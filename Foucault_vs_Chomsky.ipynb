       " 'Rather than to review historically the \\nconcept of madness, the author has chosen to re-create, mostly \\nfrom original documents, mental illness, folly, and unreason as \\nthey must have existed in their time, place, and proper social \\nperspective.',\n",
       " 'In a sense, he has tried to re-create the negative part \\nof the concept, that which has disappeared under the retroactive \\ninfluence of present-day ideas and the passage of time.',\n",
       " 'Too \\nmany historical books about psychic disorders look at the past in \\nthe light of the present; they single out only what has positive \\nand direct relevance to present-day psychiatry.',\n",
       " 'This book \\nbelongs to the few which demonstrate how skillful, sensitive \\nscholarship uses history to enrich, deepen, and reveal new \\navenues for thought and investigation.',\n",
       " 'No oversimplifications, no black-and-white statements, no \\nsweeping generalizations are ever allowed in this book; folly is \\nbrought back to life as a complex social phenomenon, part and \\nparcel of the human condition.',\n",
       " 'Most of the time, for the sake of \\nclarity, we examine madness through one of its facets; as M. \\nFoucault animates one facet of the problem after the other, he \\nalways keeps them related to each other.',\n",
       " 'The end of the Middle \\nAges emphasized the comic, but just as often the tragic aspect of \\nmadness, as in Tristan and Iseult , for example.',\n",
       " 'The Renaissance, \\nwith Erasmus’s Praise of Folly , demonstrated how fascinating \\nimagination and some of its vagaries were to the thinkers of that \\nday.',\n",
       " 'The French Revolution, Pinel, and Tuke emphasized \\npolitical, legal, medical, or religious aspects of madness; and \\ntoday, our so-called objective medical approach, in spite of the \\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\n\\nbenefits that it has brought to the mentally ill, continues to look \\nat only one side of the picture.',\n",
       " 'Folly is so human that it has \\ncommon roots with poetry and tragedy; it is revealed as much in \\nthe insane asylum as in the writings of a Cervantes or a \\nShakespeare, or in the deep psychological insights and cries of \\nrevolt of a Nietzsche.',\n",
       " 'Correctly or incorrectly, the author feels \\nthat Freud’s death instinct also stems from the tragic elements \\nwhich led men of all epochs to worship, laugh at, and dread folly \\nsimultaneously.',\n",
       " 'Fascinating as Renaissance men found it—they \\npainted it, praised it, sang about it—it also heralded for them \\ndeath of the body by picturing death of the mind.',\n",
       " 'Nothing is more illuminating than to follow with M. Foucault \\nthe many threads which are woven in this complex book, \\nwhether it speaks of changing symptoms, commitment \\nprocedures, or treatment.',\n",
       " 'For example: he sees a definite \\nconnection between some of the attitudes toward madness and \\nthe disappearance, between 1200 and 1400, of leprosy.',\n",
       " 'In the \\nmiddle of the twelfth century, France had more than 2,000 \\nleprosariums, and England and Scotland 220 for a population of \\na million and a half people.',\n",
       " 'As leprosy vanished, in part because \\nof segregation, a void was created and the moral values attached \\nto the leper had to find another scapegoat.',\n",
       " 'Mental illness and \\nunreason attracted that stigma to themselves, but even this was \\nneither complete, simple, nor immediate.',\n",
       " 'Renaissance men developed a delightful, yet horrible way of \\ndealing with their mad denizens: they were put on a ship and \\nentrusted to mariners because folly, water, and sea, as everyone \\nthen “knew,” had an affinity for each other.',\n",
       " 'Thus, “Ships of \\nFools” crisscrossed the seas and canals of Europe with their \\ncomic and pathetic cargo of souls.',\n",
       " 'Some of them found pleasure \\nand even a cure in the changing surroundings, in the isolation of \\nbeing cast off, while others withdrew further, became worse, or \\ndied alone and away from their families.',\n",
       " 'The cities and villages \\nwhich had thus rid themselves of their crazed and crazy, could \\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\n\\nnow take pleasure in watching the exciting sideshow when a ship \\nfull of foreign lunatics would dock at their harbors.',\n",
       " 'The \\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw much social unrest and \\neconomic depression, which they tried to solve by imprisoning \\nthe indigents with the criminals and forcing them to work.',\n",
       " 'The \\ndemented fitted quite naturally between those two extremes of \\nsocial maladjustment and iniquity.',\n",
       " 'A nice and hallowed tradition has labeled Tuke and Pinel as \\nthe saviors of the mentally ill, but the truth of the matter is not \\nso simple.',\n",
       " 'Many others had treated them with kindness, \\npleading that they belonged first and foremost with their \\nfamilies, and for at least two hundred years before the 1780s, \\nlegislation had been considered or passed to segregate criminals \\nand indigents from fools.',\n",
       " 'But this legislation was prompted, as \\noften as not, by a desire to protect the poor, the criminal, the \\nman imprisoned for debts, and the juvenile delinquent from the \\nfrightening bestiality of the madman.',\n",
       " 'As the madman had \\nreplaced the leper, the mentally ill person was now a subhuman \\nand beastly scapegoat; hence the need to protect others.',\n",
       " 'While \\nthe Quaker Tuke applied his religious principles, first to \\ndemented “friends” and later to foes also, partly to convert them, \\nthe great Pinel was not sure at times that he was dealing with \\nsick people; he often marveled at their unbelievable endurance of \\nphysical hardship, and often cited the ability of schizophrenic \\nwomen to sleep naked in subfreezing temperatures without \\nsuffering any ill effects.',\n",
       " 'Were not these people more healthy, \\nmore resistant than ordinary human beings?',\n",
       " 'Didn’t they have too \\nmuch animal spirit in them?',\n",
       " 'Naturally, it is impossible to discuss a book as complex as \\nMadness and Civilization without oversimplifying and doing it an \\ninjustice.',\n",
       " 'It is a tale of nuances, relative values, and delicate \\nshadings.',\n",
       " 'Yet, it is an impressive monument: in a dispassionate \\nmanner it marshals overwhelming evidence to dispel more \\neffectively than many previous attempts the myth of mental \\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\n\\nillness, and re-establishes folly and unreason in their rightful \\nplace as complex, human—too human—phenomena.',\n",
       " 'The roots \\nand symptoms of folly are being looked for today in psychology, \\nmedicine, and sociology, but they were and still are as present \\nand important in art,* religion, ethics, and epistemology.',\n",
       " 'Madness is really a manifestation of the “soul,” a variable concept \\nwhich from antiquity to the twentieth century covered \\napproximately what came to be known, after Freud, as the \\nunconscious part of the human mind.f Only time will tell how \\nmuch better students of the psyche can look at the future, after \\nreading this sobering re-creation of yesteryear’s madness and the \\nineffective attempts of humanity to treat it by amputation, \\nprojections, prejudices, and segregation.',\n",
       " 'JOSE BARCHILON, M.D.',\n",
       " 'My only quarrel with the book is the lack of emphasis on the \\nhumoristic elements in psychoses and neuroses: i.e., the patient \\nlaughs at himself, or laughs at the world through his illness.',\n",
       " 't The fear and dread of madness is as real a factor in social and \\nmedical attitudes or measures as anxiety, symptoms, and \\nresistance in coping with impulses from the individual \\nunconscious; even though the author does not explicitly \\ncompare madness with the unconscious, he equates madness \\nand dream activity so that the inference is clear enough.',\n",
       " '8 \\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE \\n\\n\\nPASCAL: “Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad \\nwould amount to another form of madness.” And Dostoievsky, in \\nhis DIARY OF A WRITER: “It is not by confining one’s \\nneighbor that one is convinced of one’s own sanity.” \\n\\nWe have yet to write the history of that other form of madness, by \\nwhich men,, in an act of sovereign reason, confine their neighbors, and \\ncommunicate and recognize each other through the merciless language \\nof non-madness; to define the moment of this conspiracy before it was \\npermanently established in the realm of truth, before it was revived by \\nthe lyricism of protest.',\n",
       " 'We must try to return, in history, to that zero \\npoint in the course of madness at which madness is an undifferentiated \\nexperience, a not yet divided experience of division itself We must \\ndescribe, from the start of its trajectory, that “other form” which \\nrelegates Reason and Madness to one side or the other of its action as \\nthings henceforth external\\\\ deaf to all exchange, and as though dead to \\none another.',\n",
       " 'This is doubtless an uncomfortable region.',\n",
       " 'To explore it we must \\nrenounce the convenience of terminal truths, and never let ourselves be \\nguided by what we may know of madness.',\n",
       " 'None of the concepts oj \\npsychopathology, even and especially in the implicit process oj \\nretrospections, can play an organizing role.',\n",
       " 'What is constitutive is the \\naction that divides madness, and not the science elaborated once this \\ndivision is made and calm restored.',\n",
       " 'What is originative is the caesura \\nthat establishes the distance between reason and non-reason; reasons \\nsubjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as madness, \\ncrime, or disease, derives explicitly from this point.',\n",
       " 'Hence we must \\nspeak of that initial dispute without assuming a victory, or the right \\nto a victory; we must speak of those actions re-examined in history, \\nleaving in abeyance all that may figure as a conclusion, as a refuge in \\ntruth; we shall have to speak of this act of scission, of this distance set, \\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\nof this void instituted between reason and what is not reason, without \\never relying upon thefulfillment of what it claims to be.',\n",
       " 'Then, and then only, can we determine the realm in which the \\nman of madness and the man of reason,, moving apart, are not yet \\ndisjunct; and in an incipient and very crude language, antedating \\nthat of science, begin the dialogue of their breach, testifying in a \\nfugitive way that they still speak to each other.',\n",
       " 'Here madness and \\nnon-madness, reason and non-reason are inextricably involved: \\ninseparable at the moment when they do not yet exist, and existing for \\neach other , in relation to each other , in the exchange which separates \\nthem.',\n",
       " 'In the serene world of mental illness, modern man no longer \\ncommunicates with the madman: on one hand, the man of reason \\ndelegates the physician to madness, thereby authorizing a relation only \\nthrough the abstract universality of disease; on the other , the man oj \\nmadness communicates with society only by the intermediary of an \\nequally abstract reason which is order, physical and moral constraint, \\nthe anonymous pressure of the group, the requirements of conformity.',\n",
       " 'As for a common language, there is no such thing; or rather, there is no \\nsuch thing any longer; the constitution of madness as a mental illness, \\nat the end of the eighteenth century, affords the evidence of a broken \\ndialogue, posits the separation as already effected, and thrusts into \\noblivion all those stammered, imperfect words withoutfixed syntax in \\nwhich the exchange between madness and reason was made.',\n",
       " 'The \\nlanguage of psychiatry, which is a monologue of reason about \\nmadness, has been established only on the basis of such a silence.',\n",
       " 'I have not tried to write the history of that language, but rather the \\narchaeology of that silence.',\n",
       " \"The Greeks had a relation to something that they called '$€>'•<;■.\",\n",
       " 'This \\nrelation was not merely one of condemnation; the existence oj \\nThrasymachus or of Callicles suffices to prove it, even if their language \\nhas reached us already enveloped in the reassuring dialectic of Socrates.',\n",
       " 'But the Greek Logos had no contrary.',\n",
       " '10 \\n\\n\\n\\nEuropean man, since the beginning of the Middle Ages, has had a \\nrelation to something he calls, indiscriminately, Madness, Dementia, \\nInsanity.',\n",
       " 'Perhaps it is to this obscure presence that Western reason \\nowes something of its depth, as the owqppoowri of the Socratic reasoners \\nowes something to the threat of upQi?..',\n",
       " 'In any case, the Reason- \\nMadness nexus constitutes for Western culture one of the dimensions op \\nits originality; it already accompanied that culture long before \\nHieronymus Bosch, and will follow it long after Nietzsche and \\nArtaud.',\n",
       " 'What, then, is this confrontation beneath the language of reason f \\nWhere can an interrogation lead us which does notfollow reason in its \\nhorizontal course, but seeks to retrace in time that constant vertically \\nwhich confronts European culture with what it is not, establishes its \\nrange by its own derangementf What realm do we enter which is \\nneither the history of knowledge, nor history itself; which is controlled \\nby neither the teleology of truth nor the rational sequence of causes, \\nsince causes have value and meaning only beyond the division f A \\nrealm, no doubt, where what is in question is the limits rather than \\nthe identity of a culture.',\n",
       " \"The classical period—from Willis to Pinel, from the frenzies op \\nRacine's Oreste to Sades Juliette and the Quinta del Sordo of Goya — \\ncovers precisely that epoch in which the exchange between madness \\nand reason modifies its language, and in a radical manner.\",\n",
       " 'In the \\nhistory of madness, two events indicate this change with a singular \\nclarity: 1657, the creation of the Hopital General and the “great \\nconfinement ” of the poor; 1794, the liberation of the chained inmates \\nof Bicetre.',\n",
       " 'Between these two unique and symmetrical events, \\nsomething happens whose ambiguity has left the historians of medicine \\nat a loss: blind repression in an absolutist regime, according to some; \\nbut according to others, the gradual discovery by science and \\nphilanthropy of madness in its positive truth.',\n",
       " 'As a matter of fact, \\nbeneath these reversible meanings, a structure is forming which does \\nnot resolve the ambiguity but determines it.',\n",

       " 'In the Middle Ages and until the Renaissance, mans \\ndispute with madness was a dramatic debate in which he confronted \\nthe secret powers of the world; the experience of madness was clouded \\nby images of the Fall and the Will of God\\\\ of the Beast and the \\nMetamorphosis , and of all the marvelous secrets of Knowledge.',\n",
       " 'In our \\nera; the experience of madness remains silent in the composure of a \\nknowledge which, knowing too much about madness> forgets it.',\n",
       " 'But \\nfrom one of these experiences to the other , the shift has been made by a \\nworld without images, without positive character , in a kind of silent \\ntransparency which reveals—as mute institution , act without \\ncommentary , immediate knowledge—a great motionless structure; this \\nstructure is one of neither drama nor knowledge; it is the point where \\nhistory is immobilized in the tragic category which both establishes \\nand impugns it.',\n",

       " 'Whence these amorous \\nfrenzies, these antipathies, these depraved tastes, this melancholy \\nwhich is caused by grief, these transports wrought in us by \\ndenial, these excesses in eating, in drinking, these indispositions, \\nthese corporeal vices which cause madness, the worst of all \\nmaladies.”!',\n",
       " 'But as yet, what was involved was only passion’s \\nmoral precedence, its responsibility, in a vague way; the real \\ntarget of this denunciation was the radical relation of the \\nphenomena of madness to the very possibility of passion.',\n",
       " 'Before Descartes, and long after his influence as philosopher \\nand physiologist had diminished, passion continued to be the \\nmeeting ground of body and soul; the point where the latter’s \\nactivity makes contact with the former’s passivity, each being a \\nlimit imposed upon the other and the locus of their \\ncommunication.',\n",
       " 'The medicine of humors sees this unity primarily as a \\nreciprocal interaction: “The passions necessarily cause certain \\nmovements in the humors; anger agitates the bile, sadness excites \\nmelancholy (black bile), and the movements of the humors are \\non occasion so violent that they disrupt the entire economy of \\nthe body, even causing death; further, the passions augment the \\nquantity of the humors; anger multiplies the bile as sadness \\nincreases melancholy.',\n",
       " 'The humors which are customarily \\n\\n\\n96 \\n\\n\\nagitated by certain passions dispose those in whom they abound \\nto the same passions, and to thinking of the objects which \\nordinarily excite them; bile disposes to anger and to thinking of \\nthose we hate.',\n",
       " 'Melancholy (black bile) disposes to sadness and to \\nthinking of untoward things; well-tempered blood disposes to \\njoy.',\n",
       " '1 \\n\\nThe medicine of spirits substitutes for this vague idea of \\n“disposition” the rigor of a physical, mechanical transmission of \\nmovements.',\n",
       " 'If the passions are possible only in a being which \\nhas a body, and a body not entirely subject to the light of its \\nmind and to the immediate transparence of its will, this is true \\ninsofar as, in ourselves and without ourselves, and generally in \\nspite of ourselves, the mind’s movements obey a mechanical \\nstructure which is that of the movement of spirits.',\n",
       " '“Before the \\nsight of the object of passion, the animal spirits were spread \\nthroughout the entire body in order to preserve all the parts in \\ngeneral; but at the presence of the new object, this entire \\neconomy is disrupted.',\n",
       " 'The majority of spirits are impelled into \\nthe muscles of the arms, the legs, the face, and all the exterior \\nparts of the body in order to afford it a disposition proper to the \\nprevailing passion and to give it the countenance and movement \\nnecessary for the acquisition of the good or the escape from the \\nevil which presents itself.”3 Passion thus disperses the spirits, \\nwhich are disposed to passion: that is, under the effect of passion \\nand in the presence of its object, the spirits circulate, disperse, \\nand concentrate according to a spatial design which licenses the \\ntrace of the object in the brain and its image in the soul, thus \\nforming in the body a kind of geometric figure of passion which \\nis merely its expressive transposition; but which also constitutes \\npassion’s essential causal basis, for when all the spirits are \\ngrouped around this object of passion, or at least around its \\nimage, the mind in its turn can tao longer ignore it and will \\nconsequently be subject to passion.',\n",
       " '97 \\n\\n\\nOne more step, and the entire system becomes a unity in \\nwhich body and soul communicate immediately in the symbolic \\nvalues of common qualities.',\n",
       " 'This is what happens in the \\nmedicine of solids and fluids, which dominates eighteenth- \\ncentury practice.',\n",
       " 'Tension and release, hardness and softness, \\nrigidity and relaxation, congestion and dryness—these qualitative \\nstates characterize the soul as much as the body, and ultimately \\nrefer to a kind of indistinct and composite passional situation, \\none which imposes itself on the concatenation of ideas, on the \\ncourse of feelings, on the state of fibers, on the circulation of \\nfluids.',\n",
       " 'The theme of causality here appears as too discursive, the \\nelements it groups too disjunct for its schemas to be applicable.',\n",
       " 'Are the “active passions, such as anger, joy, lust,” causes or \\nconsequences “of the excessive strength, the excessive tension, \\nand the excessive elasticity of the nervous fibers, and of the \\nexcessive activity of the nervous fluid”?',\n",
       " 'Conversely, cannot the \\n“inert passions, such as fear, depression, ennui, lack of appetite, \\nthe coldness that accompanies homesickness, bizarre appetites, \\nstupidity, lack of memory” be as readily followed as they are \\npreceded by “weakness of the brain marrow and of the nervous \\nfibers distributed in the organs, by impoverishment and inertia of \\n\\nthe fluids”?^ Indeed, we must no longer try to situate passion in \\na causal succession, or halfway between the corporeal and the \\nspiritual; passion indicates, at a new, deeper level, that the soul \\nand the body are in a perpetual metaphorical relation in which \\nqualities have no need to be communicated because they are \\nalready common to both; and in which phenomena of expression \\nare not causes, quite simply because soul and body are always \\neach other s immediate expression.',\n",
       " 'Passion is no longer exactly at \\nthe geometrical center of the body-and-soul complex; it is, a \\nlittle short of that, at the point where their opposition is not yet \\ngiven, in that region where both their unity and their distinction \\nare established.',\n",
       " '98 \\n\\n\\nBut at this level, passion is no longer simply one of the causes \\n—however powerful—of madness; rather it forms the basis for \\nits very possibility.',\n",
       " 'If it is true that there exists a realm, in the \\nrelations of soul and body, where cause and effect, determinism \\nand expression still intersect in a web so dense that they actually \\nform only one and the same movement which cannot be \\ndissociated except after the fact; if it is true that prior to the \\nviolence of the body and the vivacity of the soul, prior to the \\nsoftening of the fibers and the relaxation of the mind, there are \\nqualitative, as yet unshared kinds of a priori which subsequently \\nimpose the same values on the organic and on the spiritual, then \\nwe see that there can be diseases such as madness which are from \\nthe start diseases of the body and of the soul, maladies in which \\nthe affection of the brain is of the same quality, of the same \\norigin, of the same nature, finally, as the affection of the soul.',\n",
       " 'The possibility of madness is therefore implicit in the very \\nphenomenon of passion.',\n",
       " 'It is true that long before the eighteenth century, and for a \\nlong series of centuries from which we have doubtless not \\nemerged, passion and madness were kept in close relation to one \\nanother.',\n",
       " 'But let us allow the classical period its originality.',\n",
       " 'The \\nmoralists of the Greco-Latin tradition had found it just that \\nmadness be passion’s chastisement; and to be more certain that \\nthis was the case, they chose to define passion as a temporary and \\nattenuated madness.',\n",
       " 'But classical thought could define a relation \\nbetween passion and madness which was not on the order of a \\npious hope, a pedagogic threat, or a moral synthesis; it even \\nbroke with the tradition by inverting the terms of the \\nconcatenation; it based the chimeras of madness on the nature of \\npassion; it saw that the determinism of the passions was nothing \\nbut a chance for madness to penetrate the world of reason; and \\nthat if the unquestioned union of body and soul manifested \\nman s finitude in passion, it laid this same man open, at the same \\ntime, to the infinite movement that destroyed him.',\n",
       " '99 \\n\\n\\n\\nMadness, then, was not merely one of the possibilities \\nafforded by the union of soul and body; it was not just one of the \\nconsequences of passion.',\n",
       " 'Instituted by the unity of soul and \\nbody, madness turned against that unity and once again put it in \\nquestion.',\n",
       " 'Madness, made possible by passion, threatened by a \\nmovement proper to itself what had made passion itself possible.',\n",
       " 'Madness was one of those unities in which laws were \\ncompromised, perverted, distorted—thereby manifesting such \\nunity as evident and established, but also as fragile and already \\ndoomed to destruction.',\n",
       " 'There comes a moment in the course of passion when laws are \\nsuspended as though of their own accord, when movement either \\nabruptly stops, without collision or absorption of any kind of \\nactive force, or is propagated, the action ceasing only at the \\nclimax of the paroxysm.',\n",
       " 'Whytt admits that an intense emotion \\ncan provoke madness exactly as impact can provoke movement, \\nfor the sole reason that emotion is both impact in the soul and \\nagitation of the nervous fiber: “It is thus that sad narratives or \\nthose capable of moving the heart, a horrible and unexpected \\nsight, great grief, rage, terror, and the other passions which make \\na great impression frequently occasion the most sudden and \\nviolent nervous symptoms.” But—it is here that madness, strictly \\nspeaking, begins—it happens that this movement immediately \\ncancels itself out by its own excess and abruptly provokes an \\nimmobility which may reach the point of death itself.',\n",
       " 'As if in the \\nmechanics of madness, repose were not necessarily a quiescent \\nthing but could also be a movement in violent opposition to \\nitself, a movement which under the effect of its own violence \\nabruptly achieves contradiction and the impossibility of \\ncontinuance.',\n",
       " '“It is not unheard of that the passions, being very \\nviolent, generate a kind of tetanus or catalepsy such that the \\nperson then resembles a statue more than a living being.',\n",
       " 'Further, \\nfear, affliction, joy, and shame carried to their excess have more \\n\\n\\n100 \\n\\n\\n\\nthan once been followed by sudden death.',\n",
       " 'Conversely, it happens that movement, passing from soul to \\nbody and from body to soul, propagates itself indefinitely in a \\nlocus of anxiety certainly closer to that space where Malebranche \\nplaced souls than to that in which Descartes situated bodies.',\n",
       " 'Imperceptible movements, often provoked by a slight external \\nimpact, accumulate, are amplified, and end by exploding in \\nviolent convulsions.',\n",
       " 'Giovanni Maria Lancisi had already \\nexplained that the noble Romans were often subject to the vapors \\n—hysterical attacks, hypochondriacal fits—because in their court \\nlife “their minds, continually agitated between fear and hope, \\nnever knew a moment’s repose.” According to many physicians, \\ncity life, the life of the court, of the salons, led to madness by this \\nmultiplicity of excitations constantly accumulated, prolonged, \\nand echoed without ever being attenuated.',\n",
       " 'But there is in this \\nimage, in its more intense forms, and in the events constituting \\nits organic version, a certain force which, increasing, can lead to \\ndelirium, as if movement, instead of losing its strength in \\ncommunicating itself, could involve other forces in its wake, and \\nfrom them derive an additional vigor.',\n",
       " 'This was how Sauvages \\nexplained the origin of madness: a certain impression of fear is \\nlinked to the congestion or the pressure of a certain medullary \\nfiber; this fear is limited to an object, as this congestion is strictly \\nlocalized.',\n",
       " 'In proportion as this fear persists, the soul grants it \\nmore attention, increasingly isolating and detaching it from all \\nelse.',\n",
       " 'But such isolation reinforces the fear, and the soul, having \\naccorded it too special a condition, gradually tends to attach to it \\na whole series of more or less remote ideas: “It joins to this \\nsimple idea all those which are likely to nourish and augment it.',\n",
       " 'For example, a man who supposes in his sleep that he is being \\naccused of a crime, immediately associates this idea with that of \\nits satellites—judges, executioners, the gibbet.” And from being \\nthus burdened with all these new elements, involving them in its \\n\\n\\n101 \\n\\n\\ncourse, the idea assumes a kind of additional power which \\nultimately renders it irresistible even to the most concerted \\nefforts of the will.',\n",
       " 'Madness, which finds its first possibility in the phenomenon \\nof passion, and in the deployment of that double causality which, \\nstarting from passion itself, radiates both toward the body and \\ntoward the soul, is at the same time suspension of passion, \\nbreach of causality, dissolution of the elements of this unity.',\n",
       " 'Madness participates both in the necessity of passion and in the \\nanarchy of what, released by this very passion, transcends it and \\nultimately contests all it implies.',\n",
       " 'Madness ends by being a \\nmovement of the nerves and muscles so violent that nothing in \\nthe course of images, ideas, or wills seems to correspond to it: \\nthis is the case of mania when it is suddenly intensified into \\nconvulsions, or when it degenerates into continuous frenzy.',\n",
       " 'Conversely, madness can, in the body’s repose or inertia, \\ngenerate and then maintain an agitation of the soul, without \\npause or pacification, as is the case in melancholia, where \\nexternal objects do not produce the same impression on the \\nsufferer s mind as on that of a healthy man; “his impressions are \\nweak and he rarely pays attention to them; his mind is almost \\ntotally absorbed by the vivacity of certain ideas.”6 \\n\\nIndeed this dissociation between the external movements of \\nthe body and the course of ideas does not mean that the unity of \\nbody and soul is necessarily dissolved, nor that each recovers its \\nautonomy in madness.',\n",
       " 'Doubtless the unity is compromised in its \\nrigor and in its totality; but it is fissured, it turns out, along lines \\nwhich do not abolish it, but divide it into arbitrary sectors.',\n",
       " 'For \\nwhen melancholia fixes upon an aberrant idea, it is not only the \\nsoul which is involved; it is the soul with the brain, the soul with \\nthe nerves, their origin and their fibers: a whole segment of the \\nunity of soul and body is thus detached from the aggregate and \\nespecially from the organs by which reality is perceived.',\n",
       " 'The \\n\\n\\n102 \\n\\n\\nsame thing occurs in convulsions and agitation: the soul is not \\nexcluded from the body, but is swept along so rapidly by it that it \\ncannot retain all its conceptions; it is separated from its \\nmemories, its intentions, its firmest ideas, and thus isolated from \\nitself and from all that remains stable in the body, it surrenders \\nitself to the most mobile fibers; nothing in its behavior is \\nhenceforth adapted to reality, to truth, or to prudence; though \\nthe fibers in their vibration may imitate what is happening in the \\nperceptions, the sufferer cannot tell the difference: “The rapid \\nand chaotic pulsations of the arteries, or whatever other \\nderangement occurs, imprints this same movement on the fibers \\n(as in perception); they will represent as present objects which \\nare not so, as true those which are chimerical.”?',\n",
       " 'In madness, the totality of soul and body is parceled out: not \\naccording to the elements which constitute that totality \\nmetaphysically; but according to figures, images which envelop \\nsegments of the body and ideas of the soul in a kind of absurd \\nunity.',\n",
       " 'Fragments which isolate man from himself, but above all \\nfrom reality; fragments which, by detaching themselves, have \\nformed the unreal unity of a hallucination, and by very virtue of \\nthis autonomy impose it upon truth.',\n",
       " '“Madness is no more than \\n\\nthe derangement of the imagination.”^ In other words, \\nbeginning with passion, madness is still only an intense \\nmovement in the rational unity of soul and body; this is the level \\nof unreason ; but this intense movement quickly escapes the \\nreason of the mechanism and becomes, in its violences, its \\nstupors, its senseless propagations, an irrational movement; and \\nit is then that, escaping truth and its constraints, the Unreal \\nappears.',\n",

       " 'There is an original \\ninnocence of the imagination: “The imagination itself does not \\nerr, since it neither denies nor affirms but is fixed to so great a \\ndegree on the simple contemplation of an image”;9 and only the \\nmind can turn what is given in the image into abusive truth, in \\nother words, into error, or acknowledged error, that is, into \\ntruth: “A drunk man thinks he sees two candles where there is \\nbut one; a man who has a strabismus and whose mind is \\ncultivated immediately acknowledges his error and accustoms \\nhimself to see but one.”10 Madness is thus beyond imagination, \\nand yet it is profoundly rooted in it; for it consists merely in \\nallowing the image a spontaneous value, total and absolute truth.',\n",
       " 'The act of the reasonable man who, rightly or wrongly, judges an \\nimage to be true or false, is beyond this image, transcends and \\nmeasures it by what is not itself; the act of the madman never \\noversteps the image presented, but surrenders to its immediacy, \\nand affirms it only insofar is it is enveloped by it: “Many persons, \\nnot to say all, succumb to madness only from being too \\nconcerned about an object.” Inside the image, confiscated by \\n\\n\\n104 \\n\\n\\nit, and incapable of escaping from it, madness is nonetheless \\nmore than imagination, forming an act of undetermined content.',\n",

       " 'Now Diemerbroek tries to find out what are the \\n“causes” of this madness, how it can have originated.',\n",
       " 'And this is \\nwhat he learns: this man had taken his son bathing and the boy \\nhad drowned.',\n",
       " 'Hence the father considered himself responsible \\nfor his sons death.',\n",
       " 'We can therefore reconstitute in the \\nfollowing manner the development of this madness: judging \\nhimself guilty, the man decides that homicide is execrable in the \\nsight of God on High; whence it occurs to his imagination that \\nhe is eternally damned; and since he knows that the chief \\ntorment of damnation consists in being delivered into Satan’s \\nhands, he tells himself “that a horrible demon is assigned to \\nhim.” This demon he does not as yet see, but since “he does not \\ncease thinking of it,” and “regards this notion as necessarily true,” \\nhe imposes on his brain a certain image of this demon; this \\nimage is presented to his soul by the action of the brain and of \\nthe spirits with such insistence that he believes he continually \\n\\n\\n106 \\n\\n\\n\\nsees the demon itself.”12 \\n\\nHence madness, as analyzed by Diemerbroek, has two levels; \\none is manifest to all eyes: an unwarranted melancholia in a man \\nwho wrongly accuses himself of having killed his son; a depraved \\nimagination which pictures demons; a dismantled reason which \\nconverses with a phantom.',\n",
       " 'But at a deeper level, we find a \\nrigorous organization dependent on the faultless armature of a \\ndiscourse.',\n",

       " 'We also regard as being in a state of \\ndelirium those whose minds are affected by some derangement \\nin the organs of sense, or who use them in a fashion not \\ncustomary to them, as when, for example, a sufferer is deprived \\n\\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\n\\nof some voluntary action or acts inhabitually.”14 \\n\\n3.',\n",

       " 'Hence it is not surprising to find the \\neighteenth-century nosographers often classifying vertigo as a \\nmadness, and more rarely hysterical convulsions; this is because it \\nis often impossible to find in hysterical convulsions the unity of a \\nlanguage, while vertigo affords the delirious affirmation that the \\nworld is really “turning around.” Such delirium is a necessary and \\nsufficient reason for a disease to be called madness.',\n",

       " 'That the essence of madness can \\nbe ultimately defined in the simple structure of a discourse does \\nnot reduce it to a purely psychological nature, but gives it a hold \\nover the totality of soul and body; such discourse is both the \\nsilent language by which the mind speaks to itself in the truth \\nproper to it, and the visible articulation in the movements of the \\nbody.',\n",
       " 'Parallelisms, complements, all the forms of immediate \\ncommunication which we have seen manifested, in madness are \\nsuspended between soul and body in this single language and in \\nits powers.',\n",
       " 'The movement of passion which persists until it \\nbreaks and turns against itself, the sudden appearance of the \\nimage, and the agitations of the body which were its visible \\nconcomitants—all this, even as we were trying to reconstruct it, \\nwas already secretly animated by this language.',\n",
       " 'If the \\ndeterminism of passion is transcended and released in the \\n\\n\\n110 \\n\\n\\nhallucination of the image, if the image, in return, has swept \\naway the whole world of beliefs and desires, it is because the \\ndelirious language was already present—a discourse which \\nliberated passion from all its limits, and adhered with all the \\nconstraining weight of its affirmation to the image which was \\nliberating itself \\n\\nIt is in this delirium, which is of both body and soul, of both \\nlanguage and image, of both grammar and physiology, that all \\nthe cycles of madness conclude and begin.',\n",

       " 'A theme which doubtless derives \\nfrom a very old tradition, to which Andre du Laurens, at the end \\nof the sixteenth century, still testifies; for him melancholia and \\ndreams have the same origin and bear, in relation to truth, the \\nsame value.',\n",
       " 'There are “natural dreams” which represent what, \\nduring the preceding day, has passed through the senses or the \\nunderstanding but happens to be modified by the specific \\ntemperament of the subject.',\n",
       " 'In the same way, there is a \\n\\n\\n111 \\n\\n\\n\\nmelancholia which has a merely physical origin in the disposition \\nof the sufferer and alters, for his mind, the importance, the value, \\nand so to speak the coloration of real events.',\n",
       " 'But there is also a \\nmelancholia which permits the sufferer to predict the future, to \\nspeak in an unknown language, to see beings ordinarily invisible; \\nthis melancholia originates in a supernatural intervention, the \\nsame which brings to the sleepers mind those dreams which \\nforesee the future, announce events to come, and cause him to \\nsee “strange things.” \\n\\nBut in fact the seventeenth century preserves this tradition of \\nthe resemblance between madness and dreams only to break it all \\nthe more completely and to generate new, more essential \\nrelations.',\n",
       " 'Relations in which madness and dreams are not only \\nunderstood in their remote origin or in their imminent value as \\nsigns, but are confronted as phenomena, in their development, in \\ntheir very nature.',\n",
       " 'Dreams and madness then appeared to be of the same \\nsubstance.',\n",
       " 'Their mechanism was the same; thus Zacchias could \\nidentify in sleepwalking the movements which cause dreams, but \\nwhich in a waking state can also provoke madness.',\n",
       " 'In the first moments when one falls asleep, the vapors which \\nrise in the body and ascend to the head are many, turbulent, and \\ndense.',\n",
       " 'They are so dark that they waken no image in the brain; \\nthey merely agitate, in their chaotic dance, the nerves and the \\nmuscles.',\n",
       " 'The same is true in the frenzied, in maniacs: they suffer \\nfew hallucinations, no false beliefs, but an intense agitation \\nwhich they cannot manage to control.',\n",
       " 'Let us continue the \\nevolution of sleep: after the first period of turbulence, the vapors \\nwhich rise to the brain are clarified, their movement organized; \\nthis is the moment when fantastic dreams are born; one sees \\nmiracles, a thousand impossible things.',\n",
       " 'To this stage corresponds \\nthat of dementia, in which one is convinced of many things \\n“which are not in real life.” Then at last the agitation of the \\nvapors is calmed altogether; the sleeper begins to see things still \\n\\n\\n112 \\n\\n\\n\\nmore clearly; in the transparency of the henceforth limpid vapors, \\nrecollections of the day before reappear in accordance with \\nreality; such images are at most transposed, on one point or \\nanother—as occurs in melancholics, who recognize all things as \\nthey are, “in particular those who are not merely distracted.” \\nBetween the gradual developments of sleep—with what they \\ncontribute at each stage to the quality of the imagination—and \\nthe forms of madness, the analogy is constant, because the \\nmechanisms are the same: the same movement of vapors and \\nspirits, the same liberation of images, the same correspondence \\nbetween the physical qualities of phenomena and the \\npsychological or moral values of sentiments.',\n",
       " '“To emerge from \\nthe insane no differently than from the sleeping.”!6 \\n\\nThe important thing, in Zacchias’s analysis, is that madness is \\nnot associated with dreams in their positive phenomena, but \\nrather to the totality formed by sleep and dreams together: that \\nis, to a complex which includes—besides the image— \\nhallucination, memory, or prediction, the great void of sleep, the \\nnight of the senses, and all that negativity which wrests man \\nfrom the waking state and its apparent truths.',\n",
       " 'Whereas tradition \\ncompared the delirium of the madman to the vivacity of the \\ndream images, the classical period identified delirium only with \\nthe complex of the image and the night of the mind, against \\nwhich background it assumed its liberty.',\n",
       " 'And this complex, \\ntransposed entire into the clarity of the waking state, constituted \\nmadness.',\n",
       " 'This is how we must understand the definitions of \\nmadness which insistently recur throughout the classical period.',\n",
       " 'The dream, as a complex figure of image and sleep, is almost \\nalways present in that definition.',\n",
       " 'Either in a negative fashion— \\nthe notion of the waking state then being the only one that \\ndistinguishes madmen from sleepers; or in a positive fashion, \\ndelirium being defined as a modality of the dream, with the \\nwaking state as the specific difference: “Delirium is the dream of \\n\\n\\n113 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwaking persons.”!7 The ancients’ notion of the dream as a \\ntransitory form of madness is inverted; it is no longer the dream \\nwhich borrows its disturbing powers from alienation—showing \\nthereby how fragile or limited reason is; it is madness which \\ntakes its original nature from the dream and reveals in this \\nkinship that it is a liberation of the image in the dark night of \\nreality.',\n",

       "'The author most likely to have written your sample, \"This structure proper to the monarchical and bourgeois order  of France, contemporary with its organization in absolutist  forms, soon extended its network over the whole of France. An  edict of the King, dated June 16, 1676, prescribed the  establishment of an “hopital general in each city of his kingdom.”  Occasionally the measure had been anticipated by the local  authorities; the bourgeoisie of Fyons had already organized in  1612 a charity establishment that functioned in an analogous  manner. The Archbishop of Tours was proud to declare on July  10, 1676, that his “archepiscopal city has happily foreseen the  pious intentions of the King and erected an hopital general called  Fa Charite even before the one in Paris, whose order has served  as a model for all those subsequently established, within or  outside the kingdom.” The Charite of Tours, in fact, had been  founded in 1656, and the King had endowed it with an income  of four thousand livres. Over the entire face of France, hopitaux  generaux were opened; on the eve of the Revolution, they were to  be found in thirty-two provincial cities.   Even if it had been deliberately excluded from the  organization of the hopitaux generaux —by complicity, doubtless,  between royal power and bourgeoisie—the Church nonetheless  did not remain a stranger to the movement. It reformed its own  hospital institutions, redistributed the wealth of its foundations,    53     even created congregations whose purposes were rather  analogous to those of the Hopital General. Vincent de Paul  reorganized Saint-Lazare, the most important of the former lazar  houses of Paris; on January 7, 1632, he signed a contract in the  name of the Congregationists of the Mission with the “Priory” of  Saint-Lazare, which was now to receive “persons detained by  order of His Majesty.” The Order of Good Sons opened  hospitals of this nature in the north of France. The Brothers of  Saint John of God, called into France in 1602, founded first the  Charite of Paris in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, then  Charenton, into which they moved on May 10, 1645. Not far  from Paris, they also operated the Charite of Senlis, which  opened on October 27, 1670. Some years before, the Duchess of  Bouillon had donated them the buildings and benefices of La  Maladrerie, founded in the fourteenth century by Thibaut de  Champagne, at Chateau-Thierry. They administered also the  Charites of Saint-Yon, Pontorson, Cadillac, and Romans. In  1699, the Lazarists founded in Marseilles the establishment that  was to become the Hopital Saint-Pierre. Then, in the eighteenth  century, came Armentieres (1712), Mareville (1714), the Good  \", is 72.'"
