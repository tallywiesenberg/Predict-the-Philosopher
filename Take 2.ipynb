       " '    ★ ——    AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    Whereas Jackson attributes the ebbing of the revolutionary  tide to the discovery of the unsuspected complexity of modern  society, Orwell’s firsthand observations, like those of Borkenau,  suggest a far simpler explanation. What calls for explanation is  not the disaffection of the workers of Barcelona but the curious  constructions of the historian.   Let me repeat, at this point, Jackson’s comments regarding  Juan Comorera: Comorera “immediately took steps to end  barter and requisitioning, and became a defender of the peas¬  ants against the revolution”; he “ended requisitions, restored  money payments, and protected the Catalan peasants against  further collectivization.” These comments imply that the peas¬  antry of Catalonia was, as a body, opposed to the revolution  and that Comorera put a stop to the collectivization that they  feared. Jackson nowhere indicates any divisions among the  peasantry on this issue and offers no support for the implied  claim that collectivization was in process at the period of  Comorera’s access to power. In fact, it is questionable that  Comorera’s rise to power affected the course of collectivization  in Catalonia. Evidence is difficult to come by, but it seems that  collectivization of agriculture in \\'Catalonia was not, in any  event, extensive, and that it was not extending in December,  when Comorera took office. We know from anarchist sources  that there had been instances of forced collectivization in Cata¬  lonia, 91 but I can find no evidence that Comorera “protected  the peasantry” from forced collectivization. Furthermore, it is  misleading, at best, to imply that the peasantry as a whole was  opposed to collectivization. A more accurate picture is pre¬  sented by Bolloten (p. 56), who points out that “if the indi¬  vidual farmer viewed with dismay the swift and widespread  development of collectivized agriculture, the farm workers of  the Anarchosyndicalist QNT and the Socialist UGT saw in it,         on the contrary, the commencement of a new era.” In short,  there was a complex class struggle in the countryside, though  one learns little about it from Jackson’s oversimplified and mis-  leadmg account. It would seem fair to suppose that this distor¬  tion a ga m reflects Jackson’s antipathy towards the revolution  and its goals. I will return to this question directly, with refer¬  ence to areas where agricultural collectivization was much more  extensive than in Catalonia.   The complexities of modern society that baffled and con¬  founded the unsuspecting anarchist workers of Barcelona as  Jackson enumerates them, were the following: the accumu’lat-  mg food and supply problems and the administration of frontier  posts villages, and public utilities. As just noted, the food and  supp y problems seem to have accumulated most rapidly under  the brilliant leadership of Juan Comorera. So far as the frontier  posts are concerned, the situation, as Jackson elsewhere de¬  scribes it (p. 368), was basically as follows: “In Catalonia the  anarchists had, ever since July 18, controlled the customs  stations at the French border. On April 17, 1937, the reorganized  carabineros, acting on orders of the Finance Minister, Juan  Negrin, began to reoccupy the frontier. At least eight an¬  archists were killed in clashes with the carabineros.” Apart  from this difficulty, admittedly serious, there seems little  reason to suppose that the problem of manning frontier  posts contributed to the ebbing of the revolutionary tide  The available records do not indicate that the problems  of administering villages or public utilities were either  unsuspected” or too complex for the Catalonian work-  * “ remarkable and unsuspected development, but one  which nevertheless appears to be borne out by the evidence  ailable to us. I want to emphasize again that Jackson presents  no evidence to support his conclusions about the ebbing of the      ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   revolutionary tide and the reasons tor the disaffection of the  Catalonian workers. Once again, I think it fair to attribute his  conclusions to the elitist bias of the liberal intellectual rather  than to the historical record.   Consider next Jackson’s comment that the anarchists “ex¬  plained the loss of Malaga as due in large measure to the low  morale and the disorientation of the Andalusian proletariat,  which saw the Valencia government evolving steadily toward  the right.” Again, it seems that Jackson regards this as just  another indication of the naivete and unreasonableness of the  Spanish anarchists. However, here again there is more to the  story. One of the primary sources that Jackson cites is Bor-  kenau, quite naturally, since Borkenau spent several days in the  area just prior to the fall of Malaga on February 8, 1937. But  Borkenau’s detailed observations tend to bear out the anarchist  “explanation,” at least in part. He believed that Mdlaga might  have been saved, but only by a “fight of despair” with, mass  involvement, of a sort that “the anarchists might have led.’’ But  two factors prevented such a defense: first, the officer assigne  to lead the defense, Lieutenant Colonel Villalba, “interpreted  this task as a purely military one, whereas in reality he had no  military means at his disposal but only the forces of a popular  movement”; he was a professional officer, “who in the secrecy of  his heart hated the spirit of the militia” and was incapable o  comprehending the “political factor.’- A second factor was the  significant decline, by February, of political consciousness and  mass involvement. The anarchist committees were no longer  functioning and the authority of the police and Civil Guards  had been restored. “The nuisance of hundreds of independent  village police bodies had disappeared, but with it the passionate  interest of the village in the civil war.... The short interlude o  the Spanish Soviet system was at an end” (p. 212). After re-     Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   viewing the local situation in Malaga and the conflicts in the  Valencia government (which failed to provide support or arms  for the militia defending Malaga), Borkenau concludes (p.  228): “The Spanish republic paid with the fall of Malaga lor  the decision of the Right wing of its camp to make an end of  social revolution and of its Left wing not to allow that.” Jack¬  son’s discussion of the fall of Malaga refers to the terror and  political rivalries within the town but makes no reference to the  fact that Borkenau’s description, and the accompanying inter¬  pretation, do support the belief that the defeat was due in large  measure to low morale and to the incapacity, or unwillingness,  of the Valencia government to fight a popular war. On the  contrary, he concludes that Colonel Villalba’s lack of means for  “controlling the bitter political rivalries” was one factor that  prevented him from carrying out the essential military tasks.  Thus he seems to adopt the view that Borkenau condemns, that  the task was a “purely military one.” Borkenau’s eyewitness  account appears to me much more convincing.   In this case too Jackson has described the situation in a  somewhat misleading fashion, perhaps again because of the  elitist bias that dominates the liberal-Communist interpretation  of the Civil War. Like Lieutenant Colonel Villalba, liberal his¬  torians often reveal a strong distaste for “the forces of a popular  movement” and “the spirit of the militia ” And an argument can  be given that they correspondingly fail to comprehend the “po¬  litical factor.”   In the May Days of 1937, the revolution in Catalonia re¬  ceived the final blow. On May 3, the councilor for public order,  PSUC member Rodriguez Salas, appeared at the central tele¬  phone building with a detachment of police, without prior  warning or consultation with the anarchist ministers in the  government, to take over the telephone exchange. The ex-     ★== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   change, formerly the property of IT&T, had been captured by  Barcelona workers in July and had since functioned under the  control of a UGT-CNT committee, with a governmental dele¬  gate, quite in accord with the collectivization decree of October  24, 1936. According to the London Daily Worker (May\\'ll,  1937), “Salas sent the armed republican police to disarm the  employees there, most of them members of the CNT unions.”  The motive, according to Juan Comorera, was “to put a stop to  an abnormal situation,” namely, that no one could speak over  the telephone “without the indiscreet ear of the controller  knowing it.” 93 Armed resistance in the telephone building pre¬  vented its occupation. Local defense committees erected barri¬  cades throughout Barcelona. Companys and the anarchist leaders  pleaded with the workers to disarm. An uneasy truce con¬  tinued until May 6, when the first detachments of Assault  Guards arrived, violating the promises of the government that  the truce would be observed and military forces withdrawn.  The troops were under the command of General Pozas, for¬  merly commander of the hated Civil Guard and now a member  of the Communist party. In the fighting that followed, there  were some five hundred killed and over a thousand wounded.  “The May Days in reality sounded the death-knell of the revo¬  lution, announcing political defeat for all and death for certain  of the revolutionary leaders.” 94   These events—of enormous significance in the history of the  Spanish revolution—Jackson sketches in bare outline as a mar¬  ginal incident. Obviously the historian’s account must be selec¬  tive , from the left-liberal point of view that Jackson shares with  Hugh Thomas and many others, the liquidation of the revolu¬  tion in Catalonia was a minor event, as the revolution itself was  merely a kind of irrelevant nuisance, a minor irritant diverting  energy from the struggle to save the bourgeois government.           ” “• “•«   wxucn me fbUC councilors were to retire f™ • ,   government, and the question of the Telephone Company waslef   ugt 0^7: iation - t very night - h °™- —   murdered 1 \\' ‘° the re ° r ^ d <***\\' was   murdered.

I suspect it is  the same in, all wars-always the same contrast between the     _ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   sleek police in the rear and the ragged soldiers in the line ”» 8  (See pages 104-5 below.)   The contrast reveals a good deal about the nature of the wa ,  as it was understood by the Valencia government. Later Orw  was to make this conclusion explicit: “A government which  Tends boys of fifteen to the front with rifles forty years old a d  keeps its biggest men and newest weapons in the rear is m  3y more afraid of the revolution than of the fascis s. Henc  the feeble war policy of the past six months, a \" d  compromise with which the war will almost certainly end^  Jackson’s account of these events, with its omissions and assump-  !iot, suggests that he perhaps shares the view that the greatest  danger in Spain would have been a victory of the revolutio .   Jackson apparently discounts Orwell’s testimony, to some ex¬  tent, commenting that “the readers should bear in  well’s own honest statement that he knew very little about th  political complexities of the struggle.” This is a strange com-  Ti nt t one thing, Orwell’s analysis of the “political complex  uL of the struggle” bears up rather well after thirty yearspffl  is defective, it is probably in his tendency to give too muc  prominence to the POUM in comparison with the a \" arc ^  not surprising, in view of the fact that he was with the POUM  militia His exposure of the fatuous nonsense that was appear-  ing\\'aTthe time in the Stalinist and liberal pre.es appears quite  accurate, and later discoveries have given little reason t  lenge the basic facts that he reported or the interpretation  he proposed in the heat of the conflict. Orwell does,  to his own “political   feat of the revolution in May, he states,  owing to my political ignorance, not so dearly as I ought to have  done-that when the Government felt more sure of itself there  would be reprisals.” But this form of “political ignorance has    ',\n",

Although this is an exaggeration, i  is a fact that the popular organs of administration were wiped  out by Lister’s legions, and the revolution was now over, so  as Aragon was concerned.   About these events, Jackson has the following comments:   On August 11 the government announced the dissolution of the   c JTZ the anarchist-dominated administration which   had been recognized by Largo Caballero m December, 1936 toe   peasants were known to hate the Conse) “’ th \\' ^theVery exist-  serted the front during the Barcelona fighting, . .. {   ence of the Consejo was a standing challenge to e au   Once their authority had been broken, however, they were   leased, 101   These remarks are most interesting.

Recall Orwell’s observa¬  tions quoted above, pages 101-2.   What about Jackson’s statement that “the peasants were  known to hate the Consejo”? As in the other cases I have cited,  Jackson gives no indication of any evidence on which such  a judgment might be based. The most detailed investigation  of the collectives is from anarchist sources, and they indicate  that Aragon was one of the areas where collectivization was  most widespread and successful. 103 Both the CNT and the  UGT Land Workers’ Federation were vigorous in their support  for collectivization, and there is no doubt that both were mass  organizations. A number of nonanarchists, observing collecti¬  vization in Aragon firsthand, gave very favorable reports and  stressed the voluntary character of collectivization. 104 Accord¬  ing to Gaston Leval, an anarchist observer who carried out  detailed investigation of rural collectivization, “in Aragon 75  percent of small proprietors have voluntarily adhered to the  new order of things,” and others were not forced to involve  themselves in collectives. 105 Other anarchist observers-Augus-  tin Souchy in particular-gave detailed observations of the  functioning of the Aragon collectives. Unless one is willing to  assume a fantastic degree of falsification, it is impossible to  reconcile their descriptions with the claim that “the peasants  were known to hate the Consejo”—unless, of course, one re¬  stricts the term “peasant” to “individual farm owner,” in which  case it might very well be true, but would justify disbanding  the Council only on the assumption that the rights of the indi¬  vidual farm owner must predominate, not those of the landless  worker. There is little doubt that the collectives were economi¬  cally successful, 106 hardly likely if collectivization were forced  and hated by the peasantry.       ★- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   I have already cited Bolloten’s general conclusion, based on  very extensive documentary evidence, that while the individual  farmer may have viewed the development of collectivized agri¬  culture with dismay, “the farm workers of the Anarchosyndical-  ist CNT and the Socialist UGT saw in it, on the contrary, the  commencement of a new era.\" This conclusion seems quite rea¬  sonable, on the basis of the materials that are available. With  respect to Aragon, specifically, he remarks that the “debt-ridden  peasants were strongly affected by the ideas of the CNT and  FAI, a factor that gave a powerful spontaneous impulse to  collective farming,\" though difficulties are cited by anarchist  sources, which in general appear to be quite honest about fail¬  ures. Bolloten cites two Communist sources, among others, to  the effect that about 70 percent of the population in rural areas  of Aragon lived in collectives (p. 71); he adds that “many of  the region’s 450 collectives were largely voluntary,\" although  “the presence of militiamen from the neighbouring region of  Catalonia, the immense majority of whom were members of the  CNT and FAI\" was “in some measure\" responsible for the ex¬  tensive collectivization. He also points out that in many in¬  stances peasant proprietors who were not compelled to adhere  to the collective system did so for other reasons: “. . . not only  were they prevented from employing hired labour and dispos¬  ing freely of their crops ... but they were often denied all  benefits enjoyed by members\" (p. 72). Bolloten cites the attempt  of the Communists in April 1937 to cause dissension in “areas  where the CNT and UGT had established collective farms by  mutual agreement\" (p. 195), leading in some cases to pitched  battles and dozens of assassinations, according to CNT  sources. 107   Bolloten s detailed analysis of the events of the summer of   ',\n",
       " '                Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   1937 sheds considerable light on the question of peasant atti¬  tudes towards collectivization in Aragon:   It was inevitable that the attacks on the collectives should have  had an unfavorable effect upon rural economy and upon morale,  for while it is true that in some areas collectivization was  anathema to the majority of peasants, it is no less true that in  others collective farms were organized spontaneously by the bulk  of the peasant population. In Toledo province, for example  where even before the war rural collectives existed, 83 per cent of  the peasants, according to a source friendly to the Communists,  decided in favour of the collective cultivation of the soil. As the  campaign against the collective farms reached its height just be¬  fore the summer harvest [1937] ... a pall of dismay and ap¬  prehension descended upon the agricultural labourers. Work m  the fields was abandoned in many places or only carried on  apathetically, and there was danger that a substantial portion of  the harvest, vital for the war effort, would be left to rot. [P. 196J   It was under these circumstances, he points out, that the  Communists were forced to change their policy and—tempo-  rarily—to tolerate the collectives. A decree was passed legaliz¬  ing collectives \"during the current agricultural year” (his ital¬  ics) and offering them some aid. This “produced a sense of  relief in the countryside during the vital period of the harvest:.  Immediately after the crops had been gathered, the policy  changed again to one of harsh repression. Bolloten cites Com¬  munist sources to the effect that “a short though fierce cam¬  paign at the beginning of August” prepared the way for the  dissolution of the Council of Aragon. Following the dissolution  decree “the newly appointed Governor General, Jose Ignacio  Mantecon, a member of the Left Republican Party, but a secret  Communist sympathizer [who joined the party in exile, after  the war], .. . ordered the break-up of the collective farms:” The   means: Lister’s division, which restored the old order by force   ',\n",
       " '   ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   and terror. Bolloten cites Communist sources conceding the ex¬  cessive harshness of Lister’s methods. He quotes the Communist  general secretary of the Institute of Agrarian Reform, who  admits that the measures taken to dissolve the collectives were  a very grave mistake, and produced tremendous disorganiza¬  tion in the countryside,” as “those persons who were discon¬  tented with the collectives . . . took them by assault, carrying  away and dividing up the harvest and farm implements without  respecting the collectives that had been formed without vio¬  lence or pressure, that were prosperous, and that were a model  of organization. ... As a result, labour in the fields was sus¬  pended almost entirely, and a quarter of the land had not been  prepared at the time for sowing” (p. 200). Once again, it was  necessary to ameliorate the harsh repression of the collectives,  to prevent disaster. Summarizing these events, Bolloten de¬  scribes the resulting situation as follows:   But although the situation in Aragon improved in some degree,  the hatreds and resentments generated by the break-up of the  collectives and by the repression that followed were never wholly  dispelled. Nor was the resultant disillusionment that sapped the  spirit of the Anarchosyndicalist forces on the Aragon front ever  entirely removed, a disillusionment that no doubt contributed to  the collapse of that front a few months later. . . . after the  destruction of the collective farms in Aragon, the Communist  Party was compelled to modify its policy, and support collectives  also m other regions against former owners who sought the re¬  turn of confiscated land. . . . [Pp. 200-201]   Returning to Jackson’s remarks, I think we must conclude  that they seriously misrepresent the situation. 108 The dissolu¬  tion of the Council of Aragon and the large-scale destruction of  the collectives by military force was simply another stage in the  eradication of the popular revolution and the restoration of the  old order. Let me emphasize that I am not criticizing Jackson  ',\n",
       " \"               Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   for his negative attitude towards the social revolution, but  rather for the failure of objectivity when he deals with the  revolution and the ensuing repression.   Among historians of the Spanish Civil War, the dominant  view is that the Communist policy was in essentials the correct  one—that in order to consolidate domestic and international  support for the Republic it was necessary to block and then  reverse the social revolution. Jackson, for example, states that  Caballero “realized that it was absolutely necessary to rebuild  the authority of the Republican state and to work in close co¬  operation with the middle-class liberals.” The anarchist leaders  who entered the government shared this view, putting their  trust in the good faith of liberals such as 'Companys and believ¬  ing—naively, as events were to show—that the Western democ¬  racies would come to their aid.   A policy diametrically opposed to this was advocated by  Camillo Berneri. In his open letter to the anarchist minister  Federica Montseny 109 he summarizes his views in the follow¬  ing way: “The dilemma, war or revolution, no longer has mean¬  ing. The only dilemma is this: either victory over Franco  through revolutionary war, or defeat” (his italics). He argued  that Morocco should be granted independence and that an at¬  tempt should be made to stir up rebellion throughout North  Africa. Thus a revolutionary struggle should be undertaken  against Western capitalism in North Africa and, simultaneously,  against the bourgeois regime in Spain, which was gradually  dismantling the accomplishments of the July revolution. The  primary front should be political. Franco relied heavily on  Moorish contingents, including a substantial number from  French Morocco. The Republic might exploit this fact, de¬  moralizing the Nationalist forces and perhaps even winning  them to the revolutionary cause by political agitation based on   \",\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " '  AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    the concrete alternative of pan-Islamic—specifically, Moroc¬  can—revolution. Writing in April 1937, Berneri urged that the  army of the Republic be reorganized for the defense of the  revolution, so that it might recover the spirit of popular partici¬  pation of the early days of the revolution. He quotes the words  of his compatriot Louis Bertoni, writing from the Huesca front:   The Spanish war, deprived of all new faith, of any idea of a social  transformation, of all revolutionary grandeur, of any universal  meaning, is now merely a national war of independence that must  be carried on to avoid the extermination that the international  plutocracy demands. There remains a terrible question of life or  death, but no longer a war to build a new society and a new  humanity.   In such a war, the human element that might bring victory over  fascism is lost.   In retrospect, Berneri’s ideas seem quite reasonable. Delega¬  tions of Moroccan nationalists did in fact approach the Va¬  lencia government asking for arms and materiel, but were  refused by Caballero, who actually proposed territorial conces¬  sions in North Africa to France and England to try to win their  support. Commenting on these facts, Broue and Temime ob¬  serve that these policies deprived the Republic of “the instru¬  ment of revolutionary defeatism in the enemy army,” and even  of a possible weapon against Italian intervention. Jackson, on  the other hand, dismisses Berneri’s suggestion with the remark  that independence for Morocco (as for that matter, even aid to  the Moroccan nationalists) was “a gesture that would have  been highly appreciated in Paris and London.” Of course it is  correct that France and Britain would hardly have appreciated  this development. As Berneri points out, “it goes without saying  that one cannot simultaneously guarantee French and British  interests in Morocco and carry out an insurrection.” But Jack-  ',\n",
       " \"                 Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   son’s comment does not touch on the central issue, namely,  whether the Spanish revolution could have been preserved,’  both from the fascists at the front and from the bourgeois-  Communist coalition within the Republic, by a revolutionary  war of the sort that the left proposed-or, for that matter,  whether the Republic might not have been saved by a political  struggle that involved Franco’s invading Moorish troops, or at  least eroded their morale. It is easy to see why Caballero was  not attracted by this bold scheme, given his reliance on the  eventual backing of the Western democracies. On the basis of  what we know today, however, Jackson’s summary dismissal of  revolutionary war is much too abrupt.   Furthermore, Bertoni’s observations from the Huesca front  are borne out by much other evidence, some of it cited earlier.  Even those who accepted the Communist strategy of discipline  and central control as necessary concede that the repressions  that formed an ineliminable part of this strategy “tended to  break the fighting spirit of the people.” 1 ** One can only specu¬  late, but it seems to me that many commentators have seriously  underestimated the significance of the political factor, the po¬  tential strength of a popular struggle to defend the achieve¬  ments of the revolution. It is perhaps relevant that Asturias, the  one area of Spain where the system of CNT-UGT committees  was not eliminated in favor of central control, is also the one  area where guerrilla warfare continued well after Franco's vic¬  tory. Broue and Temime observe 111 that the resistance of the  partisans of Asturias “demonstrates the depth of the revolution¬  ary elan, which had not been shattered by the reinstitution of  state authority, conducted here with greater prudence.” There  can be no doubt that the revolution was both widespread and  deeply rooted in the Spanish masses. It seems quite possible  that a revolutionary war of the sort advocated by Berneri would      ■ ■ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   have been successful, despite the greater military force of the  fascist armies. The idea that men can overcome machines no  longer seems as romantic or naive as it may have a few years  ago.   Furthermore, the trust placed in the bourgeois government  by the anarchist leaders was not honored, as the history of the  counterrevolution clearly shows. In retrospect, it seems that  Berneri was correct in arguing that they should not have taken  part in the bourgeois government, but should rather have  sought to replace this government with the institutions created  by the revolution. 112 The anarchist minister Garcia Oliver  stated that “we had confidence in the word and in the person of  a Catalan democrat and retained and supported Companys as  President of the Generalitat,” 113 at a time when in Catalonia,  at least, the workers’ organizations could easily have replaced  the state apparatus and dispensed with the former political  parties, as they had replaced the old economy with an entirely  new structure. Companys recognized fully that there were lim¬  its beyond which he could not cooperate with the anarchists. In  an interview with H. E. Kaminski, he refused to specify these  limits, but merely expressed his hope that “the anarchist masses  will not oppose the good sense of their leaders,” who have  “accepted the responsibilities incumbent upon them”; he saw  his task as “directing these responsibilities in the proper path,”  not further specified in the interview, but shown by the events  leading up to the May Days. 114 Probably, Companys’ attitude  towards this willingness of the anarchist leaders to cooperate  was expressed accurately in his reaction to the suggestion of a  correspondent of the New Statesman and Nation, who pre¬  dicted that the assassination of the anarchist mayor of Puig-  cerdd would lead to a revolt: “[Companys] laughed scornfully  and said the anarchists would capitulate as they always had    \",\n",
       " \"  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   before.” 115 As has already been pointed out in some detail, the  liberal-Communist Party coalition had no intention of letting  the war against Franco take precedence over the crushing of  the revolution. A spokesman for Comorera put the matter  clearly: “This slogan has been attributed to the P.S.U.C.: 'Be¬  fore taking Saragossa, it is necessary to take Barcelona.’ This  reflects the situation exactly. . . ,” 118 Comorera himself had,  from the beginning, pressed Companys to resist the CNT. 117  The first task of the antifascist coalition, he maintained, was  to dissolve the revolutionary committees. 118 I have already  cited a good deal of evidence indicating that the repression  conducted by the Popular Front seriously weakened popular  commitment and involvement in the antifascist war. What was  evident to George Orwell was also clear to the Barcelona work¬  ers and the peasants in the collectivized villages of Aragon: the  liberal-Communist coalition would not tolerate a revolutionary  transformation of Spanish society; it would commit itself fully  to the anti-Franco struggle only after the old order was firmly  re-established, by force, if necessary. 119   There is little doubt that farm workers in the collectives un¬  derstood quite well the social content of the drive towards con¬  solidation and central control. We learn this not only from an¬  archist sources but also from the socialist press in the spring of  1937. On May 1, the Socialist party newspaper Adelante had  the following to say:   At the outbreak of the Fascist revolt the labor organizations and  the democratic elements in the country were in agreement that  the so-called Nationalist Revolution, which threatened to plunge  our people into an abyss of deepest misery, could be halted only  by a Social Revolution. The Communist Party, however, opposed  this view with all its might. It had apparently completely forgot¬  ten its old theories of a “workers’ and peasants’ republic” and a  “dictatorship of the proletariat.” From its constant repetition of   \",\n",
       " '  MINT LIBRARY   fiWfMIE-MELLOH URIVERSfTY     ^__ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   its new slogan of the parliamentary democratic republic it is clear  that it has lost all sense of reality. When the Catholic and con¬  servative sections of the Spanish bourgeoisie saw their old system  smashed and could find no way out, the Communist Party in¬  stilled new hope into them. It assured them that the democratic  bourgeois republic for which it was pleading put no obstacles in  the way of Catholic propaganda and, above all, that it stood  ready to defend the class interests of the bourgeoisie.   That this realization was widespread in the rural areas was  underscored dramatically by a questionnaire sent by Adelante  to secretaries of the UGT Federation of Land Workers, pub¬  lished in June 193 IP 1 The results are summarized as fol¬  lows :   The replies to these questions revealed an astounding unanimity.  Everywhere the same story. The peasant collectives are today  most vigorously opposed by the Communist Party. The Commu¬  nists organize the well-to-do farmers who are on the lookout for  cheap labor and are, for this reason, outspokenly hostile to the co-  operative undertakings of the poor peasants.   It is the element which before the revolution sympathized with  the Fascists and Monarchists which, according to the testimony  of the trade-union representatives, is now flocking into the ran s  of the Communist Party. As to the general effect of Communist  activity on the country, the secretaries of the U.G.T. had only  one opinion, which the representative of the Valencia organiza¬  tion put in these words: “It is a misfortune in the fullest sense of  the word.” 122   It is not difficult to imagine how the recognition of this “mis¬  fortune” must have affected the willingness of the land workers  to take part in the antifascist war, with all the sacrifices that this  entailed.   The attitude of the central government to the revolution was  brutally revealed by its acts and is attested as well in its propa¬  ganda. A former minister describes the situation as follows:    ',\n",
       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship    The fact that is concealed by the coalition of the Spanish Com¬  munist Party with the left Republicans and right wing Socialists is  that there has been a successful social revolution in half of Spain.  Successful, that is, in the collectivization of factories and farms ,  which are operated under trade union control, and operated quite  efficiently. During the three months that I was director of propa-  ganda for the United States and England under Alvarez del Vayo,  then Foreign Minister for the Valencia Government, I was in¬  structed not to send out one word about this revolution in the  economic system of loyalist Spain. Nor are any foreign corre¬  spondents in Valencia permitted to write freely of the revolution  that has taken place. 123   In short, there is much reason to believe that the will to fight  Franco was significantly diminished, perhaps destroyed, by the  policy of authoritarian centralization undertaken by the liberal-  Communist coalition, carried through by force, and disguised in  the propaganda that was disseminated among Western intel¬  lectuals 124 and that still dominates the writing of history. To  the extent that this is a correct judgment, the alternative pro¬  posed by Berneri and the left “extremists” gains in plausi¬  bility.   As noted earlier, Caballero and the anarchist ministers ac¬  cepted the policy of counterrevolution because of their trust in  the Western democracies, which they felt sure would sooner or  later come to their aid. This feeling was perhaps understanda¬  ble in 1937. It is strange, however, that a historian writing in  the 1960s should dismiss the proposal to strike at Franco’s rear  by extending the revolutionary war to Morocco, on grounds  that this would have displeased Western capitalism (see page  110 above).   Berneri was quite right in his belief that the Western democ¬  racies would not take part in an antifascist struggle in Spain. In  fact, their complicity in the fascist insurrection was not slight.     *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   French bankers, who were generally pro-Franco, blocked the  release of Spanish gold to the loyalist government, thus hinder¬  ing the purchase of arms and, incidentally, increasing the reli¬  ance of the Republic on the Soviet Union. 125 The policy of  “nonintervention,” which effectively blocked Western aid for  the loyalist government while Hitler and Mussolini in effect  won the war for Franco, was also technically initiated by the  French government—though apparently under heavy British  pressure. 126   As far as Great Britain is concerned, the hope that it would  come to the aid of the Republic was always unrealistic. A few  days after the Franco coup, the foreign editor of Paris-Soir  wrote: “At least four countries are already taking active interest  in the battle—France, which is supporting the Madrid Gov¬  ernment, and Britain, Germany and Italy, each of which is  giving discreet but nevertheless effective assistance to one  group or another among the insurgents.” 127 In fact, British  support for Franco took a fairly concrete form at the very earli¬  est stages of the insurrection. The Spanish navy remained loyal  to the Republic,* and made some attempt to prevent Franco  from ferrying troops from Morocco to Spain. Italian and Ger¬  man involvement in overcoming these efforts is well docu¬  mented; 128 the British role has received less attention, but can  be determined from contemporary reports. On August 11 , 1936,  the New York Times carried a front-page report on British  naval actions in the Straits of Gibraltar, commenting that “this  action helps the Rebels by preventing attacks on Algeciras,  where troops from Morocco land.” (A few days earlier, loyalist  warships had bombarded Algeciras, damaging the British con-   * To be more precise, pro-Franco officers were killed, and the seamen re¬  mained loyal to the Republic, in many instances.

With the collapse of his Vietnam policies, a serious international  economic crisis, and domestic turmoil threatening to make the  country impossible to govern, the President made a “noble” and  “magnanimous” gesture—“the ultimate sacrifice for peace,” in  the words of one senator: he announced that he would not seek  renomination. This proves the viability of American democracy.  By these standards a still more viable democracy was that of  fascist Japan in the late 1930s, where more than a dozen cabi¬  nets fell under not dissimilar circumstances. The health of our  system would have been demonstrated by a change of policy  caused by a recognition that what we have done in Vietnam is  wrong, a criminal act, that an American “victory” would have  been a tragedy. Nothing could be more remote from the Ameri¬  can political consciousness. So long as this remains true, we are  fated to relive this horror.   The primary reason for opposition to the war is its cost to us.  A second cause is the feeling that the cost to its victims is too  great. At first glance, this reaction seems to be at a higher moral  level than the first, but this is questionable. The principle that  we should retract our claws when the victim bleeds too much is  hardly an elevated one. What about opposition to the war on  the grounds that we have no right to stabilize or restructure  Vietnamese society, or to carry out the experiments with “mate¬  rial and human resources control” that delight the “pacification  theorist”? Such opposition is slight, and in the political arena  virtually nonexistent. The pragmatic and responsible student of     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   contemporary affairs does not descend to such emotionalism.   In March 1968, the Boston Globe ran a series of letters from a  member of the International Voluntary Services, a teacher in a  Montagnard village, obviously a person of great courage and  dedication. For the most part, these were nice, chatty letters  about life in Vietnam and the good things we’re doing for those  poor people over there. Here are some selections from one let¬  ter:   Funny thing about Vietnam, we’re creating these secure islands,  people are relocated, shuffled into “pacified” areas, but most of  the country is a no man’s land which we’re rapidly turning into a  desert by bombing, defoliation, etc. ... If the Americans get their  way, it’ll be a country of beaches, plus a few islands of secure  areas ... and the rest’ll be wasteland. Funny thing to do to a  country whose economy and politics you’re paying to enhance.  But they say the only way to beat the guerrilla forces is to  eliminate their source of life (the land and the people), ruin the  land and concentrate the people into areas you can protect . 4   I think that such a letter tells us a good deal about the mood  of the country today. A member of the I VS learns that what we  are trying to do is “eliminate their source of life (the land and  the people),” and then goes on cheerily and dutifully to do her  job, helping to restore what has been destroyed. More to the  point, several hundred thousand citizens of Greater Boston—the  cultural capital of the United States, they would like to believe  —may have read that letter and gone on to do their jobs. Why  not? It is no more harrowing than dozens of other things they  have seen and read. In fact, it is doubtful whether there is  anything we could do to the people of Vietnam (the Com¬  munists, that is) that would cause more than a momentary  shudder.   A few weeks earlier the citizens of Boston read an article in  the same place on the Globe editorial page by the chairman of   ',\n",
       " \"   Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   striate.) An accompanying dispatch from Gibraltar describes  the situation as it appeared from there:   Angered by the Spanish factions’ endangering of shipping and  neutral Gibraltar territory in their fighting, Great Britain virtually  blockaded Gibraltar Harbor last night with the huge battleship  Queen Elizabeth in the center of the entrance, constantly playing  searchlights on near-by waters.   Many British warships patrolled the entire Strait today, deter¬  mined to prevent interference with Britain’s control over the en¬  trance to the Mediterranean, a vital place in the British “lifeline  to the East.”   This action followed repeated warnings to the Spanish Gov¬  ernment and yesterday’s decree that no more fighting would be  permitted in Gibraltar Harbor. The British at Gibraltar had be¬  come increasingly nervous after the shelling of Algeciras by the  Loyalist battleship Jaime I.   Although British neutrality is still maintained , the patrol of the  Strait and the closing of the harbor will aid the military Rebels  because Loyalist warships cannot attempt to take Algeciras, now  in Rebel hands , and completely isolate the Rebels from Morocco.   The Rebels now can release some troops, who were rushed back  to Algeciras, for duty further north in the drive for Madrid.   It was reported in Gibraltar tonight that the Rebels had sent a  transport across the Strait and had landed more troops from  Morocco for use in the columns that are marching northward  from headquarters at Seville.   This was the second time this year that Britain warned a power  when she believed her measure of Mediterranean control was  threatened, and it remains to be seen whether the Madrid Gov¬  ernment will flout the British as the Italians did. If it attempts to  do so, the British gunners of the Gibraltar fort have authority to  fire warning shots. What will happen if such shots go unheeded is  obvious.   ^ All the British here refer to the Madrid Government as the  “Communists” and there is no doubt where British sympathies  now lie, encouraged by the statement of General Francisco     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Franco, leader of the Rebels, that he is not especially cooperating  with Italy.   The British Government has ordered Spaniards here to cease  plotting or be expelled and has asked Britons “loyally to refrain  from either acting or speaking publicly in such a manner as to  display marked partiality or partisanship.”   The warning, issued in the official Gibraltar Gazette, was  signed by the British Colonial Secretary here.   The warning was issued after reports of possible Communist  troubles here had reached official ears and after strong complaints  that Spanish Rebels were in Gibraltar. It was said Rebels were  making headquarters here and entering La Linea to fight. [Italics  mine]   I have quoted this dispatch in full because it conveys rather  accurately the character of British “neutrality” in the early  stages of the war and thenceforth. In May 1938, the British  ambassador to Spain, Sir Henry Chilton, “expressed the convic¬  tion that a Franco victory was necessary for peace in Spain;  that there was not the slightest chance that Italy and/or Ger¬  many would dominate Spain; and that even if it were possible  for the Spanish Government to win (which he did not believe)  he was convinced that a victory for Franco would be better for  Great Britain.” 129 Churchill, who was at first violently opposed  to the Republic, modified his position somewhat after the crush¬  ing of the revolution in the summer of 1937. What particularly  pleased him was the forceful repression of the anarchists and  the militarization of the Republic (necessary when “the entire  structure of civilization and social life is destroyed,” as it had  been by the revolution, now happily subdued). 189 However,  his good feelings towards the Republic remained qualified. In  an interview of August 14, 1938, he expressed himself as follows:  “Franco has all the right on his side because he loves his coun¬  try. Also Franco is defending Europe against the Communist  IIS               Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship    danger—if you wish to put it in those terms. But I, I am En¬  glish, and I prefer the triumph of the wrong cause. I prefer that  the other side wins, because Franco could be an upset or a  threat to British interests, and the others no.” 131   The Germans were quite aware of British sentiments, natu¬  rally, and therefore were much concerned that the supervisory  committee for the nonintervention agreement be located in  London rather than Paris. The German Foreign Ministry official  responsible for this matter expressed his view on August 29,  1936, as follows: “Naturally, we have to count on complaints of  all kinds being brought up in London regarding failure to ob¬  serve the obligation not to intervene, but we cannot avoid such  complaints in any case. It can, in fact, only be agreeable to us if  the center of gravity, which after all has thus far been in Paris  because of the French initiative, is transferred to London.” 132  They were not disappointed. In November, Foreign Secretary  Anthony Eden stated in the House of Commons: “So far as  breaches [of the nonintervention agreement] are concerned, I  wish to state categorically that I think there are other Govern¬  ments more to blame than those of Germany and Italy.” 133  There was no factual basis for this statement, but it did reflect  British attitudes. It is interesting that according to German  sources, England was at that time supplying Franco with  munitions through Gibraltar and, at the same time, providing  information to Germany about Russian arms deliveries to the  Republic. 134   The British left was for the most part in support of the lib-  eral-Communist coalition, regarding Caballero as an “infantile  leftist” and the anarchists as generally unspeakable.   The British policy of mild support for Franco was to be suc¬  cessful in preserving British interests in Spain, as the Germans  soon discovered. A German Foreign Ministry note of October    AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    1937 to the embassy in Nationalist Spain included the following  observation: “That England cannot permanently be kept from  the Spanish market as in the past is a fact with which we have  to reckon. England’s old relations with the Spanish mines and  the Generalissimo’s desire, based on political and economic con¬  siderations, to come to an understanding with England place  certain limits on our chances of reserving Spanish raw materials  to ourselves permanently.” 135   One can only speculate as to what might have been the  effects of British support for the Republic. A discussion of this  matter would take us far afield, into a consideration of British  diplomacy during the late 1930s. It is perhaps worth mention,  now that the “Munich analogy” is being bandied about in  utter disregard for the historical facts by Secretary Rusk and a  number of his academic supporters, that “containment of  Communism” was not a policy invented by George Kennan in  1947. Specifically, it was a dominant theme in the diplomacy of  the 1930s. In 1934, Lloyd George stated that “in a very short  time, perhaps in a year, perhaps in two, the conservative ele¬  ments in this country will be looking to Germany as the bul¬  wark against Communism in Europe. ... Do not let us be in a  hurry to condemn Germany. We shall be welcoming Germany  as our friend.” 136 In September 1938, the Munich agreement  was concluded; shortly after, both France and Britain did wel¬  come Germany as “our friend.” As noted earlier (see note 99),  even Churchill’s role at this time is subject to some question. Of  course, the Munich agreement was the death knell for the Span¬  ish Republic, exactly as the necessity to rely on the Soviet    Union signaled the end of the Spanish revolution in 1937.              Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   force in European affairs. Nevertheless, the American record is  hardly one to inspire pride. Technically, the United States  adhered to a position of strict neutrality. However, a careful  look raises some doubts. According to information obtained by  Jackson, “the American colonel who headed the Telephone  Company had placed private lines at the disposal of the Madrid  plotters for their conversations with Generals Mola and  Franco,” 137 just prior to the insurrection on July 17. In August,  the American government urged the Martin Aircraft Company  not to honor an agreement made prior to the insurrection to  supply aircraft to the Republic, and it also pressured the Mexi¬  can government not to reship to Spain war materials purchased  in the United States. 138 An American arms exporter, Robert  Cuse, insisted on his legal right to ship airplanes and aircraft  engines to the Republic in December 1936, and the State De¬  partment was forced to grant authorization. Cuse was de¬  nounced by Roosevelt as unpatriotic, though Roosevelt was  forced to admit that the request was quite legal. Roosevelt con¬  trasted the attitude of other businessmen to Cuse as follows:   Well, these companies went along with the request of the Gov¬  ernment. There is the 90 percent of business that is honest, I  mean ethically honest. There is the 90 percent we are always  pointing at with pride. And then one man does what amounts to  a perfectly legal but thoroughly unpatriotic act. He represents the  10 percent of business that does not live up to the best standards.  Excuse the homily, but I feel quite deeply about it. 139   Among the businesses that remained “ethically honest” and  therefore did not incur Roosevelt's wrath was the Texaco Oil  Company, which violated its contracts with the Spanish Repub¬  lic and shipped oil instead to Franco. (Five tankers that were  on the high seas in July 1936 were diverted to Franco, who  received six million dollars worth of oil on credit during the     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Civil War.) Apparently, neither the press nor the American  government was able to discover this fact, though it was re¬  ported in left-wing journals at the time. 140 There is evidence  that the American government shared the fears of Churchill  and others about the dangerous forces on the Republican side.  Secretary of State Cordell Hull, for example, informed Roose¬  velt on July 23,1936, that “one of the most serious factors in this  situation lies in the fact that the [Spanish] Government has  distributed large quantities of arms and ammunition into the  hands of irresponsible members of left-wing political organiza¬  tions.” 141   Like Churchill, many responsible Americans began to rethink  their attitude towards the Republic after the social revolution  had been crushed. 142 However, relations with Franco con-  tinued cordial. In 1957, President Eisenhower congratulated  Franco on the “happy anniversary” of his rebellion, 143 and Sec¬  retary Rusk added his tribute in 1961. Upon criticism, Rusk was  defended by the American ambassador to Madrid, who ob¬  served that Spain is “a nation which understands the implacable  nature of the communist threat,” 144 like Thailand, South  Korea, Taiwan, and selected other countries of the Free  World. 145   . 1 , Y _ 1_          Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   The study of collectivization published by the CNT in  193 7 146 concludes with a description of the village of Mem-  brilla. “In its miserable huts live the poor inhabitants of a poor  province; eight thousand people, but the streets are not paved,  the town has no newspaper, no cinema, neither a cafd nor a  library. On the other hand, it has many churches that have been  burned.” Immediately after the Franco insurrection, the land  was expropriated and village life collectivized. “Food, clothing,  and tools were distributed equitably to the whole population.  Money was abolished, work collectivized, all goods passed to  the community, consumption was socialized. It was, however,  not a socialization of wealth but of poverty.” Work continued as  before. An elected council appointed committees to organize  the life of the commune and its relations to the outside world.  The necessities of life were distributed freely, insofar as they  were available. A large number of refugees were accom¬  modated. A small library was established, and a small school of  design.   The document closes with these words:   The whole population lived as in a large family; functionaries,  delegates, the secretary of the syndicates, the members of the  municipal council, all elected, acted as heads of a family. But  they were controlled, because special privilege or corruption  would not be tolerated. Membrilla is perhaps the poorest village  of Spain, but it is the most just.   An account such as this, with its concern for human relations  and the ideal of a just society, must appear very strange to the  consciousness of the sophisticated intellectual, and it is there¬  fore treated with scorn, or taken to be naive or primitive or  otherwise irrational. Only when such prejudice is abandoned  will it be possible for historians to undertake a serious study of     ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   the popular movement that transformed Republican Spain in  one of the most remarkable social revolutions that history  records.   Franz Borkenau, in commenting on the demoralization  caused by the authoritarian practices of the central government,  observes (p. 295) that “newspapers are written by Euro¬  peanized editors, and the popular movement is inarticulate as  to its deepest impulses .. . [which are shown only] ... by acts.”  The objectivity of scholarship will remain a delusion as long as  these inarticulate impulses remain beyond its grasp. As far as  the Spanish revolution is concerned, its history is yet to be  written.   I have concentrated on one theme—-the interpretation of the  social revolution in Spain—in one work of history, a work that  is an excellent example of liberal scholarship. It seems to me  that there is more than enough evidence to show that a deep  bias against social revolution and a commitment to the values  and social order of liberal bourgeois democracy has led the  author to misrepresent crucial events and to overlook major  historical currents. My intention has not been to bring into  question the commitment to these values—that is another mat¬  ter entirely. Rather, it has been to show how this commitment  has led to a striking failure of objectivity, providing an example  of counterrevolutionary subordination” of a much more subtle  and interesting sort—and ultimately, I believe, a far more im¬  portant one—than those discussed in the first part of this  essay.   Ill   In opening this discussion of the Spanish revolution I referred  to the classical left-wing critique of the social role of intellec-   \",\n",
       " '   Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   titals, Marxist or otherwise, in modern society, and to Luxem¬  burg’s reservations regarding Bolshevism. Western sociologists  have repeatedly emphasized the relevance of this analysis “to  developments in the Soviet Union, 147 with much justice. The  same sociologists formulate “the world revolution of the epoch”  in the following terms: “The major transformation is the decline  of business (and of earlier social formations) and the rise of  intellectuals and semi-intellectuals to effective power.” 148 The  “ultra-left” critic foresaw in these developments a new attack on  human freedom and a more efficient system of exploitation. The  Western sociologist sees in the rise of intellectuals to effective  power the hope for a more humane and smoothly functioning  society, in which problems can be solved by “piecemeal tech¬  nology.” Who has the sharper eye? At least this much is plain:  there are dangerous tendencies in the ideology of the welfare  state intelligentsia who claim to possess the technique and un¬  derstanding required to manage our “postindustrial society” and  to organize an international society dominated by American  superpower. Many of these dangers are revealed, at a purely  ideological level, in the study of the counterrevolutionary sub¬  ordination of scholarship. The dangers exist both insofar as tlfie  claim to knowledge is real and insofar as it is fraudulent. Insofar  as the technique of management and control exists, it can be  used to consolidate the authority of those who exercise it and to  diminish spontaneous and free experimentation with new social  forms, as it can limit the possibilities for reconstruction of soci¬  ety in the interests of those who are now, to a greater or lesser  extent, dispossessed. Where the techniques fail, they will be  supplemented by all of the methods of coercion that modern  technology provides, to preserve order and stability.   For a glimpse of what may lie ahead, consider the Godkin  lectures of McGeorge Bundy, recently delivered at Harvard. 149      .fr .— AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Bundy urges that more power be concentrated in the executive  branch of the government, now “dangerously weak in relation  to its present tasks.” That the powerful executive will act with  justice and wisdom—this presumably needs no argument. As an  example of the superior executive who should be attracted to  government and given still greater power, Bundy cites Robert  McNamara. Nothing could reveal more clearly the dangers in¬  herent in the “new society” than the role that McNamara’s Pen¬  tagon has played for the past half-dozen years. No doubt Mc¬  Namara succeeded in doing with utmost efficiency that which  should not be done at all. No doubt he has shown an unparal¬  leled mastery of the logistics of coercion and repression, com¬  bined with the most astonishing inability to comprehend politi¬  cal and human factors. The efficiency of the Pentagon is no less  remarkable than its pratfalls. 150 When understanding fails,  there is always more force in reserve. As the “experiments in  material and human resources control” collapse and “revolu¬  tionary development” grinds to a halt, we simply resort more  openly to the Gestapo tactics that are barely concealed behind  the fagade of “pacification.” 151 When American cities explode,  we can expect the same. The technique of “limited warfare  translates neatly into a system of domestic repression—far more  humane, as will quickly be explained, than massacring those  who are unwilling to wait for the inevitable victory of the war  on poverty.   Why should a liberal intellectual be so persuaded of the vir¬  tues of a political system of four-year dictatorship ? The answer  seems all too plain.    ',\n",

Urbanization, of course, is that  \"funny thing” that we’re doing to the people of Vietnam. It is  the process described in the following terms by Don Luce, who  resigned as director of IVS in late 1967 in protest against  United States policy, after nine years in the field:   Less “fortunate” villagers [than those in “pacified” villages] have  been uprooted from their traditional homes and placed in refugee  camps that crowd around the cities. These bleak camps are made  up almost completely of women and children who deeply resent  having been torn away from their farmlands and way of life,  away from their ancestral burial grounds, and even away from  . their husbands—who are usually with the Vietcong. Their old  village usually becomes part of a free strike zone. This means that  planes can drop bombs anywhere in that area and that anyone  caught there will be considered a Vietcong and shot. Unfortu¬  nately, many of the refugees go back to harvest their rice or  wander into these areas to gather wood or thatch. In Tuy Hoa  one of the IVS members was asked to give blood at the provincial  hospital where he was working on a part-time basis. He asked an  old man waiting in the hospital what had happened. The old man  replied bitterly, “My son and four others went to cut wood. On  their return an American helicopter hovered over. Frightened,  they ran. Four were wounded; one was killed.” 6   In short, urbanization is the process by which you “eliminate  their source of life (the land and the people), ruin the land and  concentrate the people into areas you can protect.” This every¬  one understands. Yet there is scarcely a ripple of protest when  the chairman of the department of government at our greatest   ',\n",
       " '         Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship    bluntly that “the State Department is not disposed to favor large loans  of public funds to countries not welcoming our private capital” {State  Department Bulletin No. 22, 1950, cited in Frederick Clairmonte,  Economic Liberalism and Underdevelopment [Bombay and London,  Asia Publishing House, 1960], p. 248), Eugene Black, testifying be¬  fore Congress on the Asian Development Bank, pointed out that  “when the Bank makes loans you have international bids, and I am  sure that with our ability and ingenuity in this country, we will get our  share of the business. We certainly ought to get more than the small  amount we contribute.” David Bell testified that “the Bank will play a  major role in carrying forward another policy of our own assistance  program—strengthening the role of the private sector ... by identify¬  ing particular projects which can attract private capital, by helping to  draw up development plans and stimulate policies which will en¬  courage private initiative, and by drawing private capital to the re¬  gion.” Nothing here about “the generosity that characterizes our pol¬  icy.”   Equally revealing is the history of programs such as the Alliance for  Progress. As Senator Gore commented, this program “has in large  measure come to be a subsidy for American business and American  exporters” {Congressional Record, July 22, 1966)—a fairly accurate  judgment, so it appears. For example, the AID lending program in  Latin America, according to former Alliance for Progress official Wil¬  liam Rogers {The Twilight Struggle [New York, Random House,  1967], p. 205), is based on two elements: “a demonstrated balance of  payments needed to increase the nation’s ability to import U.S. goods  and services, and the adoption of public policies and programs which  would insure against capital flight on the international account side or  the misuse of domestic resources through inefficient budgeting, re¬  duced local savings or inflation.” Commenting on this, Robert Smith  notes that “the latter standard included increased tax revenues, reduc¬  tion of budget deficit, elimination of ‘distorting subsidies to public  activities,’ and the adoption of ‘state incentives to private sector invest¬  ment and growth.’” {New Politics, Vol. 6 [Spring 1967], pp. 49-57.

It  should be noted that opposition to social change, and support for the  counterrevolutionary violence that is used to suppress it, are long¬  standing features of American cultural history. Thus according to  American historian Louis Hartz, “there is no doubt that the appear¬  ance of even a mild socialism in 1848, of Ledru Rollin and the  national workshops, was enough to produce general American dismay.  There was no outcry in America against the suppression of the June  revolt of the workers in Paris, as there was none over the suppression  of the Communards in 1871. Here was violence, and plenty of it, but  it was being used for order and law, as one editorial writer put it [in  the New York Journal of Commerce ].” (The Nature of Revolution,  Testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Feb¬  ruary 26, 1968 [Washington, Government Printing Office, 1968].)   20. “The Public and the Polity,” in Ithiel de Sola Pool, ed., Contem¬  porary Political Science: Toward Empirical Theory (New York, Mc¬  Graw-Hill Book Company, 1967), p. 26.   21.

This was one  of “the areas where American-Korean multidivision operations have  literally smothered the opposition” with “vast search-and-destroy op¬  erations” and continuing “tight military control”—or so it seemed,  until late 1967, and finally February 1968, when the lid blew off. A  report on Binh Dinh Province, the “showcase” province for pacifica¬  tion, in the New York Times, February 20, tells the story. “The enemy  moves in December—which several military men called a ‘softening  up for the offensive—resulted in a wave of allied air strikes on vil¬  lages. Hundreds of homes were destroyed”—the standard American  response.

There is little point in a lengthy discussion of Wolf’s concept of  international affairs or his empirical studies. To take a few examples,  he assumes without question that North Vietnam’s willingness to dis¬  rupt the regime” in the South was motivated in part by “the marked  economic and social improvements accomplished by the Diem regime  from 1955 to I960—dramatic by comparison with the economic stag¬  nation in North Vietnam” (for fact rather than fancy on relative  development, see Buttinger, op. cit., Vol. 2, pp. 928, 966 f.); and also  that India’s “moderately successful growth” was part of the motivation  behind “China’s aggressive actions in October 1962.” See also note 36.  As to the solidity of Wolf’s empirical studies, it is perhaps enough to  note that his most significant result, the correlation between higher  GNP and higher level of political democracy in Latin America, arises  principally from the conclusion (based on data from 1950 to 1960)  that Brazil and Argentina (along with Mexico and Chile) rank high  on the scale of political democracy (cf. p. 124). The general level of  sophistication is illustrated, for example, by a solemn reference to a  consultant for having explained that in determining the “total military  value” of a set of alternatives, it is not enough to sum up the separate  values; one must also weight responses by probability of occurrence.   36. “But in all cases, the primary consideration should be whether  the proposed measure is likely to increase the cost and difficulties of  insurgent operations and help to disrupt the insurgent organization,  rather than whether it wins popular loyalty and support, or whether it  contributes to a more productive, efficient, or equitable use of re¬  sources” (Wolf, op. cit., p. 69).

See also  note 37.   47. Cited in Paul Avrich, The Russian Anarchists (Princeton, N.J.,  Princeton University Press, 1967), pp. 93-94. A recent reformulation  of this view is given by Anton Pannekoek, the Dutch scientist and  spokesman for libertarian communism, in his Workers Councils (Mel¬  bourne, 1950), pp. 36-37:   It is not for the first time that a ruling class tries to explain, and  so to perpetuate, its rule as the consequences of an inborn difference  between two kinds of people, one destined by nature to ride, the  other to be ridden. The landowning aristocracy of former centuries  defended their privileged position by boasting their extraction from a  nobler race of conquerors that had subdued the lower race of common  people. Big capitalists explain their dominating place by the assertion  that they have brains and other people havo^none. In the same way  now especially the intellectuals, considering themselves the rightful  rulers of to-morrow, claim their spiritual superiority. They form the  rapidly increasing class of university-trained officials and free pro¬  fessions, specialized in mental work, in study of books and of science,   ',\n",
       " '   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   and they consider themselves as the people most gifted with intellect.  Hence they are destined to be leaders of the production, whereas the  ungifted mass shall execute the manual work, for which no brains are  needed. They are no defenders of capitalism; not capital, but intellect  should direct labor. The more so, since now society is such a compli¬  cated structure, based on abstract and difficult science, that only the  highest intellectual acumen is capable of embracing, grasping and  handling it. Should the working masses, from lack of insight, fail to  acknowledge this need of superior intellectual lead, should they stupidly  try to take the direction into their own hands, chaos and ruin will be  the inevitable consequence.   48.

It is interesting that Douglas Pike’s very hostile account of the  National Liberation Front, cited earlier, emphasizes the popular and  voluntary element in its striking organizational successes. What he de¬  scribes, whether accurately or not one cannot tell, is a structure of  interlocking self-help organizations, loosely coordinated and developed  through persuasion rather than force—in certain respects, of a charac-  ',\n",

Those who speak  so freely of the “authoritarian Vietcong” may be correct, but they   ave presented little evidence to support their judgment. Of course it  must be understood that Pike regards the element of voluntas mass  p rtiapation ln self-help associations as the most dangerous and in¬  sidious feature of the NLF organizational structure.   Also relevant is the history of collectivization in China, which as  compared with the Soviet Union, shows a much higher reliance' on  persuasion and mutual aid than on force and terror, and appears to  have been more successful. See Thomas P. Bernstein, “Leadership and  Mass Mobilisation in the Soviet and Chinese Collectivization Cam-  paignso 1929-3° and 19SS-56: A Comparison,” China Quarterly,  No. 31 (July-September 1967), pp. hj, for some interesting and  suggestive comments and analysis.   The scale of the Chinese Revolution is so great and reports in depth  are so fragmentary that it would no doubt be foolhardy to attempt a  general evaluation. Still, all the reports I have been able to study  suggest that insofar as real successes were achieved in the several  stages of land reform, mutual aid, collectivization, and formation of  communes, they were traceable in large part to the complex interac¬  tion of the Communist party cadres and the gradually evolving peas¬  ant associations, a relation which seems to stray far from the Leninist  model of organization. This is particularly evident in William Hinton’s  magnificent study Fanshen (New York, Monthly Review Press,  1966), which is unparalleled, to my knowledge, as an analysis of a  moment of profound revolutionary change. What seems to me partiru-  larly striking in his account of the early stages of revolution in one  Chinese village is not only the extent to which party cadres submitted  themselves to popular control, but also, and more significant, the ways  in which exercise of control over steps of the revolutionary process  was a factor m developing the consciousness and insight of those who  took part in the revolution, not only from a political and social point  of view, but also with respect to the human relationships that were  created. It is interesting, in this connection, to note the strong populist  element in early Chinese Marxism. For some very illuminating ob¬  servations about this general matter, see Maurice Meisner, Li Ta-chao  and the Ongms of Chinese Marxism (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard  University Press, 1967).   I am not suggesting that the anarchist revolution in Spain—with its   \",\n",
       " '   ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   background of more than thirty years of education and struggle—is  being relived in Asia, but rather that the spontaneous and voluntary  elements in popular mass movements have probably been serious y  misunderstood because of the instinctive antipathy towards such  phenomena among intellectuals, and more recently, because of the  insistence on interpreting them in terms of Cold War mythology.   57. “The Spanish Background,” New Left Review, No. 40 (November-  December 1966), pp. 85-90.   53.

This highly informative book should certain y  be made available to an English-speaking audience.   59 An exception to the rather general failure to deal with the an¬  archist revolution is Hugh Thomas’ “Anarchist Agrarian Collectives  in the Spanish Civil War,” in Martin Gilbert, ed., A Century of Con¬  flict, 1850-1950: Essays for A. J. P. Taylor (New York, At eneum  Publishers, 1967), pp. 245-63. See note 106 below for some discus¬  sion There is also much useful information in what to my mind is e  best general history of the Civil War, La Revolution et la guerre  d’Espagne, by Pierre Broue and Emile Temime (Pans, Les Editions de  Minuit, 1961). A concise and informative recent account is contained  in Daniel Gudrin, L’Amrchisme (Paris, Gallimard, 1965). In his ex¬  tensive study, The Spanish Civil War (New York, Harper & Row,  Publishers, 1961; paperback ed. 1963), Hugh Thomas barely refers to  the popular revolution, and some of the major events are not men-  tioned at all—see, for example, note 97 below.   60 Collectivisations: Voeuvre constructive de la Revolution espag-  nole, 2nd ed. (Toulouse, Editions C.N.T., 1965). The first edition was  published in Barcelona (Editions C.N.T.-F.A.I., 1937). There is an  excellent and sympathetic summary by the Marxist scholar Kar  Korsch, “Collectivization in Spain,” in Living Marxism. , Vol 4 (April  1939) pp 179-82. In the same issue (pp. 170-71), the liberal-Com-  munist reaction to the Spanish Civil War is summarized succinctly,  and I believe accurately, as follows: “With their empty chatter as to  the wonders of Bolshevik discipline, the geniality of Caballero, and t e  passions of the Pasionaria, the ‘modem liberals’ merely covered up  their real desire for the destruction of all revolutionary possibilities in    ',\n",

An illuminating eyewitness account of this period is that of Franz  Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit (1938; reprinted Ann Arbor, Univer¬  sity of Michigan Press, 1963).   62.

Cited by Camillo Berneri in his “Lettre ouverte a la camarade  Frederica [sic] Montseny,” Guerre de classes en Espagne (Paris,  1946), a collection of items translated from his journal Guerra di  Classe. Berneri was the oustanding anarchist intellectual in Spain. He  opposed the policy of joining the government and argued for an al¬  ternative, more typically anarchist strategy to which I will return  below. His own view towards joining the government was stated suc¬  cinctly by a Catalan worker whom he quotes, with reference to the  Republic of 1931: “It is always the old dog with a new collar.” Events  were to prove the accuracy of this analysis.   Berneri had been a leading spokesman of Italian anarchism. He left  Italy after Mussolini’s rise to power, and came to Barcelona on July  19, 1936. He formed the first Italian units for the antifascist war,  according to anarchist historian Rudolf Rocker ( The Tragedy of Spain  [New York, Freie Arbeiter Stimme, 1937], p. 44). He was murdered,  along with his older comrade Barbieri, during the May Days of 1937.  (Arrested on May 5 by the Communist-controlled police, he was shot  during the following night.) Hugh Thomas, in The Spanish Civil War,  p. 428, suggests that “the assassins may have been Italian Commu¬  nists” rather than the police. Thomas’ book, which is largely devoted  to military history, mentions Berneri’s murder but makes no other  reference to his ideas or role.   Berneri’s name does not appear in Jackson’s history.   65.

This book, by a UP correspondent in Spain during  the Civil War, contains a great deal of important documentary evi¬  dence bearing on the questions considered here. The attitude of the  wealthy farmers of this area, most of them former supporters of the  right-wing organizations that had now disappeared, is well described  by the general secretary of the Peasant Federation, Julio Mateu:   Such is the sympathy for us [that is, the Communist party] in the  Valencia countryside that hundreds and thousands of farmers would  join our party if we were to let them. These farmers.. . . love our party  like a sacred thing . . . they [say] ‘The Communist Party is our party.’  Comrades, what emotion the peasants display when they utter these  words (cited in Bolloten, p. 86). There is some interesting specula¬  tion about the backgrounds for the writing of this very important book  in H. R. Southworth, Le mythe de la croisade de Franco (Ruedo  Iberico, Paris, 1964; Spanish edition, same publisher, 1963).   The Communist headquarters in Valencia had on the wall two  posters: “Respect the property of the small peasant” and “Respect the  property of the small industrialist” (Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit ,  p. 117). Actually, it was the rich farmer as well who sought protection  from the Communists, whom Borkenau describes as constituting the  extreme right wing of the Republican forces. By early 1937, according  to Borkenau, the Communist party was “to a large extent ... the party  of the military and administrative personnel, in the second place the  party of the petty bourgeoisie and certain well-to-do peasant groups, in  the third place the party of the employees, and only in the fourth place  the party of the industrial workers” (p. 192). The party also attracted  many police and army officers. The police chief in Madrid and the  chief of intelligence, for example, were party members. In general, the  party, which had been insignificant before the revolution, “gave the  urban and rural middle classes a powerful access of life and vigour” as  it defended them from the revolutionary forces (Bolloten, op. cit., p.  86 ). Gerald Brenan describes the situation as follows, in The Spanish  Labyrinth (1943; reprinted Cambridge, Cambridge University Press,  1960), p. 325:   Unable to draw to themselves the manual workers, who remained   firmly fixed in their unions, the Communists found themselves the   refuge for all those who had suffered from the excesses of the Revolu-   ',\n",

Thus [in Catalonia] one had a strange and novel  situation: on the one side stood the huge compact proletariat of  Barcelona with its long revolutionary tradition, and on the other the  white-collar workers and petite bourgeoisie of the city, organized  and armed by the Communist party against it.   Actually, the situation that Brenan describes is not as strange a one  as he suggests. It is, rather, a natural consequence of Bolshevik elitism  that the Red bureaucracy” should act as a counterrevolutionary force  except under the conditions where its present or future representatives  are attempting to seize power for themselves, in the name of the  masses whom they pretend to represent.   66 . Bolloten, op. cit., p. 189. The legalization of revolutionary actions  already undertaken and completed recalls the behavior of the “revolu¬  tionary vanguard” in the Soviet Union in 1918. Cf. Arthur Rosenberg,   A History of Bolshevism (1932; republished in translation from the  original German, New York, Russell and Russell, Publishers, 1965), '  Ch. 6. He describes how the expropriations, “accomplished as the  result of spontaneous action on the part of workers and against the  will of the Bolsheviks,” were reluctantly legalized by Lenin months  later and then placed under central party control. On the relation of  the Bolsheviks to the anarchists in postrevolutionary Russia, inter¬  preted from a pro-anarchist point of view, see Guerin, VAnarchisme,  pp. 96-125.

For a moving eyewitness account, see George Orwell, Homage to  Catalonia (1938; reprinted New York, Harcourt, Brace & World,  1952, and Boston, Beacon Press, 1955; quotations in this book from  Beacon Press edition). This brilliant book received little notice at the  time of its first publication, no doubt because the picture Orwell drew  was in sharp conflict with established liberal dogma. The attention that  it has received as a cold-war document since its republication in 1952  would, I suspect, have been of little comfort to the author.   71.

It is because of the  essential accuracy of Borkenau’s account that I think Hobsbawm (op.  cit.) is quite mistaken in believing that the Communist policy was  undoubtedly the only one which could have won the Civil War.” In  fact, the Communist policy was bound to fail, because it was predi¬  cated on the assumption that the Western democracies would join the  antifascist effort if only Spain could be preserved as, in effect, a  Western colony. Once the Communist leaders saw the futility of this  hope, they abandoned the struggle, which was not in their eyes an  effort to win the Civil War, but only to serve the interests of Russian  foreign policy. I also disagree with Hobsbawm’s analysis of the  anarchist revolution, cited earlier, for reasons that are implicit in this  entire discussion.   76. Op. cit., pp. 143-44.   77 .

While Com-  panys, as a Catalonian with separatist impulses, would naturally be  inclined to defend Catalonian achievements, he was surely not sympa¬  thetic to collectivization, despite his cooperative attitude during the  period when the anarchists, with real power in their hands, permitted  him to retain nominal authority. I know of no attempt to challenge the  accuracy of his assessment. Morrow (op. cit., p. 77) quotes the  Catalonian Premier, the entrepreneur Juan Tarradellas, as defending  the administration of the collectivized war industries against a Com¬  munist (PSUC) attack, which he termed the “most arbitrary false¬  hoods.” There are many other reports commenting on the functioning  of the collectivized industries by nonanarchist firsthand observers, that  tend to support Companys. For example, the Swiss socialist Andres  Oltmares is quoted by Rocker (The Tragedy of Spain, p. 24) as saying  that after the revolution the Catalonian workers’ syndicates “in seven    ',\n",

Orwell, op. cit., pp. 109-11. Orwell’s description of Barcelona in  December (pp. 4-5), when he arrived for the first time, deserves more  extensive quotation:   It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the  working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any  size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or  with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was  scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the  revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its  images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically  demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and cafe had an  inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks  had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters  and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal.  Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily dis¬  appeared, Nobody said “Senor” or “Don” or even “Usted”; everyone  called everyone else “Comrade” and “Thou,” and said “Salud!” instead  of “Buenos dias.” Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time  of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a  lecture from an hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There  were no private motor cars, they had all been commandeered, and all  the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted  red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming  from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining  advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide  central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed con¬  stantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary  songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the  crowds that was the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it  was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to  exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were  no “well-dressed” people at all. Practically everyone wore rough  working-class clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of the militia  uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in it that  I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I  recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for. Also  I believed that things were as they appeared, that this was really  a workers’ State and that the entire bourgeoisie had either fled, been     \"★=    AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    killed, or voluntarily come over to the workers’ side; I did not realize  that great numbers of well-to-do bourgeois were simply lying low and  disguising themselves as proletarians for the time being . . .   ... waiting for that happy day when Communist power would rein¬  troduce the old state of society and destroy popular involvement in the  war.   In December 1936, however, the situation was still as described in  the following remarks (p. 6):   Yet so far as one can judge the people were contented and hopeful.  There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still ex¬  tremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and  no beggars except the gipsies. Above all, there was a belief in the  revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into  an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave  as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine. In the  barbers’ shops were Anarchist notices (the barbers were mostly An¬  archists) solemnly explaining that barbers were no longer slaves. In  the streets were coloured posters appealing to prostitutes to stop being  prostitutes. To anyone from the hard-boiled, sneering civilization of the  English-speaking races there was something rather pathetic in the  literalness with which these idealistic Spaniards took the hackneyed  phrases of revolution. At that time revolutionary ballads of the  naivest kind, all about proletarian brotherhood and the wickedness of  Mussolini, were being sold on the streets for a few centimes each. I  have often seen an illiterate militiaman buy one of these ballads,  laboriously spell out the words, and then, when he had got the hang  of it, begin singing it to an appropriate tune.   Recall the dates. Orwell arrived in Barcelona in late December 1936.  Comorera’s decree abolishing the workers’ supply committees and the  bread committees was on January 7. Borkenau returned to Barcelona  in mid-January; Orwell, in April.   91. See Bolloten, op. cit., p. 74, citing the anarchist spokesman Juan  Peiro, in September 1936. Like other anarchists and left-wing Social-  lists, Peiro sharply condemns the use of force to introduce collectiviza¬  tion, taking the position that was expressed by most anarchists, as well  as by left-wing socialists such as Ricardo Zabalza, general secretary of  the Federation of Land Workers, who stated, on January 8, 1937: “I  prefer a small, enthusiastic collective, formed by a group of active and  honest workers, to a large collective set up by force and composed of  ',\n",
       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship    peasants without enthusiasm, who would sabotage it until it failed. Vol¬  untary collectivization may seem the longer course, but the example of  the small, well-managed collective will attract the entire peasantry,  who are profoundly realistic and practical, whereas forced collectiviza¬  tion would end by discrediting socialized agriculture” (cited by Bolloten  op, cit., p. 59). However, there seems no doubt that the precepts of  the anarchist and left-socialist spokesmen were often violated in prac¬  tice.   92. Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit, pp. 219-20. Of this officer, Jack-  son says only that he was “a dependable professional officer.” After  the fall of Malaga, Lieutenant Colonel Villalba was tried for treason,  for having deserted the headquarters and abandoned his troops. Broue  and T6mime remark that it is difficult to determine what justice there  was in the charge.   93. Jesus Hernandez and Juan Comorera, Spain Organises for Vic¬  tory: The Policy of the Communist Party of Spain Explained (Lon¬  don, Communist Party of Great Britain, n.d.), cited by Richards, op.  cit., pp. 99-100. There was no accusation that the phone service was  restricted, but only that the revolutionary workers could maintain “a  close check on the conversations that took place between the politi¬  cians.” As Richards further observes, “It is, of course, a quite different  matter when the ‘indiscreet ear’ is that of the O.G.P.U.”   94. Broue and Temime, op. cit., p. 266.   95. Jackson, op. cit., p. 370. Thomas suggests that Ses6 was probably  killed accidentally {The Spanish Civil War, p. 428).   96. The anarchist mayor of the border town of Puigcerda had been  assassinated in April, after Negrin’s carabineros had taken over the  border posts. That same day a prominent UGT member, Roldan Cor-  tada, was murdered in Barcelona, it is presumed by CNT militants.  This presumption is disputed by Peirats {Los Anarquistas: see note  58), who argues, with some evidence, that the murder may have been  a Stalinist provocation. In reprisal, a CNT man was killed. Orwell,  whose eyewitness account of the May Days is unforgettable, points  out that “One can gauge the attitude of the foreign capitalist Press  towards the Communist-Anarchist feud by the fact that Rolddn’s  murder was given wide publicity, while the answering murder was  carefully unmentioned” {op. cit., p. 119). Similarly, one can gauge  Jackson’s attitude towards this struggle by his citation of Sese’s murder  as a critical event, while the murder of Berneri goes unmentioned (cf.   ',\n",
       " \"    'AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    notes 64 and 95). Orwell remarks elsewhere that “In the English  press, in particular, you would have to search for a long time before  finding any favourable reference, at any period of the war, to the  Spanish Anarchists. They have been systematically denigrated, and, as  I know by my own experience, it is almost impossible to get anyone to  print anything in their defence” (p. 159). Little has changed since.   97. According to Orwell ( op. cit., pp. 153-54), “A British cruiser and  two British destroyers had closed in upon the harbour, and no doubt  there were other warships not far away. The English newspapers gave  it out that these ships were proceeding to Barcelona ‘to protect British  interests, 5 but in fact they made no move to do so; that is, they did not  land any men or take off any refugees. There can be no certainty  about this, but it was at least inherently likely that the British Gov¬  ernment, which had not raised a finger to save the Spanish Govern¬  ment from Franco, would intervene quickly enough to save it from its  own working class.” This assumption may well have influenced the left-  wing leadership to restrain the Barcelona workers from simply taking  control of the whole city, as apparently they could easily have done in  the initial stages of the May Days.   Hugh Thomas comments (The Spanish Civil War, p. 428) that  there was “no reason” for Orwell’s “apprehension” on this matter. In  the light of the British record with regard to Spain, it seems to me that  Thomas is simply unrealistic, as compared with Orwell, in this re¬  spect.   98. Orwell, op. cit., pp. 143-44.   99. Controversy, August 1937, cited by Morrow, p. 173. The predic¬  tion was incorrect, though not unreasonable. Had the Western powers  and the Soviet Union wished, compromise would have been possible, it  appears, and Spain might have been saved the terrible consequences of  a Franco victory. See Brenan, op. cit., p. 331. He attributes the British  failure to support an armistice and possible reconciliation to the fact  that Chamberlain “saw nothing disturbing in the prospect of an Italian  and German victory.” It would be interesting to explore more fully the  attitude of Winston Churchill. In April 1937 he stated that a Franco  victory would not harm British interests. Rather, the danger was a  “success of the trotskyists and anarchists” (cited by Broue and Te-  mime, op. cit., p. 172). Of some interest, in this connection, is the  recent discovery of an unpublished Churchill essay written in March  1939 —six months after Munich—in which he said that England  \",\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " '    Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   “would welcome and aid a genuine Hitler of peace and toleration”  (see New York Times, December 12, 1965).   100 . I find no mention at all in Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil  War. The account here is largely taken from Broue and Temime, pp.  279-80.   101 . Op cit., p. 405. A footnote comments on the “leniency” of the  government to those arrested. Jackson has nothing to say about the  charges against Ascaso and others, or the manner in which the old  order was restored in Aragon.   To appreciate these events more fully, one should consider, by com¬  parison, the concern for civil liberties shown by Negrin on the sec¬  ond, antifascist front. In an interview after the war he explained to  John Whitaker (We Cannot Escape History [New York, The Macmil¬  lan Company, 1943], pp. 116-18) why his government had been so  ineffective in coping with the fifth column, even in the case of known  fascist agents. Negrin explained that “we couldn’t arrest a man on  suspicion; we couldn’t break with the rules of evidence. You can’t risk  arresting an innocent man because you are positive in your own mind  that he is guilty. You prosecute a war, yes; but you also live with your  conscience.” Evidently, these scruples did not pertain when it was the  rights of anarchist and socialist workers, rather than fascist agents,  that were at stake.   102 . Cf. Broue and Temime, p. 262. Ironically, the government forces  included some anarchist troops, the only ones to enter Barcelona.   103. See Bolloten, op. cit., p. 55, n. 1, for an extensive list of sources.   104. Broue and Temime cite the socialists Alardo Prats, Fenner  Brockway, and Carlo Rosselli. Borkenau, on the other hand, suspected  that the role of terror was great in collectivization. He cites very little  to substantiate his feeling, though some evidence is available from  anarchist sources. See note 91 above.   Some general remarks on collectivization by Rosselli and Brockway  are cited by Rudolf Rocker in his essay “Anarchism and Anarcho-  syndicalism,” n. 1, in Paul, Eltzbacher, ed., Anarchism (London, Free¬  dom Press, 1960), p. 266:   Rosselli: In three months Catalonia has been able to set up a new  social order on the ruins of an ancient system. This is chiefly due to the  Anarchists, who have revealed a quite remarkable sense of proportion,  realistic understanding, and organizing ability. ... All the revolutionary  forces of Catalonia have united in a program of Syndicalist-Socialist       AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    character . . . Anarcho-Syndicalism, hitherto so despised, has revealed  itself as a great constructive force. I am no Anarchist, but I regard it  as my duty to express here my opinion of the Anarchists of Catalonia,  who have all too often been represented as a destructive if not a  criminal element.   Brockway: I was impressed by the strength of the C.N.T. It was un¬  necessary to tell me that it is the largest and most vital of the working  class organizations in Spain. That was evident on all sides. The large  industries were clearly in the main in the hands of the C.N.T.—rail¬  ways, road transport, shipping, engineering, textiles, electricity, building,  agriculture. ... I was immensely impressed by the constructive revolu¬  tionary work which is being done by the C.N.T. Their achievements  of workers’ control in industry is an inspiration. . . . There are still  some Britishers and Americans who regard the Anarchists of Spain as  impossible, undisciplined uncontrollables. This is poles away from the  truth. The Anarchists of Spain, through the C.N.T., are doing one of  the biggest constructive jobs ever done by the working class. At the  front they are fighting Fascism. Behind the front they are actually  constructing the new workers’ society. They see that the war against  Fascism and the carrying through of the social revolution are insepara¬  ble. Those who have seen them and understood what they are doing must  honor them and be grateful to them. . . . That is surely the biggest  thing which has hitherto been done by the workers in any part of  the world.   105. Cited by Richards, op. cit., pp. 76-81, where long descriptive  quotations are given.   106. See Hugh Thomas, “Anarchist Agrarian Collectives in the Span¬  ish Civil War” (note 59). He cites figures showing that agricultural pro¬  duction went up in Aragon and Castile, where collectivization was  extensive, and down in Catalonia and the Levant, where peasant pro¬  prietors were the dominant element.   Thomas’ is, to my knowledge, the only attempt by a professional  historian to assess the data on agricultural collectivization in Spain in  a systematic way. He concludes that the collectives were probably u a con¬  siderable social success” and must have had strong popular support, but he  is more doubtful about their economic viability. His suggestion that  “Communist pressure on the collectives may have given them the nec¬  essary urge to survive” seems quite unwarranted, as does his sugges¬  tion that “the very existence of the war . . . may have been responsible  for some of the success the collectives had.” On the contrary, their  ',\n",
       " \"   Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   success and spontaneous creation throughout Republican Spain sug¬  gest that they answered to deeply felt popular sentiments, and both the  war and Communist pressure appear to have been highly disruptive  factors—ultimately, of course, destructive factors.   Other dubious conclusions are that “in respect of redistribution of  wealth, anarchist collectives were hardly much improvement over  capitalism since “no effective way of limiting consumption in richer  collectives was devised to help poorer ones,” and that there was no  possibility of developing large-scale planning. On the contrary, Bol-  loten (op. dt., pp. 176-79) points out that “In order to remedy the  defects of collectivization, as well as to iron out discrepancies in the  living standards of the workers in flourishing and impoverished enter¬  prises, the Anarchosyndicalists, although rootedly opposed to nation¬  alization, advocated the centralization—or, socialization, as they  called it-—under trade union control, of entire branches of produc¬  tion. He mentions a number of examples of partial socialization that  had some success, citing as the major difficulty that prevented still  greater progress the insistence of the Communist party and the UGT  leadership—though apparently not all of the rank-and-file members of  the UGT—on government ownership and control. According to Rich¬  ards (op. cit., p. 82): “In June, 1937 ... a National Plenum of  Regional Federations of Peasants was held in Valencia to discuss the  formation of a National Federation of Peasants for the co-ordination  and extension of the collectivist movement and also to ensure an  equitable distribution of the produce of the land, not only between the  collectives but for the whole country. Again in Castille in October  1937, a merging of the 100,000 members of the Regional Federation  of Peasants and the 13,000 members in the food distributive trades  took place. It represented a logical step in ensuring better co-ordina¬  tion, and was accepted for the whole of Spain at the National Con¬  gress of Collectives held in Valencia in November 1937.”' Still other  plans were under consideration for regional and national coordination  —see, for example, D. A. de Santillan, After the Revolution (New  York, Greenberg Publisher, Inc., 1937), for some ideas.   Thomas feels that collectives could not have survived more than “a  few years while primitive misery was being overcome.” I see nothing  in his data to support this conclusion. The Palestinian experience has  shown that collectives can remain both a social and an economic  success over a long period. The success of Spanish collectivization,   \",\n",
       " '      ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   under war conditions, seems amazing. One can obviously not be cer¬  tain whether these successes could have been secured and extended  had it not been for the combined fascist, Communist, and liberal  attack, but I can find no objective basis for the almost universal  skepticism. Again, this seems to me merely a matter of irrational  prejudice.   107. The following is a brief description by the anarchist writer  Gaston Leval, Ne Franco , Ne Stalin, le collettivita anarchiche spagnole  nella lotta contro Franco e la reazione staliniana (Milan, Istituto Editor¬  ial Italiano, 1952), pp. 303 f.; sections reprinted in Collecttvites  anarchistes en Espagne revolutionmire, Noir et Rouge , undated.   In the middle of the month of June, the attack began in Aragon on  a grand scale and with hitherto unknown methods. The harvest was  approaching. Rifles in hand, treasury guards under Communist orders  stopped trucks loaded with provisions on the highways and brought  them to their offices. A little later, the same guards poured into the  collectives and confiscated great quantities of wheat under the authority  of the general staff with headquarters in Barbastro. . . . Later open  attacks began, under the command of Lister with troops withdrawn  from the front at Belchite more than 50 kilometers away, in the month  of August. ... The final result was that 30 percent of the collectives  were completely destroyed. In Alcolea, the municipal council that  governed the collective was arrested; the people who lived in the  Home for the Aged . . . were thrown out on the street. In Mas de las  Matas, in Monzon, in Barbastro, on all sides, there were arrests.  Plundering took place everywhere. The stores of the cooperatives and  their grain supplies were rifled; furnishings were destroyed. The  governor of Aragon, who was appointed by the central government  after the dissolution of the Council of Aragon—which appears to have  been the signal for the armed attack against the collectives—protested.  He was told to go to the devil.   On October 22, at the National Congress of Peasants, the delegation  of the Regional Committee of Aragon presented a report of which  the following is the summary:   “More than 600 organizers of collectives have been arrested. The  government has appointed management committees that seized the  warehouses and distributed their contents at random. Land, draught  animals, and tools were given to individual families or to the fascists  who had been spared by the revolution. The harvest was distributed in  the same way. The animals raised by the collectives suffered the same   ',\n",
       " '    Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   fate. A great number of collectivized pig farms, stables, and dairies  were destroyed. In certain communes, such as Bordon and Caiaceite  even seed was confiscated and the peasants are now unable to work    The estimate that 30% of the collectives were destroyed is consistent  with figures reported by Peirats (Los anarqmstas en la crisis politico  espanola, p. 300). He points out that only 200 delegates attended the  congress of collectives of Aragon in September 1937 (“held under the  shadow of the bayonets of the Eleventh Division” of Lister) as com¬  pared with 500 delegates at the congress of the preceding February  Peirats states that an army division of Catalan separatists and another  division of the PSUC also occupied parts of Aragon during this opera¬  tion, while three anarchist divisions remained at the front, under or¬  ders from the CNT-FAI leadership. Compare Jackson’s explanation of  the occupation of Aragon: “The peasants were known to hate the  Consejo, the anarchists had deserted the front during the Barcelona  fighting, and the very existence of the Consejo was a standing chal¬  lenge to the authority of the central government” (italics mine).   108. Regarding Bolloten’s work, Jackson has this to say: “Throughout  e present chapter, I have drawn heavily on this carefully docu¬  mented study of the Communist Party in 1936-37. It is unrivaled in its  coverage of the wartime press, of which Bolloten, himself a UP cor¬  respondent in Spain, made a large collection” (p. 363 n.).   109. See note 64. A number of citations from Berneri’s writings are  given by Brou4 and Temime. Morrow also presents several passages  from his journal, Guerra di Classe. A collection of his works would be  a very useful contribution to our understanding of the Spanish Civil  War and to the problems of revolutionary war in general.   110 . Cattell, op. at., p. 208.

Morrow (op. at p.  68 ) quotes James Minifie in the New York Herald Tribune, April 28.  1937 • «a reliable police force is being built up quietly but surely. The  Valencia government discovered an ideal instrument for this purpose  in the Carabineros. These were formerly customs officers and guards,  and always had a good reputation for loyalty. It is reported on good  authority that 40,000 have been recruited for this force, and that  20 000 have already been armed and equipped. . . . T e anarc is s  have already noticed and complained about the increased strengt o  this force at a time when we all know there’s little enough traffic  coming over the frontiers, land or sea.

A striking ex mp e  of the distortion introduced by the propaganda efforts of the 930s is  the strange story of the influential film The Spanish EarH,, filmed m  1937 by Joris Ivens with a text (written afterwards) by Hemmg y   a project that was apparently initiated by Dos Passos. A very revealing  account of this matter, and of the perception of the Clvl1 War ^  Hemingway and Dos Passos, is given in W. B. Watson and Barto  Whaley “The Spanish Earth of Dos Passos and Hemingway,” un¬  published, 1967. The film dealt with the collectivised village of Fuen-  tiduena in Valencia (a village collectivised by the UGT, incidental y).  For the libertarian Dos Passos, the revolution was the dominant    ',\n",
       " '   Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   theme, it was the antifascist war, however, that was to preoccupy  Hemingway. The role of Dos Passos was quickly forgotten, because of  the fact (as Watson and Whaley point out) that “Dos Passos had  become anathema to the Left for his criticisms of communist policies  in Spain.”   124. As far as the East is concerned, Rocker (The Tragedy of Spain,  p. 25) claims that “the Russian press, for reasons that are easily  understood, never uttered one least little word about the efforts of the  Spanish workers and peasants at social reconstruction.” I cannot  check the accuracy of this claim, but it would hardly be surprising if it  were correct.   125.

Jackson {op. cit.,  p. 256) refers to this matter, without noting that Texaco was violating  a prior agreement with the Republic. He states that the American  government could do nothing about this, since “oil was not considered  a war material under the Neutrality Act.” He does not point out,  however, that Robert Cuse, the Martin Company, and the Mexican  government were put under heavy pressure to withhold supplies from  the Republic,' although this too was quite legal. As noted, the Texaco  Company was never even branded “unethical” or “unpatriotic, these  epithets of Roosevelt’s being reserved for those who tried to assist the  Republic. The cynic might ask just why oil was excluded from the  Neutrality Act of January 1937, noting that while Germany and Italy  were capable of supplying arms to Franco, they could not meet his  demands for oil.   The Texaco Oil Company continued to act upon the pro-Nazi sym¬  pathies of its head, Captain Thorkild Rieber, until August 1940, when  the publicity began to be a threat to business. See Feis, op. cit., for  further details. For more on these matters, see Richard P. Trarna,  American Diplomacy and the Spanish Civil War (Bloomington, Indiana  University Press, 1968), pp. 166 f.   141. Puzzo, op. cit., p. 160. He remarks: “A government in Madrid in  which Socialists, Communists, and anarchists sat was not without  menace to American business interests both in Spain and Latin Amer¬  ica” (p. 165). Hull, incidentally, was in error about the acts of the  Spanish government. The irresponsible left-wing elements had not  been given arms but had seized them, thus preventing an immediate  Franco victory.   142. See Jackson, op. cit., p. 458.   143. Cf. Guttmann, op. cit., p. 197. Of course, American liberalism  was always proloyalist, and opposed both to Franco and to the revolu¬  tion. The attitude towards the latter is indicated with accuracy by this  comparison, noted by Guttmann, p. 165: “300 people met in Union   \",\n",

Ibid., p. 198.   145. To conclude these observations about the international reaction,  it should be noted that the Vatican recognized the Franco govern¬  ment de facto in August 1937 and de jure in May 1938. Immedi¬  ately upon Franco’s final victory, Pope Pius XII made the following  statement: “Peace and victory have been willed by God to Spain ...  which has now given to proselytes of the materialistic atheism of our  age the highest proof that above all things stands the eternal value of  religion and of the Spirit.” Of course, the position of the Catholic  Church has since undergone important shifts—-something that cannot  be said of the American government.   146.

J. Muste    insistent that pacifists “get our thinking focussed.” Their fore¬  most task “is to denounce the violence on which the present  system is based, and all the evil-material and spiritual-this  entails for the masses of men throughout the world. . . . So long  as we are not dealing honestly and adequately with this ninety  percent of our problem, there is something ludicrous, and per¬  haps hypocritical, about our concern over the ten percent of  violence employed by the rebels against oppression.” Never in  American history have these thoughts been so tragically appro-  priate as today.   The task of the revolutionary pacifist is spelled out more fully  in the final paragraph of the essay.   Those who can bring themselves to renounce wealth, position and  power accruing from a social system based on violence and put¬  ting a premium on acquisitiveness, and to identify themselves in  some real fashion with the struggle of the masses toward the  light may help in a measure—more, doubtless, by life than by  words-to devise a more excellent way, a technique of social  progress less crude, brutal, costly and slow than mankind has yet  evolved.   It is a remarkable tribute to A. J. Muste that his life’s work  can be measured by such standards as these. His essays ate  invariably thoughtful and provocative; his life, however, is an  inspiration with hardly a parallel in twentieth-century America.  Muste believed, with Gandhi, that “unjust laws and practices  survive because men obey them and conform to them. This they  do out of fear. There are things they dread more than the  continuance of the evil.” He enriched half a century of Ameri¬  can history with a personal commitment to these simple truths.  His efforts began in a time when “men believed that a better  human order, a classless and warless world, a socialist society, if  you please, could be achieved,” a time when the labor move-      *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   ment could be described as “that remarkable combination of  mass power, prophetic idealism and utopian hope.” They con¬  tinued through the general disillusionment of war and depres¬  sion and antiradical hysteria, to the days when American soci¬  ologists could proclaim that “the realization that escapes no one  is that the egalitarian and socially mobile society which the ‘free-  floating intellectuals’ associated with the Marxist tradition have  been calling for during the last hundred years has finally  emerged in the form of our cumbersome, bureaucratic mass  society, and has in turn engulfed the heretics.” 2 And finally, still  not “engulfed,” he persisted in his refusal to be one of the  obedient, docile men who are the terror of our time, to the  moment when our “egalitarian and socially mobile society” is  facing a virtual rebellion from the lower depths, when young-  men are being faced every day with the questions posed at  Nuremberg as their country devotes itself to enforcing the “sta¬  bility” of the graveyard and the bulldozed village, and when  the realization that escapes no one is that something is drasti¬  cally wrong in American society.   In one of his last published essays, Muste describes himself as  an “unrepentant unilateralist, on political as well as moral  grounds.” 3 In part, he bases his position on an absolute moral  commitment that one may accept or reject, but that cannot be  profitably debated. In part, he defends it on grounds that seem  to me not very persuasive, a psychological principle that “like  produces like, kindness provokes kindness,” hence an appeal to  \"the essential humanity of the enemy.” 4 It is very difficult to  retain a faith in the “essential humanity” of the SS trooper  or the commissar or the racist blinded with hate and fear, or,  for that matter, the insensate victim of a lifetime of anti-Com-  mumst indoctrination. When the enemy is a remote technician   programming B-52 raids or “pacification,” there is no possibility   ',\n",
       " '    The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste    for a human confrontation and the psychological basis for  nonviolent tactics, whatever it may be, simply evaporates.  A society that is capable of producing concepts like “un-  American” and “peacenik”—of turning “peace” into a dirty  word—has advanced a long way towards immunizing the indi¬  vidual against any human appeal. American society has reached  the stage of near total immersion in ideology. The commitment  has vanished from consciousness—what else can a right-think¬  ing person possibly believe? Americans are simply “pragmatic,”  and they must bring others to this happy state. Thus an official  of the Agency for International Development can write, with  no trace of irony, that our goal is to move nations “from doctri¬  naire reliance on state enterprise to a pragmatic support of  private initiative,” 5 and a headline in the New York Times can  refer to Indian capitulation to American demands concerning  the conditions of foreign investment as India’s “drift from so¬  cialism to pragmatism” (see page 355 below). With this narrow¬  ing of the range of the thinkable comes an inability to compre¬  hend how the weak and dispossessed can resist our benevolent  manipulation of their lives, an incapacity to react in human  terms to the misery that we impose.   The only useful way to evaluate the program of unilateral  revolutionary pacifism is to consider what it implies in concrete  historical circumstances. As a prescription for the United States  in the mid-sixties, it is much too easy to defend. There is no  particular merit in being more reasonable than a lunatic; corre¬  spondingly, almost any policy is more rational than one that  accepts repeated risk of nuclear war, hence a near guarantee of  nuclear war in the long run—a “long run” that is unlikely to be  very long, given the risks that policy makers are willing to  accept. Thus in the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy was willing  (according to Sorensen’s memoirs) to accept a probability of     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   y 3 to y 2 of nuclear war, in order to establish that the United  States alone has the right to maintain missiles on the borders of  a potential enemy . 6 And who knows what “probabilities the  CIA is now providing to the Rostows and the Wheelers who are  trying to save something from their Vietnam fiasco by bombing  at the Chinese border? Furthermore, it does not require an  unusual political intelligence to urge world-wide de-escalation  on the great power that by any objective standard is the most  aggressive in the world—as measured by the number of gov¬  ernments maintained by force or subverted by intrigue, by  troops and bases on foreign soil, by willingness to use the most  awesome “killing machine” in history to enforce its concept of  world order.   It would be more enlightening to consider the program of  revolutionary pacifism in the context of a decade ago, when  international gangsterism was more widely distributed, with the  British engaged in murderous repression in Kenya, the French  fighting the last of their dirty colonial wars, and the Soviet  Union consolidating its Eastern European empire with brutality  and deceit. But it is the international situation of December  1941 that provides the most severe test for Muste’s doctrine.  There is a great deal to be learned from a study of the events  that led up to an armed attack, by a competing imperialism, on  American possessions and the forces defending them, and even  more from a consideration of the varying reactions to these  events and their aftermath. If Muste’s revolutionary pacifism is  defensible as a general political program, then it must be defen¬  sible in these extreme circumstances. By arguing that it was,  Muste isolated himself not only from any mass base, but also  from all but a marginal fringe of American intellectuals.   Writing in 1941, Muste saw the war as    ',\n",
       " '    The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste    a conflict between two groups of powers for survival and domina¬  tion. One set of powers, which includes Britain and the Unite  States, and perhaps “free” France, controls some 70% of the  earth’s resources and thirty million square miles of territory, the  imperialistic Mm quo thus to their advantage was achieved by a  series of wars including the last one. All they ask now is to be left  at peace, and if so they are disposed to make their lule mil  though firm. ... On the other hand stands a group of powers such  as Germany, Italy, Hungary, Japan, controlling about 15% of  the earth’s resources and one million square miles of territory,  equally determined to alter the situation in their own favor to  impose their ideas of “order,\" and armed to the teeth to do that,  ninncrine the whole world into war.      He foresaw that an Allied victory would yield “a new American  empire” incorporating a subservient Britain, “that we shall be  the next nation to seek world domination-in other words, to do  what we condemn Hitler for trying to do.” In the disordered  postwar world, we shall be told, he predicts, that “our only  safety lies in making or keeping ourselves ‘impregnable.’ But  that . . . means being able to decide by preponderance of mili¬  tary might any international issue that may arise-which would  put us in the position in which Hitler is trying to put Germany.   In a later essay, he quotes this remark: “The problem after a  war is with the victor. He thinks he has just proved that war  and violence pay. Who will now teach him a lesson ?” 8   The prediction that the United States would emerge as the  world-dominant power was political realism; to forecast that it  would act accordingly, having achieved this status by force, was  no less realistic. This tragedy might be averted, Muste urge ,  by a serious attempt at peaceful reconciliation with no attempt  to fasten sole war-guilt on any nation, assurance to all peoples  of equitable access to markets and essential materials, arma¬  ment reduction, massive economic rehabilitation, and moves   towards international federation. To the American ideologist of   ',\n",
       " '     *- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   1941 such a recommendation seemed as senseless as the pro¬  posal, today, that we support popular revolution. And at that   moment, events and policy were taking a very different direc-  tion.   Since nothing of the sort was ever attempted, one can only  speculate as to the possible outcome of such a course The  accuracy of Muste’s forecast unfortunately requires little com¬  ment. Furthermore, a plausible case can be made for his analy¬  sis of the then existing situation, a matter of more than aca¬  demic interest in view of developments in Asia since that  time.   As I mentioned, the point of view that Muste expressed was a  rather isolated one. To see how little the intellectual climate has  changed, it is enough to consider the lengthy debate over the  decision to drop the bomb. What has been at issue is the ques¬  tion whether this constituted the last act of World War II or the  first phase of American postwar diplomacy; or whether it was  justified as a means of bringing the war to a quick conclusion.  Only rarely has the question been raised whether there was any  justification for American victory in the Pacific war; and this  issue, where faced at all, has been posed in the context of the  Cold War—that is, was it wise to have removed a counter¬  weight to growing Chinese power, soon to become “Commu-  nist” power?   A fairly typical American view is probably that expressed by  historian Louis Morton:   In the late summer and autumn of 1945 the American people had  every reason to rejoice. Germany and Japan had been defeated,  and American troops, victorious everywhere, would soon be re¬  turning home. Unprecedented evil had been overcome by the  greatest display of force ever marshaled in the cause of human  freedom. . , .»    ',\n",
       " '      The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   It is remarkable that such an attitude should be so blandly  expressed and easily accepted. Is it true that in August 1945 the  American people u had every reason to rejoice at the sight of a  Japanese countryside devastated by conventional bombing in  which tens of thousands of civilians had been massacred, not to  speak of the horrifying toll of two atom bombs (the second  being, so it appears, history’s most abominable experiment); or  at the news of a final gratuitous act of barbarism, trivial in the  context of what had just taken place, a thousand-plane raid  launched after the Japanese surrender had been announced but,  technically, before it was officially received? 10 To Secretary of  War Stimson it seemed “appalling that there had been no pro¬  test over the air strikes we were conducting against Japan  which led to such extraordinarily heavy losses of life”; he felt  that “there was something wrong with a country where no one  questioned that.” What then are we to say of a country that  still, twenty years later, is incapable of facing the question of  war guilt ?   It is not, of course, that the question of war guilt has gone  out of fashion. No trip to Germany is complete, even today,  without a ritual sigh and wringing of hands over the failure of  the German people to face up to the sins of the Nazi era, or the  German school texts which glide so easily over the Nazi atroci¬  ties and the question of war guilt. This is a sure sign of the  corruption of their nature. Just recently, a group of American  liberal intellectuals gave their impressions of a tour of West  Germany in the Atlantic Monthly (May 1967). None failed to  raise the question of war guilt. One comments that however  disparate our temperaments or our political emphases, we were  plainly a group made coherent by our shared suspicions of  Germany’s capacity for political health ... we had not forgot¬  ten, nor could we forget, that we were in the country which had          ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   been able to devise, and implement, Nazism.” The same com¬  mentator is impressed with the “dignity and fortitude” with  which young Germans “carry an emotional and moral burden  unmatched in history: they have to live with the knowledge  that their parent generation, and often their own parents, per¬  petrated the worst atrocities on the record of mankind.” An¬  other, a fervent apologist for the American war in Vietnam,  asks, “How does a human being ‘come to terms’ with the fact  that his father was a soulless murderer, or an accomplice to  soulless murder?” Several “were offended by the way the camp  [Dachau] had been fixed up, prettified.” (Does the “prettifica-  tion” of Hiroshima—or, to take a closer analogue, the prettifica-  tion of Los Alamos—provoke the same response?) To their  credit, a few refer to Vietnam; but not once is a question raised  —even to be dismissed—as to American conduct in the Second  World War, or the “emotional and moral burden” carried by  those whose “parent generation” stood by while two atom  bombs were used against a beaten and virtually defenseless  enemy.   To free ourselves from the conformism and moral blindness  that have become a national scandal, it is a good idea occasion¬  ally to read the measured reactions of conservative Asians to  some of our own exploits. Consider, for example, the words of  the Indian justice Radhabinod Pal, the leading Asian voice at  the Tokyo Tribunal that assessed the war guilt of the Japanese.  In his carefully argued (and largely ignored) dissenting opin¬  ion to the decision of the tribunal, he has the following remarks  to make:   The Kaiser Wilhelm II was credited with a letter to the Austrian  Kaiser Franz Joseph in the early days of that war, wherein he  stated as follows: “My soul is torn, but everything must be put to  fire and sword; men, women and children and old men must be   ',\n",

Wth these  methods of terrorism, which are alone capable of affectmg  people as degenerate as the French, the war will be over m tw  months, whereas if I admit considerations ofhumamty *-  prolonged for years. In spite of my repugnance I have  been obliged to choose the former system. . .   This showed his ruthless policy, and this policy of —  murder to shorten the war was considered to be a crime. In the  Pacific war under our consideration, if there was anything approach-  f„ g whaT is indicated in the above letter of the German Emperoriit  is the decision coming from the allied powers to  Future generations will judge this dire decision.

Nothin,,  like this could he traced to the credit of the present accused.   When we lament over the German conscience, we are de¬  manding of them a display of self-hatred-a good thmg, no  lubt. L for us the matter is infinitely more serious It is not a  matter of self-hatred regarding the sins of the past. Like the  SI Kaiser, we believe that everything must he put to fire  and sword, so that the war will be more quickly finished-and  we act on this belief. Unlike the German Kaiser, our soul is not  torn We manage a relative calm, as we continue today, to  write new chapters of history with the blood of the helpless and   innocent. 1fiQ     * AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   t0 MUSte ’ S radiCal PadfiSm in the of 1941   r a 1t at the first of hl , proposals ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ .   to fasten sole war-guilt on any nation.” The second was that   = b taken tQ assure tQ ^ ^ equjtaMe ^ to  arkets and essential materials.

A new plutoc¬  racy replaced the old feudal structure, adopting the forms of  p r.amentary government. Mass participation in the develop-  ng political structure was minimal; it is doubtful that the living  an ar s o t e peasantry and urban workers rose during the  period of transition from a medieval to a modern capitalist  ie y. Japan joined the other imperialist powers in the exploi-        The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste    tation of East Asia and took over Formosa, Korea, and parts of  southern Manchuria. In short, by the late 1920s, Japan was  what in modern political parlance is called a “democracy” and  was attempting to play the normal role of a great power.   A portent of danger lay in the virtual independence of the  armed forces from the civilian government. The “dual diplo¬  macy” to which this gave rise was shortly to have disastrous  consequences.   The great European war of 1914-1918 gave Japan an oppor¬  tunity to extend its “rights and interests” in China and provided  new markets for expanding Japanese industry. The revival of  European competition came as a severe blow, and postwar  diplomacy attempted vainly to construct a new and stable in¬  ternational system that would integrate Japan with the other  imperialist powers. In good faith, Japan accepted the subordi¬  nate role assigned it and consented, throughout the twenties, to  be a well-behaved member of the imperialist club. The Wash¬  ington Conference of 1921-1922 established the naval forces of  America, England, and Japan in the ratio of 5:5:3, accepting  the American position of “equality of security” rather than the  Japanese goal of “equality of armaments.” As Schroeder com¬  ments, “the American argument was that Japan, a state sur¬  rounded on all sides by historic enemies and powerful rivals,  had a superior natural situation for defense, while the United  States, in the midst of two oceans without a powerful enemy on  two continents, had defensively an inferior natural endow¬  ment.” 13   The Washington Conference arrangements were renegotiated  in the London Naval Treaty of 1930 involving Japan, Great  Britain, and the United States. The matter is discussed in detail  in a study by James Crowley. 14 In the negotiations leading to  this treaty, Secretary of State Stimson placed emphasis on “the    ',\n",
       " \"   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    'k=   unusual problems posed by the necessity of the United States to  defend two coastlines and on the ‘great concessions’ which the  American government had made at the time of the Washington  Conference.” Crowley points out that “throughout the 1920’s,  Japan faithfully adhered to the terms of the Washington Con¬  ference treaties.” At issue in the subsequent negotiations was  the question whether Japan could maintain its primary objec¬  tive: “supremacy over the American fleet in Japanese home  waters.” The London Treaty, in effect, required that Japan  abandon this objective. The London Treaty “did not render  England a second-class naval power, nor did it endanger the  safety of the United States or its insular possessions in the Pa¬  cific,” but it did compromise “the principle of Japanese naval  hegemony in Japan’s own waters.”   The domestic opposition to the treaty in Japan was a very  serious matter. It led to a strengthening of the role of the mili¬  tary, which felt, with reason, that the civilian leadership was  seriously endangering Japanese security. The treaty also evoked  the first of “the series of violent attacks on the legally appointed  leaders of Japan which would characterize the political history  of that country during the 1930’s” when Premier Hamaguchi,  who was responsible for the treaty, was shot by “a patriotic  youth” in 1930. An immediate consequence of the treaty was  the adoption by the opposition party of a platform insisting on  “the maintenance of Japan’s privileged position in Manchuria,  and a foreign policy which discounted the necessity of coopera¬  tion with the Anglo-American nations in defense of Japan’s  continental interests or in the cause of naval armament agree¬  ments.” In summary, it seems clear that the refusal of the  United States to grant to Japan hegemony in its waters (while  of course insisting on maintaining its own hegemony in the  Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific) was a significant con-    The Revolutionary Pacifism of A.

Muste    tributory cause to the crisis that was soon to erupt.   , In later years, the Japanese came to feel, with much justice,  that they had been hoodwinked more generally in the diplo¬  matic arrangements of the early 1920s, which “embodied the  idea that the Far East is essentially a place for the commercial  and financial activities of the Western peoples; and . . . empha¬  sized the importance of placing the signatory powers on an  equal footing, thus ignoring the desirability of providing special  relations between particular countries, especially between  Japan and China.” 15 A typical Japanese view of the situation  was expressed by a delegate to the 1925 conference of the Insti¬  tute of Pacific Relations (IPR): “Just as [Japan] was getting  really skillful at the game of the grab, the other Powers, most of  whom had all they wanted anyway, suddenly had an excess of  virtue and called the game off.” 16 A decade later, a delegate to  the 1936 IPR conference was to reiterate:   The Japanese feel that Western countries are unfair in imposing  the status quo on Japan and calling it “peace.” Their whole  conception of diplomatic machinery and collective security is that  it is simply a means to maintain that sort of peace, and to that  degree the Japanese people are against it. This doesn’t mean that  Japan would not participate in collective security if some ma-  chinery can be devised which provides for “peaceful change.” . . .  Japan has a legitimate desire to expand. What are the means by  which a nation can legitimately expand? Imperialistic advances  are apparently out of date, but this is not understood by the  Japanese people. The average reasoning of the Japanese people is  that Great Britain and the other Western powers have done it, so  why shouldn’t we? The problem is not so much to determine the  aggressor as to provide ample opportunities for the necessary  expansion peacefully . 17   Through the mid-1920s the Japanese were, generally, the  most sympathetic of the imperialist powers to the Kuomintang  in its attempt to unify China. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek stated   \",\n",
       " '   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    that the Japanese policy differed from the “oppressive” attitude  of Britain and the United States, and Eugene Ch’en, then a  high Kuomintang official, contrasted Japan’s nonparticipation in  the imperialist bombardment of Nanking to the “cruelty in¬  herent in the Western civilization”; this “indicated Japan’s  friendship for China.” The goal of Japanese diplomacy was to  strengthen the anti-Communist elements in the Kuomintang  and, at the same time, to support the rule of the warlord Chang  Tso-lin over an at least semi-independent Manchuria. At the  time, this seemed not totally unreasonable, although the legal  position of Japan was insecure and this policy was sure to come  into conflict with Chinese nationalism. According to one author¬  ity:   As of 1927 Manchuria was politically identifiable with China  only insofar as its overlord, Chang Tso-lin, was also commander-  in-chief of the anti-Kuomintang coalition controlling Peking. But  Chang’s economic and military base in the Three Eastern Prov¬  inces was entirely distinct from China, and in the past he had  occasionally proclaimed Manchuria’s independence. 18   To the extent that this assessment is accurate, Japanese diplo¬  macy was not unrealistic in aiming to prevent the growing na¬  tionalist movement in China from overwhelming Manchuria,  and at the same time to curb the ambitions of the Manchurian  warlord to take over all of China. This remained, in essence, the  goal of the Japanese civilian governments even through the  “Manchurian incident” of 1931-1932.   By 1931, it was becoming fairly clear that the relatively con¬  ciliatory diplomacy of the 1920s was unlikely to secure the  “rights and interests” regarded as essential for Japan’s continued  development. The effects of the great depression were immedi¬  ate and severe (see below). The London Treaty had failed to  provide Japan with military security vis a vis the other imperial-    The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. i. Muste    ist powers. Manchuria remained independent of the Kuo-  mintang, but Chinese Nationalist pressures for unification were  increasing. At the same time, the Soviet Union had significantly  expanded its military power on the Manchurian border, a fact  that could not fail to concern the Japanese military. Japan had a  substantial investment in the South Manchurian Railway and,  rightly or wrongly, regarded Manchuria as an extremely impor¬  tant potential source of desperately needed raw materials.  Large numbers of Japanese 19 as well as thousands of Korean  farmers encouraged by Japan had settled in Manchuria, inflam¬  ing Chinese nationalism and, simultaneously, deepening the  commitment of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria to “preserve  order.” The future of the South Manchurian Railway—and with  it, the associated investments as well as the welfare of the Japa¬  nese and Korean immigrants and residents—was very much in  doubt, as Chinese pressures mounted both inside Manchuria  and in Nationalist China. “Technically, under a 1905 protocol,  China was barred from building any railway lines parallel to  the South Manchurian Railway or from constructing any lines  which might endanger the commercial traffic along it,” 20 but  China was quite naturally disinclined to honor this provision,  and Japanese attempts to conduct discussions on railroad con¬  struction were frustrated, as the Kuomintang pursued its course  of attempting to incorporate Manchuria within China and to  eliminate Japanese influence, no doubt with the support of the  majority of the Manchurian population. A number of fairly  serious incidents of violence occurred involving Korean settlers  and the Japanese military. A Japanese officer was murdered in  the summer of 1931. In Shanghai, a boycott of Japanese goods  was initiated.   Under these conditions, debate intensified within Japan as to  whether its future lay in “the political leadership of an East Asia    ',\n",
       " '   + - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   power bloc” guaranteed by military force, or in continuing to  abide by “the new rules of diplomacy established by Occidental  and satiated powers/’ 21 The issue was resolved in September  1931, when Kwantung Army officers provoked a clash with  Chinese forces (the “Mukden incident”) and proceeded to take  full control of Manchuria. China, not unexpectedly, refused the  Japanese offers to negotiate, insisting that “evacuation is a pre¬  condition of direct negotiation.” 22 Exercising the right of “self-  defense” against Chinese “bandits,” the Kwantung Army  established control by force, and in August 1932 the Japanese  government, under strong military and popular pressure, recog¬  nized Manchuria as the new, “independent” state of Man-  chukuo, under the former Manchu emperor, Pu Yi. As Walter  Lippmann commented, the procedure of setting up “local Chi¬  nese governments which are dependent upon Japan” was “a  familiar one,” not unlike the American precedents “in Nic¬  aragua, Haiti, and elsewhere.” 23   The Manchurian events flowed over into China proper and  Japan itself, and caused an international crisis. The boycott in  Shanghai and a clash between Chinese troops and Japanese  marines near the Japanese sector of the international settlement  led to a retaliatory aerial bombardment by the Japanese. “This  indiscriminate use of air power against a small contingent of  Chinese soldiers dispersed among a congested civilian popula¬  tion generated a profound sense of shock and indignation in  England and the United States.” 24 In Japan, the Shanghai inci¬  dent was seen rather differently. The Japanese minister to  China at the time, Mamoru Shigemitsu, writes in his memoirs 25  that he was responsible for the request that the government  dispatch troops to Shanghai “to save the Japanese residents  from annihilation.” In his view, the thirty thousand Japanese    ',\n",
       " '    The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   settlers and the Japanese property in Shanghai were at the  mercy of the Chinese army, with its rather left-wing tendencies.  Furthermore, “Chinese Communists” were starting strikes m  Japanese-owned mills. For all of these reasons, Shigemitsu felt  justified in requesting troops, which “succeeded in dislodging  the Chinese forces from the Shanghai district and restoring law  and order”—a “familiar procedure,” as Lippmann rightly ob¬  served, and not without present-day parallels. 26   As far as Japan itself is concerned, the events of 1931-1932  were quite serious in their impact. According to the outstanding  Japanese political scientist Masao Maruyama, “the energy of  radical fascism stored up in the preparatory period now burst  forth in full concentration under the combined pressure of  domestic panic and international crises such as the Manchurian  Incident, the Shanghai Incident, and Japan’s withdrawal from  the League of Nations.” 27 Furthermore, “the issue of the in¬  fringement of the supreme command,” raised when the civilian  leadership had overruled the military leaders and m effect  capitulated to the West at the London Naval Conference, “was  a great stimulus to the fascist movement” (p. 81). In 1932 a  series of assassinations of important political figures (including  Prime Minister Inukai) contributed further to the decline of  civilian power and the strengthening of the hand of the mili¬  tary- .   The international reaction to these events was ambiguou .  The League of Nations sent a commission of inquiry, the  Lytton Commission, to investigate the Manchurian situation. Its  report rejected the Japanese position that Manchukuo should  be established as an independent state, and insisted on a loose  form of Chinese sovereignty, at which point Japan withdrew  from the League of Nations. The United States also found itself     *- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   somewhat isolated diplomatically, in that the harsh anti-Japa¬  nese position taken by Secretary of State Stimson received little  support from the other Western powers.   In a careful review of the point of view of the Lytton Com¬  mission, the Inukai government, and the central army authori¬  ties, Sadako Ogata demonstrates a considerable area of agree-  ment :   ... the central army authorities . . . insisted upon the creation of  a new local regime with authority to negotiate settlement of  Manchurian problems, but under the formal sovereignty of the  Chinese National Government, a traditional arrangement. This  was the arrangement that the world at large was willing to accept.  The Lytton Commission proposed the constitution of a special  regime for the administration of Manchuria possessed of a large  measure of autonomy but under Chinese jurisdiction. Finally  when the State of Manchukuo declared its independence, the  Government of Japan withheld formal recognition and thereby  attempted to avoid a head-on collision with the powers, which by  then had lined up behind the doctrine of non-recognition of  changes caused by Japanese military action in Manchuria. The  complete political reconstruction of Manchuria was achieved,  then, at the hands of the Kwantung Army in defiance of the  opposition of government and central military leaders. 28   The Lytton Commission report took cognizance of some of the  complexities in the situation. The report drew the following  conclusion:   This is not a case in which one country has declared war on  another country without previously exhausting the opportunities  for conciliation provided in the Covenant of the League of Na¬  tions. Neither is it a simple case of the violation of the frontier of  one country by the armed forces of a neighboring country, be¬  cause m Manchuria there are many features without an exact  parallel in other parts of the world.    ',\n",
       " '    The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste    The report went on to point out that the dispute arose in a  territory in which both China and Japan “claim to have rights  and interests, only some of which are clearly defined by inter  national law; a territory which, although legally an integral par  of China, had a sufficiently autonomous character to carry out  direct negotiations with Japan on the matters which lay at the  roots of this conflict .” 29   It is an open question whether a more conciliatory American  diplomacy that took into account some of the real problems  faced by Japan might have helped the civilian government  (backed by the central army authorities) to prevail over the  independent initiative of the Kwantung Army, which ultimately  succeeded in bringing the Japanese government to recognize  the fait accompli of a Manchukuo that was more a puppet of  the Kwantung Army than of Japan proper. #   In any event, the success of the Kwantung Army in enforcing  its conception of the status of Manchuria set Japan and the  United States on a collision course. Japan turned to an inde¬  pendent diplomacy\" and reliance on force to achieve \\'ts objec¬  tives. The Japanese position of the mid-thirties is described as  follows by Royama. Japan s aim is    not to conquer China, or to take any territory from her, but  instead to create jointly with China and Manchukuo a new order  comprising the three independent states. In accordance with this  programme, East Asia is to become a vast self-sustammg region  where Japan will acquire economic security and immunity from  such trade boycotts as she has been experiencing at the hands      This policy was in conflict with Chinese nationalism and with  tv,o lnno-term insistence of the United States on the Open oor    policy in China.

       " '   ★- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   From 1928 there had been an increasing divergence between  the policies of the civilian Japanese governments, which at¬  tempted to play the game of international politics in accordance  with the rules set by the dominant imperialist powers, and the  Kwantung Army, which regarded these rules as unfair to Japan  and was also dissatisfied with the injustice of domestic Japanese  society. The independent initiative of the Kwantung Army was  argely that of the young officers of petit-bourgeois origin who  felt that they represented as well the interests of the soldiers  predominantly of peasant stock. “The Manchurian affair consti¬  tutes an external expression of the radical reform movement  that was originally inspired by Kita and Okawa,”« who had  developed the view that Japan represented an “international  proletariat,” with an emancipating mission for the Asian masses,  and who opposed the obvious inequities of modern capitalism!  The fundamental law proposed for Manchukuo, in 1932, pro¬  tected the people from “usury, excessive profit, and all other  unjust economic pressure.” As Ogata notes,\" the fundamental  law . showed the attempt to forestall the modern forms of eco¬  nomic injustice caused by capitalism.” In Japan itself, this pro¬  gram appealed to the Social Democrats, who blamed “Chinese  warlords and selfish Japanese capitalists for the difficulties in  [Manchuria]” and who demanded “the creation of a socialistic  system in Manchuria, one that would benefit ‘both Chinese and  Japanese living in Manchuria.’ ” 33   Ogata cites a great deal of evidence to support the conclusion  that the Kwantung Army never expected to establish Japanese  supremacy, but rather proposed to leave “wide discretion to the  local self-governing Chinese bodies, and intended neither the  disruption of the daily lives of the Manchurian people nor their  assimilation into Japanese culture” (p. 182). The program for  autonomy was apparently influenced by and attempted to in-      The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   corporate certain indigenous Chinese moves towards autonomy.  “In the period immediately preceding the Manchurian Affair, a  group of Chinese under the leadership of Chang Ku also at¬  tempted to create an autonomous Manchuria based on coopera¬  tion of its six largest ethnic groups (Japanese, Chinese,  Russians, Mongolians, Koreans, and Manchurians) in order to  protect the area from Japanese, Chinese and Soviet encroach¬  ment” (p. 40). The governing bodies set up by the Kwantung  Army   were led by prominent Chinese with Japanese support. Reorgani¬  zation of local administrative organs was undertaken by utilizing  the traditional self-governing bodies. ... Yu Chung-han, a prom¬  inent elder statesman of the Mukden Government, ... was . . .  installed as chief of the Self-Government Guiding Board on No¬  vember 10. Yu had been the leader of the civilian group in  Manchuria which, in contrast to the warlords, had held to the  principle of absolute hokyo anmin (secure boundary and peace¬  ful life). According to him, the protection and prosperity of the  Northeastern Provinces assumed priority over all, including the  relationship with China proper. Through tax reform, improve¬  ment of the wage system of government officials, and abolition of  a costly army, the people in Manchuria were to enjoy the benefits  of peaceful labor, while defense was to be entrusted to their most  powerful neighbor, Japan. [Pp. 118-19]   In general, the Kwantung Army regarded the thirty million  people of Manchuria—half of whom had immigrated since the  initiation of Japanese development efforts a quarter of a cen¬  tury earlier—as “suffering masses who had been sacrificed to  the misrule of warlords and the avarice of wicked officials,  masses deriving no benefits of civilization despite the natural  abundance of the region .” 34 Furthermore, the Army regarded  Manchuria as “the fortress against Russian southern advance¬  ment, which became increasingly threatening as Soviet influ¬  ence over the Chinese revolution became more and more ap-       ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   parent.” 35 With many Japanese civilians, it felt that “Under the  leadership of Chiang Kai-shek and with the support of the  Western democratic powers which wanted to keep China in a  semi-colonial state safe from the continental advance of the  Japanese, China was rapidly becoming a military-fascist coun¬  try” 36 and had no right to dominate Manchuria. To use the  kind of terminology favored by Secretary Rusk, it was unwilling  to sacrifice the Manchurian people to their more powerful or  better organized neighbors, and it engaged in serious efforts to  win the hearts and minds of the people and to encourage the  responsible Chinese leadership that had itself been working for  Manchurian independence 37   In fact, a case can be made that “had it not been for Western  intervention, which strengthened China, the Tibetans and  Mongols would have simply resumed their own national sov¬  ereignty after the fall of the Manchu empire” in 1911, as would  the Manchurians. With considerable Western prodding, the Na¬  tionalist government had abandoned the original demand for  union with equality of Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Moslems,  and Tibetans and taken the position that China should rule the  outer dominions. The West assumed that China would be under  Western guidance and influence; “by confirming a maximum  area for China it increased the sphere of future Western in-  vestment and exploitation’* (a fact which adds a touch of  irony to current Western complaints about “Chinese expansion¬  ism”). From this point of view, the independence of Man-  chukuo could easily be rationalized as a step towards the  emancipation of the peoples of East Asia from Western domi  nance.   To be sure, the establishment of Japanese hegemony over  Manchuria—and later, northern China as well—was motivated  by the desire to secure Japanese rights and interests. A liberal    ',\n",
       " '  The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   professor of American history, Yasaka Takagi, observes that the  general support for the Japanese military in 1931 was similar to  the Manifest Destiny psychology underlying American expan¬  sion into Florida, Texas, California, Cuba, and Hawaii. 39 He  describes the bandit-infested, warlord-controlled Manchurian  region, then subject to the clash of expansionist Chinese Na¬  tionalism and Japanese imperialism, as similar to the Caribbean  when the United States justified its Caribbean policy. He asks  why there should be a Monroe Doctrine in America and an  Open Door principle in Asia, and suggests an international con¬  ference to resolve the outstanding problems of the area, noting,  however, that few Americans would “entertain even for a mo¬  ment the idea of letting an international conference define the  Monroe Doctrine and review Mexican relations.” He points out,  quite correctly, that “the peace machinery of the world is in  itself primarily the creation of the dominant races of the earth,  of those who are the greatest beneficiaries from the mainte¬  nance of the status quo ”   Nevertheless, it appears that few Japanese were willing to  justify the Manchurian incident and subsequent events on the  pragmatic grounds of self-interest. Rather, they emphasized  the high moral character of the intervention, the benefits it  would bring to the suffering masses (once the terrorism had  been suppressed), and the intention of establishing an “earthly  paradise” in the independent state of Manchukuo (later, in  China as well), defended from Communist attack by the power  of Japan. Maruyama observes that “what our wartime leaders  accomplished by their moralizing was not simply to deceive the  people of Japan or of the world; more than anyone else they  deceived themselves.” 40 To illustrate, he quotes the observa¬  tions of American Ambassador Joseph Grew on the “self-decep¬  tion and lack of realism” in the upper strata of Japanese society:      ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   ... I doubt if one Japanese in a hundred really believes that they  have actually broken the Kellogg Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty,  and the Covenant of the League. A comparatively few thinking  men are capable of frankly facing the facts, and one Japanese  said to me: “Yes, we’ve broken every one of these instruments;  we’ve waged open war; the arguments of ‘self-defense’ and ‘self-  determination for Manchuria’ are rot; but we needed Manchuria,  and that’s that.” But such men are in the minority. The great  majority of Japanese are astonishingly capable of really fooling  themselves. ... It isn’t that the Japanese necessarily has his  tongue in his cheek when he signs the obligation. It merely means  that when the obligation runs counter to his own interests, as he  conceives them, he will interpret the obligation to suit himself  and, according to his own lights and mentality, he will very likely  be perfectly honest in so doing. . . . Such a mentality is a great  deal harder to deal with than a mentality which, however brazen,  knows that it is in the wrong.   In this respect, the analogy to current American behavior in  Asia fails; more than one American in a hundred understands  that we have actually violated our commitments, not only at  Geneva but, more importantly, to the United Nations Charter.  However, the general observation remains quite valid in the  changed circumstances of today. It is very difficult to deal with  the mentality that reinterprets obligations to suit self-interest,  and may very well be perfectly honest-in some curious sense  of the word—in so doing.   Alongside of those who justified the Manchurian intervention  on the pragmatic grounds of self-interest, those who spoke of a  new Monroe Doctrine “to maintain the peace of East Asia,” and  those who fantasied about an “earthly paradise,” 41 there were  also dissident voices that questioned Japanese policy m a more  fundamental way. As the military extended its power, dissidents  were attacked—both verbally and physically—for their betrayal  of Japan. In 1936, for example, the printing presses of the    ',\n",

In 1928, American consuls  supported the dispatch of Japanese troops; one reported that  their arrival “has brought a feeling of relief . . . even among  c inese, especially those of the substantial class.” 48 The busi  ness community remained relatively pro-Japanese even after  Japanese actions in Manchuria and Shanghai in 1931-1932 ■ “in  general, it was felt that the Japanese were fighting the battle of  all foreigners against the Chinese who wished to destroy foreign  rights and privileges . . . that if the organizing abilities of the  Japanese were turned loose in China, it might be a good thing  for everybody.” 49 Ambassador Grew, on November 20, 1937  entered m his diary a note that the MacMurray Memorandum’  just circulated by one of the main American spokesmen on Far  Eastern affairs, “would serve to relieve many of our fellow  countrymen of the generally accepted theory that Japan has  een a ig bully and China the downtrodden victim ” m Com¬  monly the American attitude remained that expressed by Am-     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   bassador Nelson Johnson, who argued that the American inter¬  est dictated that we be neither pro-Chinese nor pro-Japanese  but rather “must have a single eye to the . . . effect of devel¬  opments in the East . . . upon the future interests of America,  namely, “the fact that the great population of Asia oSers a  valuable outlet for the products of our industries and that as  our industries develop we will be more and more intereste in  cultivating an outlet for them”. 61 Also typical is his explanation  of the attitude we should adopt “toward these oriental peoples  for whose future we became responsible.” What we make o  them will be “peculiarly the product of American idealism ; m  their future “we shall continue to be interested as a father must  be interested in the career of his son long after the son has left  the family nest.” 52 He was concerned, in fact, that native Amer¬  ican altruism would be too predominant in our treatment of our  Asian wards, and hoped rather that the “new period of Ameri¬  can international relations” would be “characterized by the  acquisitive, practical side of American life rather than its ideal¬    istic and altruistic side. . ,   As late as 1939 Ambassador Grew, speaking in Tokyo, de¬  scribed the American objection to the New Order as based on  the fact that it included “depriving Americans of their ong-  established rights in China” and imposing “a system of closed  economy.” Critics noted that nothing was said about the inde¬  pendence of China, and that it might well appear, from his  remarks, that “if the Japanese stopped taking actions that in¬  fringed on American rights the United States would not object  to their continued occupation of China.” 52 In the fall of 1939  Secretary of State Hull refused to negotiate a new commercial  treaty with Japan or arrive at a modus vivendt “unless Japan  completely changed her attitude and practice towards our  rights and interests in China.” 51 Had this condition been met,    ',\n",

The report o  the Banff conference of August 1933 noted that “the Indian  Government, in an attempt to foster its own cotton industry  imposed an almost prohibitive tariff on imported cotton goods  the effects of which were of course felt chiefly by Japanese  traders, whose markets in India had been growing rapidly  “Japan, which is a rapidly growing industrial nation, has a spe¬  cial need for . . .

In 1932, Japanese exports of cotton piece-goods for Ae  first time exceeded those of Great Britain. The Indian tariff  mentioned above, was 75 percent on Japanese cotton goods an  25 percent on British goods. The Ottawa conference of 1932  effectively blocked Japanese trade with the Commonwealth in¬  cluding India. As the IPR conference report noted, “Ottawa ha   dealt a blow to Japanese liberalism.”   The Ottawa Commonwealth arrangements aime a  structing an essentially closed, autarchic system; the contem¬  porary American policy of self-sufficiency proceeded m a similar  direction. The only recourse available to Japan was to try to  mimic this behavior in Manchuria. Liberalism was all very w  when Britannia ruled the waves, but not when Lancashire m-    ',\n",

The most secure markets were  C which Japan could control politically; an argument for  further political expansion . . . against an iron ring  It is hardly astonishing, then, that in 1937 Japan again began to  expand at the expense of China.

Japan demands that China, in accordance with the principle  of equality between the two countries, should recogmze the free¬  dom of residence and trade on the part of Japanese isubjects m  . • t Vr nf China with a view to promoting the economic  L ” r wh DeoDles; and that, in the light of the historical    ',\n",
       " '   The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   and economic relations between the two nations, China should  extend to Japan facilities for the development of China’s natural  resources, especially in the regions of North China and Inner  Mongolia . 68   There were to be no annexations, no indemnities. Thus a new  order was to be established, which would defend China and  Japan against Western imperialism, unequal treaties, and ex¬  traterritoriality. Its goal was not enrichment of Japan, but  rather cooperation (on Japanese terms, of course). Japan would  provide capital and technical assistance; at the same time, it  would succeed in freeing itself from dependence on the West  for strategic raw materials.   Japanese leaders repeatedly made clear that they intended no  territorial aggrandizement. To use the contemporary idiom,  they emphasized that their actions were “not intended as a  threat to China” and that “China knows that Japan does not  want a wider war,” although, of course, they would “do every¬  thing they can to protect the men they have there.” 67 They  were quite willing to negotiate with the recalcitrant Chinese  authorities, and even sought third-power intervention. 68 Such  Japanese leaders as Tojo and Matsuoka emphasized that no  one, surely, could accuse Japan of seeking mere economic gain.  In fact, she was spending more on the war in China than she  could possibly gain in return. Japan was “paying the price that  leadership of Asia demands,” they said, attempting “to prevent  Asia from becoming another Africa and to preserve China from  Communism.” 69 The latter was a particularly critical matter.  “The Japanese felt that the United Front and the Sino-Soviet  pact of 1937 were steps toward the destruction of Nationalist  China and the Bolshevization of East Asia.” 70 The Japanese  were, furthermore, quite willing to withdraw their troops once    ',\n",
       " '  + ..- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   the “illegal acts” by Communists and other lawless elements  were terminated, 71 and the safety and rights of Japanese and  Korean residents in China guaranteed.   Such terminology was drawn directly from the lexicon of  Western diplomacy. For example, Secretary of State Kellogg  had stated United States government policy as: “to require  China to perform the obligations of a sovereign state in the  protection of foreign citizens and their property” (September 2,  1925). The Washington Treaty powers were “prepared to con¬  sider the Chinese government’s proposal for the modification of  existing treaties in measure as the Chinese authorities demon¬  strated their willingness and ability to fulfill their obligations  and to assume the protection of foreign rights and interests now  safeguarded by the exceptional provisions of those treaties,”  and admonished China of “the necessity of giving concrete evi¬  dence of its ability and willingness to enforce respect for the  safety of foreign lives and property and to suppress disorders  and anti-foreign agitations” as a precondition for the carrying  on of negotiations over the unequal treaties (notes of Septem¬  ber 4, 19 2 5). 72 Because of this “inability and unwillingness,”  “none of the Treaty of Washington signatories gave effect to the  treaty with respect to extra-territorial rights, intervening in in¬  ternal Chinese affairs, tariffs, courts, etc., on grounds that their  interests were prejudiced by lawlessness and the ineffectiveness  of the government of China.” 73   In 1940, Japan established a puppet government in Nanking  under the leadership of Wang Ching-wei, who had been a  leading disciple of Sun Yat-sen and, through the 1930s, a major  figure in the Kuomintang. Its attempt to establish order in  China was vain, however, as the United Front continued to  res i s t—in the Japanese view, solely because of outside assist¬  ance from the Western imperialist powers. Japan was bogged    ',\n",
       " \"   The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   down in an unwinnable war on the Asian mainland. The policy  of “crushing blow—generous peace” was failing, because of the  foreign support for the “local authority” of Chiang Kai-shek,  while Japan’s real enemy, the Soviet Union, was expanding its  economic and military power. 74 How familiar it all sounds.   With all of the talk about benevolence and generosity, it is  doubtful that Japanese spokesmen ever surpassed the level of  fatuity that characterizes much of American scholarship, which  often seems mired in the rhetoric of a Fourth of July address.  For example, Willard Thorp describes American policy in these  terms: “. . . we do not believe in exploitation, piracy, imperial¬  ism or war-mongering. In fact, we have used our wealth to help  other countries and our military strength to defend the inde¬  pendence of small nations” 75 (in the manner indicated in note  62, for example). Many similar remarks might be cited, but it is  depressing to continue.   A wave of revulsion swept through the world as the brutality  of the Japanese attack on China became known. When notified  of the intention of the Japanese government to bomb Nanking,  the United States responded as follows: “The Government is of  the opinion that any bombardment of an extensive zone con¬  taining a sizeable population engaged in their peaceful pursuits  is inadmissible and runs counter to the principles of law and  humanity.” 76 Now that these principles have been repealed, it  is difficult to recapture the feeling of horror at the events them¬  selves and of contempt for those who had perpetrated them.  For an American today to describe these events in the manner  they deserve would be the ultimate in hypocrisy. For this rea¬  son I will say very little about them.   In Manchuria, the Japanese conducted a fairly successful  counterinsurgency operation, beginning in 1931. 77 The record  is instructive. In 1932,     ★- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   the insurgents who menaced the people and obstructed the at¬  tainment of wangtao [the perfect way of the ancient kings, or the  kingly way] had at one point reached 300,000, but the earnest  and brave efforts of various subjugating agencies headed by the  Japanese army brought about great results. Thus the number of  insurgents declined from 120,000 in 1933, to 50,000 in 1934;  40,000 in 1935; 30,000 in 1936; and 20,000 in 1937. As of  September, 1938, the number of insurgents is estimated at 10,000. 78   The success was achieved in part by contingents of Japanese  troops, in part by the national army of Manchukuo, and in part  by the police. “Because of the success of these activities [which  led to the winning of the support of the masses], the insurgent  groups are now in an extremely precarious condition and the  attainment of peace seems to be in sight.” The “native bandits”  and “rebellious troops from the local armies” had been ab¬  sorbed by the Chinese Communist party during this period, and  were, by 1938, “under the Communist hegemony operating  with the slogan of 'Oppose Manchukuo and Resist Japan,’ ”  with political leadership supplied from China. The goal of the  insurgents was “to destroy the government’s pacification efforts”  and to win public confidence and disturb public opinion “by  opposing Manchukuo and Japan and espousing Communism.  Their efforts lead the masses astray on various matters and  significantly hamper the development of natural resources and  the improvement of the people’s livelihood.” Through a combi¬  nation of pacification and propaganda activities, their efforts  were being countered and, the report continues, the “nation’s  economy and culture” preserved.   The report emphasizes the strong distaste of the authorities  for forceful means :   The use of military force against the insurgents is the principal  means of attaining peace and order, in that it will directly reduce  the number of insurgents. But this method is to be used only as a   \",\n",
       " '   The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   last resort; it is not a method that is compatible with our nation’s  philosophy, which is the realization of the kingly way ( wangtao ),  The most appropriate means suitable for a righteous government  is that of liberating the masses from old notions implanted by a  long period of exploitative rule by military cliques and feudalistic  habits and of dispelling the illusions created by Communist ideol¬  ogy. Furthermore, the philosophy of the state calls for a proper  understanding by the masses of the true nature of righteous gov¬  ernment, the reasons behind the establishment of the state, and  the current state of affairs. The insurgents should be given an  opportunity to alter their misconceived notions and to become  good citizens. This is why the operation for the inducement of  surrender has such grave significance.   A continuing problem was the “nearly universal phenomenon in  Manchuria that the insurgent groups return to their original  state of operation as soon as the subjugation period is termi¬  nated and troops are withdrawn.” 79 To counter this tendency, a  number of methods were used, with considerable success.  Communist groups were heavily infiltrated and alienation was  created within the guerrilla groups. The formerly anti-Japanese  Korean community was won over by “sociopolitical and accom¬  panying psychological changes” (“revolutionary development,”  in modern phraseology), specifically, by offering them “the pos¬  sibility of owning land and escaping from the control of their  Chinese landlords” (Lee, p. 23). Among the Chinese, the situa¬  tion was different, and more difficult.   Through propaganda and example, the guerrillas awakened the  patriotism of the people and convinced them that the guerrillas  were the only true defenders of their interests. When necessary,  the guerrillas terrorized the reluctant elements as a warning to  others. An intricate network of anti-Japanese societies, peasant  societies, and the like provided the guerrillas both with the neces¬  sary supplies and with vital intelligence. Farmers who were  located in regions too remote to be protected by the Manchukuo  authorities and the Japanese were forced to comply with the   ',\n",
       " '  *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   guerrillas’ demands, even if they had no desire to assist the in¬  surgent cause. [Lee, p. 25]   The obvious answer to this problem was a system of “col¬  lective hamlets.” By the end of 1937, the Police Affairs Head¬  quarters reported that over 10,000 hamlets had been organized  accommodating 5,500,000 people. The collective hamlets, Lee  informs us, were set up with considerable ruthlessness.   Families were ordered to move from their farm homes with little  or no notice, even if the collective hamlets were not ready. Some  farmers were forced to move just before the sowing season, mak¬  ing it impossible for them to plant any seeds that year, while  others were ordered to move just before harvest. Many farm¬  houses seem to have been destroyed by troops engaged in mop-up  operations before preparations had been made for the farmers’  relocation. The only concern of the military was to cut off the  guerrillas’ sources of food supply and their contacts with the  farmers. [Pp. 26 f.]   There is no point in supplying further details, which will be  familiar to anyone who has been reading the American press  since 1962.   The collective-hamlet program was fairly successful, though  it was necessary to prevent insurgents from “assaulting the  weakly protected collective hamlets and . . . plundering food  and grain” and to prevent infiltration. According to a report in  1939, many of the residents of the hamlets continued to “sym¬  pathize with Communism and secretly plan to join the insur¬  gents,” and the Communists continued to exploit the farmers’  grievances with skill (Lee, pp. 33 f.). Vice-Governor Itagaki  formulated the problem succinctly: “We are not afraid of  Communist propaganda; but we are worried because the mate¬  rial for propaganda can be found in the farmers’ lives. We are  not afraid of the ignition of fire; rather we are afraid of the  seeping oil” (p. 34).   ',\n",

       " '   The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste    The Japanese undertook a number of what are now called  “population control methods,” including registration of resi-  dents, issuance of residence certificates, unscheduled searches,  and so on. 80 They also made use of the method of reward and  punishment recommended by more recent theorists of pacifica¬  tion (see Lee, pp. 39-40) 81 The Japanese understood that “it was  totally unrealistic to expect reforms or innovations to be ini¬  tiated by those who were already well off” and therefore re¬  placed the former “local gentry” by “young and capable ad¬  ministrative personnel” who were “trained to assist the local  administrators through the Hsueh-ho-hui, the government- ‘  sponsored organization to recruit mass support for the Man-  chukuo regime” (p. 46). Many abuses at the village level were  also eliminated, in an attempt to wean the villagers from their  traditional belief that the government is merely an agency of  exploitation. Extensive propaganda efforts were conducted to  win the hearts and minds of the villagers (cf. pp. SS f.). In  comparison with American efforts at pacification, the Japanese  appear to have achieved considerable success—if these docu¬  ments can be believed—in part, apparently, because Japan was  not committed to guaranteeing the persistence of the old semi-  feudal order and was less solicitous of property rights. The  reports indicate that by 1940, the Communist guerrillas had  been virtually exterminated in Manchuria.   A secret report of the office of information of the government  of Manchukuo in April 1939 describes the achievements of  pacification in Tunghwa Province in glowing terms :   It must be said that the economic and spiritual impact of the  reconstruction activities on the citizens of the province has been  very uplifting. We have observed an increase in the areas under  cultivation as a result of the recovery of abandoned lands; an  increase in agricultural production owing to improvements in     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    seeds; an increase of farmers’ cash incomes as a result of im¬  provement in market facilities; remarkable progress among mer¬  chants and industrialists assisted by government loans; and the  winning of public support through medical treatment and the  administration of medicine. 82   A secret report of November 1939 describes the situation in a  province where “revolutionary development” was not yet quite  so successful and insurgents still operated:   . . . most atrociously, these insurgents pillage goods, and kill and  wound men and animals. They are also systematically conducting  Communist indoctrination operations in various villages. As a  result, many villagers are led astray by the insurgents’ propa¬  ganda and begin to work for the insurgents, passively or politi¬  cally. All this adds to the burden carried by the pacification  forces. 83   Farmers were fleeing from “insurgent-infested areas in a con¬  tinuous stream,” though some continued to “sympathize with  Communism.” However, plans were being laid to “establish con¬  fidence” and destroy insurgent forces, to carry out “relief of  afflicted people,” and, in general, to extend the work of nation  building.   I have no knowledge of the reaction in Japan to whatever  information was transmitted to the public about these matters.  No doubt, many Japanese deplored the excesses of the pacifica¬  tion program, though the more reasonable presumably con¬  tinued to discuss the situation in balanced and unemotional  terms, taking note of the violence carried out on both sides. If  there were vocal advocates of Japanese withdrawal from Man¬  churia, they could be shown reports of the sort just quoted, and  warned of the atrocities that would be sure to follow were  Japanese troops to be removed and the Communist guerrillas  given a free hand. Obviously, regardless of cost, the Japanese  must continue to use limited means to secure law and order and  ',\n",
       " '  The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   to permit the responsible elements of Manchurian society to  build an independent nation free from externally directed ter-  ror.   No one hated the necessary violence of pacification more  than the Japanese officers in charge. Vice-Governor Itagaki de¬  scribed the moral dilemma that they faced in moving words:   The construction of the defense hamlets must be enforced—with  tears. We issue small subsidy funds and severe orders [to the  farmers], telling them to move to a designated location by such  and such a date and that this is the last order. But it is too  miserable [to watch] the farmers destroying their accustomed  houses, and [to see] little innocent babies wrapped in rags and  smiling on carts that are carrying the household goods away. A  few days ago, a girl of sixteen or seventeen made me weep by  coming to my office at the prefectural government and kneeling  down to beg me to spare her house. She said, “Do we really have  to tear down our house, councilor?” She had walked a long way  to town thinking, “If I asked the councilor, something could be  done.” Watching the bony back of the little girl who was quietly ij  led out by the office boy, I closed my eyes and told myself, “You  will go to hell.” The hardship of the Japanese police officers at the  forefront who have to guide the coercive operation directly is be¬  yond imagination. I was told many times while I was on my in¬  spection tours of the front, “I cannot go on with this kind of  wretched work. I will quit and go home.” These words, uttered  [as we sat] around a lamp sipping kaoliang gin, sounded as though  someone was spitting blood. In each case we had to console and  keep telling each other that this was the last hill that needed to be ‘  conquered. The program was forced through mercilessly, inhu¬  manely, without emotion—as if driving a horse. As a result, more  than 100 defense hamlets were constructed throughout the pre¬  fecture. These were built with blood, tears, and sweat. 8 *   In Manchuria, the problem of the terrorists and Communist  bandits seems to have been solved by 1940. In China itself,  pacification continued throughout the Pacific war. Chalmers  Johnson summarizes these efforts briefly in a recent study. 85 In    ',\n",
       " '   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    both north and central China “the Japanese suffered from guer¬  rilla attacks and from their inability to distinguish a guerrilla  from a villager/’ In the north the policy implemented was “the  physical destruction of all life and property in an area where  guerrillas were thought to exist . . . whereas in central China a  policy of establishing so-called Model Peace Zones was pursued  [consisting] of expelling the Communists from certain very  rich agricultural areas and then, following this military phase,  of integrating the cleared area into the Japanese satellite econ¬  omy.” The latter policy was far more successful, and it was  possible to place the government in Chinese hands. There was  also a “strategic hamlet” program, described in the following  terms in a recent Japanese commentary:   ... the Japanese Army tried its “Chinghsiang” (Clean Hamlet)  operations in Soochow in Central China and its ‘ Ailutsun  (Railway Defense Village) program in Shangtung Province in  North China. ... The concept of “Chinghsiang” lies in making  the village or hamlet the basis for reforming government at the  grass-root level; and, by concentrating all military, political, eco¬  nomic and ideological effort on a single village, in building it up  into a peaceful, stabilized and secure area; then by using this  village as a model district, in gradually extending security and  stability to cover the whole “hsien” (county), the whole province  and eventually the whole country . 86   However, external interference made it impossible to carry  through this program. With far greater power to enforce their  efforts and a much smaller and weaker enemy, American politi¬  cal scientists were not unreasonable in looking forward to  greater success.   So events proceeded through the terrifying decade of the  1930s. Seeking desperately for allies, Japan joined with Ger¬  many and Italy in the Tripartite Pact at a moment when Ger¬  many appeared invincible. With the termination of the Japa-   ',\n",
       " '   The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J.

The expiration of t  treaty was the turning point that\\'led many moderates towards  support for the Axis powers. 87   In July 1940, the United States placed an embargo on avi -  tion fuel, which Japan could obtain from no other source mi  in September, a total embargo on scrap iron. Meanwhil Imer-  ican aid to China was increasing. In September, the P  Pact was signed, and Japanese troops entered northern Ind -  china The goals were basically two: to block the flow of sup¬  plies to Chiang Kai-shek and to take steps towards  of petroleum from the Dutch East Indies On July 2 1941, a  decision was made to move troops to southern Indochina. The  decision was known to the American government, since the  Japanese diplomatic code had been broken. On July 24 Presi  dent Roosevelt informed the Japanese ambassador that if Japan  would refrain from this step, he would use his influence  achieve the neutralization of Indochina. This message did not  reach the Japanese Foreign Ministry until July 27. On J»j^>  Japan announced publicly its plans to move troops to southern  Indochina and the United States government ordered all Jap -  nese assets in the United States to be frozen.-\\' *   total embargo of oil was announced by the United States. At  to point, “Japan was denied access to all the vitally needed   supplies outside her own control. 90 . .   What slender hope there now remained to avoid war ay  the Hull-Nomura talks, which had been under way since Feb¬  ruary. The nature of these talks has been a matter of some  - dispute. Pal points out that the American position hardened  noticeably in the course of the discussions, with respect to a      NEW MANDARINS    AMERICAN POWER AND THE    isaucs.    me united States insisted on making me axis  alliance a major issue, though Japan persistently de-emphasized  . C r ° e er ar S ues that the American motive was in part “sell-  mg the anticipated war with Japan to the American people ”   T Z°rt[T “ agree that an attack on \"“-American soil-™  Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, or the Netherlands East Indies-   constituted an attack on the United States.\\'- It may be that  the underlying motive was to justify the forthcoming American  involvement in the European war. In any event, the American  terms, by November, were such that Japan would have had to  abandon totally its attempt to secure “special interests” of the  sort possessed by the United States and Britain in the areas  under their domination, as well as its alliance with the Axis  powers, becoming a mere “subcontractor” in the emerging  American world system. Japan chose war-as we now know  With no expectation of victory over the United States but in the  hope “that the Americans, confronted by a German victory in  Europe and weary of war in the Pacific, would agree to a  negotiated peace in which Japan would be recognized as the  dominant power in Eastern Asia.” 93    On November 7, 1941, Japan offered to accept “the principle  of nondiscrimination in commercial relations” in the Pacific, in-   ClU t;® e ina ’ “ thiS Pri \" dple “ Were adopted throughout \"the  world The qualification was, needless to say, quite unthinka¬  ble. Hull s final demand was that the principle be applied in the  Japanese occupied areas and that Japan withdraw all forces  from China and Indochina. The Western powers could not be  expected to respond in kind in their dominions. A few days later  came “the day that will live in infamy.”   This final exchange points clearly to what had been, for dec¬  ades, the central problem. Japan had insisted that in its plans  or “coprosperity” and then a “new order,” it was simply follow-     The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste    ing the precedent established by Great Britain and the United  States; it was establishing its own Monroe Doctrine and realiz¬  ing its Manifest Destiny. It is revealing to study the American  response to this claim. Hull professed to be shocked. In his view  of the matter, the Monroe Doctrine, “as we interpret and apply  it uniformly since 1823 only contemplates steps for our physical  safety,” whereas Japan is bent on aggression. 94 He deplored the  “simplicity of mind that made it difficult for . . . [Japanese  generals] ... to see why the United States, on the one hand,  should assert leadership in the Western Hemisphere with the  Monroe Doctrine and, on the other, want to interfere with  Japan’s assuming leadership in Asia,” and he asked Nomura,  “Why can’t the Japanese Government educate the generals” to a  more correct understanding of this fundamental distinction? 95   American scholars were equally offended by the analogy. W.  W. Willoughby, in a detailed analysis, concludes that no com¬  parison can be made between the Monroe Doctrine and Japan’s  plans 96 The United States, he asserts, has never resorted to the  Monroe Doctrine to demand “that it be given special commer¬  cial or other economic privileges in the other American States.”  Rather, “it has exercised its powers of military intervention or of  financial administration for the benefit of the peoples of the  countries concerned or of those who have had just pecuniary  claims against them.” He cites with approval the discussion by  G. H. Blakeslee in Foreign Affairs, 97 which characterizes the  main difference between the American and Japanese position in  this way:   The United States is a vast territory with a great population vis-a-  vis a dozen Caribbean republics, each with a relatively small area  and population. Japan, on the other hand, is a country with a  relatively small area and population vis-a-vis the vast territory  and great population of China. An attitude which therefore ap-     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    pears natural for the United States to take toward the Caribbean  States does not appear natural for Japan to take toward China.   This contribution to the history of imperialist apologia at  least has the merit of originality. To my knowledge, no one had  previously argued that attempts by one nation to dominate an¬  other are proper to the extent that the victim is smaller and  weaker than the power that\\'is bent on subjugating it. However,  this argument is perhaps surpassed in acuity by Blakeslee’s next  explanation of the fundamental error in the Japanese analogy:   The United States does not need to use military force to induce  the Caribbean republics to permit American capital to find profit¬  able investment. The doors are voluntarily wide open.   American willingness to submit to the people’s will in the  Caribbean was, in fact, nicely illustrated in the fall of 1933, a  few months after Blakeslee’s article appeared, when Ramon Grau  San Martin came into power in Cuba with a program that  interrupted what Sumner Welles described as the attempt to  secure “a practical monopoly of the Cuban market for American  imports.” As Welles noted, this government was “highly prej¬  udicial to our interest ... our own commercial and export  interests cannot be revived under this government.” Conse¬  quently, Roosevelt refused to recognize the Grau government,  and Welles commenced his intrigues (which he admitted were  “anomalous”) with Batista, who was, in his judgment, “the only  individual in ’Cuba today who represented authority. . . . This  ... had rallied to his support the very great majority of the com¬  mercial and financial interests in Cuba who are looking for  protection” (Welles to Hull, October 4, 1933). The Grau gov¬  ernment soon fell, with the result that “the pre-1930 social and  economic class structure was retained, and the important place  in the Cuban economy held by foreign enterprises was not  fundamentally disturbed.” 98    ',\n",
       " '   The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste   But the basic inadequacy of the Japanese analogy, as Blakes-  lee points out, is the difference in aims. The United States   aims to help the backward Caribbean countries to establish and  maintain conditions of stability and prosperity. The United States  does not wish to seize territory, directly or indirectly, or to as¬  sume political or economic control. And when it has seemed  necessary to intervene in some revolution-tossed land, it has  effected the necessary reorganization and has then withdrawn.   It is this benevolence of intent that the Japanese do not share.  Consequently, their appeal to the precedent of American prac¬  tice is entirely without worth. The matter is simply put in a  recent study of postwar American foreign policy, which is very  critical of its recent directions: “. . . the American empire came  into being by accident and has been maintained from a sense of  benevolence.” . . . “We engaged in a kind of welfare imperial¬  ism, empire-building for noble ends rather than for such base  motives as profit and influence.” . . . “We have not exploited our  empire.” “. . . have we not been generous with our clients and  allies, sending them vast amounts of money and even sacrificing  the lives of our own soldiers on their behalf? Of course we  have.” 99   In comparison with this long-standing record of benevolence,  Japanese aggression stands exposed as the kind of “unprece¬  dented evil” that fully merited the atom bomb.   This review obviously does not exhaust the issues. But it does  serve, I think, to place in context the policy alternatives that  were open to the United States in 1941 and in earlier years. The  predominant American opinion remains that the only proper  response was the one that was adopted. In contrast, “realists of  the Grew-Kennan variety take the position expressed by  Schroeder, who argues against the mistake of basing policy on  an “emphasis on meting out justice rather than doing good.”     ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   The “moralistic” position of Hull, the “too hard and rigid policy  with Japan/ in Schroeder’s view, was not based on “sinister  design or warlike intent, but on a sincere and uncompromising  adherence to moral principles and liberal doctrines.” The “real¬  istic approach of accommodation favored by Grew would not  have been immoral, he argues. “It would have constituted only  a recognition that the American government was not then in a  position to enforce its principles, reserving for America full  freedom of action at some later, more favorable time.” 100  Schroeder does not question that we were, in fact, “meting out  justice,” but argues only that we were wrong, overly moralistic,  to do so; he does not question the principles to which the  United States adhered, but only our insistence on abiding by  these principles at an inappropriate time.   In contrast to the alternatives of “realism” and “moralism,” so  defined, the revolutionary pacifism of Muste seems to me both  eminently realistic and highly moral. Furthermore, even if we  were to grant the claim that the United States simply acted in  legitimate self-defense, subsequent events in Asia have amply,  hideously, confirmed Muste’s basic premise that “the means one  uses inevitably incorporate themselves into his ends and, if evil,  will defeat him.” Whether Muste’s was in fact the most realistic  and moral position at the time may be debated, but I think  there is no doubt that its remoteness from the American con¬  sciousness was a great tragedy. The lack of a radical critique of  the sort that Muste, and a few others, sought to develop was  one of the factors that contributed to the atrocity of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki, as the weakness and ineffectiveness of such radi¬  cal critique today will doubtless lead to new and unimaginable  horrors.

A Himmler or a Streicher  would have advanced one obvious solution. This liberal social scientist  however, suggests another: that we drive the peasants into the cities by  force ( urbanization”), putting off until after the war the “massive gov¬  ernment programs” that “will be required either to resettle migrants in  rural areas or to rebuild the cities and promote peacetime urban employ-  ment. This policy may prove to be “the answer to ‘wars of national  hbei,ition, ’ an answer that we have “stumbled upon\" in Vietnam “in  an absent-minded way.” ’    Professor Huntington disputes the view of Sir Robert Thompson that  peasant-based insurgency is immune “to the direct application of mechani-  cal and conventional power.” Not so: “. . . in the light of recent events  this statement needs to be seriously qualified. For if the ‘direct applica¬  tion of mechanical and conventional power’ takes place on such a massive  scale as to produce a massive migration from countryside to city the  basic assumptions underlying the Maoist doctrine of revolutionary’war  no longer operate. The Maoist-inspired rural revolution is undercut by the  American-sponsored urban revolution.”    It is helpful to have this explanation, from a leading political scientist,  of the basic assumptions” underlying the American doctrine of counter¬  revolutionary war.   6 “The Making of a Dove,” The Progressive , 1968, distributed by  Vietnam Information Project, 100 Maryland Avenue N.E., Washing¬  ton D.C. 20002.

See Wesley F. Craven and James L. Cate, eds., The Army Air  Forces in World War II (Chicago, University of Chicago Press,  1953), Vol. 5, pp. 732-33:   Arnold wanted as big a finale as possible, hoping that USASTAF  could hit the Tokyo area in a 1,000-plane mission: the Twentieth Air  Force had put up 853 B-29’s and 79 fighters on 1 August, and Arnold  thought the number could be rounded out by calling on Doolittles  Eighth Air Force. Spaatz still wanted to drop the third atom bomb on  Tokyo but thought that battered city a poor target for conventional  bombing; instead, he proposed to divide his forces between seven targets.  Arnold was apologetic about the unfortunate mixup on the Uth and, ac¬  cepting Spaatz’ amendment, assured him that his orders had been “co¬  ordinated with my superiors all the way to the top.” The teleconference  ended with a fervid “Thank God” from Spaatz. . . . From the Mananas,   449 B-29’s went out for a daylight strike on the 14th, and that nigh ,  with top officers standing by at Washington and Guam for a last-  minute cancellation, 372 more were airborne. Seven planes dispatched  on special bombing missions by the 509th Group brought the number  of B-29’s to 828, and with 186 fighter escorts dispatched, USASTAt  passed Arnold’s goal with a total of 1,014 aircraft. There were no  losses, and before the last B-29 returned President Truman announced  the unconditional surrender of Japan.

The progress of civilization is indicated by the  reaction to the American destruction of cities of the Mekong Delta in  early February 1968, for example, the destruction of Ben Tre with  thousands of civilian casualties to protect 20 American soldiers (20  had been killed, in a garrison of 40), after the city had been taken  over, virtually without a fight, by the NLF forces.   25. Japan and Her Destiny, ed. F. S. G. Piggott (New York, E. P.  Dutton & Co., Inc., 1958). Shigemitsu describes the Manchurian inci¬  dent as, in effect, one aspect of an attempted coup, of which the  domestic aspect failed. From his viewpoint, “Manchuria was an out¬  lying district belonging to and colonized by China,” a “sparsely popu¬  lated, backward country on the borders of China.” By 1930, the  “revolutionary diplomacy” of China was attempting to reverse and  overthrow the unequal treaties, including long-standing Japanese in¬  terests. At a time when the only solution to world problems was free  trade, Europe was reverting to a closed autarchic economy and block¬  ing trade between Japan and the colonial possessions of the European  powers, and the League of Nations was following the policy of keep¬  ing the world static, in the interests of established imperialism. The  Kwantung Army acted unilaterally, to protect what they took to be  the legitimate interests of Japan in Manchuria. Later steps to defend  Manchukuo were determined in part by the threat of ultimate Com¬  munist encirclement (by Communist Chinese and the Soviet Union),  and in part as an attempt to “counter the world movement to closed  economies,” which required that the Japanese must attempt “to attain  self-sufficiency.” This view of the situation, to which I return below,  was not unrealistic.   26. Shigemitsu, however, did not escape the Shanghai incident quite  so lightly as did, say, American Ambassador to the Dominican Repub¬  lic W. Tapley Bennett or Presidential Envoy John Bartlow Martin 23  years later, in not dissimilar circumstances. Shigemitsu was severely  wounded by a terrorist (an advocate of Korean independence) and  had a leg amputated.   27. Thought and Behaviour in Modern Japanese Politics, ed.

Comparisons are difficult, but it seems that the Japanese were  considerably more successful in establishing a functioning puppet gov¬  ernment in Manchuria than the United States has ever been in Viet¬  nam, just as the Germans were more successful in converting French  nationalist forces to their ends in occupied and Vichy France than the  United States has been in Vietnam.

Officers of the Japanese army in China expressed the same solici¬  tude.

Parenthetically, we may  remark that American postwar Philippine policy served to perpetuate  what United Nations representative Salvador Lopez calls the prewar  ‘“system rooted in injustice and greed” which “required the riveting of  the Philippine economy to the American economy through free trade  arrangements between the two countries,” and which, in “tacit al-   ',\n",
       " '    ■ \" AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   legiance with the Filipino economic elite” led to a “colonial economy  of the classical type” (“The Colonial Relationship/’ in Frank H.  Golay, ed., The United States and the Philippines [Englewood Cliffs,  N.J, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1966], pp. 7-31). Furthermore, this ^“short¬  sighted policy of pressing for immediate commercial advantage” inter¬  rupted the Philippine revolution that was under way at the time of the  American conquest. This “interruption” continued, for example, with  the policies of Magsaysay, who “cleared away the ambivalence which  had arisen in the persistent experimentation with public corporations  of various kinds by a firm avowal that public policy would reflect faith  in and dependence upon private enterprise” (Frank H. Golay, Eco¬  nomic Collaboration: The Role of American Investment,” in ibid., p.  109). One effect of this “improvement” in “the political and economic  aspects of the investment climate” was that from 1957 to 1963 “earn¬  ings accruing to American foreign investors were in excess of twice  the amount of direct foreign investment in the Philippines,” an inter¬  esting case of foreign aid. In fact, the preferential trade relations  forced on the Philippines in 1946 virtually guaranteed American  domination of the economy. Two Filipino economists, writing in the  same volume, point out that “acceptance of the Trade Act by the  Philippines was the price for war damage payments. In view of the  prevailing economic circumstances, Filipinos had no alternative but to  accept, after considerable controversy and with obvious reluctance  (p 132) But the “compensating” rehabilitation act was itself some¬  thing of a fraud, since “the millions of dollars of war damage pay¬  ments ... in effect went back to the United States in the form of  payments for imports, to the benefit of American industry and labor   (p. 125). . „   63.

Unfortunately for the Japanese apolo¬  gists, they were unable to use some of the devices available to their  current American counterparts to explain the failure of the Chinese to  accept their honorable offers. For example, the director of Harvard’s  East Asian Research Center, John King Fairbank, thoughtfully ex¬  plains that “when we offer to negotiate we are making an honorable  offer which, in our view, is a civilized and normal thing to do,” but the  Asian mind does not share our belief “in the supremacy of law and the  rights of the individual protected by law through due process” and is  thus unable to perceive our honorable intent and obvious sincerity  (j Boston Globe, August 19, 1967). It is only those rather superficial  critics who do not understand the Asian mind who insist on taking the  North Vietnamese literally when they state that negotiations can fol¬  low a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, or who point out  the moral absurdity of the plea that both the victim and his assailant  “cease their violence.”   69.

The author, a Southeast Asian specialist and  editorial writer for Asahi Shimbun, notes the similarity to earlier  Japanese efforts, but feels that the prospects for the American pro¬  gram are dim for a number of reasons, among them the following:   . . the wounds inflicted on Nature, so ruthlessly destroyed for this, are  too brutal to see. Beautiful grasslands, the verdant forests and the  rich crops have all been burned by t flame throwers, napalm bombs and  chemical defoliants. The great earth has been gouged and dug over.  The ugly land, no longer green, has lost its power to attract people and  to stir deep in the hearts of people a love for their birthplace and their  motherland.” There is, he feels, little chance that revolutionary devel¬  opment will succeed “when Nature has been turned into a scorched  earth and the system and the traditions born of a race of people have  been destroyed.”   87.

THE LOGIC OF WITHDRAWAL    I_«_—-- : -:---- \"T - - ~~   International affairs can be complex, a matter of irreconcila¬  ble interests, each with a claim to legitimacy, and conflicting  principles, none of which can be lightly abandoned. The cur¬  rent Middle East crisis is a typical, painful example. American  interference in the affairs of Vietnam is one of the rare excep¬  tions to this general rule. The simple fact is that there is no  legitimate interest or principle to justify the use of American  military force in Vietnam.   Since 1954 there has been one fundamental issue in Vietnam:  whether the uncertainty and conflict left unresolved at Geneva  will be settled at a local level, by indigenous forces, or raised to  an international level and settled through great-power in¬  volvement. Alone among the great powers, the United States   Parts of this essay appeared as an editorial statement in Ramparts, Vol. 5  (September 1967).

       " '    ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   has insisted on the latter course. It seems clear that if the  United States persists on this course, then either the issue will  be settled unilaterally through the exercise of American power,  in the manner of Nazi Germany in Poland or the Soviet Union  in Hungary, or it will develop into a great-power conflict, with  unimaginable consequences.   This is the situation to which Howard Zinn has addressed  himself in a lucid and compelling study which advocates, very  simply, that the United States accept the principle adopted by  the other great powers at Geneva in 1954 and agree to turn  Vietnam over to the Vietnamese. 1 “The daily toll in Vietnam of  innocent people is so terrible that the cessation of our military  activity—the bombings, the burning and the shelling of vil¬  lages, the search and destroy operations—has become no longer  debatable or negotiable, but a matter of urgent and unilateral  action.” And the only action on our part that can mitigate the  torture, that can avert the still greater catastrophe that lies in  wait, is to remove the military force that bears the primary  responsibility. Since, happily, this is the one policy that we can  successfully implement, there is a feasible alternative to devas¬  tation of Vietnam or a global conflict.   The proposal that the United States withdraw will be dis¬  missed as extremist.” To those who like to describe themselves  as “responsible” or “realistic,” withdrawal is politically impossi¬  ble, and the analysis of the situation in Vietnam on which the  proposal is based hopelessly naive.   On the issue of domestic politics, Zinn argues that “the so-  called ‘realists’ who urge us to speak softly and so persuade the  President are working against the reality, which is that the Pres¬  ident responds to self-interest rather than to rational argument.  ... If enough people speak for withdrawal, it can become  politically feasible.” Only a combination of factors can end the  ',\n",
       " '    The Logic of Withdrawal   war; hence “every citizen must put his full moral weight, his  whole argument, into the balance.” In fact, the government is  not a monolith. As the political and military realities in Vietnam  emerge through the haze of pretense and deception, the ad¬  visability, the desperate urgency of American withdrawal may  become correspondingly apparent, to some at least. Consider,  for example, the reaction of Senator Young to the news that the  South Vietnamese forces are unwilling to do what amounts to  police work, so that so-called “pacification” must be taken over  by the American army:   If the South Vietnamese forces of Prime Minister Ky are so  inadequate in numbers, intelligence, and training that they cannot  handle entirely the pacification program in the villages . . . , then  instead of Americans trying to train, indoctrinate, and pacify an  alien people, the time is long past due for us to withdraw to our  coastal bases and eventually from Vietnam. 2   This reaction echoes that of Senator Symington after a recent  Asian trip:   If the South Vietnamese do not achieve this pacification, there is  no point in this country continuing to pour out lives and treasure  in order to protect a government that can\" neither consolidate nor  control what has been taken from them by their own citizens and  the North Vietnamese. If the United States decides to become the  major factor in this pacification program [as it has since be¬  come] as well as in the fighting of the war [as it became long  ago], it can only become an extended war of the white man  against the Asians, on the mainland of Asia. 3   Symington’s remarks are no doubt accurate, and if past his¬  tory is any guide, they will soon be forgotten, as Americans  become habituated to the new reality. It was, after all, not very  long ago that a well-known Asian specialist, with close State  Department connections, was able to draw the following con¬  clusion in a review of Southeast Asian affairs      ★= i AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   It is unthinkable that the United States would move into the  country directly, take over the conduct of the warfare against the  Vietcong, and attempt to build and manage a government for  Saigon and the countryside. Apart from other difficulties, this  would offer convincing proof of the Communist charge of “im¬  perialism” daily leveled against our government. For the United  States to carry the war to the north on any large scale would have  the same result. 4   Observe that the date of this evaluation was February 1965;  as we recall, “convincing proof of the Communist charge of  imperialism” was not long in coming. And today, there is very  good reason to suppose that we will find ourselves in “an ex¬  tended war of the white man against the Asians, on the main¬  land of Asia.”   Far from being naive, the analysis of the situation that leads  to the call for withdrawal—not eventual but immediate—seems  to me entirely realistic; and the dimensions of the Vietnamese  tragedy are so awesome that whatever the prospects for success  may be, the responsible citizen must spare no effort to create  the political climate, the background of insight and understand¬  ing, in which this call will become a powerful one. The urgency  of this matter can hardly be exaggerated. It seems unlikely that  the Johnson administration will be willing to face the 1968 elec¬  tions with an unwinnable war on its hands. The prospects are  therefore for sharp escalation, perhaps a forced confrontation  with China. What is more, the rapid growth of Chinese nuclear  weapon and missile capacity will surely suggest to Pentagon  planners the need to act now, before the Chinese are in a posi¬  tion to hold an American army hostage on the fringes of Asia.  With this prospect, attempts to predict what may happen  next are as irrational as our Vietnamese policy itself.

       " '             The Logic of Withdrawal   justifications that are offered for persisting in the semiprinci-  pled, semilunatic course of action in which we are now so  heavily engaged. His general thesis seems to me entirely cor¬  rect. The issues are so grave that I would like to go well beyond  the bounds of a review and indicate some of the directions in  which his discussion might be extended and elaborated.   What is the situation that American policy makers face in  mid-196 7 ? The American military takeover of “pacification” is a  testimony to the failure, thus far, of the effort to impose a  political solution by force on an unwilling population. Its true  significance is tersely indicated by an unnamed American offi¬  cial in Saigon who comments: “We’ve been playing the be-nice-  to-the-Asian game for ten years, and it’s been a flop. We can’t  afford it any longer.” 5 The American chief of civil operations in  the northernmost provinces attributes the failure of the “revolu¬  tionary development teams” to the “overwhelming corruption”  of Vietnamese official life, to the failure to understand that  “until there is a contented peasantry there is no room for the  opulent society of the government of Vietnam.” 6 The same re¬  port in the Times goes on to give a dramatic example of the  results of this corruption. It comments on the successful attack  by a guerrilla force on the province capital of Quang Tri on  April 6, and continues: “A few days later, in a series of events  that were not fully reported at the time, [the guerrillas] moved  virtually unmolested into Hue while the army and the national  police fled”—a remarkable event, its significance indicated by  the fact that it was kept from the American people at the time  and still has not been frankly discussed.   In Saigon itself there are clear indications of the same  demoralization or widespread involvement in guerrilla activi¬  ties. For example, on February 13, 1967, Westmoreland’s head¬  quarters in central Saigon were subjected to a mortar attack. As      AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    the New York Times points out, with considerable understate¬  ment, this attack “gives rise to a question of the popular support  in Saigon for the South Vietnamese government. ... It seemed  unlikely to observers that the 81mm. mortar and the shells  could have been transported to the house, that the roof could  have been cut and the weapon set up without detection by  someone in the crowded residential district. Until the shells  were fired : . . , no one called the police.”   Current reports confirm, once again, that “every program to  win the allegiance of the countryside for the South Vietnamese  government has so far failed, in the opinion of most observers.  To this day, 80% of the peasantry . . . falls under Vietcong  influence if not outright control.” 7 The very terminology of this  report gives some insight into the reasons for the recurrent  failure; it has yet to be demonstrated that the Americans are  correct in their unquestioned assumption that the peasants of  Vietnam are objects, incapable of political expression or alle¬  giance, to be “controlled” by one side or the other. The report  continues: “If the South Vietnamese themselves cannot achieve  support for the government among their own people, it is un¬  likely that ‘giant white foreigners’ will be able to do this for  them.” Yet it is just this attempt to which we are now reduced,  with the military takeover. And we can be fairly sure that this  latest step will lead to new and glorious reports of success,  before the next rude awakening.   The Saigon government has few illusions as to its legitimacy  and status. Saigon officials have pointed out repeatedly that  they cannot survive in an open political arena, and that there¬  fore the Americans must destroy not only the Vietcong military  units but also its political and administrative structure, by such  devices as the “pacification” program. A clear and forthright  expression of this analysis appears in an interview with “one of    ',\n",
       " '  The Logic of Withdrawal    the top generals in the junta, a man regarded by U.S. officials as  politically the most sophisticated of the group,” reported by  George M. Kahin in a memorandum to a group of senators. 8  The general describes the situation in the following terms:   To defeat the communists we must win against them both politi¬  cally and militarily. But we are very weak politically and without  the strong political support of the population which the NLF  have. Thus now if we defeat them militarily, they can come to  power because of their greater political strength. We now have  (thanks to the support of our Allies) a strong military instru¬  ment. But we are without a political instrument that can compete  with the communists in the south. Such a political instrument we  must now begin to create, a process that will take a generation. It.  is unrealistic to speak of a cease fire until after we have built up  our political strength to the point where we can compete with the  communists successfully.   He goes on to say that the war must be carried to North Viet¬  nam, with the commitment of a million American troops, then  probably to China as well. Finally, he argues that “it might be  necessary to move on to World War III so as to insure that  communist power was fully removed from Vietnam,” a not  unrealistic forecast, if the United States continues to insist that  its proteges be spared the defeat that they know to be a cer¬  tainty if the struggle is permitted to shift to the political  arena, where they lack “the strong political support of the popu¬  lation which the NLF have.”   Buddhist leaders appear to share this analysis. In the cited  memorandum, Kahin quotes Buddhist spokesmen, obviously  unidentified, who point out that the present Saigon regime,  dependent for its life on United States support, can do nothing  to “win” the war. They plead that the United States lift the  tight lid that is clamped on political expression and political  activity so that a government with some claim to legitimacy can     ★== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   be established, one that can proceed to make a political settle¬  ment with the National Liberation Front. Despite the outra¬  geous suppression of Buddhist political activity, the Buddhists  still appear to be confident, as they have been for years, that  they can function effectively in cooperation with the NLF. The  recent “Policy Statement” published by the Overseas Vietna¬  mese Buddhist Association emphasizes this (as does the touch¬  ing and pathetic book by Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnam: Lotus in  a Sea of Fire), and, in fact, puts forth a program for South  Vietnam that is not markedly different from that of the NLF.   American authorities have repeatedly indicated that they  share this assessment of the Saigon government and its popular  base. Both the present Assistant Secretary of State for Far East¬  ern Affairs and his predecessor have expressed their belief that  neutralization of South Vietnam would lead to a Communist  takeover, and it is widely admitted that the American expedi¬  tionary force was introduced to stave off what was in essence a  political defeat. In his revealing study of the Vietcong, Ameri¬  can foreign service officer Douglas Pike concludes, with ample  evidence, that the NLF victory in the now long-forgotten civil  war was essentially a political and organizational victory,  achieved by building a mass movement. The NLF, he states, is  the only “truly mass-based political party in South Vietnam.”  Only the Buddhists—whose political organization was smashed  in the spring of 1966—could realistically hope to take part in a  coalition with the NLF, in his judgment. General Richard Stil-  well, at the time second in command in the Southeast Asian  theater, informed Senator Young that we are putting down “an  insurrection,” and even General Westmoreland, who now as¬  serts that he has seen no signs of insurrection, admitted to  Senator Young that the majority of the Vietcong fighting in the  Mekong Delta were born and reared there 9 —thus indicating that  ',\n",

       " '     The Logic of Withdrawal    he may not know the meaning of the word “insurrection;”   The basis for the success of the insurrection is not very ob¬  scure. Denis Warner, as anti-Communist as any newsman who  has worked in Southeast Asia, pointed out years ago that “in  hundreds of villages all over South-East Asia the only people  working at the grass roots for an uplift in people’s living stand¬  ards are the Communists.” 10 And to the Communist agit-prop  successes, the Americans have contributed mightily, for ex¬  ample, with the terroristic bombing policy. American sources  indicate that in the first year of American bombing of the South,  1965, local recruitment for the Vietcong tripled. 11 The head of  the Saigon office of Asahi Shimbun concludes that “It is certain  that the escalation and spread of the war, even though its re¬  sults may be advantageous to the Saigon Government itself, only  serves to heighten still further opposition to the war among the  general population,” adding that “The number of draft-dodgers  and deserters among young South Vietnamese is a sign of the  failure of the war, by and large, to win the support of young  people, who tend to view it as an American war.” 12 And the  situation can only worsen. Saigon authorities indicate that there  are now some two million refugees, most of them, according to  the reports of war correspondents, victims of American bom¬  bardment or forced resettlement. An Associated Press report  from Saigon gives the following shattering forecast:   The United States high command, preoccupied for two years with  hunting down North Vietnamese regulars, now is looking more  toward the populated valleys and lowlands where the enemy  wields potent political influence and gets his sustenance. Quick  gains are hoped for by forced resettlement of chronically Com¬  munist areas, followed up with scorched-earth operations that  deny enemy troops all food, shelter, and material support. Cen¬  tral highlands valleys are being denuded of all living things; people  ringing the Communist war zones in the South have been moved.     ★== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Some American observers recently in the Mekong Delta say that   the Vietnamese Army, long hated and feared, now is regarded as   less of a threat to the countryside than the Americans. 13   Dozens of such reports can be cited. Those who advocate  withdrawal are simply proposing that we eliminate this threat,  as only we can do.   It is hardly surprising that the peasantry refuses allegiance to  a constituent assembly that could muster 3 votes out of 117 for  the one land-reform measure that was introduced, or that even  the residents of Saigon are less than enthusiastic about a gov¬  ernment so unbelievably corrupt that the secretary of industry  in Ky’s cabinet seems to be the major supplier of drugs to the  Vietcong—of course, after receiving a third of a million dollars  in kickbacks from the American and West German suppliers. 14  Nor is it obscure why the American government continues to  use its military force to impose on the people of Vietnam the  regime of the most corrupt, most reactionary elements in Viet¬  namese society. There is simply no one else who will do its  bidding, and resist the overwhelming popular sentiment for  peace and, no doubt, neutralism. The United States government  has on occasion indicated that it would not leave if asked to do  so “by a left-wing or even neutralist government that, in the  U.S. view, did not reflect the true feelings of the South Vietna¬  mese people or military leaders.” 15 Furthermore, it will see to it  that no such government will arise, and that no such opinions  will be publicly expressed. Thus in the last few months, reports  from South Vietnam indicate that once again a Buddhist at¬  tempt to establish a legal political organization were frustrated  and the leaders arrested (Kahin memorandum, cited above,  note 8).   Jean Raffaelli, the one Western correspondent who has re¬  mained in North Vietnam, has observed that quite apart from   ',\n",
       " '      The Logic of Withdrawal    any question of politics, there is a human element of grandeur  in the resistance of the Vietnamese to the assault launched  against them by the world’s most advanced technology. In Le  Monde, a North Vietnamese doctor “of international reputa¬  tion” is quoted as saying:   . . . the Americans have demolished everything. All that we have  built since 1954 is in ruins: hospitals, schools, factories, new  dwellings. We have nothing more to lose, except for independence  and liberty. But to safeguard these, believe me, we are ready to  endure anything.   In South Vietnam, the American attack has been far more  severe, and direct report from its victims is lacking. But some  statistics tell the story well enough. According to American  sources, the Vietcong are “able to enlist an estimated 7,000  recruits a month.” 16 Recently, an extensive propaganda barrage  has enthusiastically proclaimed that in March 1967 there were  5,557 defectors from the Vietcong, almost twice as many as in  any previous month. Only the careful reader would have noted  that of these “defectors” 630 were identified as military men and  301 as political cadres, the rest being peasants, probably coming  for a free meal. 17 Seven thousand new recruits and 630 defec¬  tors—these figures indicate graphically by what means the  American war in Vietnam must be won,   The preceding description is based on reports in early 1967.  Rereading it in January 1968, I need hardly emphasize how  little the situation has changed. The savage battering of the  Vietnamese continues without pause; in scale, it is unique in the  history of warfare. We learn that aerial bombardment alone  exceeds 100 pounds of explosives per person, 12 tons of explo¬  sives per square mile, distributed almost equally between North  and South Vietnam. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been  subjected to defoliation, with what ultimate consequences no     *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   one knows. Refugees in South Vietnam are counted in the mil¬  lions. Why have they left their homes? . . the reason why the  people are forced to abandon their villages and their homes is  because, in most cases, practically all of the homes are com¬  pletely burned to the ground by the American forces. However,  the people still try to cling to their scorched land, and are re¬  moved only by compulsion. . . .” 18 Literate Americans—  those who have followed the well-reported horror story of  Ben Sue, for example—can supply the details for themselves. 19  Numerous eyewitness reports have given the lie to the cynical  pretense that our targets in North Vietnam are purely  military, targets of “steel and concrete.” The chief editorial  writer of Asahi Shimbun writes: “I myself walked around  and inspected the bombed remains of schools, hospitals,  churches, temples, market places, and other peaceful public  facilities.” 20 Lee Lockwood, Harrison Salisbury, David  Schoenbrun, and others have elaborated, for those who wish  to know. It is no longer denied that antipersonnel weapons  constitute a significant proportion of the bombing.   The political situation remains as before. Elections have been  held to legitimize the existing regime in American eyes, at least.  To ensure the proper result, the only avowed “peace candidate,”  Au Truong Thanh, was ruled off the ballot, as was the candi¬  date most likely to be a threat at the polls, General Minh (he  had previously been barred from the country). “Communists”  and “neutralists” were excluded by electoral law. In the sena¬  torial elections, tickets associated with Tri Quang Buddhists  were excluded as “proneutralist,” and the trade-union ticket was  eliminated because “one candidate lacked certification of his  legal status.” 21 As anticipated, “the candidates are generally an  aristocratic and urban group,” including few villagers—“about  90% of them live within Saigon or the surrounding province of  ',\n",
       " \"    The Logic of Withdrawal    Gia Dinh.” 22 The shenanigans involved in deciding who “won”  the senatorial elections defy description. 23 Although a number  of American political scientists declared themselves satisfied  (recalling Dean Rusk’s description of the May 1965 provincial  elections as “free elections ... by our standards”), the special  committee of the South Vietnamese Constituent Assembly rec¬  ommended to invalidate; the decision was reversed by a vote of  58-43 in the full Assembly, under police guard, with the director  of the national police, General Loan, and his armed bodyguards  conspicuously in the gallery. Phan Khac Suu, the conservative  landowner who was Assembly Speaker, refused to announce the  result, saying, “I am absolutely unwilling to accept the ver¬  dict.” 24 Shortly after the elections, Truong Dinh Dzu, who sur¬  prised everyone by speaking of peace and who placed second in  the balloting, was arrested. Also arrested was Au Truong  Thanh, “by 79 armed men in combat gear” led by General  Loan. 25 Among the charges: he had applied for an exit visa to  the United States. “It is up to him to explain why he wants to  go abroad,” stated General Loan. After being held for eighteen  hours, he was returned to house arrest, where apparently he  remains, though it is difficult to obtain information. On Novem¬  ber 3, the Saigon government freed 6,270 prisoners in an  amnesty, including 4,320 “Vietcong suspects,” most of them  peasants, and 1,120 “political detainees”—“persons who have  been held, usually without trial, for periods up to three years.”  A ranking official said, “It’s safe to say that only a tiny fraction  of the total was released Wednesday.” The government refuses  to give further information.   Furthermore, it is by now also clear that the government, in  the months since the elections, has fallen into an almost total  paralysis, the only noticeable action being the intensive effort  by the House to block the attempt to draft South Vietnamese     jf - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   boys of eighteen and nineteen to fight the American war. Tran  Van Do, the Foreign Minister, explains that “we are not able to  organize South Vietnam politically ... so we cannot accept the  NLF as a political party . . . the integration of the front will be  a political way to take over South Vietnam.” 26 The Mekong  Delta, with 40 percent of the population (and as yet, no North  Vietnamese soldiers), continues to be a Vietcong stronghold.  Asked why, President Thieu states: “The main reason the Viet¬  cong remain so strongly entrenched in the Mekong Delta is that  people there still believe there is little difference between the  French whom they called colonialists, and the Americans whom  they call imperialists.” 27 Another reason is pointed out by Con¬  gressman Reid, who notes that “70 percent of the tenant farm¬  ers of the lowlands' and Mekong Delta now rent from absentee  landlords who are living it up in Saigon” 28 —the attempt by  Congressmen Reid and Moss to have the government release a  detailed study of land measures in South Vietnam by the Gen¬  eral Accounting Office has so far been unsuccessful. 29   Tran Van Do’s analysis is confirmed by Hanson Baldwin,  who reports that “almost unanimously, . . . U.S. officials in  Vietnam view the prospect of imminent negotiations with  alarm” because inclusion of the NLF in a coalition would be  “the kiss of death.” 30 This attitude towards a negotiated settle¬  ment reveals itself continually in American diplomacy, with its  constant posing of new, more extreme conditions whenever an  opportunity for negotiations arises—as in the Ho Chi Minh-  Johnson exchange of February 1967, when President Johnson  proposed, as a condition for negotiations, that we should stop  “augmenting” our forces in South Vietnam after North Vietnam  had stopped all infiltration (we, of course, would be free to  continue our own supply and “infiltration” operations, for our  own far more extensive expeditionary forces, even after the    \",\n",
       " '  The Logic of Withdrawal    North Vietnamese desisted totally). Occasionally, spokesmen  for the American government have expressed themselves quite  clearly about the prospects for negotiations. For example, Gen¬  eral Maxwell Taylor stated in August 1965:   ... the army is the power in South Vietnam. The generals are  completely committed. They’ve burned all their bridges behind  them. They would never tolerate a government that was caught  surreptitiously or overtly negotiating with Hanoi or with the Viet-  cong. 31   It seems unlikely that either Saigon or Washington will be  trapped into negotiations, so long as the political base of those  who collaborate with us in South Vietnam remains as weak as it  is today.   Corroborating Hanson Baldwin’s summary of opinion in  Vietnam, Hedrick Smith reports from Washington that “the  recent elections did not produce an organized political base for  the government,” and, in the opinion of United States policy  makers, “the Saigon regime lacks sufficient popular support and  cohesion to enter ... a political test of strength with the  front.” 32 The elections, although they may have temporarily  calmed American public opinion, have changed little or nothing  in South Vietnam. An internal report of the United States Mis¬  sion 83 in Saigon reports the gloom of American officials over  the “strange drift from reality regarding the U.S. role in Viet¬  nam” among the “South Vietnamese people,” as evidenced, for  example, in the statement by a group of middle-aged citizens  that the new mobilization law had been enacted “at the behest  of the Americans, whose real aim is the extermination of as  many Vietnamese as possible,” or the question of a legislator  who asks, “Why should our young men be drafted to serve U.S.  interests ?”   The mood among Saigon intellectuals is summarized by a     *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   retired professor who is “somewhat to the right in the spectrum  of Saigon intellectuals.” 34 The problem, he states, is that “at  this point the only intellectuals of character who have com¬  mitted themselves are on the other side.” Ho Chi Minh retains  his popularity, because “he bridged the gap between Vietnam*  and the modern world.” “Everyone knows and admires Ho.”  The only hope, as the professor sees it, is for the United States  to put aside pretense and to appoint a new “governor or pro-  consul for Vietnam.”   As far as the military situation is concerned, Senator Mans¬  field, one of the best-informed members of the Senate on South¬  east Asian affairs, concluded after General Westmoreland’s recent  reports in Washington that he saw “very little, if anything, in  the pattern of combat operations to indicate any weakening of  the ability of the Vietcong to keep on fighting.” He believes that  the NLF remains “the dominant force in South Vietnam,” and  points out that its “stronghold” in the Mekong Delta “has hardly  been touched.” The Front, rather than Hanoi, is “the main fac¬  tor to be considered in South Vietnam.” 35   There are, to be sure, certain “pacified” areas, some even with  few American troops; for example, much of Tay Ninh Province,  where the Cao Dai is quite strong. But it is interesting to inves¬  tigate the details of this success in “pacification.” Elizabeth  Pond reports that the basis appears to be “a certain accommo¬  dation between the Cao Dai and the Viet Cong.” 36 Among the  Cao Dai intellectuals, the heroes remain those who advocated  neutralism—particularly, the former “Cao Dai Pope,” Pham  Cong Tac, who was exiled under Diem. By some, “the only one  who has carried on the tradition of Pham Cong Tac” is consid¬  ered to be Major Nguyen Thanh Mung, who joined the Viet¬  cong with his Cao Dai troops. The relation between this model  ',\n",
       " '     The Logic of Withdrawal   area and the Saigon government is one of strong mutual  mistrust, according to this report.   There has been no more revealing commentary on the situa¬  tion in the American-controlled areas of South Vietnam than  the testimony elicited by Congressman Donald Riegle from  Rutherford Poats, in May 1967, released in September. 37   Mr. Poats had been, for the preceding three years, “the No. 1  man overseeing our economic program, the so-called ‘other war’  in Vietnam,” and had just been promoted to deputy director of  the Agency for. International Development. According to this  testimony, as Congressman Riegle reports it, “the annual U.S.  commodity import program in Vietnam is actually a political  ransom paid to powerful South Vietnamese commercial inter¬  ests to insure political stability in South Vietnam, and insure  their continued support of the war.” Poats agreed with Con¬  gressman Riegle’s summary statement that “if we were to with¬  draw our AID program, ... the government would likely col¬  lapse over there, and for all intents and purposes the war would  be over,” and that “if this war were conducted in a way that  required greater economic sacrifices by certain elements in  Vietnam, the political instability is such that the country might  fly apart.” The situation is such that “there would not be mili¬  tary action by the Vietnamese military forces today had it not  been for our provision of commercial imports,” because of the  resulting “inflation, disruption, and loss of morale.” He also  agreed that “there is certainly a substantial element of truth” in  Congressman Riegle’s judgment that without the “ransom,”  commercial interests in South Vietnam would “get their sympa¬  thizers out in the streets and bring down the Government”  (though he felt this judgment to be “harsh”). Congressman  Riegle concludes that “if we cannot establish some sort of bal-   I 237     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    ance between self-sufficiency . . . versus a growing dependency,  then we will never get out of this situation. We will be mired  down there forever.” He adds that “all the evidence that piles  up on the military side and on the nonmilitary side” shows a  growing dependency. According to Mr. Poats, “that is certainly  a danger, and in some instances a fair conclusion.” It would  follow, then, if this assessment is accurate, that “we will be  mired down there forever.”   One might compare this testimony with a report by the  French resident minister in 1897:   [The only collaborators are] intriguers, disreputable or ignorant,  whom we [the French] had rigged out with sometimes high  ranks, which became tools in their hands for plundering the  country without scruple. . . . Despised, they possessed neither the  spiritual culture nor the moral fibre that would have allowed  them to understand and carry out their task. 38   Apart from its rhetorical flair, this might be the testimony of  Rutherford Poats today. Mr. Poats’s testimony will come as no  surprise to those who have been paying attention to the la¬  ments of senior American officials in Saigon. In 1959, one such  official 39 commented that “in the case of Free Viet-Nam the  lack of even a bare minimum of economic self-sufficiency makes  enduring political independence only an illusion,” and com¬  plained that “the majority of the aid is used in a manner that  maintains an extravagant standard of living.” “The Viet-Minh,”  he said, “. . . can make a strong case that the United States is  effectively replacing France as the new master of Free Viet-  Nam.” Poats’s testimony simply shows how little things have  changed. Many additional illustrations of the character of the  collaborationist elements might be cited. 40 The whole situation  recalls vividly other episodes in the history of colonialism, for  example, the situation in the Philippines during the period of  ',\n",

Christopher Lydon, the Boston Globe correspondent who ac¬  companied General Gavin on his recent trip to Vietnam, con¬  cluded a series of articles reporting his impressions with a quo¬  tation from Ton That Thien, managing editor of the Vietnam  Guardian , which was suppressed by the Saigon regime when it  printed a report questioning the official claim that Assembly  member Tran Van Van was assassinated by the Vietcong. Thien  defines what he sees as the only possible American “victory” :   You cannot defeat the other side militarily unless you devote the  next 30 or 40 years to it. You can win if you keep killing for a  generation. You simply exterminate all the Vietnamese—the way  you killed the Indians in America—and there will be no more  war. ..   Lydon comments: “This agony, if not utter desperation, among  what seemed to me the most sensitive and patriotic Vietnamese,  about the burden of American arms on their country is the  overriding impression I carry back from this tortured capital/’ 41  This agony is shared by the most perceptive observers of the  Vietnam tragedy, even those who are basically in support of the  American military intervention. Bernard Fall, for example, in  one of his last articles warned that “it is Viet-Nam as a cultural  and historic entity which is threatened with extinction,” as “the  countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military  machine ever unleashed on an area of this size.” 42 It is ap¬  palling beyond words that we permit this to continue.   When one tries to see what lies behind the official govern¬  ment reports, this is the sort of picture that emerges. Of course,  it is not the picture that the government seeks to present, nor  the one that it succeeds, by and large, in presenting, given the    ',\n",
       " '     ■ AMERICAN POWER ANO THE NEW MANDARINS   corruption of its intelligence.” He urges that “increased and  specific vigilance, not just the elaboration of general principles,  is required from the intellectual community toward specific  growing dangers to its integrity.   Senator Fulbright has developed a similar theme m an im¬  portant and perceptive speech . 2 He describes the failure of the  universities to form “an effective counterweight to the military-  industrial complex by strengthening their emphasis on the tradi¬  tional values of our democracy.” Instead they have “joined the  monolith, adding greatly to its power and influence.” Specifi¬  cally, he refers to the failure of the social scientists, “who ought  to be’ acting as responsible and independent critics of the Gov¬  ernment’s policies,” but who instead become the agents of these  policies. “While young dissenters plead for resurrection of the  American promise, their elders continue to subvert it.” With  “the surrender of independence, the neglect of teaching, and  the distortion of scholarship,” the university “is not only failing  to meet its responsibilities to Its students; it is betraying a pub-  lie trust.”   The extent of this betrayal might be argued; its existence, as a  threatening tendency, is hardly in doubt. Senator Fulbright  mentions one primary cause: the access to money and influence.  Others might be mentioned: for example, a highly restrictive,  almost universally shared ideology, and the inherent dynamics  of professionalization. As to the former, Fulbright has cite  elsewhere the observation of De Tocqueville: “I know of no  country in which there is so little independence of mind and  , real freedom of discussion as in America.” Free institutions cer¬  tainly exist, but a tradition of passivity and conformism restricts  their use—the cynic might say this is why they continue to exist.  The impact of professionalization is also quite clear. The free  floating intellectual” may occupy himself with problems be-    ',\n",

It is to the  great credit of the American press that it does still provide  information on the basis of which one who is willing to put in  the time and effort can arrive at some understanding of what is  taking place in Vietnam. But we must recognize that valuable  as this is, it has little bearing on the state of American democ¬  racy, since the opportunity to do the research that is required to  separate fact from propaganda is limited to a privileged few.   In the light of what we have seen in the past three years, it is  difficult to become excited over such matters as the ambiguity,  or duplicity, of the American government position on the Gen¬  eva agreements, or the numerous violations of domestic and  international law that have accompanied our intervention in the  internal affairs of Vietnam. Nevertheless, these matters, and in  particular the reaction as they have become too clear to over¬  look, are quite revealing for anyone concerned with the Ameri¬  can war in Vietnam and its implications for the future. It was,  at one time, quite normal to denounce the “Communists” for  their disregard of international law and treaty obligations. Now,  however, many Americans tend to scoff at such matters as irrele¬  vant, unrealistic. Suddenly, the Constitution and the system of  treaties to which we have committed ourselves—the United Na¬  tions Charter in particular—have become “outmoded,” inap¬  propriate to the complexities of current history, which require a  powerful executive, free to react with overwhelming military  force to real or alleged “emergencies” and “attacks”—such as  the alleged Tonkin Bay attack. In the world-dominant power,  this disregard for the formalities must cause very great con¬  cern.   Randolph Bourne once warned of the intellectuals who “tell  us that our war of all wars is stainless and thrillingly achieving  for good”; we have a right to become even more alarmed when   ',\n",
       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal    they tell us (not in so many words, to be sure, but by the  policies they advocate) that our national self-interest requires  that we tear to shreds the delicate fabric of international law  and disregard our treaty commitments and constitutional pro¬  cesses. Granting the inadequacies and frequent injustice of in¬  ternational law and the institutions set up to give it substance,  there is still much truth in the conclusion of the Lawyers Com¬  mittee on American Policy in Vietnam: “. . . the tragedy in  Vietnam reveals that the rules of law, when so flagrantly disre¬  garded, have a way of reasserting the calm wisdom underlying  their creation. If international law had been followed, both  Vietnam and the American people would have been spared  what Secretary General U Thant has described as ‘one of the  most barbarous wars in history.’ ” 43  The disregard for law and treaty was illustrated strikingly by  our behavior with respect to the Geneva agreements of 1954.  Much has been made of the fact that in a technical sense we  did not clearly commit ourselves to uphold these agreements.  The record, however, must not be forgotten by those who are  concerned to restore a measure of decency to our international  behavior. At Geneva, Mr. Bedell Smith did explicitly commit  the United States to observe the French-Vietnamese Agreement  on Cessation of Hostilities and paragraphs 1-12 of the Final  Declaration of the Conference (pointedly omitted was para¬  graph 13, which provided for consultations “to ensure that the  agreements . . . are respected,” an interesting omission, in the  light of subsequent attempts to achieve a negotiated settle¬  ment). The Final Declaration states that “the military demarca¬  tion line is provisional and should not in any way be interpreted  as constituting a political or territorial boundary,” and calls for  elections under international control as part of a political set¬  tlement based on “the principles of independence, unity and     if - - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   territorial integrity” for all of Vietnam. Apparently, the United  States had no intention of fulfilling its Geneva commitment, a  fact that is admitted with remarkable frankness. For example,  the Honorable Kenneth T. Young, Director of Southeast Asian  Affairs in the State Department from 1954 to 1958, writes that  in 1954 “our aim was an independent South Vietnam with a  strong government responsive to the nationalist aspirations of  the population.” 44 Thus our aim was to violate our commitment  at Geneva. This aim was part of our general program of “trying  to safeguard South Vietnam as part of the Tetainment’ of all or  most of non-communist Asia,” “of helping the Vietnamese to  create stability, security and prosperity south of the 17th paral¬  lel” so as “to deter aggression and subversion from the North”—  all in violation of our commitment at Geneva to a unified Viet¬  nam, with supervised elections in 1956. Obviously one could  hardly have supposed that “North Vietnam,” prior to the  scheduled elections in 1956, would carry out “aggression and  subversion,” and as events were to prove, nothing occurred in  those years that could even remotely be construed in such  terms, despite the Diemist repression and Diem’s refusal (with  our support) to undertake the 1955 consultations that were  provided for by the Geneva accords.   Secretary Dulles, it will be recalled, went still further in his  aims, as when he advised the French ambassador, prior to the  conference, that “above all, the deltas of the Red and Mekong  rivers must be retained as bases from which a counterattack  could recover what was lost to the Viet Minh at the conference  table.” 45 It would be interesting, though probably impossible,  to trace the ways in which the United States and its Saigon ally  acted on this concept. Bernard Fall claims, on what evidence he  does not say, that “constantly since 1956” small saboteur groups  have been parachuted or infiltrated into North Vietnam, though  ',\n",
       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal    “the casualty rate is very high and successes, if any, are few and  far between.” 46 Richard Goodwin dates these attempts from  1958. 47 Recall that even according to American propaganda,  “There was no serious threat [in South Vietnam] until 1959-60,  when North Vietnam set in motion a systematic effort to seize  control of South Vietnam by force.” 48 In fact, the American  government claims only that infiltration of trained South Viet¬  namese cadres began in 1959; even just prior to the American  takeover of the war in early 1965, surveys of Vietcong prisoners  and defectors found “most native South Vietnamese guerrillas  unaware of any North Vietnamese role in the war, except as a  valued ally.” 4 ® A comparative study of the success of the South  Vietnamese commandos in North Vietnam and the Northern-  trained South Vietnamese cadres sent to South Vietnam in the  1960s might provide an interesting commentary on some of the  strange ideas about “revolutionary guerrilla war” that appear in  current American propaganda.   It is curious, incidentally, that today only the United States  and the “Communists” insist that South Vietnam is a separate  and independent entity. The Saigon authorities maintain, in  article 1 of the new constitution, that “Vietnam [not South  Vietnam] is a territorially indivisible, unified, and independent  republic,” of which they claim to be the rulers; article 107 of the  constitution specifies that article 1 cannot be amended. Hence  in their view, even if Ho Chi Minh were to have sent his entire  army to South Vietnam, he would not have been guilty of “ag¬  gression,” but only of insurrection and subversion.   There is, however, a much more dangerous development than  the falsification and cynicism of the American government with  respect to its international commitments and to domestic and  international law, namely, the tolerance by even enlightened  American opinion of the notion that we have a perfect right to    ',\n",
       " '    AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    intervene in the internal affairs of Vietnam, to determine the  “legitimate” elements in South Vietnamese society, and to direct  the development of social and political institutions of our choice  in that unfortunate country. It is shameful but undeniable that  the turmoil over the war in the United States would never have  risen beyond a whisper had we met with success in our attempt  “to strengthen the police and security forces and other institu¬  tions contributing to a modern police state” in South Viet¬  nam. 50 One is no longer even surprised to read the recommen¬  dation, from a_ knowledgeable and quite liberal correspondent,  that “The United States ought to send [to Vietnam] the best  people it has, at this sensitive business of political reorienta¬  tion,” so that the field will not be left to the NLF. 61 As he  points out, our Vietnamese “are playing a power game, both  locally and in Saigon, for their own special privileges and inter¬  est,” and they have “little but contempt for the villagers.”  Therefore, we must find a way to win allegiance for them  among the peasantry. Imagine how Saville Davis would react  on reading such a recommendation in Pravda. Both he and his  readers take for granted, however, that the United States has  the right to carry out “political reorientation” (not to speak of  the right to use military force) anywhere in the world.   The Vietnamese revolutionaries may or may not succeed in  freeing their country from American domination, but they have  already succeeded in shattering American complacency with  regard to our international role. American power is so great that  no outside force can call us to account; hence the overwhelming  urgency of the effort to overcome the effects of a generation of  indoctrination and a long history of self-adulation.

       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal   Ogy and the tradition of conformism that makes a mockery of  the values we pretend to hold.   The first step towards political sanity must be intensive self-  examination, exposure not only of what we do and what we  represent in the world today, but also of the attitudes that color  and distort our perception of our international behavior. A re¬  markable expression of these attitudes appears in a deservedly  famous article by Neil Sheehan, written on his return from  three years as a war correspondent in Vietnam. 02 From his  direct observations, he concludes that “for its own strategic and  political ends, the United States is . . . protecting a non-Com-  munist Vietnamese social structure that cannot defend itself  and that perhaps does not deserve to be defended.” “Idealism  and dedication are largely the prerogative of the enemy”; “in  Vietnam, only the Communists represent revolution and social  change” and “despite their brutality and deceit, remain the only  Vietnamese capable of rallying millions of their countrymen to  sacrifice and hardship in the name of the nation and the only  group not dependent on foreign bayonets for survival.” On our  side are the military, and the “mandarins drawn from the mer¬  chant and landowning families” who had collaborated with the  French just as they collaborate with us. 63 He points out that  the existing social system defends privilege and that “many  young Vietnamese of peasant origin join the Vietcong because  the Communists . . . offer them their best hope of avoiding a life  on the rung of the ladder where they began—-at the bottom.  He describes the new construction in Saigon, virtually all “lux¬  ury apartments, hotels and office buildings financed by Chinese  businessmen or affluent Vietnamese with relatives or connec¬  tions within the regime . . . destined to be rented to Americans,   while “Saigon’s workers live, as they always have, in fetid slums   ',\n",
       " '    *— AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   on the city’s outskirts.” But these are the lucky ones—lucky,  that is, in comparison with the more than a million refugees,’  most of whom have left their homes “because they could no’  longer bear American and South Vietnamese bombs and shells”  or the hundreds of thousands killed and wounded, victims  largely of “the extraordinary firepower of American weaponry,”  often turned against helpless villagers by cynical South Viet¬  namese officials .® 4 He describes the American strategy as one of  “creating a killing machine ... and then turning this machine  on the enemy in the hope that over the years enough killing will  be done to force the enemy’s collapse through exhaustion and  despair” 65 —the enemy being, for the most part, the rural popu-  lation of South Vietnam.   Sheehan concludes this account in the following way: “De¬  spite these misgivings, I do not see how we can do anything  but continue to prosecute the war,” although he cannot fail to  ask himself “whether the United States or any nation has the  right to inflict this suffering and degradation on another people  for its own ends.” The reason: any other course “might under-  mine our entire position in Southeast Asia.”   Many people have commented on the disparity between the  contents of this article and the conclusions that Sheehan ex¬  presses. But there is a more important point that has received  very little attention. Sheehan begins his account by saying that  when he arrived in Vietnam he   believed m what my country was doing in Vietnam. With military  and economic aid and a few thousand pilots and Army advisers,  the United States was attempting to help the non-Communist  Vietnamese build a viable and independent nation-state and de¬  feat a Communist guerrilla insurgency that would subject them to  a dour tyranny.    ',\n",
       " '    The Logic of Withdrawal   He is disillusioned only because of the devastating conse¬  quences, for Vietnam and its people, to which this attempt led.  But he still does not question that we had a perfect right to use  military force to determine the structure of South Vietnamese  society and to defeat an insurgent movement which we had  decided “would subject them to a dour tyranny.” There is no  aggressor in history who could not have provided a similar  “justification” for his actions—and many have offered precisely  such justifications. The assumption that we have the right to  impose our will on the Vietnamese (in their best interests, of  course) is almost unchallenged. It is for this reason that one  cannot be too hopeful about the prospects of reaching liberal  American opinion in any fundamental way, on the central issues  of war and peace, freedom, and national self-determination.   There are few who challenge the assumption that we have a  perfect right to determine the legitimate elements in South  Vietnamese society, or to use force to impose the social and  political institutions that we, in our wisdom and benevolence,  have selected for South Vietnam—so long as this attempt is not  too costly to make it worthwhile. The spectrum of “responsible”  opinion extends from those who proclaim openly that we have  this right to those who formulate our goals in a way that pre¬  supposes it. As to the latter, consider the final report to Con¬  gress by Defense Secretary McNamara, probably as sane a  voice as one is likely to hear in Washington these days. We are  fighting in Vietnam, he says, “to preserve the principle that  political change must not be brought about by externally di¬  rected violence and military force.” But it is, in his view, per¬  fectly legitimate for “externally directed violence and military  force” to be employed to guarantee political stability—that is,  when it is the United States that exercises this force. In fact, he     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    goes still further. We even have the right to use our military  force to carry out political and social change. Thus the pacifica¬  tion program, which is under American military control,  “involves nothing less than the restructuring of Vietnamese soci¬  ety,” but it is, in his view, a legitimate, in fact laudable pro¬  gram. 56 Thus the principle that we are fighting to preserve is  not the principle of nonintervention by military force in the  affairs of other nations. Rather, it is the principle that the  United States, and the United States alone, may intervene in  the internal affairs of other nations to guarantee political sta¬  bility and even to restructure their society. Secretary Mc¬  Namara is of course aware of the fact that the role of North  Vietnam in “externally directed violence” has always been, and  now remains, far slighter than our own; it is the department that  he headed—the Department of Defense—that has provided most  of the evidence on this matter. But North Vietnamese inter¬  ference has been in support of social change of a sort that we  define as illegitimate, whereas ours is in support of stability  (or occasionally, restructuring) that we have determined to be  quite proper. To be concise, we are fighting in Vietnam in ful¬  fillment of our role as international judge and executioner—  nothing less.   Secretary McNamara’s formulation of our goals in Vietnam is  given in calm and measured tones and is for this reason decep¬  tively reassuring. With less subtlety, the same presuppositions  are expressed in the words of a congressman from Texas,  twenty years ago:   No matter what else we have of offensive or defensive weapons,  without superior air power America is a bound and throttled  giant; impotent and easy prey to any yellow dwarf with a pocket  knife . 67    ',\n",

       " '  The Logic of Withdrawal   What is important in such statements as this is not the under¬  current of racism—though that is bad enough—but rather the  notion that we are “easy prey” to these yellow dwarves with  their pocket knives. Obviously, we are “easy prey” to them only  in their countries, where we have a perfect right to be. .   Why do we have this right? The answer has been given by  many statesmen and scholars: It is in our national interest.  President Johnson has expressed the matter quite clearly on  occasion, for example, in the following statement (November 2,  1966):   There are three billion people in the world and we have only 200  million of them. We are outnumbered 15 to one. If might did  make right they would sweep over the United States and take  what we have. We have what they want.   Consequently, “we are going to have to stand and say: ‘Might  doesn’t make right’ ”—as we are doing in South Vietnam, for  example. Or in Guatemala, where according to Guatemalan  Vice-President Marroquin Rojas, “American planes based in  Panama take part in military operations in Guatemala” m which  “napalm is frequently used in zones suspected of serving as  refuge for the rebels.” 58   When President Johnson pleads that we are defending our-  selves against a superior force, that we must stand m Vietnam  or else they will “sweep over the United States and take what  we have,” he is, unfortunately, representing a substantial, prob¬  ably dominant body of American opinion. To us today, it may  seem difficult to understand how it could be seriously believed,  thirty years ago, that a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy was threat¬  ening the survival of Germany, the bearer of the spiritual values  of Western civilization. 59 To others today, it may be equally  difficult to take seriously the picture of the strongest, richest  nation on earth cowering in terror behind its missiles and nu-      * AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   clear warheads, in fear that “what we have” will be taken away  if we allow a tiny country halfway around the world to follow  its own course in freedom from American domination. Never¬  theless, this characterization is no caricature. People in the so-  called “peace movement” have a tendency to regard Lyndon  Johnson as an illegitimate usurper who does not represent the  mainstream of American opinion. They are probably deluding  themselves. Statements such as those just quoted may very well  reflect prevailing American attitudes, and one who wishes to  think realistically about the American imperial role would do  well to bear this in mind—as he should bear in mind the fact  that this is a country in which a leading liberal commentator,  after all that has happened in the past three years, can describe  the American war in Vietnam in these terms:   [America] is fighting a war now on the principle that military  power shall not compel South Vietnam to do what it does not  want to do, that man does not belong to the state. This is the  deepest conviction of Western Civilization, and rests on the old  doctrine that the individual belongs not to the state but to his  Creator, and therefore has “inalienable rights” as a person, which  no magistrate or political force may violate . 60   As I have just pointed out, we are not the first nation to have  seen itself as fighting to defend the “deepest convictions of  Western civilization.” When James Reston, with the access to  information that he has, can seriously contend that we have been  fighting to preserve the inalienable rights of the people of Viet¬  nam against “military power” or “political force,” we can see  what a long road lies ahead before there is any hope that this  country will recover its political sanity.   The colonialist mentality that colors the American perception  of the Vietnam war is strikingly evident in the reactions of those  who are turning against the war as its monstrous character   ',\n",
       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal   becomes too plain to hide. Several months ago, for example, the  top leaders of the International Voluntary Services resigned-  some after almost a decade of work in Vietnamese villages—  “because they believed that our military action was proving  counterproductive, and threatened to alienate the majority of  the Vietnamese from their American saviours.” 61 The IVS  group paints a grim picture of the consequences of our military  intervention in Vietnam, in terms that are not unfamiliar to  readers of the American press. Their resignation was intended  as a protest against policies which, they predict, can only serve  to drive still more of the population into association with the  NLF. They assert that our “commitment” in Vietnam has al¬  ways been to one element of Vietnamese society, “the urban-  educated group, which has felt that a noncommunist, inde¬  pendent government would best serve their interests and the ^  interests of their compatriots in the rural villages of South Viet-\\'  nam.” That we had a right to make such a commitment and to  act on it is not questioned in their statement. The “tragedy  unfolding in Vietnam” to which Senator Morton refers is that  we were unable to realize this commitment, to construct a  stable government that would represent the interests of the  Vietnamese, as these interests are interpreted by “the urban-  educated group.”   No one would question the sincerity or dedication of the IVS  leaders, or their undoubted contributions in their work in South  Vietnam. But there is every reason to question their assumption  that we have the right to restructure and organize South Viet¬  namese society, by force if necessary (their resignation came in  the fall of 1967), along lines that we have set. In essence, their  position is not different from that of Lord Cornwallis, whose  “permanent settlement” in India in 1793 restructured village  society, creating a landed aristocracy on the British pattern.      *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his belief that this  civilized arrangement could only benefit the Indians in the long  run. Of course, the new squirearchy also happened to serve  British interests; as the British Governor-General Lord William  Bentinck put it: “If security was wanting against popular  tumult or revolution, I should say that the ‘permanent settle¬  ment\\' ... has this great advantage ... of having created a vast  body of rich landed proprietors deeply interested in the con¬  tinuance of British Dominion and having complete command  over the mass of the people\" (1829). Our reasons for wanting to  control Vietnam are not those of the British in India in 1829, but  m Vietnam, as in the Philippines and Latin America, our efforts  are directed to organizing (or restructuring) the society so as to  ensure the domination of those elements that will enter into  partnership with us. That we should do so is not surprising,  surely not to anyone who is familiar with the history of impe¬  rialism. What is extraordinary is that at this late date we should  act with so little awareness of what we are doing, that we still  find it possible to deceive ourselves, though few others, 62 with  the classical rhetoric of long-decayed imperialism.   Before continuing with this sketch of American reactions to  the war in Vietnam, I would like to cite another American  military source, which gives much insight into the nature of the  Vietcong success in the face of the titanic military force with  which we have attempted to batter it to the ground:   The success of this unique system of war depends upon almost  complete unity of action of the entire native population. That  such unity is a fact is too obvious to admit of discussion; how it  is brought about and maintained is not so plain. Intimidation has  undoubtedly accomplished much to this end, but fear as the only  motive is hardly sufficient to account for the united and appar¬  ently spontaneous action of several millions of people. One traitor  ',\n",
       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal   in each town would effectually destroy such a complex organiza¬  tion.   This assessment is from a United States War Department  report, in the year 1900; the author is Major General Arthur  MacArthur, and he is commenting, of course, on the campaign  to suppress the Philippine war of national liberation, then ac¬  tively in progress. These remarks are perfectly apropos today. I  quote them to dispel the thought that Vietnam is merely a  unique aberration, a blunder, merely a result of “the politics of  inadvertence,” without roots in our history and without signifi¬  cance for the future.   There is of course a sense in which the liberal critics are correct  when they refer to the Vietnam war as an “aberration.” In Viet¬  nam, we lost control. The Vietnamese refused to play the game  the way they were expected to when the war was simulated on  the RAND Corporation computers. They did not realize that  they were supposed to yield when the pressure reached a certain  point. Therefore, we were forced to escalate beyond any reason¬  able level, to a stage where our economy and society can hardly  bear the cost. In this respect, it is true, Vietnam is an aberration.  In all other respects it is a natural consequence of the policy that  was described three quarters of a century ago by Brooks Adams,  in prophetic words, when he proclaimed: “Our geographical posi¬  tion, our wealth, and our energy pre-eminently fit us to enter  upon the development of Eastern Asia and to reduce it to part of  our economic system.” The suppression of the movement for  Philippine independence, shortly after, was only the first attempt  to put into practice the policy of reducing Eastern Asia to part  of our economic system. At that time, we were defending Chris¬  tianity from the savage Moros. Now, we are defending the free  world from the International Communist Conspiracy. In other       . ■*= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   respects, little has changed, except for the scale of our attack.   Again, the example of the Philippine war illustrates the need  to turn our attention from the problems of Southeast Asia to  those of the United States—to the ideological commitments on  which American initiatives are based, and the national self-  image that permits them to be tolerated with such equanimity;  in particular, the unshakable belief in American goodwill and  generosity that persists through each calamity—notably, among  the self-styled “hardheaded and pragmatic liberals”—and that  stultifies political thinking and debases political discourse. We  can, for example, learn a great deal about the sources of Ameri¬  can Vietnamese policy by observing how American scholarship  comes to terms with the suppression of the Philippine struggle  for independence—in which, incidentally, there were well over  100,000 Filipino casualties. Thus Louis Halle argues that “we  could not hand the Philippines back to the Spanish tyranny,  and they were in no condition to govern themselves or encom¬  pass their own defense. If we simply got out and came home we  would leave chaos behind,” with the Germans and Japanese  lurking in wait. Therefore, the United States, “having inad¬  vertently become responsible for the Philippines, had no alter¬  native to assuming, itself, the obligation of governing and  defending what consequently became the first item of an Ameri¬  can overseas empire.” 63   It need hardly be pointed out that it was the American ex¬  peditionary force from whom the Filipinos needed “defense.”  Nor will I discuss the kind of society that we bequeathed  them, 64 except to remark that for reasons that are perhaps  obvious, the Huk guerrillas once again appear to be in control of  large areas of central Luzon, setting the stage for what may be a  bloody re-enactment of the tragedy of Vietnam.   We can also learn a good deal from the reactions of American    ',\n",
       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal    observers to the tensions that have developed between the  United States and the Philippines in the postwar period. Con¬  sider, for example, the remarks of David Sternberg, 05 who asks  “what has happened to the Philippine reservoir of good will and  friendship toward Americans” since formal independence was  granted to our Philippine colony? To this long-term resident of  the Philippines and former AID adviser, it appears that there  were “few complex problems” under the American occupation,  “once the scars of war had healed and America’s good inten-  tions had gained credence” and “the mass of Filipinos were able  to relate the realization of their personal hopes and aspirations  to a benign American presence.” But now, “the commercial  American, though still benign employer, is also a potential  competitor.” The old, mutually satisfactory “mentor-student”  relation, suffused by the warmth of the benign employer to his  wards, is difficult to reconstruct under the conditions of formal  independence. Of course, there is hope, for example, in the  “cultural predisposition toward private enterprise” and the ex¬    istence of “a small but highly competent body of planners and  managers at the top level of the private economic sector.” The  hope is not dimmed by the fact that seventy years after the  “benign American presence” was established by force, three  quarters of the population live under conditions unchanged  since the Spanish occupation, under the continuing rule of a  political and economic elite who were “coopted into the colonial  regime” and have “an affectionate respect for the American way  of life.” 66 a resoect not unrelated, perhaps, to the great privi¬    leges that they enjoy as a consequence of the American con¬  quest. 67   It is remarkable to see how easily perceptive and informed  commentators succeed in deluding themselves as to the charac¬  ter of American actions and policies. For example, Roger Hils-     *== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   man, in his recently published study of policy making under the  Kennedy administration, To Move a Nation , discusses the at¬  tempt to concentrate the peasantry in “strategic hamlets” in the  early 1960s, maintaining that “the primary role of the strategic  hamlet was to provide [the peasants] ... a free choice between  the Viet Cong and the government.” As he makes very clear,  this “free choice” was to be provided by careful police work  inside the hamlets (“for it seemed obvious that putting up de¬  fenses around a village would do no good if the defenses en¬  closed Viet Cong agents”); the failure of the program he at¬  tributes to the fact that “there had been no real effort to isolate  the population from the Viet Cong by eliminating Viet Cong  agents and supporters inside the strategic hamlets and by im¬  posing controls on the movement of people and supplies . . .  Viet Cong supporters and agents . . . had no difficulty repene¬  trating the hamlet and continuing subversion.” Thus the pro¬  gram failed “to provide the villager with physical security, so  that he has a choice of refusing to cooperate with the Viet Cong,”  a “free choice” which is obviously denied him as long as Viet-  cong supporters are permitted to exist in his village.   There is no doubt an important difference between this level  of self-deception and that of Marshal Ky, who describes the  philosophy of his government as “100 percent social revolu¬  tionary,” 68 or CIA analyst George Carver, who tells us of “the  genuine social revolution now taking place in the urban areas of  South Vietnam.” 69 The natural reaction to such pronounce¬  ments is one of ridicule, but amusement fades when one begins  to calculate the human cost.   Let us return to Howard Zinn’s study (cf. note 1), in the light  of some of these general observations. Zinn has some apt re¬  marks about the moral blindness that permits America to re¬  main insensitive to the agony of Vietnam. “We listen with the   ',\n",
       " '         The Logic of Withdrawal    languor of a people who have never been bombed, who have  only been the bombardiers.” “We have no Hiroshima, no city of  the blind and maimed, no professors haggard from long terms  m jail ... we have never been forced . . . to recognize our  deeds,^ to bow, to apologize, to promise a life of peace. We  have, in other words, never been caught.” Thus protest is muted  and diffuse, as “Uncle Sam, the white-gloved financier of coun¬  terrevolution has removed his gloves, taken gun in hand, and  moved into the jungle,” and has slowly composed “an enormous  pattern of devastation which, if seen in its entirety, would have  to be described as one of the most evil acts committed by any  nation in modern times.”   There are, I think, certain gaps in Zinn’s analysis of the  factors that prevent withdrawal of what can only be described as  our army of occupation. Consider the matter of prestige. Zinn  disposes effectively of the claim that our prestige as a nation  would be diminished by withdrawal, noting that this would  satisfy a range of opinion that extends from Adenauer to the  Japanese left. But there is also the matter of internal prestige—  the factor to which Eric Hobsbawm referred when he pointed  out that American policy making often seems less concerned   with red areas on the map than with red faces in the Penta¬  gon.   Furthermore, it may be that in some respects Zinn under¬  estimates the subtlety of those whose arguments he counters.  For example, he remarks that “we see every rebellion as the  result of some plot concocted in Moscow or Peking,” and that  the Russians make the same mistake, attributing revolts “in  Hungary or Poznan ... to bourgeois influence or to American  scheming.” Although one can, to be sure, become a prisoner of  one’s own propaganda, it is nevertheless difficult to believe that  the Russian leaders so misunderstood the events of 1956; more     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   likely, they were unwilling to tolerate an erosion of their power  in a sensitive buffer area and found in “bourgeois influence” and  “American scheming” a useful propaganda cover. Similarly, it  strains credulity to suppose that our present Secretary of State  was simply deluded when he described “the Peiping regime,” in  1951, as “a colonial Russian Government—a Slavic Manchukuo  on a’larger scale.” Ample evidence was available to him to show  the absurdity of this evaluation, for example, in the State De¬  partment White Paper on China published not long before.  More likely, as in the case of the Hungarian revolution, it was  necessary to find a way to justify a variety of long-range poli¬  cies: strengthening the Western alliance and rearming Ger¬  many, expanding the nuclear arsenal, stemming popular revolu¬  tions in the Third World and subverting or strangling those that  had taken place. Similarly, it is not easy to convince oneself that  the director of the CIA, Allen Dulles, really believed that Mos¬  sadegh was willfully “creating a Communist state,” or that Assis¬  tant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas Mann  was so woefully ignorant of world affairs as to suppose that the  Dominican revolution in 1965 resulted from the machinations of  a “Sino-Soviet military bloc.” Rather, one must adapt to current  styles of acceptable international behavior. It would not do to  use today the phraseology of Secretary of State Philander Knox  who sent marines into Cuba in 1908 saying that “the United  States does not undertake first to consult the Cuban Government  if a crisis arises requiring a temporary landing somewhere.” And  in general, the “international Communist conspiracy” is a perfect  propaganda device to justify actions that reinforce and extend  American hegemony, serving our aims just as “bourgeois influ¬  ence and American scheming” serve those of Russian imperial¬  ism. In both cases there is, of course, a background of fact that    ',\n",
       " '             The l-ogic of Withdrawal    gives a superficial plausibility to the fabrications of the propa¬  gandist.   Similarly, I think that Zinn does not go far enough in analyz¬  ing the justification for the war given by the dissatisfied liberals,  a very important matter if one hopes to construct a domestic  political base for a policy of disengagement in Vietnam, or  more generally, for a significant reorientation of American in¬  ternational behavior away from the policy of repression and  “restructuring” on American terms, disguised as “anti-Commu-  nism and “preservation of order.” I have already given a num¬  ber of illustrations of the ideological blinders that must be re¬  moved before sensible discussion can even begin. Others can  easily be added.   Consider, for example, Richard Goodwin’s essay, cited in  note 47. Goodwin constructs a powerful argument against the  war, but concludes nevertheless that the war is ultimately justi¬  fied, in part on grounds of American self-interest, in part be¬  cause of the necessity for “protecting Asia from dominion or  conquest by a hostile power.” As to the first, “the bedrock vital  interest of the United States,” which must serve as the “single  standard” against which any step in policy making must be  tested, is “to establish that American military power, once  committed to defend another nation, cannot be driven from the  field”—even if, as in the case in question, an American with¬  drawal would be in the face of an “enemy” that is largely in¬  digenous. 70 If we generalize this “bedrock vital interest” to  other great powers, the outlook for the future is dim. The Soviet  Union, for example, could have used this argument to justify its  military intervention in Hungary (in support of what it re¬  garded as the legitimate government, against rebels incited  from the outside and including fascist elements, etc.), or to    ',\n",

Taking note of these dangers , o _  reads with concern the claims of some social scientists that then  discipline is essential for the training of those to whom t ey  refer as “the mandarins of the future.- Philosophy and liter*  ture still “have their value,” so Ithiel Pool informs us but rt is  psychology, sociology, systems analysis, and political scienc  that provide the knowledge by which “men of power are  humanized and civilized.” In no small measure, the Vietnam  war was designed and executed by these new mandarins, and  it testifies to the concept of humanity and civilization they are   likely to bring to the exercise of power . 6   Is the new access to power of the technical intelligentsia a  delusion or a growing reality? There are those who perceive the  “skeletal structure of a new society” in which the leadership w  rest “with the research corporation, the industrial a ora ones,  the experimental stations, and the universities,” with the sci¬  entists, the mathematicians, the economists, and the engineers  of the new computer technology”-“not only the best talents  but eventually the entire complex of social prestige and social  Status will be rooted in the intellectual and scientific commu  ties\\'—\\' A careful look at the “skeletal structure” of this new  society, if such it is, is hardly reassuring. As Daniel Bell pom s  out “it has been war rather than peace that has been large y  responsible for the acceptance of pianning ;and «\"atic  modes in government,” and our present “mobilized society  one that is geared to the “social goal” of “military and war  preparedness.” Bell’s relative optimism regarding * e “fj  ety comes from his assumption that the university is the P ac  where theoretical knowledge is sought, tested, and codified u i a  disinterested way” and that “the mobilized postures of the Cold  War and the space race” are a temporary aberration, a reaction    ',\n",
       " '    £ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   maintain its missiles in Cuba (there to defend against American  invasion), in which case we would not now be discussing Viet¬  nam or anything else.   Still more interesting, however, is the secbnd argument: that  we must protect Asia from dominion or conquest by a hostile  power. I will not dwell on the fact that all reputable authorities  agree that the Vietnamese are strongly anti-Chinese, 71 so that if  we were really interested in containing Chinese expansionism,  we should presumably be supporting Ho Chi Minh, along with  all popular, indigenous forces on the border of China, whatever  their domestic character. What seems to me most revealing,  however, is the reason that Goodwin cites as underlying our  commitment to protect Asia from outside force. It is “the almost  idealistic, compelling conviction that the one nation with the  power to prevent it should not stand aside while nations unwill¬  ingly submit to foreign domination.” Thus we must not “un¬  dermine the central world purpose of the United States the  creation of an international order of independent states.” It  does not occur to him that by suppressing a victorious insurrec¬  tion, we are precisely undermining this “central world purpose  and forcing a nation to “submit to foreign domination.” Nor  does he take note of the fact that we are unable to form a  puppet government with even the legitimacy of those set up by  Germany and Japan—we have not, for example, been able to  find a national figure of the stature of Petain or Wang Ching-  wei to mask our aggression. This sentimental faith in American  benevolence, with its various corollaries (“the politics of inad¬  vertence,” “the inscrutability of history”), is a major factor that  stands in the way of the realistic and common-sense proposal  that Zinn advocates.   Zinn’s discussion of the Munich analogy could also be use¬  fully extended by a consideration of the views of the Kennedy    ',\n",
       " '  The Logic of Withdrawal    liberals. Goodwin, for example, is too sophisticated to accept  the Munich analogy, but he goes on to offer a revealing coun¬  terthesis. He argues, first of all, that in Vietnam we are combat¬  ting not aggression but “internal aggression”—an interesting  phrase, which refers apparently to “aggression” by a revolution- ,  ary movement against a government maintained in power by  foreign arms. And he concludes that what we face is not t  Munich but rather “another episode ... in a long, continuing  conflict.” Other episodes include our “success” in Greece and  Turkey, Soviet intervention in Cuba, the invasion of Korea, the  bombing of Quemoy and Matsu, subversion in the Congo and  the Central African Republic, fighting in Malaya and the Phil¬  ippines and on the Indian border. And now, he adds, “they are  beginning in Thailand.”   But with whom are we engaged in this “long, continuing  conflict”? Certainly not the Soviet Union, which had little to do  with the Sino-Indian border dispute; nor China, which did not  start the civil war in Greece; nor Ho Chi Minh, who, for all his  sins, is not responsible for subversion in the Congo. Nor is  “international Communism” a very convincing devil, in the  wake of the Sino-Soviet split, gestures of independence in East¬  ern Europe and North Korea, the admitted refusal of North  Vietnam, even in its present desperate straits, to kowtow to its  powerful allies. In fact, there is no identifiable adversary. We  are confronted with a mysterious but dangerous force, which  cannot be located or specified in any concrete terms, but which  is there, threatening us. While rejecting the Munich analogy,  Goodwin, the liberal critic, tacitly accepts the assumption on  which it is based and which gives it great plausibility. For if  this force exists, then surely we must stop it in Vietnam before  it lands on the beaches of Florida or Cape Cod.   The unpleasant fact is that if one wishes to pursue the   ',\n",
       " '   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    Munich analogy there is only one plausible contender for the  role of Hitler. And if China or Russia do involve themselves in  World War III over Vietnam, we can be sure that the memory  of Munich will play an important role in their calculations. 72  Arnold Toynbee has put the matter quite succinctly: “The Pres¬  ident manifestly feels that he is speaking with Churchill’s voice  —the Churchill of 1940—but to the ears of peoples who have  suffered from Western domination in the past, his voice sounds  like the Kaiser’s and like Hitler’s.”   There is surely no greater irony than the demand that to  ensure world peace, the United States must develop a strategy  for the containment of China. China is surrounded by American  missiles and huge military bases supporting an army eight thou¬  sand miles from home. It is subject to regular bombardment  from an island that is barely off the mainland, not to speak of  overflights and commando raids, all under the protection of the  Seventh Fleet, admittedly intervening in a civil war. For two  years American planes have been bombing the only railroad  connecting southwestern China, with its industrial center of  Kunming, to the rest of the country—it happens to pass near  Hanoi. Yet even a Roger Hilsman, one of the sanest voices  commenting on Asian affairs, can speak of the “formidable  threat” posed by Communist China, and can conclude that “it  certainly served no useful purpose for the United States to re¬  ward aggression by recognizing Communist China or by encour¬  aging their being seated in the U.N.” 73   It is illuminating to examine in detail Hilsman’s demonstra¬  tion of “Chinese belligerence.” The primary example of “Chi¬  nese aggression” (apart from “aggression” in Korea) is the sup¬  port for the “crude and unsophisticated” insurrections in  “Burma, Thailand, Malaya, the Philippines, and French Indo¬  china,” which the Chinese succeeded in putting “on a more  ',\n",
       " '   The Logic of Withdrawal    effective, politically sophisticated course’’ (p. 285). The totory  of “Chinese belligerence,” of the aggression w ic  careful not to reward, is completed with these  the cancellation of trade contacts with Japan when the Kish  government would not allow the Chinese flag tc.be flownover  its mission in Tokyo; (2) various unrealized totsto g  Kong, including an appeal “to Nationalist leader °  deal” ■ (3) the suppression of the Tibetan revol , ( )   Indian border crisis; (5) “encouraging the local“/“go  a direct use of military force, first in Laos and then in South   Vietnam” (pp. 288 f.)-   It is not easy to decide which of these is the_ most telling  example of Chinese aggression; perhaps Burma, m which ac¬  cording to U Thant in 1965, “there has not been a single  stance of outside help to the Burmese Commum^  period when Chinese Nationalist forces roamed northern Bu  at great cost to the Burmese. It would also be interest! g  discover what evidence was available to the director of intelli¬  gence for the State Department regarding Chinese control, or  even material assistance, in the cases of Thailand, aaya, an  the Philippines—and also to discover why this evidence _  never been made public. “Chinese aggression” in Indochina m  contrast to the responsible and purely defensive posture of the  Western powers, is of course well documented. As to Laos,  Hilsman himself repeats much of the well-known story of the  American attempt to subvert the legitimate  ing it by “pro-Western neutralists” and then a rig g  ta^tatorship-an attempt which continued until 1962 when  Kennedy, in a dramatic and sensible reversal of policy, agieed  Lily to support the neutralist elements that had previous y  Seen backed only by the Communist powers. Quite revealing m  sL neln is Hilsman’s judgment that the real Communist     ★ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   “threat” in Laos “seems more likely to have been an expansion  o pohttea 1 control based on winning peasant support in the  villages (p. 112) a threat rather like that posed by the 1954  Geneva agreements, which, the Vietminh thought, “would give  them half of Vietnam for sure and an excellent opportunity to   win the other half through political subversion,” i.e., an elec-  toral victory (p. 103).   Hilsman also has relevant comments on the Sino-Indian  border dispute. He observes (p. 322) that “the Indians un¬  wisely provided the Chinese ample provocation by adopting a  forward strategy-establishing isolated outposts behind the  Chinese outposts that India felt had encroached on what they  considered their rightful territory-and Prime Minister Nehru  in the early fall of 1962, announced publicly that the Indian  Army had been ordered to clear India’s territory of the Chi¬  nese aggressors.” He points out that the unilateral Chinese pull¬  back of their victorious armies showed that we face “not only a  powerful enemy but a politically skillful one” (p. 338) He does  not unfortunately, go into the background of the conflict, but  excellent Western sources exist that thoroughly refute the sim-  phstic view-advanced, to my knowledge, by not a single  Western scholar-that the border dispute was merely, or even  primarily, a matter of “Chinese aggression.” The issue of Tibet  we need not discuss, since whatever the facts may be—and if  Western scholarship is to be trusted, they are not simply what is  claimed by American propaganda-Tibet is internationally  recognized as a region of China; one might with equal logic  accuse the United States of aggression in Watts, or in the Mis-   S1 ^ PP ,l Del . ta ’ Where ’ rep0rtS indicate > thousands are starving  while Washington plays politics.   Elsewhere, Hilsman demonstrates Chinese aggressiveness on  the basis of the principle of post hoc ergo propter hoc:          The Logic of Withdrawal    It was in November 1957, following the Soviet Sputnik success,  that Mao proclaimed that the “East Wind prevails over the West  Wind” and so heralded the shift from the “Bandung” policy of  peaceful coexistence back to a hard line. In South Vietnam inci¬  dents of guerrilla terrorism and assassination began to mount. [Pp.  418-19]   The same claim is made in connection with his discussion of the  difficulties faced by the “pro-Western neutralist” Phoui Sanani-  kone, who came to power through American intrigue in  Laos:   Phoui and his policy also had the misfortune to come to the  test just when Communist policy was changing away from the  “peaceful coexistence” of the Bandung spirit to the hard line  enunciated by Mao Tse-tung in his “East Wind Over West Wind”  speech in Moscow in November 1957. It was during the next year  that Hanoi, following this new hard line, reached the decision to  begin the guerrilla war against the South. [P. 119]   The suggestion that it was the Chinese hard line that was re¬  sponsible for the failure of the American policy of subversion in  Laos is a most interesting one. According to the American re¬  porter Arthur Dommen, who appears to be Hilsman’s primary  source of information on Laos, the Chinese took no action at all  in Laos until the end of 1959, despite American violations of the  Geneva agreements by the supplying of arms and military train¬  ing by American officers in civilian clothes; 74 and after that  their “interference” consisted of offering support for the neutral¬  ist Souvanna Phouma government that the United States was  trying desperately to replace, first by the “pro-Western neutral¬  ist” Phoui and then by the outright fascist Phoumi Nosavan.  However, this is not the point. To Hilsman, the aggressiveness  of China and Russia is demonstrated by the fact that they sup¬  ported the neutralist Souvanna Phouma against the American-       * = AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   sponsored attempt to overthrow his government through con¬  tinual and intensive subversion.   As to the claim that Hanoi decided to begin guerrilla war in  the South on the basis of Mao Tse-tung’s new hard line, Hils-  man makes no attempt to substantiate this allegation, which is  in conflict with whatever is known of the historical record. 75   Hilsman, recall, was director of intelligence for the State De¬  partment and then Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern  Affairs; he is a Kennedy liberal and an academic expert on  international affairs. His treatment of historical events and the  reasoning on which he bases conclusions about such matters as  “Chinese aggressiveness” can only be described as appalling. Yet  it represents the best and most sophisticated thinking that is to  be found near the center of power, so the available information  indicates. One cannot escape a feeling of alarm on reading  Hilsman’s study of how policy was set in the Kennedy admin¬  istration.   In discussing Chinese aggressiveness, we must bear in mind  that there is a clear sense in which China has already shown  itself to be very aggressive, namely, the following:   We must recognize that an overt act of war has been committed  by an enemy when that enemy builds a military force intended  for our eventual destruction, and that the destruction of that  force before it can be launched or employed is defensive action  and not aggression. As a nation we must understand that an overt  act of war has been committed long before the delivery of that  first blow . 76   One wonders how long it will be before the American Air Force  undertakes defensive action against such overt acts of war on  the part of the Chinese.   It would be wrong to leave this matter of American “con¬  tainment” of China without reference to a few simple facts that          The Logic of Withdrawal   rarely seem to penetrate the American consciousness. There is  something peculiarly ugly about the American reaction to the  attempt of China to achieve national unity, to raise itself from  penury and starvation, to erase a century of degradation. K. S.  Karol 77 puts the matter plainly, in words that Americans would  do well to ponder:   ... by trying to strangle China, which has been permanently on  the edge of famine, and by threatening her with bombs, America  has helped to “harden” the Chinese and make them what they are  today. , . . The American anti-Chinese propaganda . . . boomerangs  on occasion. Pharisaic editorial writers like Joseph Alsop and  others periodically announce with contemptible pleasure Chinese  famines which exist, fortunately, only in their imaginations; but  their editorials are often read in countries with pro-American  governments where famine actually rages. Sooner or later truth  will out, and it is then doubly unfavorable to the Americans, first  because it is disgusting to see the world’s most overfed country  rejoicing that others—even if they are Communist—are suffering  from hunger, and secondly because one discovers that it is not in  China but in their own camp—in Central or South America, for  example—that people are dying of malnutrition . . . today a  Kwangtung peasant eats much better than a peasant in Kerala in  India—and this is known in Asia . 78 ,, _   While sympathizing with China’s problems, one may still  react with dismay, perhaps even outrage, to the authoritarian  and repressive character of the Chinese state, as one may have  varying reactions to the society that is developing. But there is  nothing to justify our shameful treatment of China in the post¬  war years.   With all the cynicism of the mid-twentieth century, it is nev¬  ertheless startling to see how easily the rhetoric of imperialism  comes to American lips, sometimes muted, sometimes entirely  overt. Arthur Schlesinger writes that if our killing machine  achieves a victory in Vietnam, “we may all be saluting the wis-       AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    dom and statesmanship of the American government.” 79 That  an American military victory might be a tragedy—this is un¬  thinkable. Roger Hilsman speaks of “the Korean War, Dien-  bienphu, the two Laos crises, and Vietnam [as] only the open¬  ing guns of what might well be a century-long struggle for  Asia.” 80 What kind of struggle it will be is clear, if Laos and  Vietnam are precedents. The foreign editor of Look magazine  writes:   The Far East is now our Far West. The western frontier of  American power today stands on the far side of the Pacific  Ocean. ... It stretches through the island chain off the Asian  mainland with three toeholds on the continent, Korea, Vietnam  and Thailand. . . . We are a Pacific power—the only Pacific  power. We are there to stay. . . . This is where we have markets  and, except for Japan, no rival producers. 81   These sentiments are familiar. It has been a long-standing belief,  expressed by Cordell Hull, Henry Wallace, Dean Acheson, and  many others, that we can escape recurrent economic stagnation or  internal regimentation only with ever expanding markets. These  words recall the characteristically direct formulations of Harry  Truman, who announced in 1947 (in James Warburg’s paraphrase)  that “the whole world should adopt the American system [which]  could survive in America only if it became a world system,” 82  noting also that unless the trend toward nationalization is reversed,  the “American way” and the “way of peace” will be threatened.   And the natural counterpart to this doctrine is neatly ex¬  pressed in the 1967 Prize Essay of the United States Naval  Institute, by Professor Harold Rood of Claremont College, who  argues as follows:   The U.S. position in the Pacific is no longer what it was in 1941.  The territory which came under direct Japanese attack early in  the war, the Hawaiian islands and the Aleutians, are each sov-   ',\n",
       " '        The Logic of Withdrawal   ereign states today_Yet Hawaii is closer to Peking than it is to   Washington, D.C. The Aleutian islands at their westernmost tip  are closer to China than they are to Seattle, Washington. Where  once the security of the United States could conveniently, it  seemed, rest on Alaska and Hawaii in the Pacific, these two states  now have the right to demand the same kind of security which  each of them once helped furnish to the continental United  States.   Consider the implications. Our allies and our bases in Taiwan,  Camranh Bay, Thailand, also have the right to demand  the same kind of security which each of them now helps furnish  to Alaska and Hawaii. And so on, indefinitely. Of course, we  have heard all of this before. Japan once needed Manchuria for  survival—without Manchuria, it was a “potted plant,” without  roots. And to secure Manchuria it was obviously necessary to  ensure that North China was “friendly,” and then all of China,  and Southeast Asia, and on to the Pacific war. Our claim to  special rights in Asia is, on grounds of security or economic  interest, far weaker than that of Japan. Japan, however, was  dwarfed in wealth and power by a colossus across the seas, and  we are not.   Along such lines as these, one could develop an instructive  sequel to Howard Zinn’s discussion of “Munich, dominoes, and  containment.”   What would be the consequences of a withdrawal of Ameri¬  can forces from Vietnam? If past events are any guide, the  cessation of aggressive military action by the United States will  lead to a disengagement of North Vietnamese units, as hap¬  pened, apparently, during the bombing pause in January 1966.  It is noteworthy that no group in South Vietnam has advocated  North Vietnamese involvement in an immediate political solu¬  tion, and the same North Vietnamese leadership that was will¬  ing, a decade ago, to arrange a modus vivendi with Diem        *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   would very likely agree to negotiate the problems of Vietnam  with a government that would at least respond to its diplomatic  notes. Just what might emerge from the shattered debris of  South Vietnamese society, no one can predict with any confi¬  dence. It is clear, however, that under the American occupation  there can be only unending tragedy. A few years ago, the  Premier of Ceylon commented that “the best form of foreign  aid the United States can give to small countries is to abstain  from interfering in their affairs.” As applied to Vietnam, at  least, this grim appraisal is no longer an arguable matter.   Postscript   Shortly before his death, Bernard Fall told an interviewer the  story of a Vietnamese who listened to an American general  boasting of one of the latest victories of the Vietnam campaign.  “Yes, General, I understand,” said the Vietnamese, “but aren’t  your victories coming closer and closer to Saigon?” 83 The pre¬  ceding essay was completed in January 1968. Within a week,  American victories reached Saigon itself. Several months after,  it seems that the Tet offensive represents a turning point in the  war.   For the past decade there have been two versions of the  tragedy of Vietnam. The first is that of the war correspondents.  Their message has been that Vietnamese resistance is so deeply  embedded in the fabric of Vietnamese society that American  “victory” can be achieved only through annihilation. The sec¬  ond is the official story, too familiar to bear repetition. Time  after time after time the correspondents’ version has been proven  correct by events. Now, in the wake of the Tet offensive, there  is only one story. Apart from lonely relics like Joseph Alsop and  a few Southeast Asian scholars, everyone now seems to under¬  stand that there are only two probable endings to the Vietnam  ',\n",
       " '       The Logic of Withdrawal   tragedy : annihilation or withdrawal of the American army of  occupation. Annihilation was the prospect foreseen by Bernard  Fall in the interview just mentioned. He quotes a captured  prisoner who says, \"We will all die, but we will not surrender”;  and he concludes that “Vietnam will be destroyed.” Spokesmen  for the NLF and North Vietnam, however, have long argued  that they can win on the battlefield. In the past their estimates  have been realistic. It may be that the Tet offensive-which  brought home to the American public that the official version of  the Vietnamese story was an illusion or a lie—may also have  persuaded American policy planners that there are no military  options remaining, short of drastically changing the nature of  the war and taking a long step towards World War III. If so,  this raises the prospects for peace, that is, for withdrawal of the  American troops. Withdrawal may be called a “negotiated set¬  tlement”; it may be called “victory.” What is important is not  the words but the substance: the return of Vietnam to the  Vietnamese.   It is conceivable, though unlikely, that the Vietnamese resist¬  ance will settle for less. One lesson that has been taught them in  the past twenty years is that the only victories that last are  military ones. The great powers cannot be trusted. They will  resort to treachery and subversion to undermine any diplomatic  settlement. It seems unlikely that the NLF will lay down their  arms so long as they are able to maintain control of substantial  parts of South Vietnam, or that they will accept token representa¬  tion in a coalition, just as it is unlikely that the French resistance  twenty-five years ago Would have terminated its struggle had it  been offered the ministry of health in the Vichy government.   In the last days of January, some S0,000-60,000 Vietcong,  about 10 percent North Vietnamese, 84 took over most of the  urban areas of South Vietnam, obviously with the cooperation       _ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   of hundreds of thousands of urban residents. The American  response was: destroy. According to the Associated Press,  “Heavy bombs, aircraft rockets, naval gunfire, napalm, tear gas  and all the usual ground weapons from eight-inch howitzers to  tank guns are being used in heavily populated city areas. 86  Robert Shaplen reported from Saigon:   A dozen separate areas, comprising perhaps sixty or seventy  blocks, had been totally burned out. These were almost all resi¬  dential areas. . . . Most of the damage was the result of rocket  attacks by American armed helicopters or other planes, thoug  some of it had been caused by artillery or ground fighting,  modern ten-million-dollar textile plant, containing forty thousand  spindles, was entirely destroyed by bombs because it was sus¬  pected of being a Vietcong hideout.   The correspondent for Le Monde-iorc^ to leave the country  soon after-reported that   in the popular suburbs, the Front has proven that the only way to  eliminate its control is through systematic destruction. To dis¬  lodge it, the air force had to level many residential areas. Fleeing  the bombardments, tens of thousands of refugees have poured into  the center of the city. 86   Hu 6 was virtually destroyed by American troops, block by  block, house by house. According to an American military  source, 119 American marines were killed in this operation,  along with 1,584 “North Vietnamese” and some 3,000 civil¬  ians. 87 Charles Mohr reported that “in towns such as Hue,  Vinhlong, Bentre and Mytho appalling destruction was  wrought when encircled allied forces took the decision to de¬  stroy the attacking Vietcong forces by destroying the places they  had occupied.” 88   The American political scientist Milton Sacks has only this to  say, in an article on these events: “In conventional terms, it now  ',\n",
       " '       The Logic of Withdrawal    seems clear that the Communists have suffered a military defeat  in their Tet offensive. They have expended the lives of thou¬  sands of their soldiers without securing a single province or dis¬  trict town of significance”—no word from this Southeast Asian  expert about the means by which this “defeat” was accom¬  plished, or its political meaning. 89 American officials on the  scene manage a somewhat broader view. One official, quoted  by Charles Mohr, stated: “The Government won the recent  battles, but it is important to consider how they won. At first  the Vietcong had won and held everything in some towns ex¬  cept the American military compound and a South Vietnamese  position.” Senator Mansfield is also aware of the realities:  the hamlets, villages and the cities are seen to be honeycombed  with a National Liberation Front infrastructure which has un¬  doubtedly existed for many years, which is still intact, and  which may well be stronger than ever”; there is “not the begin¬  ning of a stable political situation” in South Vietnam 90   In a broadcast from Saigon, Howard Tuchner of NBC stated  that “there is no doubt that the U.S. military position in Viet¬  nam has never been weaker. U.S. officers in Saigon now feel for  the first time that the United States can lose the war militar¬  ily.” 91 The military situation is not widely discussed, but it is  indicated by a report that “more than 1000 planes and helicop¬  ters are reported destroyed or damaged, principally by Russian-  built 122mm. rockets that have a range of eight miles or more.”  According to an unidentified congressman, “one-third of the  U.S. helicopter force in Vietnam has been destroyed or side¬  lined indefinitely . . . losses were almost as heavy in fixed wing  aircraft, particularly in cargo planes.” The Navy is reported to  have sent a helicopter carrier to the northern part of South  Vietnam, in the apparent hope that NLF infiltrators will at least  not succeed in penetrating this sanctuary. 92       AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   In the Mekong Delta, the major cities suffered heavy damage   virtual destruction in some instances—as the Americans de¬  cided in case after case “to destroy the town in order to save it,”  in the words of the American major responsible for the victory  at Ben Tre 93 Still, in April, reports from the countryside are  confused. However, the general situation is clear from the fact  that the IVS has withdrawn most of its field workers because of  “security conditions.” A volunteer reported in February: “The  number of locations at which we can safely place a volunteer  have significantly decreased in recent months”; another said  that “we all knew that security in the countryside was getting  worse and worse.” 94 According to a South Vietnamese senator,  Vong A Sang, the government now controls “only one third of  the country,” the remaining two thirds being occupied by the  Vietcong. 95 The nature of the American war is tersely indicated  by an American official: “What the Vietcong did was occupy  the hamlets we pacified just for the purpose of having the allies  move in and bomb them out. By their presence, the hamlets  were destroyed.” 96 The same report indicates that in Binh Dinh  Province the “showcase” province for pacification—this had  been going on, unreported, for months: “The enemy moves in  December—which several military men called a ‘softening up’  for the offensive—resulted in a wave of allied air strikes on  villages. Hundreds of homes were destroyed.” Newsweek sum¬  marizes the situation in detail, quoting an IVS worker who  reports from Can Tho that almost all of the casualties were  caused by United States fire power, in the American counterat¬  tack: “As difficult as this may be to believe, not a single Viet¬  namese I have met in Saigon or in the Delta blames the Viet  Cong for the events of the past two weeks.” 97 How sur¬  prising.   The Tet offensive led to a significant change in the political   ',\n",
       " '     station m the United States. President Johnson has indicated  that he will not seek re-election. A number of “peace candi¬  dates -who have yet to discuss the fundamental political issues  -have received substantial support. For the first time the  American government appears willing to take tentative steps  towards serious negotiations. It is a devastating indictment of  the state of American democracy that only a major military  defeat was able to bring about these changes in the political  climate. If the past is any guide, only continuing military set¬  backs in Vietnam and the threat of serious dislocation at home  will succeed in moving the government towards concrete steps  that might lead to peace. For the first time, there seems a real  hope that the war will end without extermination of the Viet¬  namese. Nevertheless, those who have devoted themselves to  working for peace in Vietnam can only be saddened by the  realization that they have failed to create the consciousness in  is country that we have no right to win a military victory It is  he miraculous heroism of the Vietnamese resistance that has  forced these tentative moves towards peace in Vietnam. To say  this is not to make a political judgment with regard to the  various forces in Vietnamese society, but only to recognize the  bare and inescapable facts. For the so-called “peace move¬  ment, the recent events pose a major challenge. The “peace  movement” has been getting by for too long with cheap Jokes  out LBJ and with concentration on peripheral issues such as  the bombing of North Vietnam. The challenge it now faces is to  create the understanding that we have no right to set any con¬  ditions at all on a political settlement in Vietnam; that Ameri¬  can military force must be withdrawn from Vietnam, and from  the other simmering Vietnams throughout the world; that  American power and resources and technical skills must be used  to build and not to repress or to “contain” or to destroy      AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    Notes   1.

He  interprets the book as giving “a mild criticism of the American and  South Vietnamese roles,” a conclusion which can only amaze anyone  who has read it, until he realizes that Dillin sees nothing to object to  in “evacuation and total destruction of four Viet Cong-controlled yil-^  lages, including Bensuc,” “a thriving village” of farmers who “were  healthy and relatively prosperous.”   John Mecklin {New York Times Book Review, October 29, 1967)  at least realizes that the reader is likely to feel “violent disgust as the  enormity of Schell’s picture begins to sink in,” and he has to admit  that “much of Schell’s indictment ... is justified, accurate and over¬  due.” But he considers it quite unfair; for example, because it fails to  mention the “monstrous handicaps that plague the United States  effort,” specifically, the lack of command authority over the Saigon  regime (a fact which obviously has no relevance to this purely Ameri¬  can operation, conducted without informing the Vietnamese) and. “the  deplorably short tour of duty ... of Americans in Vietnam, making it  impossible to acquire the kind of experience so badly needed in situa¬  tions such as Bensuc.” He thinks, nevertheless, that the book “should  be required reading in the Pentagon . . . because of its rare pinpointing  of critical areas where the United States could be doing a better job m  Vietnam,” presumably, in conducting such operations even more effi¬  ciently in the future. . t ^ .   These reactions testify to a kind of creeping Eichmanmsm, which m  fact must also explain the limited reaction to the original New York  Times report of the Ben Sue operation, January 11, 1967. Pacification  in Ben Sue had been a total failure, so “the only military or political  solution for this place,” according to the American colonel in charge,  was forced resettlement. Of course, some of. the villagers weren’t too  happy about it. “I imagine there will be a lot of wailing and gnashing  of teeth, but they’ll do what they’re told,” said the colonel.. Some  might not do what they were told, of course. “41 villagers did not.  During the day they were tracked down and killed.” The conclusion?  “Soon the government will have no need to win the hearts and minds  of Bensuc. There will be no Bensuc.”   One can hardly decide which is more scandalous, the events them¬  selves or the muted response.    ',\n",
       " '   ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Mechlin, incidentally is responsible for some of the most amazing  comments on Vietnam. In a review in the New York Times Book  Review, June 4, 1967, he attributes to Thich Nhat Hanh the idiotic  proposal that “both the Americans and the Communists ... go away  and allow the Vietnamese to work things out.” As senior officer in the  United States Mission in Saigon from 1962 to 1964, he might, one  would think, have perceived that the Vietcong were Vietnamese, par¬  ticularly since United States officials in Saigon at the end of 1962  estimated that “about one-half of the South Vietnamese support the  NLF (Robert Scigliano, South Vietnam: Nation Under Stress [Bos¬  ton, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963], p. 145). In his Mission in  Torment (Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday & Company, Inc. 1965),  Mecklin describes the Vietnamese peasant as a man whose “vocabu¬  lary is limited to a few hundred words,” whose “power of reason .  develops only slightly beyond the level of an American six-year-old,”  whose “mind is untrained and therefore atrophies” (p. 76); but  strangely, the political and military tactics of the Vietcong, making use  of techniques that were “skillfully entwined in the life and character of  the Vietnamese peasant,” “confounded not only the U.S. Mission but  also the aristocratic leaders of the Diem regime” (pp. 78-79). Their  forces “were developed to a surprisingly sophisticated degree . . . with  jungle arms factories, radio nets, clandestine hospitals, propaganda  printing presses, . . . V.C. cameramen filming the action” in ambushes  (p. 79); to the Government forces the Vietcong seemed to be “eight  feet tall. And so on.

       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   to Communist aggressiveness. In contrast, a strong argument  can be made that the university has, to a significant degree,  betrayed its public trust; that matters of foreign policy are very  much “a reflex of internal political forces” as well as of eco¬  nomic institutions (rather than “a judgment about the national  interest, involving strategy decisions based on the calculations  of an opponent’s strength and intentions”); that the mobiliza¬  tion for war is not “irony” but a natural development, given our  present social and economic organization; that the technologists  who achieve power are those who can perform a service for  existing institutions; and that nothing but catastrophe is to be  expected from still further centralization of decision making in  government and a narrowing base of corporate affiliates. The  experience of the past few years gives little reason to feel opti¬  mistic about these developments.   Quite generally, what grounds are there for supposing that  those whose claim to power is based on knowledge and tech¬  nique will be more benign in their exercise of power than those  whose claim is based on wealth or aristocratic origin? On the  contrary, one might expect the new mandarin to be dangerously  arrogant, aggressive, and incapable of adjusting to failure, as  compared with his predecessor, whose claim to power was not  diminished by honesty as to the limitations of his knowledge,  lack of work to do, or demonstrable mistakes . 8 In the Vietnam  catastrophe, all of these factors are detectable. There is no point  in overgeneralizing, but neither history nor psychology nor  sociology gives us any particular reason to look forward with  hope to the rule of the new mandarins.   In general, one would expect any group with access to power  and affluence to construct an ideology that will justify this state  of affairs on grounds of the general welfare. For just this reason,  Bell’s thesis that intellectuals are moving closer to the center of     ★- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   power, or at least being absorbed more fully into the decision¬  making structure, is to some extent supported by the phenome¬  non of counterrevolutionary subordination noted earlier. That  is, one might anticipate that as power becomes more accessible,  the inequities of the society will recede from vision, the status  quo will seem less flawed, and the preservation of order will  become a matter of transcendent importance. The fact is that  American intellectuals are increasingly achieving the status of a  doubly privileged elite: first, as American citizens, with respect  to the rest of the world; and second, because of their role in  American society, which is surely quite central, whether or not  Bell’s prediction proves accurate. In such a situation, the dan¬  gers of counterrevolutionary subordination, in both the domes¬  tic and the international arena, are apparent. I think that  0 Brien is entirely correct in pointing to the necessity for “in¬  creased and specific vigilance” towards the danger of counter¬  revolutionary subordination, of which, as he correctly remarks,  “we hear almost nothing.” I would like to devote this essay to a  number of examples.   Several years ago it was enthusiastically proclaimed that “the  fundamental political problems of the industrial revolution have  been solved, and that “this very triumph of democratic social  evolution in the West ends domestic politics for those intel¬  lectuals who must have ideologies or utopias to motivate them  to social action.” 9 During this period of faith in “the end of  ideology,” even enlightened and informed commentators were  inclined to present the most remarkable evaluations of the state  of American society. Daniel Bell, for example, wrote that “in  the mass consumption economy all groups can easily acquire  the outward badges of status and erase the visible demarca¬  tions.” 10 Writing in Commentary in October 1964, he main-  ',\n",

See also Anthony Harrigan, A Guide to the War in Vietnam  (Boulder, Colo., Panther Publications, 1966), for a view of the war  that is probably representative of a significant segment of American  opinion. He points out that American troops are “regaining a spirit  that was characteristic of U.S. troops in the winning of a continent  from the turbulent Indian tribes,” as they fight a war where “an  American can’t tell the VC from the ‘friendlies,’ ” where “the smiling  face of the farmer on his water buffalo beyond the airstrip fence could  be a VC who plans to throw a grenade at you or your airplane,” where  the Tri Quang Buddhists have “become an instrument in the hands of  the enemies of the people of South Viet Nam,” where “the agitation  over gas is another reminder that protecting a people against commu¬  nist aggression usually is a thankless job,” etc., etc.   43.

He adds the  obscure remark that if this independent South Vietnam were viable,  strong, popular, enlightened, and effective, “then the foreign and dip¬  lomatic repercussions of two Vietnams de facto would be easier to  handle, particularly for regulating the relations between North and  South Vietnam in future consultations and elections which we in  Washington envisaged coming at some time, perhaps in 1956 or possi¬  bly a little later.” But the Geneva agreements that we were pledged to  uphold say nothing about “two Vietnams de facto,” nor about an  “independent South Vietnam” as “a strong, viable state,” Obviously, it  is absurd to speak of a viable, independent state bounded by a provi¬  sional demarcation line which “should not in any way be interpreted  as constituting a political or territorial boundary.” It is interesting,  incidentally, that Mr. Young can summarize the American effort to  “promote political viability” in Vietnam from 1954 to 1967 with not a  mention of what happened to those elections that were “envisaged  coming ... in 1956 or possibly a little later.”   Richard Falk has commented on the hypocrisy of the accusation  that North Vietnam challenged world order by its “indirect aggres-  2S0     The Logic of Withdrawal    sion” in South Vietnam in the 1960s, noting that “In Viet Nam  Saigon’s establishment, rather than the subsequent attempt at its re¬  moval, of a political frontier at the seventeenth parallel represented  the coercive challenge to world order,” since the “political settlement  at Geneva in 1954 provided a formula for the nullification (rather  than one for the maintenance) of the division” (“International Law and  the United States Role in Vietnam,” Yale Law Journal, Vol. 76 [May  1967], p. 1118). Similarly, the United States effort to build up the  military strength of the Saigon regime, which enabled it to crush  domestic opposition and institute the “grim dictatorship” that support¬  ers of the American effort were later to deplore, was a clear violation  of our pledge at Geneva not to use force or threat of force to disturb  the accords. Secretary Dulles was as candid as Kenneth Young about  our intention to disregard the Geneva agreements, announcing our  intention to build up “the truly independent states of Cambodia, Laos  and southern Vietnam” {Department of State Bulletin, August 2,  1954, cited in George M. Kahin and John W. Lewis, The United  States and Vietnam [New York, The Dial Press, 1967], p. 61).   It is, incidentally, remarkable that our professed dissatisfaction with  the accords and announced intention not to observe them is often  cited today as somehow relieving us from the obligation to honor  them, as eliminating any onus for this violation.   45.

To mention a  recent one, Louis Heren writes in the London Times, April 20, 1968,  from Washington, that the CIA \"‘did in fact deploy saboteurs in the  North from 1959. They were parachuted in or dropped off the coast  by patrol boats, and Vice-President Ky commanded the air transport  wing of the South Vietnam Air Force in 1962 and 1963. He is known  to have been in charge of the parachute drops. The agents were South  Vietnamese and were trained by the C.I.A. in Special Forces camps,  notably the 77th Special Forces Group. The frogmen were trained at  Da Nang. Apart from destroying bridges and other vulnerable points,  they were also expected to organize guerrilla warfare, especially in the  Catholic areas. Both operations were a complete fiasco, 95 per cent  casualties were admitted in 1963, but the opium trade flourished.”  Heren’s report goes on to discuss the possible connection between  these operations and the opium trade, and the reports under investiga¬  tion by a Senate subcommittee that Marshal Ky was dismissed from  the operation for his participation in opium smuggling.   48. Dean Rusk, December 5, 1966. Cited in Theodore Draper, Abuse  of Power (New York, The Viking Press, Inc., 1967), p. 45. It is  difficult to exaggerate the startling character of the material that  Draper has assembled, particularly with respect to the pronounce¬  ments of Dean Rusk.   49. New York Times, June 7, 1965. Polls taken for CBS in November  1966 and February 1967 indicate that even “among strong anti-Com-  munist South Vietnamese . . . exposed primarily to government propa¬  ganda there still appears to be a rejection of the American idea that  the war is a consequence of ‘aggression from the North’ ” (Richard  Falk, “International Law and the United States Role in Vietnam,” p.  1102 n.). The results are reported in the Times, March 22, 1967.  Even in this biased sample of South Vietnamese opinion, 83% were in  favor of (and 5% opposed to) reunification with the North after the  end of the war, and emphasis on negotiations was preferred to exten¬  sion of military operations to the North by a ratio of 4 to 1.   The poll of Vietcong prisoners cited above showed that ‘‘few of  them considered themselves Communists or could give a definition of  Communism” and confirmed the judgments of most observers that  “the Vietcong function far more through persuasion and indoctrina-    ',\n",
       " \"   The Logic of Withdrawal   tion than through the authoritarianism of traditional armies.” It has  often been emphasized, even by those committed to the American  effort in Vietnam, that “it would be a serious mistake to consider  Communist power in South Vietnam as based predominantly on ter¬  rorism or military strength, or even upon the indifference of an ignor¬  ant peasantry” (Scigliano, op. cit., p. 158). There is near unanimity,  outside of the State Department, that “the historical fact is that force  in the struggle for the South was first used by the Diem regime, not by  the Communists,” that the latter was, moreover, far more restrained,  that although “guidance and assistance from the North” may have  been an important factor in the “amazing success” of the NLF, “it  would have made little headway without wide popular support,” and  that “the war started as a civil war in the South,” well before the  alleged infiltration began (Joseph Buttinger, Vietnam: A Dragon Em¬  battled [New York, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc. 1967], Vol. 2, pp. 976  f., 981-82). Buttinger’s study is quite interesting, not only for its  careful and extensive scholarship but also because he was, for many  years, a strong supporter of the Diem regime and the American in¬  volvement in support of it. He explains, for example, why Diem was  unable to move towards democratic, representative structures: “Local  elections would have given the Vietminh control of most of the rural  communities. The Vietminh was not only popular and in effective  political control of large regions, but it alone had people with the  requisite organizational skills to exploit whatever opportunities for  democratic self-expression the regime opened up.” Thus, “Freely con¬  stituted organizations too would have been captured by the Vietminh”  (p. 856); he adds that “the NLF was truly the Vietminh reborn” and  speaks of “the similarity, or better, near identity, of the Vietminh and  the NLF. He also analyzes the much greater economic progress' in  the North (cf. pp. 928, 966 f.), and notes that repression of dissidence  in the North was less severe than in the South, largely, he feels,  because dissidence was less dangerous (cf. pp. 964 f.).   50. The thrust of “much of the American effort in Vietnam,” according to  Scigliano, who served in the Michigan State University Advisory  Group in Vietnam (op. cit., 1963, p. 197). In contrast, “precious little of  American energies or resources has been devoted to political goals, as  contrasted with the military and economic aims.” His detailed breakdown '  of aid figures shows that military aid was overwhelmingly dominant, even   \",\n",

As to the military, Jonathan Randal points out in the New. York  Times, June 11, 1967, that “only one officer above the rank of lieuten¬  ant colonel did not serve in the French army against the Vietminh in  the French Indochina war.” Perhaps this is part of the reason why the  Saigon army has little interest in the war, while “the Vietcong can  take the same unwilling recruit and turn him into a tiger m six  months” (American regimental adviser), as it may go part way to¬  wards explaining the desertion rates that Randal cites for the elite  battalions in 1966: 22% for the armed forces as a whole, 31% for the  rangers, 33% for the marines, and 45% for the airborne battalions. .   54. See Halberstam, op. cit., for some indication of the incredible  corruption of those to whom he refers as “our Vietnamese.” Their  cynicism has continually scandalized American reporters. Malcolm  Browne, for example, reports that Vietnamese military officers have  ordered hamlets “blown off the map” by American Skyraiders to cover   cases of graft (op. cit., p. 210). _   55. Kahin, op. cit. (see note 8), reports that the medical staff of Hue  hospital estimated that “almost 90% of the war casualties were occa¬  sioned by American and South Vietnamese army air bombardments  and artillery,” and that an American working at Quangnai hospital  “estimated that about 70% of all civilian war casualties had been  inflicted by American, South Korean and South Vietnamese aerial  bombardment and artillery.” Note that these estimates refer to areas  more or less under American control, where victims can hope to reac  the hospitals. What is amazing is that any substantial number of casu¬  alties in such areas are caused by American and allied forces. Even in  Saigon hospital Kahin saw many victims of napalm, mostly children  he was informed by medical students “that it is government policy to  disperse as widely as possible napalm casualties that are brought to  hospitals so that visitors will not conclude that there are so many o   them.” . . „   American reactions to such discoveries are often astonishing For   example, Senator Proxmire inserted into the Congressional Record (May    ',\n",
       " '          The Logic of Withdrawal   26, 1965, S 11799-801) a whitewash of administration policy by Thomas  Ross in the Chicago Sun-Times, May 23, 1965, to show how real experts  support the government. Support the government he does. He also points  out that “the Vietcong have achieved a high degree of immunity” and  “move freely throughout most of the country with little fear that the local  populace will betray them to the government.” Military strategy has  therefore been forced to shift from counterinsurgency to classical war.  But, he observes, “it is still much too soon to tell whether sophisticated  weapons and conventional ground troops can succeed where counter¬  insurgency has failed. In fact, there is some evidence of popular resent¬  ment to the expanding use of napalm, a development which is not sur¬  prising if one has observed a hospital ward full of bleeding women and  children seared from head to toe.” While Mr. Ross and Senator Proxmire  may await the evidence, others will draw their own conclusions, even be¬  fore the inevitable study by the RAND Corporation. ”   56. Excerpts from his secret testimony appear in the New York  Times, February 2, 1968. The Vietcong will be happy to learn, from  his testimony, that we do not “seek the surrender of Vietcong forces;  we would be content to see them lay down their arms and take their  place as peaceful citizens of South Vietnam, or move to the North if  they so desire.” Presumably, the distinction between “surrendering”  and laying down one’s arms” is explained in the censored part of the  testimony.   The remark recalls that of another leading dove, Arthur Goldberg,  who announced our position before the United Nations, in what was  widely described as a “conciliatory” statement, as being: “No military  forces, armed personnel or bases [are] to be maintained in North or  South Vietnam except those under the control of the respective gov¬  ernments” ( New York Times, September 22, 1967). The Vietcong, in  other words, need not surrender; we ask only that it go out of exist¬  ence as a military force. And when the government we have instituted  establishes total military control, we will have no further interest in  retaining our army in Vietnam. The German High Command could   have outlined its goals in France in just the same terms.   57. Lyndon B. Johnson, Congressional Record, March 15, 1948, House,  p. 2883.   58. Marcel Niedergang in Le Monde hebdomadaire, January 18-24,  19 68. The same speech was cited by Hugh O’Shaughnessy in the New\"  Statesman, December 1, 1967, who goes on to say that “similar things   ',\n",
       " '  - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   are happening in Nicaragua, which is virtually a U.S. colony and  where guerrilla warfare broke out this year.” In the Nation, February  5, 1968, pp. 166-67, Norman Diamond reports on the application in  Guatemala of “advanced techniques in counterinsurgency being devel¬  oped in Vietnam,” including heavy bombing in large areas of the  country, “pacification,” even rerouting of rivers “to cover the traces of  bombings and massacres, as well as razing forests and bulldozing  villages”—all under the paternalistic guidance of the American “ad¬  visers.” The American press has yet to cover these events. In general,  the failure of the press to report events in Latin America is scandal¬  ous. The coverage of Latin American events in Le Monde is greater in  scope (and incomparably greater in depth) than anything to be found  in the American press, which, like American scholarship, is little con¬  cerned with American-directed violence in other countries so long as it  is reasonably successful.   The quoted statement of the Guatemalan Vice-President would very  likely cause something of a commotion in liberal circles were it to be  published in the American press. However, hardly an eyebrow would be  raised at other parts of Niedergang’s report, for example, these lines:  “According to M. Antonio Palacios, of the Bank of Guatemala, Two  thirds of the population live in a primitive manner; the infant mortal¬  ity rate is frightful.’ 70 percent of those under 20 have never been to  school; the average life expectancy is scarcely more than 40 years;  hunger and lack of hygiene are a veritable scourge; innumerable  clandestine distilleries produce a fiery brandy called ‘guaro,’ maintain¬  ing a destructive alcoholism; 80 percent of doctors practice in the  capital; outside begins the rule of the ‘sorceror’ and the incantations  which combine Christianity and the Mayan tradition. Finally, there is  83 percent illiteracy, one of the highest proportions in all of Latin  America.”   Recall that in 1954 the people of Guatemala were taking some  small steps towards extricating themselves from this torment.   59. A picture suggested, for example, in the crabbed and involuted  arguments of Martin Heidegger, who, lecturing in 1935, saw Germany  as “the nation with the most neighbors and hence the most endan¬  gered” by the “great pincers,” by the “world character” represented in  its crudest form in Russia and America, where “the domination ... of  a cross section of the indifferent mass has become ... an active  onslaught that destroys all rank and every world-creating impulse of  ',\n",
       " \"       The Logic of Withdrawal   the spirit” ( Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Ralph Manheim, [New  Haven, ^ Conn., Yale University Press, 1959], pp. 45-46)! Ger¬  many, “the most metaphysical of nations,” must forestall “the peril of  world darkening,” and, standing “in the center of the Western world,”  must “take on its historical mission.” “If the great decision regarding  Europe is not to bring annihilation, that decision must be made in  terms of new spiritual energies unfolding historically from out of the  center,” that is, Germany-in 1935. To Heidegger, in 1935, the ciil-  tural mission of Germany is to recapture and advance the “supreme  possibility of human being, as fashioned by the Greeks”—which is  quite natural, since along with Greek, “the German language is (in  regard to its possibilities for thought) at once the most powerful and  most spiritual of all languages” (p. 57). Compare Thomas Mann, who  left Germany in 1933 because he could not, as “a German writer,  made responsible through his habitual use of language, remain silent!  quite silent, m the face of all the irreparable evil which has been  committed daily, and is being committed in my country, against body,  soul and spirit, against justice and truth, against men and man”  (quoted in George Steiner, Language and Silence [New York, Atheneum  Publishers, 1967], p. 102).   60. James Reston, New York Times, November 24, 1967. Reston  does not question that it is “in defending this doctrine” that men are  dying in Vietnam, that this “principle” is in fact what motivates Wash¬  ington; but he admits that in the “profound spiritual bewilderment”  caused by the immense destruction, it is becoming difficult “to believe  m the cause.” A few days earlier (November 15), he had mused on  one of the great “mysteries and tragedies in Vietnam,” “the Hanoi  Government’s continuing refusal to talk about a negotiated settle¬  ment.” The reason for this “continuing refusal” (which will come as a  surprise to those who have been reading the news columns of the  Times for the past three years) is, he feels, that “Ho Chi Minh and his  associates simply cannot believe that the U.S. would make such sacri¬  fices of men and treasure simply to defend the principle of opposing  military aggression—and then withdraw when the principle is sus-  tained”; Reston is convinced that “President Johnson is perfectly sin- '  cere” in “his offers to make peace and withdraw.”   61.

In Novem¬  ber, the British Daily Mail reported that 66% of those questioned in a  poll said Britain should not support the United States, 21% that it should.   It is unfortunate that the press does not see fit to make this informa¬  tion readily available. In countries where the government is somewhat  responsive to public opinion, this enormous groundswell of opposition  to the United States will sooner or later be translated into diplomatic          The Logic of Withdrawal    isolation and, perhaps, an attempt to construct a counterforce to con¬  tain American power. The consequences of such a move could be  disastrous. No one stands to gain, in the long run, by the concealing of  these facts.   63.

Halle’s comments are little more than a para¬  phrase of McKinley’s famous statement of how divine guidance led him  to the solution of the problem of how to deal with the Philippines :   I don’t know how it was, but it came; 1) that we could not give them  back to Spain—-that would be cowardly and dishonorable; 2) that we  could not turn them over to France or Germany—our commercial rivals  in the Orient—that would be bad business and discreditable; 3) that  we could not leave them to themselves—they were unfit for self-  government and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there  worse than Spain’s was; and 4) that there was nothing left for us to do  but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize  and Christianize them, and by God’s grace do the very best we could by  them, as our fellowmen for whom Christ also died.

Gettleman, ed., Vietnam: History, Documents, and  Opinions on a Major World Crisis (Greenwich, Conn., Fawcett, 1965),  pp. 284-316.   71. See for example, P. J. Honey, “The Foreign Policy of North  Vietnam,” in John D. Montgomery and Albert 0. Hirschman, eds.,  Public Policy (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1967),  Vol. 16, pp. 160-80. Honey cites as one of the “main requirements of  North Vietnamese foreign policy,” “to resist Chinese attempts to  dominate Vietnam.” Similarly, in his Communism in North Vietnam  (Cambridge, Mass, The M.I.T. Press, 1963), he points out that Pham  Van Dong, second in command in North Vietnam, is “no political  extremist but rather a cautious moderate” who “has stated that he  believes Asia’s problems can be solved only through cooperation with  the white races,” and that Vo Nguyen Giap is violently anti-Chmese—  it is for this reason, he goes on to say, that he remains in control of  the army. In fact, Honey concludes, “there are excellent grounds for  the belief that the principal raison d’etre of such a powerful army in  North Vietnam today is to protect North Vietnam, against possible  Chinese aggression.” Similar views are expressed by just about every¬  one who has considered the matter. It is particularly interesting that  they are shared by Honey, whose militant anti-Communism reaches  outlandish levels and frequently leads him to pure fabrication—e.g,  his contention that the North Vietnamese refused to agree to negotia¬  tions at the beginning of 1965 {Public Policy, Vol 16, p. 180)—and  to amazing allegations, for example, that some significant portion of the  antiwar activity in Britain and the United States is initiated by the Com¬  munist parties and financed by Hanoi-including, as a special reward to  loyal supporters, free trips to North Vietnam (ibid., p. 168). One won¬  ders whether his analyses of North Vietnam, which are apparently taken  seriously by policy planners, show as much of a sense of reality as his  perception of events in Britain and the United States.   72. It is worth recalling that the Soviet Union has much better rea¬  sons than we do for taking seriously the lesson of Munich.   73. Op. cit., p. 298.   ',\n",

       " \"    The Bitter Heritage    of this liberal critique shows how remote from the mainstream  o American opinion, that opinion which might be influential in  decision making, is a point of view that would be considered  quite moderate in the spectrum of world opinion: namely, that  the United States has no unilateral right to determine by force  t e course of development of the nations of the Third World.   As a specimen of liberal American ideology, Schlesinger’s  book also provides some insight into one fairly significant aspect  o the complex matter of imperialist expansion. No doubt ideol¬  ogy has its roots in real or at least perceived interests; it is,  however, no novel observation that ideology can have a life of  its own, contributing to the design and implementation of pol¬  icy m a way that may, on occasion, even conflict with the inter¬  ests from which it arose. The postwar American anti-Commu-  mst paranoia provides many examples. In part, it provided a  convenient and occasionally plausible-justification for the  kind of interventionism that had long characterized American  policy, m ever extending domains. In part it no doubt func¬  tioned as an almost independent basis for specific policy deci¬  sions, leading to actions that go beyond what is demanded by  the interests that foreign policy in a general way attempts to  serve. Our China policy provides a number of examples of this  Phenomenon. Another is the behavior of the Eisenhower admin¬  istration m Cuba in 1960 (as described by Ambassador Philip  Bonsai m Foreign Affairs, January 1967), when the Castro gov¬  ernment demanded that American and British oil refineries  process Soviet rather than Venezuelan oil. Although “the com¬  panies would probably have reluctantly gone along with the  [Castro] government’s request,” strong pressure from Washing¬  ton impelled them to refuse, leading to expropriation and a  sharp worsening of Cuban-American relations. Such incidents,  and there are many, are interesting for those concerned with     ■ ' AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   the dynamics of imperialism in the modern period. Schlesinger’s  approach to the Vietnam war provides some understanding o  the cultural factors that are involved in this complex interaction  of real or perceived material interests, ideology, and govern-  ment initiative.   Schlesinger’s critique of current Vietnam policy is also inter¬  esting because of the role of its author in the Kennedy adminis¬  tration, when much of the groundwork for the present tragedy  in Vietnam was laid. In this respect, it is of some value to  “Washington watchers,” that is, to those who are interested m  determining how American foreign policy develops and how it  appears to those involved in its implementation.   It is, for example, of interest to learn of the extent to which  Schlesinger attributes our present tribulations to bureaucratic  stupidity rather than Machiavellian intent. He raises the ques¬  tion “which already haunts the American conscience,” as to  whether we are “really carrying out this policy, as we constantly  proclaim, to save the people we are methodically destro y“S’  or are we “doing it for less exalted purposes of our own. The  question is not directly answered, but the implication is that  stupidity and ignorance, rather than pursuit of self-interest, are  to blame for the bitter heritage. Viewing the development of  American policy from the outside, it seems not too difficult to  construct a rationale. But Schlesinger’s judgment must be given   weight. After all, he was there. .   Still, it is questionable how widely Schlesinger s view o  American innocence is shared. For example, he admits that  there may appear to be “a gigantic American effort at the encir¬  clement and strangulation of China.” But, he asserts, this is not  “our view of what we are doing; nor is it in fact what we are  doing,” though “it really should not astonish us that a crew o  dogmatic Marxist-Leninists should so interpret the extraordi-    \",\n",

This was the decision of a liberal American administra¬  tion, Like the earlier steps to enforce our will in Vietnam, it was  taken with the support of leading political figures, intellectuals,  and academic experts, many of whom now oppose the war  because they do not believe that American repression can suc¬  ceed in Vietnam and therefore urge, on pragmatic grounds,  thdt we “take our stand” where the prospects are more hopeful.  If the resistance in Vietnam were to collapse, if the situation  were to revert to that of Thailand or Guatemala or Greece,  where the forces of order, with our approval and assistance, are  exercising a fair degree of control, then this opposition to the  Vietnam war would also cease; in the words of one such  spokesman, we might then “all be saluting the wisdom and  statesmanship of the American government .” 1 If we are forced  to liquidate this enterprise—in one of the two possible ways—    \",\n",
       " \"                    The Bitter Heritage    nary deployment of American armies, navies and military bases  thousands of miles from the United States and mobilized ....  against no one but themselves.” In fact, one need hardly be a  dogmatic Marxist-Leninist to draw the conclusion that we are  interested in encircling China. This is precisely, for example,  the view of Charles Wolf, senior economist of the RAND Cor¬  poration, who regards it as our major foreign policy task to  make China “willing to live with this fear” of American encir¬  clement (see the congressional hearings before the Subcommit¬  tee on the Far East and the Pacific, January 27, 1966). Schles-  inger evidently thinks of his interpretation as consistent with  our “philosophical heritage—empirical, pragmatic, ironic, plu¬  ralistic, competitive.” It just may be, however, that a more ap¬  propriate adjective is “inane.”   Schlesinger is as aware of what we are doing in Vietnam as  any reader of the New York Times or I. F. Stone’s Weekly. He  emphasizes that “the war began as an insurrection within South  Vietnam which, as it has gathered momentum, has attracted  increasing support and direction from the North” and that the  result of our bombing of North Vietnam “was to bring North  Vietnamese forces south of the border,” though on a scale  which is dwarfed by our own invasion of the country. He real¬  izes that “if we continue the pursuit of total military victory, we  will leave the tragic country gutted and devastated by bombs,  burned by napalm, turned into a wasteland by chemical defoli¬  ation, a land of ruin and wreck,” with its “political and institu¬  tional fabric” pulverized. He knows that “our bombers roam  Over the hapless country, dumping more tonnage of explosives  each month than we were dropping per month on all Europe  and Africa during the Second World War—more in a year than  we dropped on the entire Pacific during the Second World  War.” And he understands the effects on the civilian population     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    ★=   of this attack, unprecedented in scale in the history of warfare.  All of this arouses in the author feelings of great compassion—  for President Johnson. (“No thoughtful American can withhold  sympathy as President Johnson ponders the gloomy choices  which lie ahead.”)   It is not that Schlesinger is incapable of indignation. He is  properly irate about the “warfare in the shadows” of the Viet-  cong, their “ambush and assassination and torture, leaving be¬  hind a trail of burned villages, shattered families and weeping  women” (the “trail of burned villages” is not further identified,  but perhaps the cast of characters has become confused at this  point); and he is not lacking in contempt for those who mob  the Secretary of Defense or burn draft cards. One wonders  whether he would have been equally offended by a comparable  “outpouring of emotion” in Italy in 1935, or Russia in 1956. But  as far as American actions are concerned, “it is not only idle but  unfair to seek out guilty men.” Johnson and Humphrey are  mere “sentimental imperialists,” fundamentally decent men  with an “Asian vision” that is “not dishonorable,” interested in  “the salvation of Asia.”   Not unexpectedly, the Kennedy administration escapes any  censure, except for its failure to keep up with the press reports  of what was actually taking place. True, Kennedy introduced  an army of over 15,000 men, nearly three times the size of the  Condor Legion sent by Hitler to “fight Communism” in an ear¬  lier civil war. But this was simply the “politics of inadvertence.”  As to the “crisis of credibility,” the implication is that this too is  a post-Kennedy phenomenon—no one would guess from read¬  ing this book that a White Paper of December 1961 was entitled  “A Threat to the Peace: North Vietnam’s Effort to Con¬  quer South Vietnam.” Nor would the reader of The Bitter Her¬  itage be likely to guess that not long before, its author was      The Bitter Heritage   referring to 1962 as “not a bad year,” with “aggression checked  m Vietnam/’ or reiterating, with apparent approval, a charac¬  terization of North Vietnam as “the source of aggression” (A  Thousand Days).   still, in basic respects, Schlesinger’s approach to the conduct  of international affairs has a certain internal consistency He  was opposed to the abortive Cuba invasion in 1961, because of  his feeling that the planned deception was not likely to succeed,  not out of any principled objection to such an action. Similarly’  today, he refers with skepticism to Joseph Alsop’s prediction  that before too long “the Vietnamese war will look successful”  from the American point of view, but adds that “we all pray  that Mr. Aisop will be right.” The liberal view, Schlesinger  style, differs from that of Aisop in two important respects: first,  m its skepticism as to the immediacy of an American victory;  second, m its inability to imagine that any right-thinking Amer¬  ican could fail to be in favor of an outright American victory, if  only it could be achieved by the means now being employed  (which will, to be sure, turn the country into “a land of ruin  and wreck”). Thus “we all pray” that American armed might  will be successful, but the more sophisticated of us doubt that  Alsop’s prediction will come true.   Although Schlesinger now insists that “aggression from the  North” will hardly do as an explanation for the war in South  Vietnam, the old habits break through in his usage of the term  “the South Vietnamese.” Thus our goal in Vietnam “should be  the creation and stabilization of secure areas where the South  Vietnamese might themselves undertake social and institutional  development.” In fact, the areas where the South Vietnamese  themselves have undertaken social and institutional develop¬  ment are those where the Vietcong have been in control, for  example, in large parts of the Mekong Delta prior to the brutal      ' AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   American and South Korean campaigns of the last few months.  Ample documentation to support this conclusion is presented  by Douglas Pike (who, in Schlesinger’s judgment, is “the most  careful student of the Viet Cong”) in his recent book, Viet  Cong . It would seem, then, that if our goal is to allow the South  Vietnamese themselves to undertake social and institutional  development, we should simply withdraw, or at the very least  permit negotiations among indigenous South Vietnamese forces  to the exclusion of outside powers, among which, of course, we  ourselves are dominant by an overwhelming margin.   But the South Vietnamese that Schlesinger has in mind are  those whose claim to legitimacy is based on American arms  (including the “South Vietnamese” in the military junta). Thus,  in his lexicon, “South Vietnamese” is to be understood rather in  the manner of the Japanese terminology of a quarter of a cen¬  tury ago, in which the “legitimate Chinese government” was  that of Wang Ching-wei, the puppet ruler whom they installed  (see page 194 above). The only appropriate comments regard¬  ing this conception of Rusk, Schlesinger, et al. are those of the  American note of December 30, 1938, to Japan, which denied  “that there is need or warrant for any one Power to take upon  itself to prescribe what shall be the terms and conditions of a  'new order’ in areas not under its sovereignty and to constitute  itself the repository of authority and the agent of destiny m  regard thereto.”   In the same vein, Schlesinger’s “middle course” would offer  the Vietcong the prospect of participating in the future political  life of Vietnam, “conditioned on their laying down their arms,  opening up their territories and abiding by the ground rules of  free elections.” Since there is no compensating demand that the  Americans withdraw and that the Saigon army lay down their  arms and open up their territories, Schlesinger’s middle course,    \",\n",
       " \"                  The Bitter Heritage    in essential respects, does not even go as far as the position of  the Pentagon, which, on the surface at least, commits us to  withdrawal after “Viet Cong military units would be deac¬  tivated.” Either proposal requests only that the other side sur¬  render, after which we guarantee them political rights.   A true “middle course,” demanding capitulation of no faction  in the civil struggle, would advocate withdrawal of all foreign  troops (American, South Korean, North Vietnamese, and other  minor contingents), negotiations among existing political forces  in South Vietnam—that is, the National Liberation Front and  whatever other forces still have not been crushed by Marshal  Ky’s American-supported storm troopers—to form a coalition  government. As is admitted on all sides, adoption of this middle  course would lead to the collapse of the Saigon regime, a fact  which, along with the general unwillingness of the Saigon army  to fight or even remain in uniform, should lead us, as Schles-  inger puts it, to “wonder all the more about the political side of  the war.”   This course has in fact been repeatedly proposed, by the  NLF, despite Schlesinger’s blanket assertion that “Hanoi and  the Viet Cong will not negotiate so long as they think they can  win.” It is possible that the repeated Hanoi and NLF initiatives  towards negotiation and their demand for a coalition govern¬  ment will prove to be a deception, but there is no doubt that it  is a deception simply to deny the existence of these initiatives or  to ignore the content of the NLF program—a program which,  since 1960, has been calling for the formation of “a broad national  democratic coalition administration ... including representatives  of all strata of people, nationalities, political parties, religious  communities, and patriotic personalities” (see Kahin and Lewis,  US. in Vietnam, Appendix 6-B).   Similarly, it is a deception to assert blandly, as Schlesinger      AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    does, that “Hanoi has put such stress on the withdrawal of  American troops as a condition precedent to negotiation,” in the  face of the frequent insistence from Hanoi that the demand for  withdrawal is put forth as “a basis” for negotiations.   Jean Lacouture commented in Le Nouvel Observateur, Jan¬  uary 1967, that United States government officials are the last  people on earth who are unaware of the fundamental elements  of the NLF program of 1962, He might have added that Arthur  Schlesinger seems the last person on earth to be unaware of the  negotiation position of Hanoi and the NLF (stated, for exam¬  ple, by Premier Pham Van Dong; cf. New York Times, April 14,  1965), that recognition of the famous four points as “a basis”  for a political settlement will create “favorable conditions” for  such a settlement and make it “possible to consider the recon¬  vening of an international conference along the pattern of the  1954 Geneva Conference on Vietnam.” Neither then nor since  has withdrawal of American troops been demanded as a pre¬  condition for negotiations.   Thus Schlesinger’s “middle course” appears to differ from the  approach of the Joint Chiefs and the State Department only in  tactical emphasis. All accept the assumption that dispatch of an  American expeditionary force of half a million men to take over  the conduct of the war is defense of the interests of the South  Vietnamese, whereas infiltration from the North is an aggressive  attack on South Vietnam. In Schlesinger’s case, this assumption  takes the form of a proposal that the guerrillas capitulate, after  which we will grant them political rights. Analogously, the Pres¬  ident and his spokesmen put forth the cynical demand that the  North Vietnamese restrict or terminate their activities in the       The Bitter Heritage    by the North Vietnamese during the Tet truce as “extra evi¬  dence that they were not sincere in their statement on negotia¬  tions,” while maintaining that United States logistic operations  carried out'during the truce period were different because they  “did not send men and supplies across the border into North  Vietnam but were in South Vietnam only” ( New York Times ,  February 17, 1967). To go back to earlier precedents, it is the  same attitude that permits Schlesinger (in his A Thousand  Days) to express his horror at the discovery of Cuban arms  cached in Venezuela, but to think nothing of the extensive  American military aid that has been used to institute or support  repressive regimes throughout the continent. The underlying  assumption is that the United States does have a warrant “to  take upon itself to prescribe what shall be the terms and condi¬  tions of a ‘new order’ in areas not under its sovereignty and to  constitute itself the repository of authority and the agent of  destiny in regard thereto.”   Every competent observer has pointed out that “the war in  South Vietnam has been between the large, professionally  trained army of an unpopular government and the amateur  military wing of a strong, nationalistically based political move¬  ment in which the Communists have formed the spearhead”  (Michael Field, The Prevailing Wind). For this reason, the  Saigon authorities have never wavered from their demand, ex¬  pressed in a statement of March 1 , 1965, that negotiations are  unthinkable unless the “Communists” show their sincerity “by  withdrawing beforehand their armed units and their political  cadres from South Vietnamese territory” (italics mine). The  demand is appropriate; by their own repeated admission, the  Saigon authorities have no hope of maintaining themselves in  an open political arena. It is hardly necessary to document the  fact that this has been the dominant American position as well,       ^ _ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   in effect, as Schlesinger himself emphasizes.   Furthermore, Schlesinger has no illusions about the character  of the puppet regime in Saigon. He proposes, then, that we  should “encourage a pro-peasant regime to come into exist¬  ence,” “a government which enlists enthusiastic popular support  in the countryside.” He does not raise the question of how this  is possible when the country is under American military occu¬  pation, or why one should expect the policy makers of the  Kennedy-Johnson administrations to be capable of such a total  reorientation of approach. But perhaps some light is shed on  Schlesinger’s conception of democratic processes by his charac¬  terization of the 1966 elections in South Vietnam as that “val¬  iant try at self-government” which “excited such idealistic hopes  in the United States.” He does not see fit to mention that in this  valiant try at self-government, Communists and neutralists  whose actions might be advantageous to the Communists were,  by law, excluded from the ballot, nor does he comment on the  conditions, reported widely in the press, under which cam¬  paigning and voting took place. In fact, his evaluation of this  election recalls the remarks of his occasional adversary Dean  Rusk, according to whom the provincial elections of May 1965  “from our point of view . . . were free elections” (August 25,  1965). Under the Rusk-Schlesinger concept of “free elections,”  it is not unimaginable that “free elections” can be conducted  under'American military occupation.   Schlesinger grants that the regime we have imposed in Viet¬  nam is that of “a new class of nouveaux mandarins,” that it is  “pervaded by nepotism, corruption and cynicism,” and he  admits that our military policy is simply one of devastating the  land and annihilating the helpless population. One might sup¬  pose, then, that he would suggest American withdrawal. In fact,  he says very little about this possibility, dismissing it out of    \",\n",

       " '      The Bitter Heritage    hand because it “would have ominous reverberations through¬  out Asia,” because it would be “humiliating,” and because of  our “moral obligations” to those whom we have supported and  encouraged. The argument is hardly convincing. Our moral ob¬  ligations, such as they may be, can be met by resettling those  whom Schlesinger describes as the “Frankenstein’s monsters  we delight in creating in our client countries,” and their cohorts,  say, in Arizona. The “humiliation” of withdrawal hardly com¬  pares with the national disgrace of a policy of scorched earth  and mass murder. It is difficult to imagine anything more “omi¬  nous” for backward Asian countries than a permanent military  presence of the sort we are rapidly constructing on the borders  of China. Schlesinger’s “middle course” is one that, if successful,  will leave the United States as dominant as it is m the Philip¬  pines, hardly an attractive prospect. If anything will lead this  nation to “defile its oldest ideals and disgrace itself in the eyes  of the world and its own posterity,” it is a willingness to tolerate  any barbarism, so long as it can succeed, and to raise our twit¬  ters of protest only when total victory seems beyond our grasp.

Thirty years ago, Franz Borkenau concluded a brilliant study  of the crushing of the popular revolution in Spain with this  comment: “In this tremendous contrast with previous revolu¬  tions one fact is reflected. Before these latter years, counter-  evolution usually depended upon the support of reactionary  powers which were technically and intellectually inferior to the  forces of revolution. This has changed with the advent of fas¬  cism Now, every revolution is likely to meet the attack of the  most modern, most efficient, most ruthless machinery yet in  existence. It means that the age of revolutions free to evolve  according to their own laws is over .” 1   ',\n",
       " '    Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools   It would have taken a fair amount of foresight, at that time,  to realize that the prediction would be proved accurate, with  substitution of “liberal imperialism\" for “fascism,” and that the  United States would, in a generation, be employing the most  efficient and most ruthless machinery in existence to ensure that  revolutionary movements will not evolve according to their own  laws,, to guarantee that its own particular concept of civilization  and justice and order will prevail. And it would have required  considerable insight, in the late 1930s, to realize that before too  long a reformist American administration with a “welfare state”  domestic orientation would be doing its utmost to prove the  correctness of Marx’s grim observation about this concept of  civilization and justice and order: “The civilization and justice  of bourgeois order comes out in its lurid light whenever the  slaves and drudges of that order rise against their masters; then  this civilization and justice stand forth as undisguised savagery  and lawless revenge/’   It is conceivable that American actions in Vietnam are simply  a single outburst of criminal insanity, of no general or long-  range significance except to the miserable inhabitants of that  tortured land. It is difficult, however, to put much credence in  this possibility. In half a dozen Latin American countries there  are guerrilla movements that are approaching the early stages of  the second Vietnamese war, and the American reaction is, appar¬  ently, comparable. That is, American arms are used to attack  guerrilla forces and to “dry up the sea in which they swim,” in  the Maoist terminology affected by the military; and American  “advisers” guide and train the troops which, as Latin American  liberals observe, are needed only to occupy their own country in  the interests of domestic ruling classes and Northern capital. In  these countries it has not yet become necessary, as in Vietnam,  to convert the fact of Communist involvement into the myth of     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Communist aggression in justification of open United States  control of the counterrevolutionary forces, nor has the time yet  arrived for application of the full arsenal of terror in support of  the regime selected as most favorable to American interests. But  it seems that this next step is fully expected. In Le Nouvel  Observateur, the peasant organizer Francisco Juliao was re¬  cently quoted as certain of United States intervention when  rebellion breaks out in the Brazilian Northeast Provinces.  Others, less well known, have expressed themselves similarly.  There is little basis, in history or logic, for supposing them to be  wrong—little basis, that is, apart from the kind of sentimental¬  ity that sees the United States, alone among nations, as a selfless  (if rather oafish) public benefactor, devoted only to projects of  “international good will,” though frequently blundering in an  excess of warmhearted generosity. One should no doubt take  seriously the insistence of administration spokesmen that one  purpose of the present violence is to prove that wars of national  liberation cannot succeed; to demonstrate, that is, in the clear¬  est and most explicit terms, that any revolutionary movement  that we—unilaterally, as in Vietnam—designate as illegitimate  will face the most efficient and ruthless machinery that can be   developed by modern technology.   In minor ways, world opinion can serve as some kind of  brake on full-scale utilization of the technology of terror and  destruction. There has, as yet, been no use of nuclear weapons  in Vietnam; and although rural populations are considered fair  game for any sort of military attack, urban areas, where the  butchery would be more evident to the outside world, are still  relatively immune. Similarly, the use of gas attacks and chemi¬  cal warfare has been extended only slowly, as habituation per¬  mits each gradual increment to pass unnoticed. 2 But ultimately,  the only effective brake can be popular revulsion on a mass    ',\n",

Consequently, the level of cul¬  ture that can be achieved in the United States is a life-and-  death matter for large masses of suffering humanity. This too is  a fact that must color any discussion of contemporary American  institutions.   It is easy to be carried away by the sheer horror of what the  daily press reveals and to lose sight of the fact that this is  merely the brutal exterior of a deeper crime, of commitment to  a social order that guarantees endless suffering and humiliation  and denial of elementary human rights. It is tragic that the  United States should have become, in Toynbee’s words, “the  leader of a world-wide anti-revolutionary movement in defense  of vested interests.” For American intellectuals and for the  schools, there is no more vital issue than this indescribable  tragedy.   No one would seriously propose that the schools attempt to  deal directly with such contemporary events as the American  attack on the rural population of Vietnam or the backgrounds  in recent history for the atrocities that are detailed in the mass  media. No sane person would have expected the schools in  France, for example, to explore the character of and justifica¬  tion for the Algerian war, or the schools in Russia to have dealt  honestly with the crushing of the Hungarian revolution, or the  schools in Italy to have analyzed the invasion of Ethiopia in an  objective way, or the schools in England to have exposed the  contemporary suppression of Irish nationalism. But it is perhaps  not ridiculous to propose that the schools might direct them¬  selves to something more abstract, to an attempt to offer stu¬  dents some means for defending themselves from the onslaught  of the massive government propaganda apparatus, from the  natural bias of the mass media, and—to turn specifically to our  present topic—from the equally natural tendency of significant   ',\n",

It is frightening to observe the comparative indifference of  American intellectuals to the immediate actions of their govern¬  ment and its long-range policies, and their frequent willingness  —often eagerness—to play a role in implementing these poli¬  cies. This is not the place to illustrate in detail; in any event, I  do not command the rhetoric to speak, in the only accurate and  appropriate terms, of the actual conduct of the war and the way  it has been tolerated at home. But more superficial examples  make the point well enough.   Only marginal groups of American academics have reacted to  the fact that while the United States stands in the way of the  only sort of meaningful negotiations, namely, negotiations  among indigenous South Vietnamese political forces to the ex¬  clusion of the foreign invaders from the United States and  Korea, and (on a vastly different scale) from North Vietnam, it  nevertheless is able to persist in its pretense of interest in a  “negotiated settlement” with no outcry of protest against this  farce. When Secretary Rusk openly admits that we cannot ac¬  cept the North Vietnamese proposals of April 1965 because  they require that the Saigon government be supplanted by a  broad, national democratic coalition representing existing polit¬  ical forces in the country, there is no public denunciation of the  cynicism of the position he upholds. When the press reports  that the electoral law commission in South Vietnam faces the  “awesome task” of running “honest elections” while making sure  that the Communists do not win and that no Communists or  “neutralists whose actions are advantageous to the Commu¬  nists” appear on the ballot, there is little editorial comment, few  letters to the editor, no general dismay.

Sup¬  pose that high school students were exposed to the best  current American scholarship, for example, George Taylor s e-  cent study for the Council on Foreign Relations, *  pines and the United States. Here they won d learn how M a  century after the bloody suppression of the native ind p  ence movement at a cost of well over tOO,000 lives in the years  1898-1900, the country achieved nominal in epen enc  surface forms of democracy.

In general, the history of imperialism and of imperialist  apologia, particularly as seen from the point of view of those at  the wrong end of the guns, should be a central part of any  civilized curriculum. But there are other aspects to a program of  intellectual self-defense that should not be overlooked. In an  age of science and technology, it is inevitable that their prestige  will be employed as an ideological instrument—specifically,  that the social and behavioral sciences will in various ways be  made to serve in defense of national policy or as a mask for  special interest. It is not merely that intellectuals are strongly  tempted, in a society that offers them prestige and affluence, to  take what is now called a “pragmatic attitude” (in a perverse  sense of “pragmatism” which is, sad to say, not without some  historical justification, as shown in the Dewey-Bourne inter¬  change during the First World War—see Introduction, pages  5-7), that is, an attitude that one must “accept,” not criti¬  cally analyze or struggle to change, the existing distribution of  power, domestic or international, and the political realities that  flow from it, and must work only for “slow measures of im¬  provement” in a technological, piecemeal manner. It is not  merely that having taken this position (conceivably with some  justification, at a particular historical moment), one is strongly  tempted to provide it with an ideological justification of a very  general sort. Rather,..what we must also expect is that political  elites will use the terminology of the social and behavioral sci¬  ences to protect their actions from critical analysis—the non¬  specialist does not, after all, presume to tell physicists and engi-   ',\n",

And for any particular  action, experts can certainly be found in the universities who  will solemnly testify as to its appropriateness and realism. This  is not a matter of speculation; thus we already find, in congres¬  sional testimony, the proposal by a leading political scientist  that we try to impose mass starvation on a quarter of the  human race, if their government does not accept our dictates.  And it is commonly argued that the free-floating intellectual,  who is now outdated, has no business questioning the conclu¬  sions of the professional expert, equipped with the tools of  modern science.   This situation again carries a lesson for the schools, one to  which teachers in particular should be quite sensitive, bom¬  barded as they have been in recent years by authoritative con¬  clusions about what has been “demonstrated” with regard to  human learning, language, and so on. The social and behavioral  sciences should be seriously studied not only for their intrinsic  interest, but so that the student can be made quite aware of  exactly how little they have to say about the problems of man  and society that really matter. They should, furthermore, be  studied in the context of the physical sciences, so that the stu¬  dent can be brought to appreciate clearly the limits of their  intellectual content. This can be an important way to protect a  student from the propaganda of the future, and to put him in a  position to comprehend the true nature of the means that are  sure to be used to conceal the real significance of domestic or  international policy.   Suppose, however, that contrary to all present indications,  the United States will stop short of using its awesome resources  of violence and devastation to impose its passionately held  ideology and its approved form of social organization on large   areas of the world. Suppose, that is, that American policy ceases  ',\n",

It  would nevertheless remain true that the level of culture that can  be achieved in the United States is a matter of overwhelming  importance for the rest of the world. If we want to be truly  utopian, we may consider the possibility that American re¬  sources might be used to alleviate the terrorism that seems to be  an inevitable correlate of modernization, if we can judge from  past and present history. We can conceive of the possibility that  the schools, or the intellectuals, might pay serious attention to  questions that have been posed for centuries, that they might  ask whether society must, indeed, be a Hobbesian bellum  omnium contra omnes, and might inquire into the contempo¬  rary meaning of Rousseau’s protest that it is contrary to natural  right that “a handful of men be glutted with superfluities while  the starving multitude lacks necessities.\" They might raise the  moral issue faced, or avoided, by one who enjoys his wealth and  privilege undisturbed by the knowledge that half of the chil¬  dren born in Nicaragua will not reach five years of age, or that  only a few miles away there is unspeakable poverty, brutal  suppression of human rights, and almost no hope for the future,  and they might raise the intellectual issue of how this can be  changed. They might ask, with Keynes, how long we must con¬  tinue to “exalt some of the most distasteful of human qualities  into the position of the highest virtues,” setting up “avarice and  usury and precaution . . . [as] ... our gods,” and pretending to  ourselves that “fair is foul and foul is fair, for foul is useful and  fair is not.” If American intellectuals will be preoccupied with     *- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   such questions as these, they can have an invaluable civilizing  influence on society and on the schools. If, as is more likely,  they regard them with disdain as mere sentimental nonsense,  then our children will have to look elsewhere for enlightenment  and guidance.

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF  INTELLECTUALS    Twenty years ago, Dwight Macdonald published a series of  articles in Politics on the responsibilities of peoples, and specifi¬  cally, the responsibility of intellectuals. I read them as an un¬  dergraduate, in the years just after the war, and had occasion to  read them again a few months ago. They seem to me to have  lost none of their power or persuasiveness. Macdonald is con¬  cerned with the question of war guilt. He asks the question: To  what extent were the German or Japanese people responsible  for the atrocities committed by their governments? And, quite  properly, he turns the question back to us: To what extent are  the British or American people responsible for the vicious terror  bombings of civilians, perfected as a technique of warfare by  the Western democracies and reaching their culmination in   This is a revised version of a talk given at Harvard and published in  Mosaic, June 1966. It appeared in substantially this form in the New York  Review of Books, February 23, 1967.

To an undergraduate in 1945—1946—to any¬  one whose political and moral consciousness had been formed  by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian  purge, the “China incident,” the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi  atrocities, the Western reaction to these events and, in part,  complicity in them—these questions had particular significance  and poignancy.   With respect to the responsibility of intellectuals, there are  still other, equally disturbing questions. Intellectuals are in a  position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions  according to their causes and motives and often hidden inten¬  tions. In the Western world at least, they have the power that  comes from political liberty, from access to information and  freedom of expression. For a privileged minority, Western  democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training  to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and  misrepresentation, ideology, and class interest through which  the events of current history are presented to us. The responsi¬  bilities of intellectuals, then, are much deeper than what Mac¬  donald calls the “responsibility of peoples,” given the unique  privileges that intellectuals enjoy.   The issues that Macdonald raised are as pertinent today as  they were twenty years ago. We can hardly avoid asking our¬  selves to what extent the American people bear responsibility  for the savage American assault on a largely helpless rural pop¬  ulation in Vietnam, still another atrocity in what Asians see as  the “Vasco da Gama era” of world history. As for those of us  who stood by in silence and apathy as this catastrophe slowly  took shape over the past dozen years, on what page of history  do we find our proper place? Only the most insensible can  escape these questions. I want to return to them, later on, after  ',\n",

This, at least, may seem enough of a truism to  pass without comment. Not so, however. For the modern intel¬  lectual, it is not at all obvious. Thus we have Martin Heidegger  writing, m a pro-Hitler declaration of 1933, that “truth is the  revelation of that which makes a people certain, clear, and  strong m its action and knowledge”; it is only this kind of  t uth that one has a responsibility to speak.

Similarly, the Communist planners probed the “free world spec¬  trum of defense” in Northern Azerbaijan and Greece (where  Stalin “supported substantial guerrilla warfare”— ibid., pp.  36 and 148), operating from plans carefully laid in 1945. And  in Central Europe, the Soviet Union was not “prepared to  accept a solution which would remove the dangerous tensions  from Central Europe at the risk of even slowly staged corro¬  sion of communism in East Germany” {ibid., p. 156).   It is interesting to compare these observations with studies by  scholars actually concerned with historical events. The remark  about Stalin’s initiating the first Vietnamese war in 1946 does  not even merit refutation. As to Hanoi’s purported initiative of  1958, the situation is more clouded. But even government  sources 8 concede that in 1959 Hanoi received the first direct  reports of what Diem referred to 9 as his own Algerian war, and        ★== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   that only after this did they lay their plans to involve them¬  selves in this struggle. In fact, in December 1958 Hanoi made  another of its many attempts—rebuffed once again by Saigon  and the United States—to establish diplomatic and commercial  relations with the Saigon government on the basis of the status  quo. 10 Rostow offers no evidence of Stalin’s support for the  Greek guerrillas: in fact, though the historical record is far from  clear, it seems that Stalin was by no means pleased with the  adventurism of the Greek guerrillas, who, from his point of  view, were upsetting the satisfactory postwar imperialist settle¬  ment. 11   Rostow’s remarks about Germany are more interesting still.  He does not see fit to mention, for example, the Russian notes  of March-April 1952, which proposed unification of Germany  under internationally supervised elections, with withdrawal of  all troops within a year, if there was a guarantee that a reuni¬  fied Germany would not be permitted to join a Western mili¬  tary alliance. 12 And he has also momentarily forgotten his own  characterization of the strategy of the Truman and Eisenhower  administrations: “to avoid any serious negotiation with the So¬  viet Union until the West could confront Moscow with German  rearmament within an organized European framework, as a fait  accompli ” 13 —to be sure, in defiance of the Potsdam agree¬  ments.   But most interesting of all is Rostow’s reference to Iran. The  facts are that there was a Russian attempt to impose by force a  pro-Soviet government in Northern Azerbaijan that would  grant the Soviet Union access to Iranian oil. This was rebuffed  by superior Anglo-American force in 1946, at which point the  more powerful imperialism obtained full rights to Iranian oil for  itself, with the installation of a pro-Western government. We  recall what happened when, for a brief period in the early  ',\n",
       " '   Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools    1950s, the only Iranian government with something of a popu¬  lar base experimented with the curious idea that Iranian oil  should belong to the Iranians. What is interesting, however, is  the description of Northern Azerbaijan as part of “the free  world spectrum of defense.” It is pointless, by now, to comment  on the debasement of the phrase “free world.” But by what law  of nature does Iran, with its resources, fall within Western do¬  minion? The bland assumption that it does is most revealing of  deep-seated attitudes towards the conduct of foreign affairs.   In addition to this growing lack of concern for truth, we find,  in recent statements, a real or feigned naivete with regard to  American actions that reaches startling proportions. For exam¬  ple, Arthur Schlesinger has recently characterized our Vietna¬  mese policies of 1954 as “part of our general program of inter¬  national goodwill.” 14 Unless intended as irony, this remark  shows either a colossal cynicism or an inability, on a scale that  defies comment, to comprehend elementary phenomena of con¬  temporary history. Similarly, what is one to make of the testi¬  mony of Thomas Scheiling before the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, January 27, 1966, in which he discusses the two  great dangers if all Asia “goes Communist”? 16 First, this would  exclude “the United States and what we call Western civiliza¬  tion from a large part of the world that is poor and colored and  potentially hostile.” Second, “a country like the United States  probably cannot maintain self-confidence if just about the  greatest thing it ever attempted, namely to create the basis for  decency and prosperity and democratic government in the un¬  derdeveloped world, had to be acknowledged as a failure or as  an attempt that we wouldn’t try again.” It surpasses belief that  a person with even minimal acquaintance with the record of  American foreign policy could produce such statements.   It surpasses belief, that is, unless we look at the matter from a    ',\n",
       " '     .fr -- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   more historical point of view, and place such statements in the  context of the hypocritical moralism of the past; for example, of  Woodrow Wilson, who was going to teach the Latin Americans  the art of good government, and who wrote (1902) that it is  “our peculiar duty” to teach colonial peoples “order and self-  control . . . [and] ... the drill and habit of law and obedience.”  Or of the missionaries of the 1840s, who described the hideous  and degrading opium wars as “the result of a great design of  Providence to make the wickedness of men subserve his pur¬  poses of mercy toward China, in breaking through her wall of  exclusion, and bringing the empire into more immediate contact  with western and Christian nations.” Or, to approach the  present, of A. A. Berle, who, in commenting on the Dominican  intervention, has the impertinence to attribute the problems of  the Caribbean countries to imperialism —Russian imperial¬  ism. 16   As a final example of this failure of skepticism, consider the  remarks of Henry Kissinger in concluding his presentation in a  Harvard-Oxford television debate on American Vietnam poli¬  cies. He observed, rather sadly, that what disturbs him most is  that others question not our judgment but our motives—a re¬  markable comment on the part of one whose professional con¬  cern is political analysis, that is, analysis of the actions of gov¬  ernments in terms of motives that are unexpressed in official  propaganda and perhaps only dimly perceived by those whose  acts they govern. No one would be disturbed by an analysis of  the political behavior of Russians, French, or Tanzanians, ques¬  tioning their motives and interpreting their actions in terms of  long-range interests, perhaps well concealed behind official  rhetoric. But it is an article of faith that American motives are  pure and not subject to analysis (see note 1). Although it is  nothing new in American intellectual history—or, for that mat-  ',\n",
       " '  The Responsibility of Intellectuals   ter, in the general history of imperialist apologia—this inno¬  cence becomes increasingly distasteful as the power it serves  grows more dominant in world affairs and more capable, there¬  fore, of the unconstrained viciousness that the mass media  present to us each day. We are hardly the first power in history  to combine material interests, great technological capacity, and  an utter disregard for the suffering and misery of the lower  orders. The long tradition of naivete and self-righteousness that  disfigures our intellectual history, however, must serve as a  warning to the Third World, if such a warning is needed, as to  how our protestations of sincerity and benign intent are to be  interpreted.   The basic assumptions of the “New Frontiersmen” should be  pondered carefully by those who look forward to the involve¬  ment of academic intellectuals in politics. For example, I have  referred to Arthur Schlesinger’s objections to the Bay of Pigs  invasion, but the reference was imprecise. True, he felt that it  was a “terrible idea,” but “not because the notion of sponsoring  an exile attempt to overthrow Castro seemed intolerable in  itself.” Such a reaction would be the merest sentimentality, un¬  thinkable to a tough-minded realist. The difficulty, rather, was  that it seemed unlikely that the deception could succeed. The  operation, in his view, was ill-conceived but not otherwise ob¬  jectionable . 17 In a similar vein, Schlesinger quotes with ap¬  proval Kennedy’s “realistic” assessment of the situation resulting  from Trujillo’s assassination: “There are three possibilities in  descending order of preference: a decent democratic regime, a  continuation of the Trujillo regime or a Castro regime. We  ought to aim at the first, but we really can’t renounce the sec¬  ond until we are sure that we can avoid the third .” 18 The  reason why the third possibility is so intolerable is explained a  few pages later: “Communist success in Latin America would    • AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   deal a much harder blow to the power and influence of the  United States.” Of course, we can never really be sure of avoid¬  ing the third possibility; therefore, in practice, we will always  settle for the second, as we are now doing in Brazil and Argen¬  tina, for example. 19   Or consider Walt Rostow’s views on American policy in  Asia. 20 The basis on which we must build this policy is that “we  are openly threatened and we feel menaced by Communist  China.” To prove that we are menaced is of course unnecessary,  and the matter receives no attention; it is enough that we feel  menaced. Our policy must be based on our national heritage  and our national interests. Our national heritage is briefly out¬  lined in the following terms: “Throughout the nineteenth cen¬  tury, in good conscience Americans could devote themselves to  the extension of both their principles and their power on this  continent,” making use of “the somewhat elastic concept of the  Monroe doctrine” and, of course, extending “the American in¬  terest to Alaska and the mid-Pacific islands. . . . Both our insist¬  ence on unconditional surrender and the idea of post-war occu¬  pation . . . represented the formulation of American security  interests in Europe and Asia.” So much for our heritage. As to  our interests, the matter is equally simple. Fundamental is our  “profound interest that societies abroad develop and strengthen  those elements in their respective cultures that elevate and  protect the dignity of the individual against the state.” At the  same time, we must counter the “ideological threat,” namely  “the possibility that the Chinese Communists can prove to  Asians by progress in China that Communist methods are better  and faster than democratic methods.” Nothing is said about  those people in Asian cultures to whom our “conception of the  proper relation of the individual to the state” may not be the  uniquely important value, people who might, for example, be    ',\n",
       " '   The Responsibility of Intellectuals    concerned with preserving the “dignity of the individual”  against concentrations of foreign or domestic capital, or against  semifeudal structures (such as Trujillo-type dictatorships) in¬  troduced or kept in power by American arms. All of this is  flavored with allusions to “our religious and ethical value sys¬  tems” and to our “diffuse and complex concepts” which are ,to  the Asian mind “so much more difficult to grasp” than Marxist  dogma, and are so “disturbing to some Asians” because of “their  very lack of dogmatism.”   Such intellectual contributions as these suggest the need for a  correction to De Gaulle’s remark, in his memoirs, about the  American “will to power, cloaking itself in idealism.” By now,  this will to power is not so much cloaked in idealism as it is  drowned in fatuity. And academic intellectuals have made their  unique contribution to this sorry picture.   Let us, however, return to the war in Vietnam and the re¬  sponse that it has aroused among American intellectuals. A strik¬  ing feature of the recent debate on Southeast Asian policy has  been the distinction that is commonly drawn between “respon¬  sible criticism,” on the one hand, and “sentimental” or “emo¬  tional” or “hysterical” criticism, on the other. There is much to  be learned from a careful study of the terms in which this  distinction is drawn. The “hysterical critics” are to be identified,  apparently, by their irrational refusal to accept one fundamen¬  tal political axiom, namely, that the United States has the right  to extend its power and control without limit, insofar as is  feasible. Responsible criticism does not challenge this assump¬  tion, but argues, rather, that we probably can’t “get away with  it” at this particular time and place.   A distinction of this sort seems to be what Irving Kristol has  in mind, for example, in his analysis of the protest over Vietnam  policy, in Encounter, August 1965. He contrasts the responsible   ',\n",
       " \"  *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   critics, such as Walter Lippmann, the New York Times , and  Senator Fulbright, with the “teachrin movement.” “Unlike the  university protesters,” he maintains, “Mr. Lippmann engages in  no presumptuous suppositions as to 'what the Vietnamese peo¬  ple really want—he obviously doesn’t much care—or in legalis¬  tic exegesis as to whether, or to what extent, there is 'aggres¬  sion’ or 'revolution’ in South Vietnam. His is a realpolitik point  of view; and he will apparently even contemplate the possibility  of a nuclear war against China in extreme circumstances.” This  is commendable, and contrasts favorably, for Kristol, with the  talk of the “unreasonable, ideological types” in the teach-in  movement, who often seem to be motivated by such absurdities  as “simple, virtuous 'anti-imperialism.’ ” who deliver “harangues  on 'the power structure,’ ” and who even sometimes stoop so  low as to read “articles and reports from the foreign press on  the American presence in Vietnam.” Furthermore, these nasty  types are often psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, or  philosophers (just as, incidentally, those most vocal in protest in  the Soviet Union are generally physicists, literary intellectuals,  and others remote from the exercise of power), rather than  people with Washington contacts, who of course realize that  had they a new, good idea about Vietnam, they would get a  prompt and respectful hearing” in Washington.   I am not interested here in whether Kristol’s characterization  of protest and dissent is accurate, but rather in the assumptions  that it expresses with respect to such questions as these: Is the  purity of American motives a matter that is beyond discussion,  or that is irrelevant to discussion? Should decisions be left to  “experts” with Washington contacts—that is, even if we assume  that they command the necessary knowledge and principles to  make the “best” decision, will they invariably do so? And, a  logically prior question, is “expertise” applicable—that is, is   \",\n",
       " '   The Responsibility of Intellectuals   there a body of theory and of relevant information, not in the  public domain, that can be applied to the analysis of foreign  policy or that demonstrates the correctness of present actions in  some way that the psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, and  philosophers are incapable of comprehending? Although Kristol  does not examine these questions directly, his attitudes presup¬  pose answers, answers which are wrong in all cases. American  aggressiveness, however it may be masked in pious rhetoric, is a  dominant force in world affairs and must be analyzed in terms  of its causes and motives. There is no body of theory or signifi¬  cant body of relevant information, beyond the comprehension  of the layman, which makes policy immune from criticism. To  the extent that “expert knowledge” is applied to world affairs, it  is surely appropriate—for a person of any integrity, quite neces¬  sary—to question its quality and the goals that it serves. These  facts seem too obvious to require extended discussion.   A corrective to Kristol’s curious belief in the administration’s  openness to new thinking about Vietnam is provided by Mc-  George Bundy in a recent article. 21 As Bundy correctly ob¬  serves, “on the main stage ... the argument on Viet Nam turns  on tactics, not fundamentals,” although, he adds, “there are  wild men in the wings.” On stage center are, of course, the  President (who in his recent trip to Asia had just “magisterially  reaffirmed” our interest “in the progress of the people across the  Pacific”) and his advisers, who deserve “the understanding sup¬  port of those who want restraint.” It is these men who deserve  the credit for the fact that “the bombing of the North has been  the most accurate and the most restrained in modern warfare”  —a solicitude which will be appreciated by the inhabitants, or  former inhabitants, of Nam Dinh and Phu Ly and Vinh. It is  these men, too, who deserve the credit for what was reported  by Malcolm Browne as long ago as May 1965: “In the South,     -fc —— AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   huge sectors of the nation have been declared ‘free bombing  zones,’ in which anything that moves is a legitimate target. Tens  of thousands of tons of bombs, rockets, napalm and cannon fire  are poured into these vast areas each week. If only by the laws  of chance, bloodshed is believed to be heavy in these raids.”   Fortunately for the developing countries, Bundy assures us,  “American democracy has no enduring taste for imperialism,”  and “taken as a whole, the stock of American experience, un¬  derstanding, sympathy and simple knowledge is now much the  most impressive in the world.” It is true that “four-fifths of all  the foreign investing in the world is now done by Americans”  and that “the most admired plans and policies ... are no better  than their demonstrable relation to the American interest”—just  as it is true, so we read in the same issue of Foreign Affairs, that  the plans for armed action against Cuba were put into motion a  few weeks after Mikoyan visited Havana, “invading what had  so long been an almost exclusively American sphere of influ¬  ence.” Unfortunately, such facts as these are often taken by  unsophisticated Asian intellectuals as indicating a “taste for im¬  perialism.” For example, a number of Indians have expressed  their “near exasperation” at the fact that “we have done every¬  thing we can to attract foreign capital for fertilizer plants, but  the American and the other Western private companies know  we are over a barrel, so they demand stringent terms which we  just cannot meet,” 22 while “Washington . . . doggedly insists  that deals be made in the private sector with private enter¬  prise.” 28 But this reaction, no doubt, simply reveals once again  how the Asian mind fails to comprehend the “diffuse and com¬  plex concepts” of Western thought.   It may be useful to study carefully the “new, good ideas  about Vietnam” that are receiving a “prompt and respectful  hearing” in Washington these days. The United States Govern-  ',\n",
       " '  The Responsibility of Intellectuals   ment Printing Office is an endless source of insight into the  moral and intellectual level of this expert advice. In its publica¬  tions one can read, for example, the testimony of Professor  David N. Rowe, director of graduate studies in international  relations at Yale University, before the House Committee on  Foreign Affairs (see note 15). Professor Rowe proposes (p.  266) that the United States buy all surplus Canadian and Aus¬  tralian wheat, so that there will be mass starvation in China.  These are his words: “Mind you, I am not talking about this as  a weapon against the Chinese people. It will be. But that is only  incidental. The weapon will be a weapon against the Govern¬  ment because the internal stability of that country cannot be  sustained by an unfriendly Government in the face of general  starvation.” Professor Rowe will have none of the sentimental  moralism that might lead one to compare this suggestion with,  say, the Ostpolitik of Hitler’s Germany. 24 Nor does he fear the  impact of such policies on other Asian nations, for example  Japan. He assures us, from his “very long acquaintance with  Japanese questions,” that “the Japanese above all are people who  respect power and determination.” Hence “they will not be so  much alarmed by American policy in Vietnam that takes off  from a position of power and intends to seek a solution based  upon the imposition of our power upon local people that we are  in opposition to.” What would disturb the Japanese is “a policy  of indecision, a policy of refusal to face up to the problems, [m  China and Vietnam] and to meet our responsibilities there in a  positive way,” such as the way just cited. A conviction that we  were “unwilling to use the power that they know we have”  might “alarm the Japanese people very intensely and shake the  degree of their friendly relations with us.” In fact, a full use of  American power would be particularly reassuring to the Japa¬  nese, because they have had a demonstration “of the tremen-     *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   dous power in action of the United States . . . because they have  felt our power directly.” This is surely a prime example of the  healthy realpolitik point of view” that Irving Kristol so much  admires.   But, one may ask, why restrict ourselves to such indirect  means as mass starvation? Why not bombing? No doubt this  message is implicit in the remarks to the same committee of the  Reverend R. J. de Jaegher, regent of the Institute of Far East¬  ern Studies, Seton Hall University, who explains that like all  people who have lived under Communism, the North Vietna¬  mese “would be perfectly happy to be bombed to be free” (p.  345).   Of course, there must be those who support the Communists.  But this is really a matter of small concern, as the Honorable  Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern  Affairs from 1953 to 1959, points out in his testimony before the  same committee. He assures us that “The Peiping regime  represents something less than 3 percent of the population” (p.  402).   Consider, then, how fortunate the Chinese Communist lead¬  ers are, compared to the leaders of the Vietcong, who, accord¬  ing to Arthur Goldberg, represent about “one-half of one per¬  cent of the population of South Vietnam,” that is, about one  half the number of new Southern recruits for the Vietcong dur¬  ing 1965, if we can credit Pentagon statistics. 25   In the face of such experts as these, the scientists and philos¬  ophers of whom Kristol speaks would clearly do well to con¬  tinue to draw their circles in the sand.   Having settled the issue of the political irrelevance of the  protest movement, Kristol turns to the question of what moti¬  vates it—more generally, what has made students and junior  faculty “go left,” as he sees it, amid general prosperity and  ',\n",
       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   tamed that we have in effect already achieved “the egalitarian  and socially mobile society which the ‘free floating intellectuals’  associated with the Marxist tradition have been calling for  during the last hundred years.” Granting the obvious general  rise m standard of living, the judgment of Gunnar Myrdal  seems far more appropriate to the actual situation when he  says: “The common idea that America is an immensely rich and  affluent country is very much an exaggeration. American afflu¬  ence is heavily mortgaged. America carries a tremendous bur¬  den of debt to its poor people. That this debt must be paid is  not only a wish of the do-gooders. Not paying it implies a risk  for the social order and for democracy as we have known it.” 11  Surely the claim that all groups can easily enter the mass-con¬  sumption economy and “erase the visible demarcations” is a  . considerable exaggeration.   Similar evaluations of American society appear frequently in  contemporary scholarship. To mention just one example, con¬  sider the analysis that Adam Ulam gives of Marx’s concept of  capitalism: “One cannot blame a contemporary observer like  Marx for his conviction that industrial fanaticism and self-right¬  eousness were indelible traits of the capitalist. That the capital¬  ist would grow more humane, that he would slacken in his  ceaseless pursuit of accumulation and expansion, were not im¬  pressions readily warranted by the English social scene of the  1840’s and ’50’s.” 12 Again, granting the important changes in  industrial society over the past century, it still comes as a sur¬  prise to hear that the capitalist has slackened in his ceaseless  pursuit of accumulation and expansion. 13   Remarks such as these illustrate a failure to come to grips  with the reality of contemporary society which may not be  directly traceable to the newly found (or at least hopefully  sough 1) access to power and affluence, but which is, neverthe-       - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   less, what one would expect in the developing ideology of a  new privileged elite.   Various strands of this ideology are drawn together in a re¬  cent article by Zbigniew Brzezinski, 11 in which a number of the  conceptions and attitudes that appear in recent social thought  are summarized—I am tempted to say “parodied.” Brzezinski  too sees a “profound change” taking place in the intellectual  community, as “the largely humanist-oriented, occasionally  ideologically-minded intellectual-dissenter, who sees his role  largely in terms of proffering social critiques, is rapidly being  displaced either by experts and specialists, who become in¬  volved in special governmental undertakings, or by the gener-  alists-integrators, who become in effect house-ideologues for  those in power, providing overall intellectual integration for  disparate actions.” He suggests that these “organisation-ori¬  ented, application-minded intellectuals” can be expected to in¬  troduce broader and more relevant concerns into the political  system—though there is, as he notes, a danger that “intellectual  detachment and the disinterested search for truth” will come to  an end, given the new access of the “application-minded intellect¬  uals” to “power, prestige, and the good life.” They are a new  meritocratic elite, “taking over American life, utilising the uni¬  versities, exploiting the latest techniques of communications,  harnessing as rapidly as possible the most recent technological  devices.” Presumably, their civilizing impact is revealed by the  great progress that has been made, in this new “historical era  that America alone has already entered, with respect to the prob¬  lems that confounded the bumbling political leaders of past eras  —the problems of the cities, of pollution, of waste and destruc¬  tiveness, of exploitation and poverty.

Scholarship   Still another strand in the ideology of the new emerging elite  is the concern for order, for maintaining the status quo, which is  now seen to be quite favorable and essentially just. An excellent  example is the statement by fourteen leading political scientists  and historians on United States Asian policy, recently dis¬  tributed by the Freedom House Public Affairs Institute. 18  These scholars designate themselves as “the moderate segment  of the academic community.” The designation is accurate; they  stand midway between the two varieties of extremism, one  which demands that we destroy everyone who stands in our  path, the other, that we adopt the principles of international  behavior we require of every other world power. The purpose  of their statement is to “challenge those among us who, over¬  whelmed by guilt complexes, find comfort in asserting or imply¬  ing that we are always wrong, our critics always right, and that  Only doom lies ahead.” They find our record in Asia to be “re¬  markably good,” and applaud our demonstrated ability to  rectify mistakes, our “capacity for pragmatism and self-exami¬  nation,” and our “healthy avoidance of narrow nationalism,  capacities which distinguish us “among the major societies of  this era.”   The moderate scholars warn that “to avoid a major war in the  Asia-Pacific region, it is essential that the United States con¬  tinue to deter, restrain, and counterbalance Chinese power.”  True, “China has exercised great prudence in avoiding a direct  confrontation with the United States or the Soviet Union” since  the Korean War, and it is likely that China will “continue to  substitute words for acts while concentrating upon domestic  issues.” Still, we cannot be certain of this and must therefore  continue our efforts to tame the dragon. One of the gravest  problems posed by China is its policy of “isolationist fanaticism  —obviously, a serious threat to peace. Another danger is the       *- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   terrifying figure of Mao Tse-tung, a romantic, who refuses to  accept the “bureaucratism essential to the ordering of this  enormously complex, extremely difficult society.” The moder¬  ate scholars would feel much more at ease with the familiar sort  of technical expert, who is committed to the “triumph of bu¬  reaucratism” and who refrains from romantic efforts to under¬  mine the party apparatus and the discipline it imposes.   Furthermore, the moderate scholars announce their support  for “our basic position” in Vietnam. A Communist victory in  Vietnam, they argue, would “gravely jeopardize the possibilities  for a political equilibrium in Asia, seriously damage our credi¬  bility, deeply affect the morale—and the policies—of our Asian  allies and the neutrals.” By a “political equilibrium,” they do  not, of course, refer to the status quo as of 1945-1946 or as  outlined by international agreement at Geneva in 1954. They do  not explain why the credibility of the United States is more  important than the credibility of the indigenous elements  in Vietnam who have dedicated themselves to a war of national  liberation. Nor do they explain why the morale of the military  dictatorships of Thailand and Taiwan must be preserved. They  merely hint darkly of the dangers of a third world war, dangers  which are real enough and which are increased when advocates  of revolutionary change face an external counterrevolutionary  force. In principle, such dangers can be lessened by damping  revolutionary ardor or by withdrawing the counterrevolutionary  force. The latter alternative, however, is unthinkable, irrespon¬  sible.   The crucial assumption in the program of the moderate  scholars is that we must not encourage “those elements com¬  mitted to the thesis that violence is the best means of effecting  change.” It is important to recognize that it is not violence as  such to which the moderate scholars object.

Premise 1:  American decision makers think along the lines outlined by  Herman Kahn. Premise 2: Kahn thinks it would be better for  everyone to be red than for everyone to be dead. Premise 3: If  the Americans were to respond to an all-out counter-value at¬  tack, then everyone would be dead. Conclusion: The Americans  will not respond to an all-out counter-value attack, and therefore  it should be launched without delay. Of course, one can carry  the argument a step further. Fact: The Russians have not car¬  ried out an all-out counter-value attack. It follows that they are  not rational. If they are not rational, there is no point in “stra¬  tegic thinking.” Therefore . . .   Of course this is all nonsense, but nonsense that differs from  Kahn’s only in the respect that the argument is of slightly  greater complexity than anything to be discovered in his work.  What is remarkable is that serious people actually pay attention  to these absurdities, no doubt because of the fagade of tough-  mindedness and pseudoscience.   It is a curious and depressing fact that the “antiwar move¬  ment” falls prey all too often to similar confusions. In the fall\"of  1965, for example, there was an International Conference on  Alternative Perspectives on Vietnam, which circulated a pam¬  phlet to potential participants stating its assumptions. The plan  was to set up study groups in which three “types of intellectual  tradition” will be represented: (1) area specialists; (2) “social  theory, with special emphasis on theories of the international  system, of social change and development, of conflict and con¬  flict resolution, or of revolution”; (3) “the analysis of public  policy in terms of basic human values, rooted in various theo¬  logical, philosophical and humanist traditions.” The second in¬  tellectual tradition will provide “general propositions, derived     \\' AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   from social theory and tested against historical, comparative, or  experimental data”; the third “will provide the framework out  of which fundamental value questions can be raised and in  terms of which the moral implications of societal actions can be  analyzed.” The hope was that “by approaching the questions  [of Vietnam policy] from the moral perspectives of all great  religions and philosophical systems, we may find solutions that  are more consistent with fundamental human values than cur¬  rent American policy in Vietnam has turned out to be.   In short, the experts on values (i.e., spokesmen for the great  religions and philosophical systems) will provide fundamental  insights on moral perspectives, and the experts on social theory  will provide general empirically validated propositions and  “general models of conflict.” From this interplay, new policies  will emerge, presumably from application of the canons of sci  entific method. The only debatable issue, it seems to me, is  whether it is more ridiculous to turn to experts in social theory  for general well-confirmed propositions, or to the specialists in  the great religions and philosophical systems for insights into   fundamental human values.   There is much more that can be said about this topic, ut  without continuing, I would simply like to emphasize that, as is  no doubt obvious, the cult of the expert is both self-serving, for  those who propound it, and fraudulent. Obviously, one must  learn from social and behavioral science whatever one can; ob¬  viously, these fields should be pursued in as serious a way as is  possible. But it will be quite unfortunate, and highly dangerous,  if they are not accepted and judged on their merits and accord¬  ing to their actual, not pretended, accomplishments. In particu¬  lar if there is a body of theory, well tested and verified, fha  applies to the conduct of foreign affairs or the resolution of  domestic or international conflict, its existence has been kept a    ',\n",
       " '   The Responsibility of Intellectuals   well-guarded secret. In the case of Vietnam, if those who feel  themselves to be experts have access to principles or informa¬  tion that would justify what the American government is doing  in that unfortunate country, they have been singularly ineffec¬  tive in making this fact known. To anyone who has any famil¬  iarity with the social and behavioral sciences (or the “policy  sciences”), the claim that there are certain considerations and  principles too deep for the outsider to comprehend is simply an  absurdity, unworthy of comment.   When we consider the responsibility of intellectuals, Our  basic concern must be their role in the creation and analysis of  ideology. And in fact, Kristol’s contrast between the unreason¬  able ideological types and the responsible experts is formulated  in terms that immediately bring to mind Daniel Bell’s interest¬  ing and influential essay on the “end of ideology ,” 26 an essay  which is as important for what it leaves unsaid as for its actual  content. Bell presents and discusses the Marxist analysis of  ideology as a mask for class interest, in particular quoting  Marx’s well-known description of the belief of the bourgeoisie  “that the special conditions of its emancipation are the general  conditions through which alone modern society can be saved  and the class struggle avoided.” He then argues that the age of  ideology is ended, supplanted, at least in the West, by a general  agreement that each issue must be settled on its own individual  terms, within the framework of a welfare state in which, pre¬  sumably, experts in the conduct of public affairs will have a  prominent role. Bell is quite careful, however, to characterize  the precise sense of “ideology” in which “ideologies are ex¬  hausted.” He is referring only to ideology as “the conversion of  ideas into social levers,” to ideology as “a set of beliefs, infused  with passion, . . . [which] . . . seeks to transform the whole of a  way of life.” The crucial words are “transform” and “convert       ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   into social levers / 5 Intellectuals in the West, he argues, have lost  interest in converting ideas into social levers for the radical  transformation of society. Now that we have achieved the plu¬  ralistic society of the welfare state, they see no further need for  a radical transformation of society; we may tinker with our way  of life here and there, but it would be wrong to try to modify it  in any significant way. With this consensus of intellectuals,  ideology is dead.   There are several striking facts about Bell’s essay. First, he  does not point out the extent to which this consensus of the  intellectuals is self-serving. He does not relate his observation  that, by and large, intellectuals have lost interest in “transform¬  ing the whole way of life 55 to the fact that they play an increas¬  ingly prominent role in running the welfare state; he does not  relate their general satisfaction with the welfare state to the fact  that, as he observes elsewhere, “America has become an affluent  society, offering place ... and prestige ... to the onetime  radicals.” Secondly, he offers no serious argument to show that  intellectuals are somehow “right” or “objectively justified” in  reaching the consensus to which he alludes, with its rejection of  the notion that society should be transformed. Indeed, although  Bell is fairly sharp about the empty rhetoric of the “New Left,”  he seems to have a quite utopian faith that technical experts  will be able to come to grips with the few problems that still  remain; for example, the fact that labor is treated as a commod¬  ity, and the problems of “alienation.”   It seems fairly obvious that the classical problems are very  much with us; one might plausibly argue that they have even  been enhanced in severity and scale. For example, the classical  paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty is now an ever, in¬  creasing problem on an international scale. Whereas one might    ',\n",
       " '  The Responsibility of Intellectuals   conceive, at least in principle, of a solution within national  boundaries, a sensible idea as to how to transform international  society in such a way as to cope with the vast and perhaps  increasing human misery is hardly likely to develop within the  framework of the intellectual consensus that Bell describes. .   Thus it would seem natural to describe the consensus of Bell’s  intellectuals in somewhat different terms than his. Using the  terminology of the first part of his essay, we might say that the  welfare state technician finds justification for his special and  prominent social status in his “science,” specifically, in the claim  that social science can support a technology of social tinkering  on a domestic or international scale. He then takes a further  step, proceeding, in a familiar way, to claim universal validity  for what is in fact a class interest: he argues that the special  conditions on which his claims to power and authority are  based are, in fact, the general conditions through which alone  modern society can be saved; that social tinkering within a  welfare state framework must replace the commitment to the  “total ideologies” of the past, ideologies which were concerned  with a transformation of society. Having found his position of  power, having achieved security and affluence, he has no fur¬  ther need for ideologies that look to radical change. The scholar-  expert replaces the “free-floating intellectual” who “felt that the  wrong values were being honored, and rejected the society,”  and who has now lost his political role (now, that is, that the  right values are being honored).   Conceivably, it is correct that the technical experts who will  (or hope to) manage the “postindustrial society” will be able to  cope with the classic problems without a radical transformation  of society. Just so, it is conceivably true that the bourgeoisie  was right in regarding the special conditions of its emancipation     *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   as the general conditions through which alone modern society  would be saved. In either case, an argument is in order, and  skepticism is justified where none appears.   Within the same framework of general utopianism, Bell goes  on to pose the issue between welfare state scholar-experts and  Third World ideologists in a rather curious way. He points out,  quite correctly, that there is no issue of Communism, the content  of that doctrine having been “long forgotten by friends and  foes alike.” Rather, he says, “the question is an older one:  whether new societies can grow by building democratic institu¬  tions and allowing people to make choices—and sacrifices—  voluntarily, or whether the new elites, heady with power, will  impose totalitarian means to transform their countries.” The  question is an interesting one; it is odd, however, to see it  referred to as “an older one.” Surely he cannot be suggesting  that the West chose the democratic way—for example, that in  England during the industrial revolution, the farmers voluntar¬  ily made the choice of leaving the land, giving up cottage  industry, becoming an industrial proletariat, and voluntarily de¬  cided, within the framework of the existing democratic institu¬  tions, to make the sacrifices that are graphically described in the  classic literature on nineteenth-century industrial society. One  may debate the question whether authoritarian control is neces¬  sary to permit capital accumulation in the underdeveloped  world, but the Western model of development is hardly one  that we can point to with any pride. It is perhaps not surprising  to find a Walt Rostow referring to “the more humane processes  [of industrialization] that Western values would suggest .” 27  Those who have a serious concern for the problems that face  backward countries and for the role that advanced industrial  societies might, in principle, play in development and moderni-  ',\n",
       " '   The Responsibility of Intellectuals    zation must use somewhat more care in interpreting the signifi¬  cance of the Western experience.   Returning to the quite appropriate question, whether “new  societies can grow by building democratic institutions” or only  by totalitarian means, I think that honesty requires us to recog¬  nize that this question must be directed more to American intel¬  lectuals than to Third World ideologists. The backward coun¬  tries have incredible, perhaps insurmountable problems, and  few available options; the United States has a wide range of  options, and has the economic and technological resources,  though evidently neither the intellectual nor the moral re¬  sources, to confront at least some of these problems. It is easy  for an American intellectual to deliver homilies on the virtues of  freedom and liberty, but if he is really concerned about, say,  Chinese totalitarianism or the burdens imposed on the Chinese  peasantry in forced industrialization, then he should face a task  that is infinitely more significant and challenging—the task of  creating, in the United States, the intellectual and moral cli¬  mate, as well as the social and economic conditions, that would  permit this country to participate in modernization and devel¬  opment in a way commensurate with its material wealth and  technical capacity. Massive capital gifts to Cuba and China  might not succeed in alleviating the authoritarianism and terror  that tend to accompany early stages of capital accumulation,  but they are far more likely to have this effect than lectures on  democratic values. It is possible that even without “capitalist  encirclement” in its varying manifestations, the truly democratic  elements in revolutionary movements—in some instances so¬  viets and collectives, for example—might be undermined by an  “elite” of bureaucrats and technical intelligentsia; but it is a  near certainty that the fact of capitalist encirclement, which all     + — AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   revolutionary movements now have to face, will guarantee this  result. The lesson, for those who are concerned to strengthen  the democratic, spontaneous, and popular elements in develop¬  ing societies, is quite clear. Lectures on the two-party system, or  even the really substantial democratic values that have been in  part realized in Western society, are a monstrous irrelevance in  the face of the effort that is required to raise the level of culture  in Western society to the point where it can provide a “social  lever” for both economic development and the development of  true democratic institutions in the Third World—and for that  matter, at home as well.   A good case can be made for the conclusion that there is  indeed something of a consensus among intellectuals who have  already achieved power and affluence, or who sense that they  can achieve them by “accepting society” as it is and promoting  the values that are “being honored” in this society. And it is also  true that this consensus is most noticeable among the scholar-  experts who are replacing the free-floating intellectuals of the  past. In the university, these scholar-experts construct a “value-  free technology” for the solution of technical problems that  arise in contemporary society , 28 taking a “responsible stance”  towards these problems, in the sense noted earlier. This con¬  sensus among the responsible scholar-experts is the domestic  analogue to that proposed, in the international arena, by those  who justify the application of American power in Asia, what¬  ever the human cost, on the grounds that it is necessary to  contain the “expansion of China” (an “expansion” which is, to  be sure, hypothetical for the time being) 29 —to translate from  State Department Newspeak, on the grounds that it is essential  to reverse the Asian nationalist revolutions, or at least to pre¬  vent them from spreading. The analogy becomes clear when we  look carefully at the ways in which this proposal is formulated.    ',\n",

Captured  NLF documents contrast the enemy’s “military superiority”  with their own “political superiority” (p. 106), thus fully con¬  firming the analysis of American military spokesmen who define  our problem as how, “with considerable armed force but little  political power, [to] contain an adversary who has enormous  political force but only modest military power.” 34   Similarly, the most striking outcome of both the Honolulu  conference in February and the Manila conference in October  was the frank admission by high officials of the Saigon govern¬  ment that “they could not survive a ‘peaceful settlement’ that  left the Vietcong political structure in place even if the Viet¬  cong guerrilla units were disbanded,” that “they are not able to  compete politically with the Vietnamese Communists. ^ Thus,  Mohr continues, the Vietnamese demand a “pacification pro¬  gram” which will have as “its core ... the destruction of the  clandestine Vietcong political structure and the creation of an  iron-like system of government political control over the popu¬  lation.” And from Manila, the same correspondent, on October  23, quotes a high South Vietnamese official as saying: “Frankly,  we are not strong enough now to compete with the Communists  on a purely political basis. They are organized and disciplined.  The non-Communist nationalists are not—we do not have any  large, well-organized political parties and we do not yet have  unity. We cannot leave the Vietcong in existence.” Officials in  Washington understand the situation very well. Thus Secretary  Rusk has pointed out that “if the Vietcong come to the confer¬  ence table as full partners they will, in a sense, have been  victorious in the very aims that South Vietnam and the United  States are pledged to prevent” (January 28, 1966). Similarly,  Max Frankel reported from Washington: “Compromise has had  no appeal here because the Administration concluded long agfr     *= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   that the non-Communist forces of South Vietnam could not  long survive in a Saigon coalition with Communists. It is for that  reason—and not because of an excessively rigid sense of proto¬  col—that Washington has steadfastly refused to deal with the  Vietcong or recognize them as an independent political force/’ 36   In short, we will—magnanimously—permit Vietcong repre¬  sentatives to attend negotiations, but only if they will agree to  identify themselves as agents of a foreign power and thus forfeit  the right to participate in a coalition government, a right which  they have now been demanding for a half-dozen years. We know  well that in any representative coalition, our chosen delegates  could not last a day without the support of American arms.  Therefore, we must increase American force and resist mean¬  ingful negotiations, until the day when a client government can  exert both military and political control over its own population  —a day which may never dawn, for as William Bundy has  pointed out, we could never be sure of the security of a South¬  east Asia “from which the Western presence was effectively  withdrawn.” Thus if we were to “negotiate in the direction of  solutions that are put under the label of neutralization,” this  would amount to capitulation to the Communists. 37 According  to this reasoning, then, South Vietnam must remain, perma¬  nently, an American military base.   All of this is of course reasonable, so long as we accept the  fundamental political axiom that the United States, with its  traditional concern for the rights of the weak and downtrodden,  and with its unique insight into the proper mode of develop¬  ment for backward countries, must have the courage and the  persistence to impose its will by force until such time as other  nations are prepared to accept these truths—or simply to aban¬  don hope.   If it is the responsibility of the intellectual to insist upon the   ',\n",
       " '   The Responsibility of Intellectuals    truth, it is also his duty to see events in their historical perspec¬  tive. Thus one must applaud the insistence of the Secretary of  State on the importance of historical analogies, the Munich  analogy, for example. As Munich showed, a powerful and ag¬  gressive nation with a fanatic belief in its manifest destiny will  regard each victory, each extension of its power and authority,  as a prelude to the next step. The matter was very well put by  Adlai Stevenson, when he spoke of “the old, old route whereby  expansive powers push at more and more doors, believing they  will open, until, at the ultimate door, resistance is unavoidable  and major war breaks out.” Herein lies the danger of appease¬  ment, as the Chinese tirelessly point out to the Soviet Union,  which they claim is playing Chamberlain to our Hitler in Viet¬  nam. Of course, the aggressiveness of liberal imperialism is not  that of Nazi Germany, though the distinction may seem rather  academic to a Vietnamese peasant who is being gassed or in¬  cinerated. We do not want to occupy Asia; we merely wish, to  return to Mr. Wolf, “to help the Asian countries progress  toward economic modernization, as relatively ‘open’ and stable  societies, to which our access, as a country and as individual  citizens, is free and comfortable.” 38 The formulation is appro¬  priate. Recent history shows that it makes little difference to us  what form of government a country has as long as it remains an  “open society,” in our peculiar sense of this term-—a society,  that is, which remains open to American economic penetration  or political control. If it is necessary to approach genocide in  Vietnam to achieve this objective, then this is the price we must  pay in defense of freedom and the rights of man.   It is, no doubt, superfluous to discuss at length the ways in  which we assist other countries to progress towards open socie¬  ties “to which our access is free and comfortable.” One enlight¬  ening example is discussed in the recent congressional hearings     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    from which I have now quoted several times, in the testimony  of Willem Holst and Robert Meagher, representing the Stand¬  ing Committee on India of the Business Council for Interna¬  tional Understanding. 39 As Mr. Meagher points out: “If it was  possible, India would probably prefer to import technicians and  know-how rather than foreign corporations. Such is not possi¬  ble ; therefore India accepts foreign capital as a necessary evil.”  Of course, “the question of private capital investment in India  . . . would be no more than a theoretical exercise” had the  groundwork for such investment not been laid by foreign aid,  and were it not that “necessity has forced a modification in  India’s approach to private foreign capital.” But now, “India’s  attitude toward private foreign investment is undergoing a sub¬  stantial change. From a position of resentment and ambiva¬  lence, it is evolving toward an acceptance of its necessity. As  the necessity becomes more and more evident, the ambivalence  will probably be replaced by a more accommodating attitude.”  Mr. Holst contributes what is “perhaps a typical case history,”  namely, “the plan under which it was proposed that the Indian  Government in partnership with a United States private con¬  sortium was to have increased fertilizer production by a million  tons per year, which is just double presently installed capacity  in all of India. The unfortunate demise of this ambitious plan  may be attributed in large part to the failure of both Govern¬  ment and business to find a workable and mutually acceptable  solution within the framework of the well-publicized 10 busi¬  ness incentives.” The difficulty here was in connection with the  percentage of equity ownership. Obviously, “fertilizers are des¬  perately needed in India.” Equally obviously, the consortium  “insisted that to get the proper kind of control majority owner¬  ship was in fact needed.” But “the Indian Government officially  insisted that they shall have majority ownership,” and “in some-   ',\n",

Notes   I. Such a research project has now been undertaken and published as  a “Citizens’ White Paper”: F. Schurmann, P. D. Scott, and R. Zelnik,  The Politics of Escalation in Vietnam (New York, Fawcett World  Library, and Boston, Beacon Press, 1966). For further evidence of  American rejection of United Nations initiatives for diplomatic set-  tlement, just prior to the major escalation of February 1965, see  Mario Rossi, “The US Rebuff to U Thant,” New York Review\" of  Books, November 17, 1966. See also Theodore Draper, “How Not To  Negotiate,” New York Review of Books, May 4, 1967. There is fur¬  ther documentary evidence of NLF attempts to establish a coalition  government and to neutralize the area, all rejected by the United  States and its Saigon ally, in Douglas Pike, Viet Cong (Cambridge,  Mass., The M.I.T. Press, 1966). In reading material of this latter sort  one must be especially careful to distinguish between the evidence  presented and the “conclusions” that are asserted, for reasons noted  briefly below (see note 33).   It is interesting to see the first, somewhat oblique published reac¬  tions to The Politics of Escalation by those who defend our right to  conquer South Vietnam and institute a government of our choice. For  example, Robert Scalapino ( New York Times Magazine , December   II, 1966) argues that the thesis of the book implies that our leaders  are “diabolical.” Since no right-thinking person can believe this, the  thesis is refuted. To assume otherwise would betray “irresponsibility,”  in a unique sense of this term—a sense that gives an ironic twist to the  title of this chapter. He goes on to point out the alleged central  weakness in the argument of the book, namely, the failure to perceive  that a serious attempt on our part to pursue the possibilities for a  diplomatic settlement would have been interpreted by our adversaries  as a sign of weakness.    ',\n",
       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   they approve of our violence in Vietnam, which, as they are  well aware, enormously exceeds that of the Vietnamese enemy.  To further underline this point, they cite as our greatest tri¬  umph in Southeast Asia the “dramatic changes” which have  taken place in Indonesia—the most dramatic being the mas¬  sacre of several hundred thousand people. But this massacre,  like our extermination of Vietnamese, is not a use of violence to  effect social change and is therefore legitimate. What is more, it  may be that those massacred were largely ethnic Chinese and  landless peasants, and that the “countercoup” in effect re-estab¬  lished traditional authority more firmly. 19 If so, all the more  reason why we should not deplore this use of violence; and in  fact, the moderate scholars delicately refrain from alluding to it  in their discussion of dramatic changes in Indonesia. We must  conclude that when these scholars deplore the use of violence to  effect change, it is not the violence but rather steps toward social  change that they find truly disturbing. Social change that de¬  parts from the course we plot is not to be tolerated. The threat  to order is too great.   So great is the importance of stability and order that even  reform of the sort that receives American authorization must  often be delayed, the moderate scholars emphasize. “Indeed,  many types of reform increase instability, however desirable  and essential they may be in long-range terms. For people  under siege, there is no substitute for security.” The reference,  needless to say, is not to security from American bombardment,  but rather to security from the wrong sorts of political and  social change.   The policy recommendations of the moderate scholars are  based on their particular ideological bias, namely, that a certain  form of stability—not that of North Vietnam or North Korea,  but that of Thailand, Taiwan, or the Philippines—is so essential       .fr -- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   that we must be willing to use our unparalleled means of vio¬  lence to ensure that it is preserved. It is instructive to see how  other mentors of the new mandarins describe the problem of  order and reform. Ithiel Pool formulates the central issue as  follows:   In the Congo, in Vietnam, in the Dominican Republic, it is clear  that order depends on somehow compelling newly mobilized  strata to return to a measure of passivity and defeatism from  which they have recently been aroused by the process of mod¬  ernization. At least temporarily, the maintenance of order re¬  quires a lowering of newly acquired aspirations and levels of  political activity. 20   This is what “we have learned in the past thirty years of inten¬  sive empirical study of contemporary societies.” Pool is merely  describing facts, not proposing policy. A corresponding version  of the facts is familiar on the domestic scene: workers threaten  the public order by striking for their demands, the impatience  of the Negro community threatens the stability of the body  politic. One can, of course, imagine another way in which order  can be preserved in all such cases: namely, by meeting the  demands, or at the very least by removing the barriers that  have been placed, by force which may be latent and disguised,  in the way of attempts to satisfy the “newly acquired aspira¬  tions.” But this might mean that the wealthy and powerful  would have to sacrifice some degree of privilege, and it is there¬  fore excluded as a method for maintenance of order. Such pro¬  posals are likely to meet with little sympathy from Pool’s new  mandarins.   From the doubly privileged position of the American scholar,  the transcendent importance of order, stability, and nonvio¬  lence (by the oppressed) seems entirely obvious; to others, the   ',\n",

At other times, Schlesinger does indeed display admirable scholarly  caution. For example, in his introduction to The Politics of Escalation  he admits that there may have been “flickers of interest in negotia¬  tions” on the part of Hanoi. As to the administration’s lies about  negotiations and its repeated actions undercutting tentative initiatives  towards negotiations, he comments only that the authors may have  underestimated military necessity and that future historians may prove  them wrong. This caution and detachment must be compared with  Schlesinger’s attitude towards renewed study of the origins of the Cold  War: in a letter to the New York Review of Books, October 20, 1966,  he remarks that it is time to “blow the whistle” on revisionist attempts  to show that the Cold War may have been the consequence of some¬  thing more than mere Communist belligerence. We are to believe,  then, that the relatively straightforward matter of the origins of the  Cold War is settled beyond discussion, whereas the much more com¬  plex issue of why the United States shies away from a negotiated  settlement in Vietnam must be left to future historians to ponder.   It is useful to bear in mind that the United States government itself  is on occasion much less diffident in explaining why it refuses to  contemplate a meaningful negotiated settlement. As is freely admitted,  this solution would leave it without power to control the situation. See,  for example, note 37.   6. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., A Thousand Days: John F.

Although, to maintain perspective, we should recall that in his  wildest moments, Alfred Rosenberg spoke of the elimination of thirty  million Slavs, not the imposition of mass starvation on a quarter of the  human race. Incidentally, the analogy drawn here is highly “irrespon¬  sible, in the technical sense of this neologism discussed earlier. That  is, it is based on the assumption that statements and actions of Ameri¬  cans are subject to the same standards and open to the same interpre¬  tations as those of anyone else.   25. New York Times, February 6, 1966. What is more, Goldberg  continues, the United States is not certain that all of these are volun¬  tary adherents. This is not the first such demonstration of Communist  duplicity. Another example was seen in the year 1962, when according  to United States government sources 15,000 guerrillas suffered 30,000  casualties. See Arthur Schlesinger, A Thousand Days, p. 982.   26. Reprinted in a collection of essays entitled The End of Ideology:  On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties (New York The  Free Press, 1960), pp. 369-75. I have no intention here of entering into  the full range of issues that have been raised in the discussion of the  “end of ideology” for the past dozen years. It is difficult to see how a  rational person could quarrel with many of the theses that have been  put forth, e.g., that at a certain historical moment the “politics of  civility is appropriate, and perhaps efficacious; that one who advo¬  cates action (or inaction—a matter less frequently noted) has a re¬  sponsibility to assess its social cost; that dogmatic fanaticism and   secular religions” should be combated (or if possible ignored); that  technical solutions to problems should be implemented, where possi¬  ble; that “/e dogmatisme ideologique devait disparaitre pour que les  idees repnssent vie” (Aron); and so on. Since this is sometimes taken to  be an expression of an “anti-Marxist” position, it is worth keeping in  mind that such sentiments as these have no bearing on non-Bolshevik  Marxism, as represented, for example, by such figures as Luxemburg,  Pannekoek, Korsch, Arthur Rosenberg, and many others.   27.

Nor am I aware of a research project  devoted to the problem of how poorly armed guerrillas might more  effectively resist a brutal and devastating military technology—surely  the kind of problem that would have interested the free-floating intel¬  lectual who is now hopelessly out of date.   29. In view of the unremitting propaganda barrage on “Chinese  expansionism/’ perhaps a word of comment is in order. Typical of  American propaganda on this subject is Adlai Stevenson’s assessment,  shortly before his death (cf. New York Times Magazine, March 13,  1966): “So far, the new Communist ‘dynasty’ has been very aggres¬  sive. Tibet was swallowed, India attacked, the Malays had to fight 12  years to resist a ‘national liberation’ they could receive from the Brit¬  ish by a more peaceful route. Today, the apparatus of infiltration and  aggression is already at work in North Thailand.”   As to Malaya, Stevenson is probably confusing ethnic Chinese with  the government of China. Those concerned with the actual events  would agree with Harry Miller, in Communist Menace in Malaya  (New York, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1954), p. 230, that “Com¬  munist China continues to show little interest in the Malayan affair  beyond its usual fulminations via Peking Radio.” There are various  harsh things that one might say about Chinese behavior in what the  Sino-Indian Treaty of 1954 refers to as “the Tibet region of China,  but it is no more proof of a tendency towards expansionism than is the  behavior of the Indian government with regard to the Naga and Mizo  tribesmen. As to North Thailand, “the apparatus of infiltration” may  well be at work, though there is little reason to suppose it to be  Chinese-and it is surely not unrelated to the American use of  Thailand as a base for its attack on Vietnam. This reference is the  sheerest hypocrisy.   The “attack on India” grew out of a border dispute that began  several years after the Chinese had completed a road from Tibet to  Sinkiang in an area so remote from Indian control that the Indians  learned about this operation only from the Chinese press. According  to American Air Force maps, the disputed area is in Chinese territory.  Cf. Alastair Lamb, China Quarterly, No. 23 (July-September 1965), pp.  202-7. To this distinguished authority, “it seems unlikely that the  Chinese have been working out some master plan ... to take over the  Indian sub-continent lock, stock and overpopulated barrel.” Rather, he  thinks it likely that the Chinese were probably unaware that India even    ',\n",

On Monday, October 16, on \\'the Boston Common I listened as      On Resistance   Howard Zinn explained why he felt ashamed to be an Ameri¬  can. I watched as several hundred young men, some of them  my students, made a terrible decision which no young person  should have to face: to sever their connection with the Selective  Service System. The week ended, the following Monday, with a  quiet discussion in Cambridge in which I heard estimates, by an  academic consultant to the Department of Defense, of the  nuclear megatonnage that would be necessary to a take out 1 ’  North Vietnam (“Some will find this shocking, but . . “No  civilian in the government is suggesting this, to my knowledge  . ... “Let’s not use emotional words like \\'destruction’ etc.),  and listened to a leading expert on Soviet affairs who explained  how the men in the Kremlin are watching very carefully to  determine whether wars of national liberation can succeed—if  so, they will support them all over the world. (Try pointing out  to such an expert that on these assumptions, if the men in the  Kremlin are rational, they will surely support dozens of such  wars right now, since at a small cost they can confound the  American military and tear our society to shreds—you will be  told that you don’t understand the Russian soul.)   The weekend of the peace demonstrations in Washington left  impressions that are vivid and intense, but unclear to me in  their implications. The dominant memory is of the scene itself,  of tens of thousands of young people surrounding what they  believe to be—I must add that I agree—the most hideous insti¬  tution on this earth and demanding that it stop imposing misery  and destruction. Tens of thousands of young people. This I find  hard to comprehend. It is pitiful but true that by an over¬  whelming margin it is the young who are crying out in horror at  what we all see happening, the young who are being beaten  when they stand their ground, and the young who have to  decide whether to accept jail or exile, or to fight in a hideous     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   war. They have to face this decision alone, or almost alone. We   should ask ourselves why this is so.   Why, for example, does Senator Mansfield feel “ashamed for  the image they have portrayed of this country,” and not feel  ashamed for the image of this country portrayed by the institu¬  tion these young people were confronting, an institution di¬  rected by a sane and mild and eminently reasonable man who  can testify calmly before Congress that the amount of ordnance  expended in Vietnam has surpassed the total expended in Ger¬  many and Italy in World War II? Why is it that Senator Mans¬  field can speak in ringing phrases about those who are not  living up to our commitment to “a government of laws”—refer¬  ring to a small group of demonstrators, not to the ninety-odd  responsible men on the Senate floor who are watching, with full „  knowledge, as the state they serve clearly, flagrantly violates the  explicit provisions of the United Nations Charter, the supreme  law of the land? He knows quite well that prior to our invasion  of Vietnam there was no armed attack against any state. It was  Senator Mansfield, after all, who informed us that “when the  sharp increase in the American military effort began in early  1965, it was estimated that only about 400 North Vietnamese  soldiers were among the enemy forces in the South which  totaled 140,000 at that time”; and it is the Mansfield Report  from which we learn that at that time there were 34,000 Ameri¬  can soldiers already in South Vietnam, in violation of our  “solemn commitment” at Geneva in 1954.   The point should be pursued. After the first International  Days of Protest in October 1965, Senator Mansfield criticized  the “sense of utter irresponsibility” shown by the demonstrators.  He had nothing to say then, nor has he since, about the “sense  of utter irresponsibility” shown by Senator Mansfield and others  who stand by quietly and vote appropriations as the cities and    ',\n",
       " '   On Resistance   villages of North Vietnam are demolished, as millions of refu¬  gees in the South are driven from their homes by American  bombardment. He has nothing to say about the moral standards  or the respect for law of those who have permitted this  tragedy.   I speak of Senator Mansfield precisely because he is not a  breast-beating superpatriot who wants America to rule the  world, but is rather an American intellectual in the best sense, a  scholarly and reasonable man—the kind of man who is the  terror of our age. Perhaps this is merely a personal reaction, but  when I look at what is happening to our country, what I find  most terrifying is not Curtis LeMay, with his cheerful sugges¬  tion that we bomb our “enemies” back into the Stone Age, but  rather the calm disquisitions of the political scientists on just  how much force will be necessary to achieve our ends, or just  what form of government will be acceptable to us in Vietnam.  What I find terrifying is the detachment and equanimity with  which we view and discuss an unbearable tragedy. We all know  that if Russia or China were guilty of what we have done in  Vietnam, we would be exploding with moral indignation at  these monstrous crimes.   There was, I think, a serious miscalculation in the planning of  the Washington demonstrations. It was expected that the march  to the Pentagon would be followed by a number of speeches,  and that those who were committed to civil disobedience would  then separate themselves from the crowd and go to the Penta¬  gon, a few hundred yards away across an open field. I had  decided not to take part in civil disobedience, and I do not  know in detail what had been planned. As everyone must real¬  ize, it is very hard to distinguish rationalization from rationality  in such matters. I felt, however, that the first large-scale acts of  civil disobedience should be more specifically defined, more     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   clearly in support of those who are refusing to serve in Vietnam,  on whom the real burden of dissent must inevitably fall. While  appreciating the point of view of those who wished to express  their hatred of the war in a more explicit way, I was not con¬  vinced that civil disobedience at the Pentagon would be either  meaningful or effective.   In any event, what actually happened was rather different  from what anyone had anticipated. A few thousand people  gathered for the speeches, but the mass of marchers went  straight on to the Pentagon, some because they were committed  to direct action, many because they were simply swept along.  From the speakers’ platform where I stood it was difficult to  determine just what was taking place at the Pentagon. All we  could see was the surging of the crowd. From secondhand re¬  ports, I understand that the marchers passed through and  around the front line of troops and took up a position, which  they maintained, on the steps of the Pentagon. It soon became  obvious that it was wrong for the few organizers of the march  and the mostly middle-aged group that had gathered near them  to remain at the speakers’ platform while the demonstrators  themselves, most of them quite young, were at the Pentagon. (I  recall seeing near the platform Robert Lowell, Dwight Mac¬  donald, Monsignor Rice, Sidney Lens, Benjamin Spock and his  wife, Dagmar Wilson, Donald Kalish.) Dave Dellinger sug¬  gested that we try to approach the Pentagon. We found a place  not yet blocked by the demonstrators, and walked up to the line  of troops standing a few feet from the building. Dellinger sug¬  gested that those of us who had not yet spoken at the rally talk  directly to the soldiers through a small portable sound system.  From this point on, my impressions are rather fragmentary.  Monsignor Rice spoke, and I followed. As I was speaking, the  line of soldiers advanced, moving past me—a rather odd expe-    ',\n",
       " '     On Resistance   nence. I don’t recall just what I was saying. The gist was, I  suppose, that we were there because we didn’t want the sol¬  diers to kill and be killed, but I do remember feeling that the  way I was putting it seemed silly and irrelevant.   The advancing line of soldiers had partially scattered the  small group that had come with Dellinger. Those of us who had  been left behind the line of soldiers regrouped, and Dr. Spock  began to speak. Almost at once, another line of soldiers  emerged from somewhere, this time in a tightly massed forma¬  tion, rifles in hand, and moved slowly forward. We sat down.  As I mentioned earlier, I had no intention of taking part in any  act of civil disobedience, until that moment. But when that  grotesque organism began slowly advancing—more grotesque  because its cells were recognizable human beings—it became  obvious that one could not permit that thing to dictate what  one was going to do. I was arrested at that point by a federal  marshal, presumably for obstructing the soldiers (the technical  term for this behavior is “disorderly conduct”) I should add  that the soldiers, so far as I could see (which was not very far),  seemed rather unhappy about the whole matter, and were’  being about as gentle as one can be when ordered (I presume  this was the order) to kick and club passive, quiet people who  refuse to move. The federal marshals, predictably, were very  different. They reminded ,me of the police officers I had seen in  a Jackson, Mississippi, jail several summers ago, who had  laughed when an old man showed us a bloody homemade ban¬  dage on his leg and tried to describe to us how he had been  beaten by the police. In Washington, the ones who got the  worst of it at the hands of the marshals were the young boys  and girls, particularly boys with long hair. Nothing seemed to  bring out the marshals’ sadism more than the sight of a boy  with long hair. Yet, although I witnessed some acts of violence   ',\n",
       " '      AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   ★====   by the marshals, their behavior largely seemed to range from  indifference to petty nastiness. For example, we were kept m a  police van for an hour or two with the doors closed and only a  few air holes for ventilation—one can’t be too careful with such  ferocious criminal types.   In the prison dormitory and after my release I heard many  stories, which I feel sure are authentic, of the courage of the  young people, many of whom were quite frightened by the  terrorism that began late at night after the TV cameramen and  most of the press had left. They sat quietly hour after hour  through the cold night; many were kicked and beaten and  dragged across police lines (more “disorderly conduct”). I also  heard stories, distressing ones, of provocation of the troops by the  demonstrators—usually, it seems, those who were not in the front  rows. Surely this was indefensible. Soldiers are unwitting instru¬  ments of terror; one does not blame or attack the club that is  used to bludgeon someone to death. They are also human beings,  with sensibilities to which one can perhaps appeal. There is in  fact strong evidence that one soldier, perhaps three or four, re¬  fused to obey orders and was placed under arrest. The soldiers,  after all, are in much the same position as the draft resisters. If  they obey orders, they become brutalized by what they do; if  they do not, the personal consequences are severe. It is a situa¬  tion that deserves compassion, not abuse. But we should retain a  sense of proportion in the matter. Everything that I saw or heard  indicates that the demonstrators played only a small role m  initiating the considerable violence that occurred.   The argument that resistance to the war should remain  strictly nonviolent seems to me overwhelming. As a tactic, vio¬  lence is absurd. No one can compete with the government m  this arena, and the resort to violence, which will surely fail, will  simply frighten and alienate some who can be reached, and will    ',\n",
       " '   On Resistance   further encourage the ideologists and administrators of forceful  repression. What is more, one hopes that participants in non¬  violent resistance will themselves become human beings of a  more admirable sort. No one can fail to be impressed by the  personal qualities of those who have grown to maturity in the  civil rights movement. Whatever else it may have accom¬  plished, the civil rights movement has made an inestimable.   contribution to American society in transforming the lives and  characters of those who took part in it. Perhaps a program of  principled, nonviolent resistance can do the same for many  others, in the particular circumstances that we face today. It is  not impossible that this may save the country from a terrible  future, from yet another generation of men who think it clever  to discuss the bombing of North Vietnam as a question of tac¬  tics and cost-effectiveness, or who support our attempt to con¬  quer South Vietnam, with the human cost that they well know,  blandly asserting that “our primary motivation is self-interest—  the self-interest of our own country in this shrinking world”  (Citizens Committee for Peace with Freedom, New York  Times , October 26, 1967).   Returning to the demonstrations, I must admit that I was  lelieved to find people whom I had respected for years in the  prison dormitory—Norman Mailer, Jim Peck, Dave Dellinger,  and a number of others. I think it was reassuring to many of the  kids who were there to be able to feel that they were not totally  disconnected from a world that they knew and from people  whom they admired. It was moving to see that defenseless  young people who had a great deal to lose were willing to be  jailed for what they believed—young instructors from state uni¬  versities, college kids who have a very bright future if they are  willing to toe the line, many others whom I could not identify.   What comes next? Obviously, that is the question on every-     ★== \\' AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   one\\'s mind. The slogan “From Dissent to Resistance\" makes  sense, I think, but I hope it is not taken to imply that dissent  should cease. Dissent and resistance are not alternatives but  activities that should reinforce each other. There is no reason  why those who take part in tax refusal, draft resistance, and  other forms of resistance should not also speak to church groups  or town forums, or become involved in electoral politics to sup¬  port peace candidates or referenda on the war. In my experi¬  ence, it has often been those committed to resistance who have  been most deeply involved in such attempts at persuasion. Put¬  ting aside the matter of resistance for a moment, I think it  should be emphasized that the days of “patiently explain\" are  far from over. As the coffins come home and the taxes go up,  many people who were previously willing to accept government  propaganda will become increasingly concerned to try to think  for themselves. The reasons for their change are unfortunate;  the opportunities for educational activity are nevertheless very  good.   Furthermore, the recent shift in the government’s propa¬  ganda line offers important opportunities for critical analysis of  the war. There is a note of shrill desperation in the recent  defense of the American war in Vietnam. We hear less about  “bringing freedom and democracy\" to the South Vietnamese  and more about the “national interest.” Secretary Rusk broods  about the dangers posed to us by a billion Chinese; the Vice-  President tells us that we are fighting “militant Asian Commu¬  nism\" with “its headquarters in Peking” and adds that a Viet-  cong victory would directly threaten the United States; Eugene  Rostow argues that “it is no good building model cities if they  are to be bombed in twenty years time,\" and so on (all of this  “a frivolous insult to the United States Navy,\" as Walter Lipp-  mann rightly commented).   ',\n",
       " '     On Resistance    This shift in propaganda makes it much easier for critical  analysis to attack the problem of Vietnam at its core, which is in  Washington and Boston, not in Saigon and Hanoi. There is  something ludicrous, after all, in the close attention that oppo¬  nents of the war give to the political and social problems of  Vietnam. Those who were opposed to the Japanese conquest of  Manchuria a generation ago did not place emphasis on the  political and social and economic problems of Manchuria, but  on those of Japan. They did not engage in farcical debate over  the exact degree of support for the puppet emperor, but looked  to the sources of Japanese imperialism. Now opponents of the  war can much more easily shift attention to the source of the  aggression, to our own country, its ideology and institutions.  We can ask whose “interest” is served by 100,000 casualties and  100 billion dollars expended in the attempt to subjugate a small  country halfway around the world. We can point to the absur¬  dity of the idea that we are “containing China” by destroying  popular and independent forces on its borders, and to the cyni¬  cism of the claim that we are in Vietnam because “to Ameri¬  cans, peace and freedom are inseparable” and because “sup¬  pression of freedom” must not “go unchallenged” (the Citizens  Committee again). We can ask why it is that those who make  this claim do not suggest that an American expeditionary force  be sent to Taiwan, to Rhodesia, to Greece, or to Mississippi, but  only to Vietnam, where, they want us to believe, the master  aggressor Mao Tse-tung is following a Hitlerian course in his  cunning way, committing aggression without troops and an¬  nouncing world conquest by insisting, through the medium of  Lin Piao, that indigenous wars of national liberation can expect  little from China beyond applause. We can ask why Secretary  McNamara reads such statements as a new Mein Kampf —or  why those who admit that “a Vietnamese communist regime   ',\n",
       " '   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    would probably be . . . anti-Chinese” (Ithiel de Sola Pool, Asian  Swvey, August 1967) nevertheless sign statements which pre¬  tend that in Vietnam we are facing the expansionist aggressors  from Peking. We can ask what factors in American ideology  make it so easy for intelligent and well-informed men to say that  we “insist upon nothing for South Vietnam except that it be free  to chart its own future” (Citizens Committee) although they  know quite well that the regime we imposed excluded all those  who took part in the struggle against French colonialism, “and  properly so” (Secretary Rusk, 1963); that we have since been  attempting to suppress a “civil insurrection” (General Stillwell)  led by the only “truly mass-based political party in South Viet¬  nam” (Douglas Pike); that we supervised the destruction of the  Buddhist opposition; that we offered the peasants a “free  choice” between the Saigon government and the National Lib¬  eration Front by herding them into strategic hamlets from  which NLF cadres and sympathizers were eliminated by the  police (Roger Hilsman); and so on. The story is familiar. And  we can emphasize what must be obvious to a person with a  grain of political intelligence: that the present world problem is,  not “containing China” but containing the United States.   More important, we can ask the really fundamental question.  Suppose that it were in the American “national interest” to  pound into rubble a small nation that refuses to submit to our  will. Would it then be legitimate and proper for us to act “in  this national interest” ? The Rusks and the Humphreys and the  Citizens Committee say yes. Nothing could show more clearly  how we are taking the road of the fascist aggressors of a gen¬  eration ago.   We are, of course, in a domestic political environment very  different from that of the citizens of Germany or Japan. Here, it  takes no heroism to protest. We have many avenues open to us  ',\n",
       " '  On Resistance    to drive home the lesson that there is not one law for the United  States and one for the rest of mankind, that no one has ap¬  pointed us judge and executioner for Vietnam or anywhere else  Many avenues of political education, on and off the campus,  lave been explored in the past two years. There can be no ques¬  tion that this effort should continue and grow to whatever limit  the degree of commitment permits.   Some seem to feel that resistance will “blacken” the peace  movement and make it difficult to reach potential sympathizers  through more familiar channels. I don’t agree with this objec¬  tion, but I feel that it should not be lightly disregarded. Resis¬  tors who hope to save the people of Vietnam from destruction  must select the issues they confront and the means they employ  m such a way as to attract as much popular support as possible  for their efforts. There is no lack of clear issues and honorable  means, surely, hence no reason why one should be impelled to  ug y actions on ambiguous issues. In particular, it seems to me  that draft resistance, properly conducted (as it has been so  ar , is not only a highly principled and courageous act, but one  that might receive broad support and become politically effec¬  tive. It might, furthermore, succeed in raising the issues of pas¬  sive complicity in the war which are now much too easily  evaded Those who face these issues may even go on to free  themselves from the mind-destroying ideological pressures of  American life, and to ask some serious questions about Amer-  cas role in the world, and the sources, in American society, for  mis criminal behavior.   Moreover, I feel that this objection to resistance is not prop¬  erly formulated. The “peace movement” exists only in the fanta¬  sies of the paranoid right. Those who find some of the means  employed or ends pursued objectionable can oppose the war in  other ways. They will not be read out of a movement that does   ',\n",
       " '  Objectivity and Libera! Scholarship   matter is not so simple. If we listen, we hear such voices as this,  from an economist in India:   It is disingenuous to invoke “democracy/’ “due process of law,”  “non-violence,” to rationalise the absence of action. For mean¬  ingful concepts under such conditions become meaningless since,  in reality, they justify the relentless pervasive exploitation of the  masses; at once a denial of democracy and a more sinister form  of violence perpetrated on the overwhelming majority through  contractual forms. 21   Moderate American scholarship does not seem capable of com¬  prehending these simple truths.   It would be wrong to leave the impression that the ideology  of the liberal intelligentsia translates itself into policy as a rain  of cluster bombs and napalm. In fact, the liberal experts have  been dismayed by the emphasis on military means in Vietnam  and have consistently argued that the key to our efforts should  be social restructuring and economic assistance. Correspond-  ingly, I think that we can perceive more clearly the attitudes  that are crystallizing among the new mandarins by considering  the technical studies of pacification, for example, the research  monograph of William Nighswonger, cited earlier (see note 4).  The author, now a professor of political science, was senior  United States civilian representative of the Agency for Inter-  national Development in Quang Nam Province from 1962 to  1964. As he sees the situation, “the knotty problems of pacifica¬  tion are intricately intertwined with the issues of political de¬  velopment and they necessitate—at this time in history--inti¬  mate American involvement.” Thus Americans must ask some  “basic questions of value and obligation—questions that tran¬  scend the easy legalisms of ‘self-determination’ and ‘noninter¬  vention.’ ” These easy legalisms have little relevance to a world     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   in which the West is challenged by “the sophisticated method¬  ology and quasi-religious motivation of Communist insur¬  gency.” It is our duty, in the interest of democracy and free¬  dom, to apply our expertise to these twin goals: “to isolate the  enemy and destroy his influence and control over the rural pop¬  ulation, and to win the peasant’s willing support through effec¬  tive local administration and programs of rural improvement.”  “An underlying assumption is that insurgency ought to be de¬  feated—for the sake of human rights. . . .” Despite the “re¬  markable achievements in economic and social development in  Russia and China, “The South Vietnamese peasant deserves  something better,” and we must give it to him—as we have m  Latin America and the Philippines-even if this requires aban¬  doning the easy legalisms of the past and intervening with mili¬  tary force.   Of course, it won’t be easy. The enemy has enormous ad¬  vantages. For one thing, “as in China, the insurgents in Vietnam  have exploited the Confucian tenets of ethical rule both by their  attacks on government corruption and by exemplary Com¬  munist behavior”; and “the Viet-Cong inherited, after Geneva,  much of the popular support and sympathies previously at¬  tached to the Viet-Minh in the South.” After the fall of Diem,  matters became still worse: “. . . vast regions that had been  under government control quickly came under the influence of  the Viet-Cong.” By late 1964 the pacification of Quang Nam  Province had become “all but impossible,” and the worst of it is  that “the battle for Quang Nam was lost by the government to  Viet-Cong forces recruited for the most part from within the  province.” 22 By 1966, the Vietcong seem so well entrenched in  rural areas that “only a highly imaginative and comprehensive  counterinsurgency campaign, with nearly perfect execution and  substantial military support, would be capable of dislodging    ',\n",
       " '   - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   not exist; they have only themselves to blame if they do not  msl™ use of the other forms of protest that are available.   I have left to the end the most important question, the one  about which X have least to say. This is the question of the  forms resistance should take. We all take part in the war to a  greater or lesser extent, if only by paying taxes and permitting  domestic society to function smoothly. A person has to choose  for himself the point at which he will simply refuse to take part  any longer. Reaching that point, he will be drawn into resist-  ance. I believe that the reasons for resistance I have already  mentioned are cogent ones: they have an irreducible moral ele¬  ment that admits of little discussion. The issue is posed in 1 s  starkest form for the boy who faces induction, and m a form  that is somewhat more complex for the boy who must decide  whether to participate in a system of selective service that may  pass the burden from him to others less fortunate and less privi¬  leged It is difficult for me to see how anyone can refuse to  engage himself, in some way, in the plight of these young men.  There are many ways to do so: legal aid and financial suppor ,  participation in support demonstrations; draft counseling or¬  ganization of draft-resistance unions or community-based re¬  sistance organizations; assisting those who wish to escape the  country; the steps proposed by the clergymen who recently  announced that they are ready to share the fate of those who  will be sent to prison. About this aspect of the program of  resistance I have nothing to say that will not be obvious to  anyone who is willing to think the matter through.   Considered as a political tactic, resistance requires careful  thought, and I do not pretend to have very clear ideas about it.  Much depends on how events unfold in the coming months.  Westmoreland’s war of attrition may simply continue with no  foreseeable end, but the domestic political situation makes t is    ',\n",
       " '    On Resistance   unlikely. If the Republicans do not decide to throw the election  again, they could have a winning strategy: they can claim that  they will end the war, and remain vague about the means.  Under such circumstances, it is unlikely that Johnson will per¬  mit the present military stalemate to persist. There are, then,  several options. The first is American withdrawal, in whatever  terms it would be couched. It might be disguised as a retreat to  “enclaves,” from which the troops could then be removed, It  might be arranged by an international conference, or by per¬  mitting a government in Saigon that would seek peace among  contending South Vietnamese and then ask us to leave. This  policy might be politically feasible; the same public relations  firm that invented terms like “revolutionary development” can  depict withdrawal as victory. Whether there is anyone in the  executive branch with the courage or imagination to urge this  course, I do not know. A number of senators are proposing, in  essence, that this is the course we should pursue, as are such  critics of the war as Walter Lippmann and Hans Morgenthau,  if I understand them correctly. A detailed and quite sensible  plan for arranging withdrawal along with new, more meaning¬  ful elections in the South is outlined by Philippe Devillers in Le  Monde hebdomadaire of October 26, 1967. Variants can easily  be imagined. What is central is the decision to accept the prin¬  ciple of Geneva that the problems of Vietnam be settled by the  Vietnamese.   A second possibility would be annihilation. No one doubts  that we have the technological capacity for this, and only the  sentimental doubt that we have the moral capacity as well.  Bernard Fall predicted this outcome in an interview shortly  before his death. “The Americans can destroy,” he said, “but  they cannot pacify. They may win the war, but it will be the  victory of the graveyard. Vietnam will be destroyed.”       AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    A third option would be an invasion of North Vietnam. This  would saddle us with two unwinnable guerrilla wars instead of  one, but if the timing is right, it might be used as a device to  rally the citizenry around the flag.   A fourth possibility is an attack on China. We could then  abandon Vietnam and turn to a winnable war directed against  Chinese industrial capacity. Such a move should win the  election. No doubt this prospect also appeals to that insane  rationality called “strategic thinking.” If we intend to keep  armies of occupation or even strong military bases on the Asian  mainland, we would do well to make sure that the Chinese do  not have the means to threaten them. Of course, there is the  danger of a nuclear holocaust, but it is difficult to see why this  should trouble those whom John McDermott calls the “crisis  managers,” the same men who were willing, in 1962, to accept a  high probability of nuclear war to establish the principle that  we, and we alone, have the right to keep missiles on the borders  of a potential enemy.   There are many who regard “negotiations” as a realistic alter¬  native, but I do not understand the logic or even the content of  this proposal. If we stop bombing North Vietnam we might  well enter into negotiations with Hanoi, but there would then  be very little to discuss. As to South Vietnam, the only negotia¬  ble issue is the withdrawal of foreign troops; other matters can  only be settled among whatever Vietnamese groups have sur¬  vived the American onslaught. The call for “negotiations”  seems to me not only empty, but actually a trap for those who  oppose the war. If we do not agree to withdraw our troops, the  negotiations will be deadlocked, the fighting will continue,  American troops will be fired on and killed, the military will  have a persuasive argument to escalate, to save American lives.  In short, the Symington solution: we offer them peace on our  ',\n",
       " '   On Resistance   terms, and if they refuse—the victory of the graveyard.   Of the realistic options, only withdrawal (however dis¬  guised) seems to me at all tolerable, and resistance, as a tactic  of protest, must be designed so as to increase the likelihood that  this option will be selected. Furthermore, the time in which to  take such action may be very short. The logic of resorting to  resistance as a tactic for ending the war is fairly clear. There is  no basis for supposing that those who will make the major  policy decisions are open to reason on the fundamental issues,  m particular the issue of whether we, alone among the nations  of the world, have the authority and the competence to deter¬  mine the social and political institutions of Vietnam. What is  more, there is little likelihood that the electoral process will  bear on the major decisions. As I have pointed out, the issue may  be settled before the next election. Even if it is not, it is hardly  likely that a serious choice will be offered at the polls. And if by  a miracle such a choice is offered, how seriously can we take  the campaign promises of a “peace candidate” after the experi¬  ence of 1964? Given the enormous dangers of escalation and its  hateful character, it makes sense, in such a situation, to search  for ways to raise the domestic cost of American aggression, to  raise it to a point where it cannot be overlooked by those who  have to calculate such costs. One must then consider in what  ways it is possible to pose a serious threat. Many possibilities  come to mind: a general strike, university strikes, attempts to  hamper war production and supply, and so on.   Personally, I feel that disruptive acts of this sort would be  justified were they likely to be effective in averting an imminent  tragedy. I am skeptical, however, about their possible effective¬  ness. At the moment, I cannot imagine a broad base for such  action, in the white community at least, outside the universities.  Forcible repression would not, therefore, prove very difficult      _ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   My guess is that such actions would, furthermore, primarily  involve students and younger faculty from the humanities and  the theological schools, with a scattering of scientists. The pro¬  fessional schools, engineers, specialists in the technology of  manipulation and control (much of the social sciences), would  probably remain relatively uninvolved. Therefore the long-  range threat, such as it is, would be to American humanistic and  scientific culture. I doubt that this would seem important to  those in decision-making positions. Rusk and Rostow and their  accomplices in the academic world seem unaware of the serious  threat that their policies already pose in these spheres. I doubt  that they appreciate the extent, or the importance, of the dissi¬  pation of creative energies and the growing disaffection among  young people who are sickened by the violence and deceit that  they see in the exercise of American power. Further disruption  in these areas might, then, seem to them a negligible cost.   Resistance is in part a moral responsibility, in part a tactic to  affect government policy. In particular, with respect to support  for draft resistance, I feel that it is a moral responsibility that  cannot be shirked. On the other hand, as a tactic, it seems to me  of doubtful effectiveness, as matters now stand. I say this with  diffidence and considerable uncertainty.   Whatever happens in Vietnam, there are bound to be signifi¬  cant domestic repercussions. It is axiomatic that no army ever  loses a war; its brave soldiers and all-knowing generals are  stabbed in the back by treacherous civilians. American with¬  drawal is likely, then, to bring to the surface the worst features  of American culture, and perhaps to lead to a serious internal  repression. On the other hand, an American “victory” might  well have dangerous consequences both at home and abroad. It  might give added prestige to an already far too powerful execu¬  tive. There is, moreover, the problem emphasized by A. J.    ',\n",
       " '   On Resistance   Muste: . . the problem after a war is with the victor. He   thinks he has just proved that war and violence pay. Who will  now teach him a lesson?” For the most powerful and most  aggressive nation in the world, this is indeed a danger. If we  can rid ourselves of the naive belief that we are somehow  different and more pure—a belief held by the British, the  French, the Japanese, in their moments of imperial glory—then  we will be able honestly to face the truth in this observation.  One can only hope that we will face this truth before too many  innocents, on all sides, suffer and die.   Finally, there are certain principles that I think must be  stressed as we try to build effective opposition to this and future  wars. We must not, I believe, thoughtlessly urge others to com¬  mit civil disobedience, and we must be careful not to construct  situations in which young people will find themselves induced,  perhaps in violation of their basic convictions, to commit civil  disobedience. Resistance must be freely undertaken. I also  hope, more sincerely than I know how to say, that it will create  bonds of friendship and mutual trust that will support and  strengthen those who are sure to suffer.      SUPPLEMENT TO “ON  RESISTANCE”    Following the publication of “On Resistance” in the New York  Review,of Books, a number of very interesting letters were  received dealing with several of the questions raised in it. Two  appeared, with accompanying comments of mine, in the issue  of February 1, 1968. The first, from a college professor whom I  will identify here simply as Mr. Y, noted “an undramatic but  steady shift of opinion” among middle-class people, many con¬  servative or apolitical, who “are deciding that the war simply  isn’t worth what it costs.” Mr. Y counsels that these people can  be convinced, not that the war is wrong, but that it is “damned  foolishness,” and he suggests that “the patient effort to win over  those millions who view the war in pragmatic rather than moral  terms may be more significant” than the various forms of resist¬  ance which, while perhaps revealing a “pure conscience,” may  nevertheless “not actually help put an end to war.” The second  letter is from a former member of “The Resistance,” now under¬  ground and obviously unidentified, who signs simply: William     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    X. As he analyzes the situation, “the war will end when the  American middle class wants it to” and “what will cause the  middle class to want an end to the war will be the conjunction  of Vietnamese resistance plus the high cost to the middle class  in effort and money to deal with taxes, inflation, disruption, and  obstruction at home.” It follows, then, “that the most effective  antiwar activities are those which are the most disruptive, the  most costly, those which most undermine the authority of the  government domestically and in its war policy”—ghetto rebel¬  lions (“those elements of the white middle class opposed to the  war must work to protect participants”), demonstrations such  as the ones at the Pentagon and at the New York and Oakland  induction centers, and others that will cause the government’s  authority to be questioned and that will “escalate the cost” to  the government. He therefore opposes the individual act of  “confrontation” and describes the “notion of the alternatives—  the military, prison, or exile” sketched in my article as “too  limited, constrained by lack of experience and by lack of a full  comprehension of what is to be done.” “We have work to do, or  simply lives to live, and don’t intend to make their job easier or  our lives more miserable.” His advice is “to make them pay the  piper, who called the tune. That is what black folks know, who  sing and dance all the time.”   My own remarks, accompanying these letters, were not in¬  tended as an “answer” but simply as a third, somewhat different  reaction to the same questions. I have added a few paragraphs  for publication here.   Mr. Y and William X agree that middle-class attitudes will be  decisive in determining the outcome of the American war in  Vietnam, and that these attitudes will be shaped not by moral  but by “pragmatic” considerations, considerations of cost. Yet      Supplement to “On Resistance”   they arrive at diametrically opposed conclusions regarding the  appropriate choice of tactics: Mr. Y opposes all forms of resist¬  ance and feels that one should try to convince the American  people “that the war is damned foolishness,” and Mr. X con¬  cludes that the “most effective antiwar activities are those which  are the most disruptive.” Viewing the situation from a rather  similar perspective, I nevertheless find myself reaching still  different conclusions. This is hardly astonishing. No one can  evaluate the effectiveness of various tactics with any precision.  Furthermore, no course of action open to us offers much hope  of preventing the Vietnam tragedy from assuming still more  awesome proportions. We are, unfortunately, discussing tactics  of limited effectiveness and partially unpredictable conse¬  quences.   I suspect that Mr. Y and Mr. X exaggerate the political signifi¬  cance of middle-class opinion. Even if 65 percent or 99 percent  of the American people were convinced “that the war is  damned foolishness,” there would remain the problem of trans¬  lating this conviction into politically effective action. It is  doubtful that the political system provides this opportunity in a  realistic way. Those who feel that an American “victory” in  Vietnam would be a political and moral tragedy therefore face  two kinds of tactical problem: first, how to bring “pragmatic  middle-class opinion” to oppose the war; second, how to give  effective political expression to such opposition as exists. I am  not convinced that either correspondent is entirely realistic in  assessing these matters.   Consider first the matter of dissent. There is no need to try to  persuade someone that his taxes are going up, that his neigh¬  bor’s son was killed, and that he doesn’t like it. Rather, I feel,  dissent should be concerned with political and moral issues.  The American government no doubt commands the resources to      ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   end the war through annihilation, and Mr. Y overlooks the fact  that those who feel that the war is “damned foolishness” may  perfectly well accept this way of bringing it to an end. Suppose,  for example, that the military were to decide that the use of  tactical nuclear weapons would provide the cheapest means for  uprooting the NLF political and administrative structure in the  Mekong Delta (with the inevitable solemn statement from  Freedom House applauding this exercise of limited means to  show that violence doesn’t pay). The purpose of dissent is to  mobilize opinion against the use of American force to impose a  political solution in Vietnam—to the hideous extent it is used  today, to the still more barbaric extent of tomorrow, or in fact,  to any extent at all—whatever the costs may be. This is the  crucial problem that dissent must face with respect to Vietnam  as well as all of the other countries where American force is  being used directly, or where American arms and military train¬  ing are contributing to internal repression. Contrary to Mr. Y,  then, I feel that dissent should aim to convince the American  people that the war is wrong, and to explain why this or any  similar use of force is wrong.   Consider next the assumption that opposition to the war will  mount as its costs visibly increase. It follows that we should  attempt to increase these costs. Resistance, properly conducted,  can serve to increase the domestic cost of American aggression  and can therefore help shape the attitudes of the “pragmatic  middle classes” of whom Mr. Y speaks, as it can help shape the  decisions of those who must calculate these costs in setting the  course of American foreign policy. Mr. Y is surely wrong in  supposing that those who undertake resistance do so to preserve  their moral purity. Mr. X’s letter is ample testimony to the fact  that resistance can be, and I feel quite generally is, undertaken  as a political act. One may argue that it is misguided, but not  ',\n",
       " '  Supplement to “On Resistance”    that it is apolitical. Of course, the resister must choose his tac¬  tics so as to maximize the probability that the developing oppo¬  sition will take a civilized form—in the case of Vietnam, with¬  drawal rather than annihilation—and he must accompany his  resistance with the kind of dissent that will seek to raise the  general level of political and moral consciousness. These, it  seems to me, are the conclusions that one should draw from the  analysis of the situation that Mr. Y proposes.   To me it seems that draft resistance meets these conditions,  The principle is clear and unambiguous. An individual’s refusal  to carry out the criminal acts of his government sets the stage, in  the most effective way possible, for the attempt to demonstrate  the criminal nature of these acts. Furthermore, the resistance is  “costly,” both to the government and to the “pragmatic middle  classes.” Let us make the matter concrete. Draft resistance is,  for the moment, strongest among the students at the best uni¬  versities. Last month, for example, 320 law school students apd  several hundred students at Yale signed “We Won’t Go” state¬  ments. The government will soon have to decide whether to  draft graduate students. If the resistance continues to grow, the  decision will be a costly one, no matter how it is made. It is  politically difficult to give students a blanket exemption, for  obvious reasons. On the other hand, an attempt to draft stu¬  dents will, if resistance develops, put the government in the  position of tolerating an open violation of the law or of carrying  out serious punitive acts against the children of the social and  economic elite. One of the costs of the war is the contempt for  the government, for its violence and mendacity, felt by many  young people. Punishment of resisters will deepen this disaffec¬  tion, and may channel it in new directions. Involvement of  adults in support of resisters increases the costs still more. If we  look beyond Vietnam, the costs may be greater still, not only       ★==    AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    because of the unpredictable effects of a really large-scale re¬  pression of those who are expected to run the society in the  coming years, but also because of the “danger” inherent in the  fact that a citizen dares to ask whether he should mechanically  obey, that he raises questions about the range of meaningful  political action.   There are several ways in which one can hope to affect the  decisions made by the government. One way is to try to influ¬  ence the choice that will be offered by the two major political  parties and to exercise this choice on Election Day. Another,  very different approach is to try to modify the objective condi¬  tions that any elected official must consider when he selects a  course of action. I do not want to go into the general question  of the legitimacy of these alternatives, but rather to make two  points. First, those who are committed to the first method will  naturally regard political action of the latter sort—draft resist¬  ance, for example—as a danger, whose cost they must seek to  reduce. Secondly, to be realistic, the parliamentary system at  the moment offers almost no opportunity for meaningful action  on such issues as Vietnam. One cannot be certain, of course.  Nevertheless, we might as well face up to the overwhelming  probability that the choice in November will be between barely  distinguishable policies. Senator McCarthy’s candidacy might  be important as an educational effort (it can hardly be re¬  garded as a political effort) if McCarthy were to raise serious  issues and break free from the narrow limits of what passes for  political discussion in this country today, but as yet he has not  done so. It is a remarkable fact that in this democracy, not a  single public figure, no segment of the mass media, advocates  the position which, according to the recent international Gallup  polls, is that of the overwhelming majority in most of the “free  world”—that the United States should withdraw from Vietnam.   ',\n",
       " '   Supplement to “On Resistance”   The basic issues are not discussed in the mass media and are  not raised in the political arena. These are the realities that we  must face in determining an appropriate mode of political action.   To summarize, draft resistance can make use of the inegali-  tarian nature of American society as a technique for increasing  the cost of American aggression, and it threatens values that are  important to those in a decision-making position. (One who  shares these values must then ask how they benefit our victims,  and what price our victims must pay to secure these values from  any risk.) It is difficult to judge how heavily such costs will  we.gh m the balance, but I think that Mr. Y is not justified in  contending that the goal of resistance can only be to safeguard  one’s purity of conscience.   Of course, resistance might backfire; it might lead the “prag-  matic opposition” to demand a harsh and brutal victory. How¬  ever, the danger seems to me slight. There is no reason why a  principled and obviously courageous and highly moral act  should have this consequence. Rather, I think it is likely to  cause others to consider their own complicity, in their work, in  their payment of war taxes, in their preservation of the domestic  peace that permits the warmakers to operate freely. Further¬  more, it is important to bear in mind that any political act  carries with it a potential danger of this sort. For example, it is  not unlikely that President Johnson would react to a threat at  the polls with a sharp escalation, on the theory (probably cor¬  rect) that this would gain him at least short-term support. I see  no reason to believe that nonviolent resistance is more likely to   have this consequence than electoral politics. Quite the con-  trary.   Although I agree with Mr. X that resistance can be an effec¬  tive political act, I think his analysis errs in three respects First  I think he miscalculates the effect that disruptive actions will’     * AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   have on the middle class that he wants to move to opposition.  Second, I think he is considering the notion of “cost” in too  narrow a sense. And third, I believe that he underestimates the  force the government commands. As to the first matter, he fads  to take into account the strong likelihood that disruptive acts  will increase the urge to win the war by pure terror, with per¬  haps a violent repression at home as well. As far as costs are  concerned, he considers only the matter of “effort and money.”  But these, I suspect, are negligible costs when we consider the  kinds of disruptive acts that might be carried out by the white  middle class, students or adults. The million dollars spent by  the government on October 21 is a trivial sum for the govern¬  ment—but the substantially greater sums expended to mount  the demonstration are not at all trivial, for the “peace move¬  ment.” Hence if the criterion is cost in this sense, the demon¬  stration would have to be regarded as a serious setback. In  general, I think that the important costs that can be increased  by student and middle-class resistance are the more abstract  ones discussed earlier. These cannot be calculated in dollars and  cents, but they are no less real for that.   As to the matter of government force, I think it is surely  ample to control, with ease, any disruptive acts that can now be  foreseen. As Hans Morgenthau observed recently, there has  been a qualitative shift in the balance of force between a gov¬  ernment and a massed populace, and this disparity can only  increase. A report last June by the Institute of Defense Analysis  proposed a great many delightful new ideas for “crowd control\"  (itching powder, “sticky blobs to glue rioters together,” chemi¬  cal agents, “mechanically spread sticky strings, bands, or adhe¬  sives which might slow the movement of the crowd by linking  people together or to themselves,” foam generators which lead  to “psychological distress through loss of contact with the en-  ',\n",
       " '   Supplement to \"On Resistance”    vironment,” tranquilizing darts, etc.—AP report, November 11,  1967), ideas which give an interesting portent of what is to come  and a useful insight into university-sponsored research at its best.  My guess is that talk of disruptive acts is a fantasy.   I have said nothing about ghetto rebellions. These may affect  the war, in one or another way, but they are not acts under¬  taken with the end of bringing about American withdrawal from  Vietnam and must, I think, be considered in a totally different  context.   Although the context today remains quite different, it is still  very much to be hoped that resistance against the Vietnam war  and the deeper imperialist forces of which it is a manifesta¬  tion can contribute to the struggle against domestic oppression.  No doubt one of the pressures on the government to end the war  is the fear that the troops will be needed to occupy American  cities and to enforce the status quo at home. The kind of “lim¬  ited war” mentality that underlies the IDA study just men¬  tioned is revealed even more explicitly by Homer Bigart in the  New York Times , March 22, 1968, in a long report headed:  “Army Helps Police Get ‘Hip’ on Riots.” I quote a few para¬  graphs, to give the flavor:   On a piney knoll some 60 city and state policeman and National  Guard officers gathered yesterday to watch the testing of “non-  lethal agents” that may be used this summer to disperse riotous  mobs in the nation’s cities. . . . Robins sang, coffee and cookies  were served and the post band played “The Stars and Stripes  Forever” as the sixth class of the Civil Disobedience Orientation  Course climbed out of an Army bus to begin a 20-hour course oil  the anatomy of a riot ... [at the] . . . Army’s riot control school,  an institution hurriedly conceived a few months ago to teach the  grim lessons derived from the Detroit and Newark riots. ...   The report goes on to describe the new, “more devastating”  types of tear gas now available, and the ways in which grenades    ^__ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   and helicopters can be used to control “the mobs.” An accom¬  panying picture shows a “simulated battle between militant  civil rights demonstrators and the National Guardsmen. The  demonstrators hold a sign saying “We Shall Overcome” and the  heavily armed soldiers, with gas masks and fixed bayonets,  demonstrate how this slogan can be refuted. The description  continues as follows:   The clash is staged in a Hollywood type mockup of a community  called RiotsviUe. . . . “Baby,” a firebrand militant . . . , harangues  a crowd, charging policy brutality. The crowd waves signs de¬  nouncing war. One sign reads “We Shall Overcome.” Bricks and  rocks ... are thrown at the “Mayor” when he tries to placate the  mob.   But here comes the National Guard. Using tear gas, bayonets,  an armored personnel carrier, and classic antiriot tactics, the  troops prevail. “Baby” is seized and taken off in the armored car,  a prisoner.   Presumably the audience breathes a sigh of relief, sipping their  coffee and munching on cookies to the strains of “The Stars and  Stripes Forever” as the scene fades, secure in the knowledge  that those who denounce war and poverty and racism shall not  prevail—all of this certainly a reasonable forecast of what the  future may hold.   I do agree with Mr. X in his criticism of the tactic of escalat¬  ing confrontation that was proposed, at one time, by the loosely  organized group called “The Resistance.” Confrontations will  come quickly enough. The real task, for the present, is to organ¬  ize as large as possible a base of support for resistance—a pro¬  liferation of local resistance support groups linked together in a  national network, with participation of white and black resis¬  ters, with adult middle-class support on and off campus, sub¬  stantial financial assistance, and personal involvement by peo¬  ple who feel that resistance can be made politically effective,    ',\n",
       " '   Supplement to “On Resistance”   who feel that they have a moral responsibility to give concrete  assistance to those who refuse to serve in Vietnam, who wish to  increase the political cost of repression by standing alongside  the young men who will inevitably suffer most severely. Think¬  ing in still more long-range terms, it may be that the most  significant steps towards a reform of American society will  prove to be the efforts of the very courageous and unsung few  who are devoting themselves to community organizing, often  using the draft and its inequities as a point of entry into com¬  munities that provide the mass base for American repression,  and seeking to create both consciousness and organizational  structure for resistance on the part of those who bear the heavi¬  est burdens but who are, for the present, passive victims of an  unchallenged coercive ideology. The national RESIST organi¬  zation is attempting to provide the framework for a range of  such activities, using as a basis the Call To Resist Illegitimate  Authority (most of which appeared as an advertisement in the  New York Review of Books on October 12, 1967). With all of  the necessary qualifications, I feel that involvement in this effort  is the most effective form of political action against this and  future wars that is now open to a concerned citizen.   Those of us who are not under direct attack and who are rela¬  tively free to choose a course of action have a responsibility to  the victims of American power that we must face with unwaver¬  ing seriousness. In considering some tactic of protest or resist¬  ance, we must ask what its consequences are likely to be for the  people of Vietnam or of Guatemala or of Harlem, and what effect  it will have on the building of a movement against war and op¬  pression, a movement that will help to create a society in which  one can live without fear and without shame. We have to search  for ways to persuade vast numbers of Americans to commit them¬  selves to this task, and we must devise ways to convert this       AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    commitment into effective action. The goal may seem so remote  as to be a fantasy, but for those who are serious, this is the only  strategy that can be considered. Persuasion may involve deeds as  well as words; it may involve the construction of institutions  and social forms, even if only in microcosm, that overcome the  competitiveness and the single-minded pursuit of self-interest  that proves a mechanism of social control as effective as that of  a totalitarian state. But the goal must be to design and construct  alternatives to the present ideology and social institutions that  are more compelling on intellectual and moral grounds, and that  can draw to them masses of Americans who find that these al¬  ternatives satisfy their human needs—including the human need  to show compassion, to encourage and to assist those who seek to  raise themselves from the misery and degradation that our so¬  ciety has helped to impose and now seeks to perpetuate.   It would be criminal folly to fail to act when there are oppor¬  tunities to move towards these goals, or to act in such a way as  to make them still more distant than they are today. It is not  easy to find a way to steer between these dangers. There is no  doubt that in the recent past, the error has consistently been on  the side of caution and restraint, fear and moral blindness. But  one must bear in mind, as tensions mount, that the opposite error  is no less serious. It is quite easy to design tactics that will help  to consolidate the latent forces of a potential American fascism.  To mention just one obvious example, verbal and physical abuse  of the police, however great the provocation, can have only this  effect. Such tactics may seem “radical” and, in a narrow sense,  justified by the magnitude of the infamy and evil that they seek  to overcome. They are not.   In fact, it is senseless to speak—as many now do—of tactics  and actions as being “radical,” “liberal,” “conservative,” or “re¬  actionary.” In itself, an action cannot be placed on a political  ',\n",
       " '  Supplement to \"On Resistance”   dimension at all. It may be successful or unsuccessful in achiev¬  ing an end that can be described in political terms. But it is use¬  ful to remember that the same tactics that one man may propose  with high conscience and deep commitment to radical social  change may also be pressed by a well-placed police spy, bent on  destroying such a movement and increasing popular support for  the forces of repression. Consider the Reichstag fire, to return to  a day that is less remote than one would wish. Or consider the act  of a seventeen-year-old Jewish refugee from Poland just thirty  years ago—of Herschel Grynszpan, who assassinated a German  official in Paris in November 1938. It is difficult to condemn this  desperate act, which set off violent pogroms throughout Germany  and helped entrench more deeply the Nazi regime of terror; but  the victims of Nazi terror would offer no thanks to Herschel  Grynszpan. We must not abandon the victims of American power,  or play games with their fate. We must not consent to have the  same repression imposed on still further helpless victims or the  same blind fury unleashed against them. Acts that seem perfectly  justified in themselves when regarded in a narrow sense may be  very wrong when considered in the light of their probable conse¬  quences. And a failure to approach those who can be reached, a  failure to act with strength and determination when one can do  so in a constructive way, is no less thoughtless and indefensible.  These are very general remarks, and not very helpful, perhaps,  when we face the concrete question of what we can do right now.  Still, I think that such guidelines as these must form the frame¬  work for these decisions.   One final remark. The Vietnam war is the most obscene ex¬  ample of a frightening phenomenon of contemporary history—  the attempt by our country to impose its particular concept of  order and stability throughout much of the world. By any ob¬  jective standard, the United States has become the most aggres-   ',\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   sitch a powerful and extensive insurgent apparatus.”   A major difficulty we face is the “progressive social and  economic results” shown by the Vietcong efforts. An AID report  in March 1965 explains the problem. Comparing “our £ new life  hamlets’ ” to the Vietcong hamlets, the report comments as fol¬  lows :   The basic differences are that the VC hamlets are well organized,  clean, economically self supporting and have an active defense  system. For example, a cottage industry in one hamlet was as  large as has been previously witnessed anywhere in Chuong Thien  province. New canals are being dug and pineapples are under  cultivation. The VC also have a relocation program for younger  families. These areas coincide with the areas just outside the planned  GVN sphere of interest. Unless the USOM/GVN activities exhibit a  more qualitative basis [sic], there is little likelihood of changing the  present attitudes of the people. For example, in one area only five  kilometers from the province capital, the people refused medical  assistance offered by ARVN medics.   However, all is not lost. Even though “the Viet-Cong strength  in the countryside has made a Quantum leap’ from its position  of early 1962,” there is a compensating factor, namely, “the  counterinsurgent military capability was revolutionized by sub¬  stantial American troop inputs.” This allows us entirely new  options. For example, we can implement more effectively some  of the “experiments with population and resources control  methods” that were tried by the USOM and the National Police  as early as 1961, though with little success. Given the new possi¬  bilities for “material and human resources control,” we may  even recapture some of the population—a serious matter;  Given the enormous numbers of South Vietnamese citizens  presently allied with the Viet-Cong (for whatever reason), the  recovery of these peasants for the national cause must be made  one of the central tasks of the pacification enterprise.”     * American power and the new mandarins   If we are going to succeed in implementing “material and  human resources control,” we must moderate ARVN behavior  somehow. Thus, according to an AID report of February 1965,  “A high incident rate of stealing, robbing, raping and obtain¬  ing free meals in the rural areas has not endeared the popula¬  tion towards ARVN or Regional Forces.” Nor did it improve  matters when many civilians witnessed a case in which an  ARVN company leader killed a draft dodger, disemboweled him,  “took his heart and liver out and had them cooked at a restau¬  rant,” after which “the heart and liver were eaten by a number  of soldiers.” Such acts cause great difficulties, especially in try¬  ing to combat an enemy so vile as to practice “exemplary  Communist behavior.”   More generally, “the success of pacification requires that  there be survivors to be pacified,” and given “the sheer magni¬  tude of American, Korean, Australian and indigenous Viet¬  namese forces,” which has so severely “strained the economic and  social equilibrium of the nation,” it is sometimes difficult to  ensure this minimal condition.   There are other problems, for example, “the difficulty of  denying food to the enemy” in the Mekong Delta; “the hunger  for land ownership,” which, for some curious reason, is never  satisfied by our friends in Saigon; the corruption; occasional  bombing of the “wrong” village; the pervasive “Viet-Cong in¬  filtration of military and civilian government organization”; the  fact that when we relocate peasants to new hamlets, we often  leave “the fox still in the henhouse,” because of inadequate  police methods; and so on.   Still, we have a good “pacification theory,” which involves  three steps: “elimination of the Viet-Cong by search-and-de-  stroy operations, protection and control of the population and  its resources by police and military forces, and preparing and  ',\n",

At the  same time, we enjoy a high degree of internal freedom. We can  speak and write and organize. Resisters may be punished se¬  verely, but they will not be sent to slave-labor camps or gas  chambers. Given these facts, resistance is feasible even for those  who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe,  for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of  the attempt to impose American hegemony. Resistance cannot  now significantly deplete the manpower pool that makes possi¬  ble the use of American power for global repression, nor can it,  at the moment, significantly impede the research, production,  and supply on which this exercise of power rests. But it can  contribute significantly towards raising the domestic costs of  this attempt and eliminating the apathy and passivity that may  permit it to succeed. It therefore has a potential significance  that extends far beyond Vietnam. It may help to save other  small countries from the fate of Vietnam, and indeed, to save  the world from indescribable catastrophe.    ',\n",
       " \"  EPILOGUE    As the great peasant revolutions raged in China more than a  century ago, Karl Marx wrote in the New York Tribune about    civilwUrid^r 656 reV ° IUti0n SeemS likdy t0 “ ercise on the   assertion th ,'v, ^ S6em * strange “ d a very paradoxical   asserfon that the next uprising of the people of Europe, and their   next movement for republican freedom and economy of govern-   Emni’r^ir, CPead m ° re ° n What ‘ S n0W passin * in the Celestial  Empire the very opposite of Europe-than on any other politi-   cal cause that now exists-Now, England having brought   about the revolution in China, the question is how that revolutfon   roji m IeaCt ° n Eogland - and throu S h England on Eu-    A few years later he discussed the “curious spectacle” of “China  sending disorder into the Western world while the Western  Powers, by English, French, and American war steamers, are   convey,ng ‘order’ to Shanghai, Nanking, and the mouths of the  Great Canal.”   As in other respects, the timetable that Marx envisioned was    \",\n",
       " '   AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   in error, and the cast of characters has now somewhat changed.  Furthermore, what Marx had in mind was the possibility that  an economic crisis might be caused in the West by a successfu  revolution in China, endangering the China trade, the impor¬  tance of which, in the fashion of most writers on this matter  until fairly recently, he tended to exaggerate. Still, it is well to  consider today the remarkable spectacle of the disorder created in  the Western world as the attempt to convey order to Asian  countries-the very opposite of the West-is proving to be be¬  yond the power of Western imperialism. In part, the disorder is  rooted in revulsion, and to this extent is a tribute to a strain of  decency in Western culture, difficult as it is to pronounce these  words amidst the barbarism of the Vietnam war. The disorder  spreading through the Western world is not solely or even pri¬  marily a reaction to the frustration of Western power in Asia  but there is no doubt that the massive convulsions m Asia, an  the heroic Vietnamese resistance to American power, have  served as a catalytic agent, releasing forces that might have  remained latent. In itself, this disorder is neither good nor bad,  a cause neither for hope nor for despair. It remains to be seen  whether this disorder can be converted into a force that will  revitalize American society, or whether it will settle into dea -  ening repression, or will simply subside, to little effect.   It should be clear to a rational man that the chances for  survival, let alone a decent existence, are rather slight if Ameri¬  can power continues to be used with such abandon as in the  past few years, or even flaunted so freely. The capacity of the  national state for violence and coercion, the threat that it poses  to the survival of its citizens, are so extreme that other problems  seem to fade in comparison. But this violence cannot be met and  overcome without regard for its social roots. Just prior to the  Second World War, America was in the depths of depression,    ',\n",
       " '   Epilogue    with nine million unemployed. It is difficult to fault this evalua¬  tion of the social and economic policies of the 1930s: “The New  Deal failed to solve the problem of depression, it failed to raise  the impoverished, it failed to redistribute income, it failed to  extend equality and generally countenanced racial discrimination  and segregation. It failed generally to make business more re¬  sponsible to the social welfare or to threaten business’ pre¬  eminent political power” (Barton J. Bernstein, “The New Deal:  The Conservative Achievements of Liberal Reform,” in B. J.  Bernstein, ed., Towards a New Past [New York, Pantheon  Books, 1968]). Since the national mobilization of World War II,  we have spent over a trillion dollars on “defense.” It hardly is  necessary to resort to the “new economics” to show that such  measures can reduce unemployment and keep the economy func¬  tioning, as it requires little political insight to see why the govern¬  ment is likely to expend the resources it commands on research  and development that yield no immediate profit, on missiles and  “fast-deployment logistic ships” rather than on a mass transpor¬  tation system that will conflict with the needs of the oil com¬  panies and automotive industry, on nerve gas and manned  orbital laboratories rather than on farming the oceans (while  wealthy farmers and farm industries are subsidized to cut back  agricultural production). It is reasonably clear that unless the  commercial and industrial system comes under some sort of  popular democratic control, political democracy will be a sham  and state power will continue to serve inhuman ends. It is  easy to say that new thinking and social experimentation are  needed to free us from the paralysis and fears that narrow our  vision and direct national energies to destruction and waste,  that it is necessary to develop social and political consciousness  through participation and popular control in decision making.   It is also correct. There now exist opportunities for change that   ',\n",

What is  needed, clearly, is better training for American officials, and of  course, true national dedication to this humanitarian task.   A grave defect in our society, this political scientist argues, is  our tendency to avoid “an active American role in the fostering  of democratic institutions abroad.” The pacification program in  Vietnam represents an attempt to meet our responsibility to  foster democratic institutions abroad, through rational methods  of material and human resources control. Refusal to dedicate  ourselves to this task might be described as “a policy more  selfish and timid than it was broad and enlightened,” 23 to use  the terminology of an earlier day.   When we strip away the terminology of the behavioral sci¬  ences, we see revealed, in such work as this, the mentality of  the colonial civil servant, persuaded of the benevolence of the  mother country and the correctness of its vision of world order,  and convinced that he understands the true interests of the  backward peoples whose welfare he is to administer. In fact,  much of the scholarly work on Southeast Asian affairs reflects  precisely this mentality. As an example, consider the August  1967 issue of Asian Survey, fully devoted to a Vietnam  symposium in which a number of experts contribute their  thoughts on the success of our enterprise and how it can be  moved forward.     *- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   The introductory essay by Samuel Huntington, chairman of  the department of government at Harvard, is entitled “Social  Science and Vietnam.” It emphasizes the need “to develop  scholarly study and understanding of Vietnam” if our “involve¬  ment” is to succeed, and expresses his judgment that the papers  in this volume “demonstrate that issues and topics closely con¬  nected to policy can be presented and analyzed in scholarly and  objective fashion.”   Huntington’s own contribution to “scholarly study and under¬  standing of Vietnam” includes an article in the Boston Globe,  February 17, 1968. Here he describes the “momentous changes  in Vietnamese society during the past five years,” specifically,  the process of urbanization. This process “struck directly at the  strength and potential appeal of the Viet Cong.” “So long as the  overwhelming mass of the people lived in the countryside, the  VC could win the war by winning control of those people—and  they came very close to doing so in both 1961 and 1964. But the  American sponsored urban revolution undercut the VC rural  revolution.” The refugees fleeing from the rural areas found not  only security but also “prosperity and economic well-being.”  “While wartime urban prosperity hurt some, the mass of the  poor people benefited from it.”   The sources of urbanization have been described clearly  many times, for example, by this American spokesman in Viet¬  nam: “There have been three choices open to the peasantry.  One, to stay where they are; two, to move into the areas con¬  trolled by us; three, to move off into the interior towards the  Vietcong. . . . Our operations have been designed to make the  first choice impossible, the second attractive, and to reduce the  likelihood of anyone choosing the third to zero .” 24 The benefits  accruing to the newly urbanized elements have also been amply  described in the press, for example, by James Doyle of the     Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   Globe , February 22, 1968: Saigon “is a rich city, the bar own¬  ers, B-girls, money changers and black marketeers all making  their fortunes while it lasts. It is a poor city, with hundreds of  thousands of refugees crammed into thatched huts and tin-  roofed shacks, more than two million people shoehorned into 21_  square miles.” Or Neil Sheehan, in a classic and often-quoted  article (New York Times, October 9, 1966):   A drive through Saigon demonstrates another fashion in which &  the social system works. Virtually all the new construction con- s  sists of luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings financed by .   Chinese businessmen or affluent Vietnamese with relatives or.^   connections within the regime. The buildings are destined to be  rented to Americans. Saigon’s workers live, as they always have,  in fetid slums on the city’s outskirts. . . . Bars and bordellos,  thousands of young Vietnamese women degrading themselves as  bar girls and prostitutes, gangs of hoodlums and beggars and  children selling their older sisters and picking pockets have be¬  come ubiquitous features of urban life.   Many have remarked on the striking difference between the  way in which the press and the visiting scholar describe what  they see in Vietnam. It should occasion no surprise. Each is  pursuing his own craft. The reporter’s job is to describe what he  sees before his eyes; many have done so with courage and even  brilliance. The colonial administrator, on the other hand, is con¬  cerned to justify what he has done and what he hopes to do,  and—if an “expert” as well—to construct an appropriate ideo¬  logical cover, to show that we are just and righteous in what we  do, and to put nagging doubts to rest. One sees moral degrada¬  tion and fetid slums; the other, prosperity and well-being—and  if kindly old Uncle Sam occasionally flicks his ashes on someone  by mistake, that is surely no reason for tantrums.   Returning to the collection of scholarly and objective studies  in Asian Survey, the first, by Kenneth Young, president of the        ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Asia Society, describes our difficulties in “transferring innova¬  tions and institutions to the Vietnamese” and calls for the assist¬  ance of social scientists in overcoming these difficulties. Social  scientists should, he feels, study “the intricacies that effectively  inhibit or transfer what the Americans, either by government  policy or by the technician’s action, want to introduce into the  mind of a Vietnamese or into a Vietnamese organization.” The  problem, in short, is one of communication. For this objective  scholar, there is no question of our right to “transfer innovations  and institutions to the Vietnamese,” by force if necessary, or of  our superior insight into the needed innovations or appropriate  institutions. In just the same way, Lord Cornwallis understood  the necessity of “transferring the institution” of a squirearchy to  India as any reasonable person could see, this was the only  civilized form of social organization.   The “scholarly objectivity” that Huntington lauds is further  demonstrated in the contribution by Milton Sacks, entitled  “Restructuring Government in South Vietnam.” As Sacks per¬  ceives the situation, there are two forces in South Vietnam, the  “nationalists” and the “Communists.” The “Communists” are the  Vietminh and the NLF; among the “nationalists,” he mentions  specifically the VNQDD and the Dai Viet (and the military).  The “nationalists” have a few problems; for example, they  “were manipulated by the French, by the Japanese, by the com¬  munists and latterly by the Americans,” and “too many of South  Vietnam’s leading generals fought with the French against the  Vietnamese people.” 23 Our problem is the weakness of the na¬  tionalists, although there was some hope during General  Khanh’s government, “a most interesting effort because it was a  genuine coalition of representatives of all the major political  groups in South Vietnam.” Curiously, this highly representative  government was unable to accept or even to consider “a pro-      Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   posal for what appeared to be an authentic coalition govern¬  ment” coming from the National Liberation Front in mid-  I964. 26 According to Douglas Pike, the proposal could not be  seriously considered because none of the “non-Communists’ in  South Vietnam, “with the possible exception of the Buddhists,  thought themselves equal in size and power to risk entering into  a coalition, fearing that if they did the whale would swallow the  minnow.” Thus, he continues, “coalition government with a  strong NLF could not be sold within South Vietnam,” even to  the government which, as Sacks informs us, was ‘a genuine  coalition” of “all the major political groups in South Vietnam,”  Rather, the GVN and its successors continued to insist that the  NLF show their sincerity by withdrawing “their armed units  and their political cadres from South Vietnamese territory”  (March 1, 1965).   According to Sacks, “the problem which presents itself is to  devise an institutional arrangement that will tend to counteract  the factors and forces which are conducive to that instability  that now plagues Vietnamese political life. This problem, of  course, is one that presents itself to us. And, Sacks feels, it is  well on its way to solution, with the new constitution and the  forthcoming (September 1967) elections, which “will provide  spokesmen who claim legitimacy through popular mandate and  speak with authority on the issues of war and peace for their  constituency.” Although this “free election . . . will still leave  unrepresented those who are fighting under the banner of the  South Vietnam National Liberation Front and those whose  candidates were not permitted to stand in the elections, we  must, after all, understand that no institution in the real world  can be perfect. The important thing, according to Sacks, is that  for the first time since the fall of Diem, there will be elections  that are not seen by the government in power simply “as a      *- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   means of legitimating the power they already had, using the  governmental machinery to underwrite themselves.” Putting  aside the remarkable naivete regarding the forthcoming elec-  tions, what is striking is the implicit assumption that we have a  right to continue our efforts to restructure the South Vietnamese  government, in the interests of what we determine to be Viet¬  namese nationalism. In just the same way, the officers of the  Kwantung Army sought to support \"genuine Manchurian na¬  tionalism,” thirty-five years ago.   To understand more fully what is implied by the judgment  that we must defend the “nationalists” against the “Commu¬  nists,” we can turn again to Pike’s interesting study. The nation¬  alist groups mentioned by Sacks are the VNQDD and the Dai  Viet. The former, after its virtual destruction by the French,  was revived by the Chinese Nationalists in 1942. “It supported  itself through banditry. It executed traitors with a great deal of  publicity, and its violent acts in general were carefully con¬  ceived for their psychological value.” Returning to Vietnam  “with the occupying Chinese forces following World War II,” it  “was of some importance until mid-1946, when it was purged  by the Vietminh.” “The VNQDD never was a mass political  party in the Western sense. At its peak of influence it num¬  bered, by estimates of its own leaders, less than 1,500 persons.  Nor was it ever particularly strong in either Central or South  Vietnam. It had no formal structure and held no conventions or  assemblies.” As to the Dai Viet, “Dai Viet membership included  leading Vietnamese figures and governmental officials who  viewed Japan as a suitable model for Vietnam [N. B. fascist  Japan]. The organization never made any particular obeisance  either to democracy or to the rank-and-file Vietnamese. It prob¬  ably never numbered more than 1,000 members and did not  consider itself a mass-based organization. It turned away from   ',\n",

       " '  Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   Western liberalism, although its economic orientation was basi¬  cally socialist, in favor of authoritarianism and blind obedi¬  ence.During World War II, “it was at all times strongly pro-  Japanese.”   In contrast to these genuine nationalists, we have the Viet-  minh, whose “war was anticolonial, clearly nationalistic/ and  concerned all Vietnamese,” and the NLF, which regarded the  rural Vietnamese not “simply as a pawn in a power struggle but  as the active element in the thrust,” which “maintained that its  contest with the GVN and the United States should be fought  out at a political level and that the use of massed military might  was in itself illegitimate,” until forced by the Americans and the  GVN “to use counterforce to survive.” In its internal documents  as well as its public pronouncements the NLF insisted, from its  earliest days, that its goal must be to “set up a democratic  national coalition administration in South Vietnam; realize in¬  dependence, democratic freedoms, and improvement of the  people’s living conditions; safeguard peace; and achieve na¬  tional reunification on the basis of independence and democ¬  racy. “Aside from the NLF there has never been a truly mass-  based political party in South Vietnam.” It organized “the rural  population through the instrument of self-control—victory by  means of the organizational weapon,” setting up a variety of  self-help “functional liberation associations” based on “associa-  tional discipline” coupled with “the right of freedom of discus¬  sion and. secret vote at association meetings,” and generating  “a sense of community, first, by developing a pattern of political  thought and behavior appropriate to the social problems of the  rural Vietnamese village in the midst of sharp social change  and, second, by providing a basis for group action that allowed  the individual villager to see that his own efforts could have  meaning and effect” (obviously, a skilled and treacherous      ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   enemy). This was, of course, prior to “the advent of massive  American aid, and the GVN’s strategic hamlet program.” With  the American takeover of the war, the emphasis shifted to mili¬  tary rather than political action, and ultimately, North Viet¬  namese involvement and perhaps control; “beginning in 1965,  large numbers of regular army troops from North Vietnam were  sent into South Vietnam.”   In short, what we see is a contrast between the Dai Viet and  VNQDD, representing South Vietnamese nationalism, and the  NLF, an extrinsic alien force. One must bear in mind that Sacks  would undoubtedly accept Pike’s factual description as ac¬  curate, but, like Pike, would regard it as demonstrating nothing,  since we are the ultimate arbiters of what counts as “genuine  Vietnamese nationalism.”   An interesting counterpoint to Sacks’s exposition of national¬  ist versus Communist forces is provided in David Wurfel’s care¬  ful analysis, in the same issue of Asian Survey , of the “Saigon  political elite.” He argues that “this elite has not substantially  changed its character in the last few years” (i.e., since 1962),  though there may be a few modifications: “Formerly, only  among the great landlords were there those who held significant  amounts of both political and economic power; grandiose cor¬  ruption may have allowed others to attain that distinction in  recent years.” Continuing, “the military men in post-Diem cabi¬  nets all served under Bao Dai and the French in a civil or  military capacity.” Under the French, “those who felt most  comfortable about entering the civil service were those whose  families were already part of the bureaucratic-intellectual elite.  By the early 1950’s they saw radicalism, in the form of the Viet  Minh, as a threat to their own position. The present political  elite is the legacy of these developments ” Although, he ob¬  serves, things might change, “the South Vietnamese cabinets  4S     Objectivity an$ Liberal Scholarship   and perhaps most of the rest of the political elite have been  constituted by a highly westernized intelligentsia. Though the  people of South Vietnam seem to be in a revolutionary mood,  this elite is hardly revolutionary.” The NLF constitutes a  “counter-elite,” less Westernized: of the NLF Central Commit¬  tee members, “only 3 out of 27 report studying in France.”   The problem of “restructuring government” is further ana¬  lyzed by Ithiel Pool, along lines that parallel Sacks’s contribu¬  tion to this collection of “scholarly, objective studies.” He begins  by formulating a general proposition: “I rule out of considera¬  tion here a large range of viable political settlements,” namely,  those that involve “the inclusion of the Viet Cong in a coalition  government or even the persistence of the Viet Cong as a legal  organization in South Vietnam.” Such arrangements “are not  acceptable”—to us, that is. The only acceptable settlement is  one “imposed by the GVN despite the persisting great political  power of the Viet Cong.”   There is, of course, a certain difficulty: “. . . the Viet Cong is  too strong to be simply beaten or suppressed.” It follows, then,  that we must provide inducements to the Vietcong activists to  join our enterprise. This should not prove too difficult, he feels.  The Vietcong leadership consists basically of bureaucratic types  who are on the make. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that  this “discontented leadership” has “the potential for making a  total break when the going gets too rough.” We must therefore  provide them with “a political rationalization for changing  sides.” The problem is ideological. We must induce a change in  the “image of reality” of the Vietcong cadres, replacing their  “naive ideology,” which sees the GVN as “American puppets  and supporters of exploiters, the tax collectors, the merchants,  the big landlords, the police, and the evil men in the villages,”  by a more realistic conception. We can do this by emphasizing     ★== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   hamlet home rule and preventing the use of military forces to  collect rents, a suggestion which will be greeted with enthusi¬  asm in Saigon, no doubt. The opportunity to serve as function¬  aries for a central government which purshes such policies will  attract the Vietcong cadres and thus solve our problem, that of  excluding from the political process the organization that con¬  tains the effective political leaders.   Others have expressed a rather different evaluation of the  human quality and motivation of these cadres. For example,  Joseph Buttinger contrasts the inability of the Diem regime to  mobilize support with the success of the NLF: “. . . that people  willing to serve their country were to be found in Vietnam no  one could doubt. The Vietminh had been able to enlist them by  the tens of thousands and to extract from them superhuman  efforts and sacrifices in the struggle for independence.” 27 Mili¬  tary reports by the dozens relate the amazing heroism and  dedication of the guerrillas. Throughout history, however, colo¬  nial administrators have had their difficulties in comprehending  or coming to grips with this phenomenon.   In the course of his analysis of our dilemma in Vietnam, Pool  explains some of the aspects of our culture that make it difficult  for us to understand such matters clearly. We live in “a guilt  culture in which there is a tradition of belief in equality.” For  such reasons, we find it hard to understand the true nature of  Vietcong land redistribution, which is primarily “a patronage  operation” in which “dissatisfied peasants band together in a  gang to despoil their neighbors” and “then reward the deserving  members of the cabal.”   This terminology recalls Franz Borkenau’s description of the  “streak of moral indifference” in the history of Russian revolu¬  tionism, which permitted such atrocities as the willingness “to  ‘expropriate/ by means of robbery, the individual property of   ',\n",
       " '   Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   individual bourgeois.” 28 Our side, in contrast, adheres to the  “tradition of belief in equality” when we implement land re¬  form. For example, the New York Times , December 26, 1967,  reports a recent conference of experts studying the “Taiwan  success in land reform,” one of the real success stories of Ameri¬  can intervention. “The Government reimbursed the former  landlords in part (30 per cent) with shares of four large public  enterprises taken over from the Japanese. The remainder was  paid in bonds. . . . Many speakers at the conference singled out  the repayment as the shrewdest feature of the Taiwan program.  It not only treated the landlords fairly, they said, but it also  redirected the landlords’ energies and capital towards industry,”  thus advancing the “wholesale restructuring of society” in the  only healthy and humane direction.   In a side remark, Pool states that “in lay public debates now  going on one often hears comments to the effect that Viet¬  namese communism, because it is anti-Chinese, would be like  Yugoslav communism.” It would, of course, be ridiculous to  argue such a causal connection, and, in fact, I have never heard  it proposed in “lay public debate” or anywhere else. Rather,  what has been maintained by such laymen as Hans Morgen-  thau, General James Gavin, and others is that Vietnamese  Communism is likely to be Titoist, in the sense that it will strive  for independence from Chinese domination. Thus they reject  the claim that by attacking Vietnamese Communism we are  somehow “containing Chinese Communism”—a claim implied,  for example/in the statement of the “Citizens Committee for  Peace with Freedom in Vietnam,” in which Ithiel Pool, Milton  Sacks, and others, speaking for “the understanding, independ¬  ent and responsible men and women who have consistently  opposed rewarding international aggressors from Adolf Hitler  to Mao Tse-tung,” warn that if we “abandon Vietnam,” then        . AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   “Peking and Hanoi, flushed with success, [will] continue their  expansionist policy through many other ‘wars of liberation.’ ” By  misstating the reference to Titoist tendencies, Pool avoids the  difficulty of explaining how an anti-Chinese North Vietnam is  serving as the agent of Hitlerian aggression from Peking; by  referring to “lay public debate,” he hopes, I presume, to dis¬  guise the failure of argument by a claim to expertise.   Returning again to the Asian Survey Vietnam symposium, the  most significant contribution is surely Edward Mitchell’s discus¬  sion of his RAND Corporation study on “the significance of  land tenure in the Vietnamese insurgency.” In a study of twenty-  six provinces, Mitchell has discovered a significant correlation  between “inequality of land tenure” and “extent of Government  [read: American] control.” In brief, “greater inequality  implies greater control.” “Provinces seem to be more secure  when the percentage of owner-operated land is low (tenancy  is high); inequality in the distribution of farms by size is  great; large, formerly French-owned estates are present;  and no land redistribution has taken place.” To explain  this phenomenon, Mitchell turns to history and behavioral  psychology. As he notes, “in a number of historical cases  it has been the better-to-do peasant who has revolted,  while his poorer brothers actively supported or passively ac¬  cepted the existing order.” The “behavioral explanation” lies “in  the relative docility of poorer peasants and the firm authority of  landlords in the more ‘feudal’ areas . . . the landlord can exer¬  cise considerable influence over his tenant’s behavior and read¬  ily discourage conduct inconsistent with his own interests.”   In an interview with the New York Times (October 15, 1967),  Mitchell adds an additional explanation for the fact that the  most secure areas are those that remain “essentially feudal in  social structure”: when the feudal structure is eliminated,    ',\n",

Going a step beyond, notice how perverse is the entire dis¬  cussion of the “conceptual framework” for counterinsurgency.  The idea that we must choose between the method of “winning  hearts and minds” and the method of shaping behavior pret  sumes that we have the right to choose at all. This is to grant us  a right that we would surely accord to no other world power.  Yet the overwhelming body of American scholarship accords us  this right. For example, William Henderson, formerly associate  executive director and Far Eastern specialist for the Council on  Foreign Relations, proposes that we must “prosecute a construc¬  tive, manipulative diplomacy” in order to deal with “internal  subversion, particularly in the form of Communist-instigated  guerrilla warfare or insurgency”—“internal aggression,” as he  calls it, in accordance with contemporary usage. 89 Our “historic  tasks,” he proclaims, are “nothing less than to assist purpose¬  fully and constructively in the processes of modern nation  building in Southeast Asia, to deflect the course of a funda¬  mental revolution into channels compatible with the long range  interests of the United States.” It is understood that true “nation  building ’ is that path of development compatible with our in¬  terests; hence there is no difficulty in pursuing these historic  tasks m concert. There are, however, two real stumbling-blocks  m the way of the required manipulative diplomacy. The first is  “a great psychological barrier.” We must learn to abandon “old  dogma” and pursue a “new diplomacy” that is “frankly inter-    ',\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " \"   ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   ventionistrecognizing “that it goes counter to all the tradi¬  tional conventions of diplomatic usage.” Some may ask whether  “we have the moral right to interfere in the properly autono¬  mous affairs of others/’ but Henderson feels that the Com¬  munist threat fully justifies such interference and urges that we  be ready to “use our 'special forces’ when the next bell rings,”  with no moral qualms or hesitation. The second barrier is that  “our knowledge is pitifully inadequate.” He therefore calls on  the academic community, which will be only too willing to  oblige, to supply “the body of expertise and the corps of spe¬  cialists,” the knowledge, the practitioners, and the teachers, to  enable us to conduct such a “resourceful diplomacy” more  effectively.   Turning to the liberal wing, we find that Roger Hilsman has a  rather similar message in his study of the diplomacy of the  Kennedy administration, To Move a Nation. He informs us that  the most divisive issue among the “hardheaded and pragmatic  liberals” of the Kennedy team was how the United States  should deal with the problem of “modern guerrilla warfare, as  the Communists practice it.” The problem is that this “is inter¬  nal war, an ambiguous aggression that avoids direct and open  attack violating international frontiers” (italics his). Appar¬  ently, the hardheaded and pragmatic liberals were never di¬  vided on the issue of our right to violate international frontiers  in reacting to such “internal war.” As a prime example of the  “kind of critical, searching analysis” that the new, liberal, re¬  vitalized State Department was trying to encourage, Hilsman  cites a study directed to showing how the United States might  have acted more effectively to overthrow the Mossadegh gov¬  ernment in Iran. Allen Dulles was “fundamentally right,” ac¬  cording to Hilsman, in judging that Mossadegh in Iran (like  Arbenz in Guatemala) had come to power (to be sure,    \",\n",

The liberals  were extremely weak in any event, in particular because of the  domination of the economy by Western and Chinese enterprises  linked with the corrupt governmental bureaucracy. The Coup  Group that had overthrown the government “was composed  almost entirely of commoners, many of whom had come from  the peasantry or low-ranking military and civil service families,”  and who now wanted their share in corruption and authori¬  tarian control. The opposition “Democrats” were, for the most     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   part, “members of the royal family or conservative landowners  who wanted to preserve their role in the government and their  personal wealth.” Whatever opportunities might have existed  for the development of some more equitable society disap¬  peared once the American presence became dominant, how¬  ever. Surely any Thai liberal reformer must have been aware of  this by 1950, in the wake of the coups, the farcical rigged elec¬  tions, the murder and torture of leaders of the Free Thai anti-  Japanese underground, the takeover by the military of the polit¬  ical and much of the commercial system—particularly when he  listened to the words of American Ambassador Stanton as he  signed a new aid agreement: “The American people fully sup¬  port this program of aid to Thailand because of their deep  interest in the Thai people whose devotion to the ideals of  freedom and liberty and wholehearted support of the UN have  won the admiration of the American people.   “A notable trend throughout this period was the growing  intimacy between the Thai military leaders and the top-level  military officials from the United States,” who helped them ob¬  tain “large-scale foreign aid which in turn bolstered their polit¬  ical power.” The head of the American military mission, Colo¬  nel Charles Sheldon, stated that Thailand was “threatened by  armed aggression by people who do not believe in democracy,  who do not believe in freedom or the dignity of the individual  man as do the people of Thailand and my country.” Adlai Ste¬  venson, in 1953, warned the Thai leaders “that their country  was the real target of the Vietminh,” and expressed his hope that  they “fully appreciate the threat.” Meanwhile, United States  assistance had built a powerful army and supplied the police  with tanks, artillery, armored cars, an air force, naval patrol  vessels, and a training school for paratroopers.

It may be useful to sample some of the  other views that appear in American scholarship. Consider/for  example, the proposals of Thomas R.

It is an illusion to be¬  lieve that we can retreat from Asia and leave it to its own  devices, for our own Western culture must be understood as “a  minority movement of recent date in the evolution of civiliza-  ’ and it cannot be taken for granted that Asia will remain     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   “incapable of intervening in our affairs.” Thus to defend our¬  selves, we must intervene with force in the affairs of Asia. If we  fail to establish “our industrial enterprise system” universally,  we will have to “defend our privileges and gains by means o  the continuing, brutalizing, and costly exercise of superior force  in every corner of the globe.”   Why are we justified in forceful intervention in t e a airs o  Asia? “One obvious justification for United States intervention  in Asian affairs lies in our leadership of the world strugg e  against communism. Communist political and economic infiltra¬  tion among a majority of the world’s peoples appears to Ameri¬  can political leadership to be fatal to our safety and progress,  this attitude is supported almost unanimously by public opin¬  ion.” Pursuing this logic a few steps further, we wil soon av  the same “obvious justification” for taking out China with nu¬  clear weapons—and perhaps France as well, for good meas-   ure.   Further justification is that the defense of our western sea¬  board “requires that the North Pacific be controlled as a virtual  American lake,” a fact which “provides one basis for Umte^  States intervention in power struggles throughout the region,  to preserve the security of this mare nostrum- Our “victory over  Japan left a power vacuum in Southeast Asia and the ar as  that was tempting to communist aggression; therefore, we ha  to step in and use our military power.” “Island possessions, such  as Guam, those of the strategic trust territories, and probably  Okinawa, remain indispensable, if not to the narrow defense o  our shores, certainly to the military posture essential to our total  security and world aims.”* 6 Apart from the magnificent scope  of this vision, rarely equaled by our forerunners, the termi-  nology is not unfamiliar.

Rosa Luxemburg, in 1918, argued that Bolshevik elitism  would lead to a state of society in which the bureaucracy alone  would remain an active element in social life—though now it  would be the “red bureaucracy” of that State Socialism that  Bakunin had long before described as “the most vile and terri¬  ble lie that our century has created.” 40 A true social revolution  requires a “spiritual transformation in the masses degraded by  centuries of bourgeois class rule”; 50 “it is only by extirpating  the habits of obedience and servility to the last root that the  working class can acquire the understanding of a new form of  discipline, self-discipline arising from free consent.” 51 Writing  in 1904, she predicted that Lenin’s organizational concepts  would “enslave a young labor movement to an intellectual elite  hungry for power . . . and turn it into an automaton manipu¬  lated by a Central Committee.” 52 In the Bolshevik elitist doc¬  trine of 1918 she saw a disparagement of the creative, spon¬  taneous, self-correcting force of mass action, which alone, she     ★- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   argued, could solve the thousand problems of social reconstruc¬  tion and produce the spiritual transformation that is the essence  of a true social revolution. As Bolshevik practice hardened into  dogma, the fear of popular initiative and spontaneous mass  action, not under the direction and control of the properly des¬  ignated vanguard, became a dominant element of so-called  “Communist” ideology.   Antagonism to mass movements and to social change that  escapes the control of privileged elites is also a prominent fea¬  ture of contemporary liberal ideology. 53 Expressed as foreign  policy, it takes the form described earlier. To conclude this  discussion of counterrevolutionary subordination, I would like  to investigate how, in one rather crucial case, this particular  bias in American liberal ideology can be detected even in the  interpretation of events of the past in which American involve¬  ment was rather slight, and in historical work of very high  caliber.   In 1966, the American Historical Association gave its biennial  award for the most outstanding work on European history to  Gabriel Jackson, for his study of Spain in the 1930s. 54 There is  no question that of the dozens of books on this period, Jackson’s  is among the best, and I do not doubt that the award was well  deserved. The Spanish Civil War is one of the crucial events of  modern history, and one of the most extensively studied as well.  In it, we find the interplay of forces and ideas that have domin¬  ated European history since the industrial revolution. What is  more, the relationship of Spain to the great powers was in many  respects like that of the countries of what is now called the  Third World. In some ways, then, the events of the Spanish  Civil War give a foretaste of what the future may hold, as Third  World revolutions uproot traditional societies, threaten imperial  dominance, exacerbate great-power rivalries, and bring the world  ',\n",

In fact, this astonishing social upheaval seems  to have largely passed from memory. The drama and pathos of  the Spanish Civil War have by no means faded; witness the  impact a few years ago of the film To Die in Madrid . Yet in this  film (as Daniel Guerin points out) one finds no reference to the  popular revolution that had transformed much of Spanish society.   I will be concerned here with the events of 1936-193 7, 61 and  with one particular aspect of the complex struggle involving  Franco Nationalists, Republicans (including the Communist  party), anarchists, and socialist workers’ groups. The Franco  insurrection in July 1936 came against a background of several  months of strikes, expropriations, and battles between peasants  and Civil Guards. The left-wing Socialist leader Largo Cabal¬  lero had demanded in June that the workers be armed, but was  refused by Azana. When the coup came, the Republican gov¬  ernment was paralyzed. Workers armed themselves in Madrid  and Barcelona, robbing government armories and even ships in  the harbor, and put down the insurrection while the govern¬  ment vacillated, torn between the twin dangers of submitting to   ',\n",
       " '    ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   Franco and arming the working classes. In large areas of Spain  effective authority passed into the hands of the anarchist and  socialist workers who had played a substantial, generally domi¬  nant role in putting down the insurrection.   The next few months have frequently been described as a  period of “dual power.” In Barcelona industry and commerce  were largely collectivized, and a wave of collectivization spread  through rural areas, as well as towns and villages, in Aragon,  Castile, and the Levant, and to a lesser but still significant  extent in many parts of Catalonia, Asturias, Estremadura, and  Andalusia. Military power was exercised by defense commit¬  tees; social and economic organization took many forms, fol¬  lowing in main outlines the program of the Saragossa Congress  of the anarchist CNT in May 1936. The revolution was “apoliti¬  cal,” in the sense that its organs of power and administration  remained separate from the central Republican government  and, even after several anarchist leaders entered the government  in the autumn of 1936, continued to function fairly independ¬  ently until the revolution was finally crushed between the  fascist and Communist-led Republican forces. The success, of  collectivization of industry and commerce in Barcelona im¬  pressed even highly unsympathetic observers such as Borkenau.  The scale of rural collectivization is indicated by these data  from anarchist sources: in Aragon, 450 collectives with half a  million members; in the Levant, 900 collectives accounting for  about half the agricultural production and 70 percent of mar¬  keting in this, the richest agricultural region of Spain; in Castile,  300 collectives with about 100,000 members. 62 In Catalonia,  the bourgeois government headed by Companys retained  nominal authority, but real power was in the hands of the  anarchist-dominated committees.   The period of July through September may be characterized    ',\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " ' ',\n",
       " '    Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   as one of spontaneous, widespread, but unconsummated social  revolution. 63 A number of anarchist leaders joined the govern¬  ment; the reason, as stated by Federica Montseny on January 3,  1937, was this: “. . . the anarchists have entered the government  to prevent the Revolution from deviating and in order to carry  it further beyond the war, and also to oppose any dictatorial  tendency, from wherever it might come.” 64 The central gov¬  ernment fell increasingly under Communist control—in Cata¬  lonia, under the control of the Communist-dominated PSUC—  largely as a result of the valuable Russian military assistance.  Communist success was greatest in the rich farming areas of the  Levant (the government moved to Valencia, capital of one of  the provinces), where prosperous farm owners flocked to the  Peasant Federation that the party had organized to protect the  wealthy farmers; this federation “served as a powerful instru¬  ment in checking the rural collectivization promoted by the  agricultural workers of the province.” 66 Elsewhere as well,  counterrevolutionary successes reflected increasing Communist  dominance of the Republic.   The first phase of the counterrevolution was the legalization  and regulation of those accomplishments of the revolution that  appeared irreversible. A decree of October 7 by the Commu¬  nist Minister of Agriculture, Vicente Uribe, legalized certain  expropriations—namely, of lands belonging to participants in  the Franco revolt. Of course, these expropriations had already  taken place, a fact that did not prevent the Communist press  from describing the decree as “the most profoundly revolution¬  ary measure that has been taken since the military uprising.” 66  In fact, by exempting the estates of landowners who had not  directly participated in the Franco rebellion, the decree repre¬  sented a step backward, from the standpoint of the revolu¬  tionaries, and it was criticized not only by the CNT but also by     ic — = AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   the Socialist Federation of Land Workers, affiliated with the  UGT. The demand for a much broader decree was unaccepta¬  ble to the Communist-led ministry, since the Communist party  was “seeking support among the propertied classes in the anti-  Franco coup” and hence “could not afford to repel the small  and medium proprietors who had been hostile to the working  class movement before the civil war.” 67 These “small proprie¬  tors,” in fact, seem to have included owners of substantial  estates. The decree compelled tenants to continue paying rent  unless the landowners had supported Franco, and by guaran¬  teeing former landholdings, it prevented distribution of land to  the village poor. Ricardo Zabalza, general secretary of the Fed¬  eration of Land Workers, described the resulting situation as  one of “galling injustice”; “the sycophants of the former political  bosses still enjoy a privileged position at the expense of those  persons who were unable to rent even the smallest parcel of  land, because they were revolutionaries.” 68   To complete the stage of legalization and restriction of what  had already been achieved, a decree of October 24, 1936,  promulgated by a CNT member who had become Councilor for  Economy in the Catalonian Generalitat, gave legal sanction to  the collectivization of industry in Catalonia. In this case too, the  step was regressive, from the revolutionary point of view. Col¬  lectivization was limited to enterprises employing more than a  hundred workers, and a variety of conditions were established  that removed control from the workers’ committees to the state  bureaucracy. 66   The second stage of the counterrevolution, from October  1936 through May 1937, involved the destruction of the local  committees, the replacement of the militia by a conventional  army, and the re-establishment of the prerevolutionary social  and economic system, wherever this was possible.

The  collectivization decree of October 24 was rescinded and indus¬  tries were \"freed” from workers’ control. Communist-led armies  swept through Aragon, destroying many collectives and de¬  manding their organizations and, generally, bringing the area  under the control of the central government. Throughout the  Republican-held territories, the government, now under Com¬  munist domination, acted in accordance with the plan an¬  nounced in Pravda on December 17, 1936: \"So far as Catalonia  is concerned, the cleaning up of Trotzkyist and Anarcho-Syndi¬  calist elements there has already begun, and it will be carried  out there with the same energy as in the U.S.S.R. n —an , we  may add, in much the same manner.   In brief, the period from the summer of 1936 to 1937 was one  Of revolution and counterrevolution: the revolution was largely  spontaneous with mass participation of anarchist and socia ist  industrial and agricultural workers; the counterrevolution was  under Communist direction, the Communist party increasingly  coming to represent the right wing of the Republic. During t is  period and after the success of the counterrevolution, t e e-  public was waging a war against the Franco insurrection; this  has been described in great detail in numerous publications,  and I will say little about it here. The Communist-led counter¬  revolutionary struggle must, of course, be understood against  the background of the ongoing antifascist war and the more  general attempt of the Soviet Union to construct a broad anti¬  fascist alliance with the Western democracies. One reason for  the vigorous counterrevolutionary policy of the Communis s  was their belief that England would never tolerate a revo u-  tionary triumph in Spain, where England had substantial com-     AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   mercial interests, as did France and to a lesser extent the  United States. I will return to this matter below. However I  hink ,t .s important to bear in mind that there were undoubt¬  edly other factors as well. Rudolf Rocker’s comments are I  believe, quite to the point:    ... the Spanish people have been engaged in a desperate struggle  against a pitiless foe and have been exposed besides to the tcfet  in ngues of the great imperialist powers of Europe.

       " \"    Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   tion of the extent to which Bolshevism and Western liberalism  have been united in their opposition to popular revolution.  However, I do not think that one can comprehend the events in  Spain without attaining this perspective.   With this brief sketch—partisan, but I think accurate—for  background, I would like to turn to Jackson’s account of this  aspect of the Spanish Civil War (see note 54).   Jackson presumes (p. 259) that Soviet support for the Repub¬  lican cause in Spain was guided by two factors: first, concern  for Soviet security; second, the hope that a Republican victory  would advance “the cause of worldwide ‘people’s revolution’  with which Soviet leaders hoped to identify themselves.” They  did not press their revolutionary aims, he feels, because “for the  moment it was essential not to frighten the middle classes or the  Western governments.”   As to the concern for Soviet security, Jackson is no doubt  correct. It is clear that Soviet support of the Republic was one  aspect of the attempt to make common cause with the Western  democracies against the fascist threat. However, Jackson’s con¬  ception of the Soviet Union as a revolutionary power—hopeful  that a Republican victory would advance “the interrupted  movement toward world revolution” and seeking to identify it¬  self with “the cause of the world-wide ‘people’s revolution’ ”  —seems to me entirely mistaken. Jackson presents no evidence  to support this interpretation of Soviet policy, nor do I know of  any. It is interesting to see how differently the events were  interpreted at the time of the Spanish Civil War, not only by  anarchists like Rocker but also by such commentators as Gerald  Brenan and Franz Borkenau, who were intimately acquainted  with the situation in Spain. Brenan observes that the counter¬  revolutionary policy of the Communists (which he thinks was  “extremely sensible”) was      *== AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   the policy most suited to the Communists themselves. Russia is a  totalitarian regime ruled by a bureaucracy: the frame of mind of  its leaders, who have come through the most terrible upheaval in  history, is cynical and opportunist: the whole fabric of the state  is dogmatic and authoritarian. To expect such men to lead a  social revolution in a country like Spain, where the wildest ideal¬  ism is combined with great independence of character, was out of  the question. The Russians could, it is true, command plenty of  idealism among their foreign admirers, but they could only  harness it to the creation of a cast-iron bureaucratic state, where  everyone thinks alike and obeys the orders of the chief above  him . 74    He sees nothing in Russian conduct in Spain to indicate any  interest in a “people’s revolution.” Rather, the Communist pol¬  icy was to oppose “even such rural and industrial collectives as  had risen spontaneously and flood the country with police who,  like the Russian Ogpu, acted on the orders of their party rather  than those of the Ministry of the Interior.” The Communists  were concerned to suppress altogether the impulses towards  “spontaneity of speech or action,” since “their whole nature and  history made them distrust the local and spontaneous and put  their faith in order, discipline and bureaucratic uniformity”  —hence placed them in opposition to the revolutionary forces  in Spain. As Brenan also notes, the Russians withdrew their  support once it became clear that the British would not be  swayed from the policy of appeasement, a fact which gives  additional confirmation to the thesis that only considerations of  Russian foreign policy led the Soviet Union to support the Re¬  public.   Borkenau’s analysis is similar. He approves of the Communist  policy, because of its “efficiency,” but he points out that the  Communists “put an end to revolutionary social activity, and     1: If i .1! jJJ Mili f J 'iMlfL 1, ...i *! .1!;l. Ukll.UJ ihM M’l:\\\\ It!      Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   Simply the defence of a legal government. . . . communist policy  in Spain was mainly dictated not by the necessities of the Span¬  ish fight but by the interests of the intervening foreign power,  Russia/’ a country “with a revolutionary past, not a revolution¬  ary present.” The Communists acted “not with the aim of trans¬  forming chaotic enthusiasm into disciplined enthusiasm [which  Borkenau feels to have been necessary], but with the aim of  substituting disciplined military and administrative action for  the action of the masses and getting rid of the latter entirely.”  This policy, he points out, went “directly against the interests  and claims of the masses” and thus weakened popular support.  The now apathetic masses would not commit themselves to the  defense of a Communist-run dictatorship, which restored former  authority and even “showed a definite preference for the police  forces of the old regime, so hated by the masses.” It seems to  me that the record strongly supports this interpretation of  Communist policy and its effects, though Borkenau’s assump¬  tion that Communist “efficiency” was necessary to win the anti-  Franco struggle is much more dubious-a question to which I  return below. 75   It is relevant to observe, at this point, that a number of the  Spanish Communist leaders were reluctantly forced to similar  conclusions. Bolloten cites several examples, 76 specifically, the  military commander “El Campesino” and Jesus Hernfindez, a  minister in the Caballero government. The former, after his  escape from the Soviet Union in 1949, stated that he had taken  for granted the “revolutionary solidarity” of the Soviet Union  during the Civil War—a most remarkable degree of innocence  —-and. realized only later “that the Kremlin does not serve the  interests of the peoples of the world, but makes them serve its  own interests; that, with a treachery and hypocrisy without  parallel, it makes use of the international working class as a     ^ AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   mere pawn in its political intrigues.” Hernandez, in a speech  given shortly after the Civil War, admits that the Spanish  Communist leaders “acted more like Soviet subjects than sons  of the Spanish people.” “It may seem absurd, incredible,” he  adds, “but our education under Soviet tutelage had deformed us  to such an extent that we were completely denationalized; our  national soul was torn out of us and replaced by a rabidly  chauvinistic internationalism, which began and ended with the  towers of the Kremlin.”   Shortly after the Third World Congress of the Communist  International in 1921, the Dutch “ultra-leftist” Hermann Gorter  wrote that the congress “has decided the fate of the world  revolution for the present. The trend of opinion that seriously  desired world revolution ... has been expelled from the Russian  International. The Communist Parties in western Europe and  throughout the world that retain their membership of the Rus¬  sian International will become nothing more than a means to  preserve the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Republic. 77  This forecast has proved quite accurate. Jackson’s conception  that the Soviet Union was a revolutionary power in the late  1930s, or even that the Soviet leaders truly regarded themselves  as identified with world revolution, is without factual support.  It is a misinterpretation that runs parallel to the American Cold  War mythology that has invented an “international Communist  conspiracy” directed from Moscow (now Peking) to justify its  own interventionist policies.   Turning to events in revolutionary Spain, Jackson describes  the first stages of collectivization as follows: the unions in  Madrid, “as in Barcelona and Valencia, abused their sudden  authority to place the sign incautado [placed under workers  control] on all manner of buildings and vehicles” (p. 279).    \",\n",
       " \"           Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship    Why was this an abuse of authority? This Jackson does not  explain. The choice of words indicates a reluctance on Jackson's  part to recognize the reality of the revolutionary situation, de¬  spite his account of the breakdown of Republican authority.  The statement that the workers “abused their sudden authority”  by carrying out collectivization rests on a moral judgment that  recalls that of Ithiel Pool, when he characterizes land reform in  Vietnam as a matter of “despoiling one’s neighbors,” or of Franz  Borkenau, when he speaks of expropriation in the Soviet Union  as “robbery,” demonstrating “a streak of moral indifference.”   Within a few months, Jackson informs us, “the revolutionary  tide began to ebb in Catalonia” after “accumulating food and  supply problems, and the experience of administering villages,  frontier posts, and public utilities, had rapidly shown the  anarchists the unsuspected complexity of modern society” (pp.  313-14). In Barcelona, “the naive optimism of the revolutionary  conquests of the previous August had given way to feelings of  resentment and of somehow having been cheated,” as the cost  of living doubled, bread was in short supply, and police bru¬  tality reached the levels of the monarchy. “The POUM and the  anarchist press simultaneously extolled the collectivizations and  explained the failures of production as due to Valencia policies  of boycotting the Catalan economy and favoring the bour¬  geoisie. They explained the loss of Malaga as due in large mea¬  sure to the low morale and the disorientation of the Andalusian  proletariat, which saw the Valencia government evolving stead¬  ily toward the right” (p. 368). Jackson evidently believes that  this left-wing interpretation of events was nonsensical, and that  in fact it was anarchist incompetence, or treachery that was  responsible for the difficulties: “In Catalonia, the CNT factory  committees dragged their heels on war production, claiming      ★= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   that the government deprived them of raw materials and was  favoring the bourgeoisie ” (p. 365).   In fact, “the revolutionary tide began to ebb in Catalonia”  under a middle-class attack led by the Communist party, not  because of a recognition of the “complexity of modern society.”  And it was, moreover, quite true that the Communist-domi¬  nated central government attempted, with much success, to  hamper collectivized industry and agriculture and to disrupt the  collectivization of commerce. I have already referred to the  early stages of counterrevolution. Further investigation of the  sources to which Jackson refers and others shows that the an¬  archist charges were not baseless, as Jackson implies. Bolloten  cites a good deal of evidence in support of his conclusion that   In the countryside the Communists undertook a spirited defence  of the small and medium proprietor and tenant farmer against the  collectivizing drive of the rural wage-workers, against the policy  of the labour unions prohibiting the farmer from holding more  land than he could cultivate with his own hands, and against the  practices of revolutionary committees, which requisitioned har¬  vests, interfered with private trade, and collected rents from ten¬  ant farmers . 78   The policy of the government was clearly enunciated by the  Communist Minister of Agriculture: “We say that the property  of the small farmer is sacred and that those who attack or  attempt to attack this property must be regarded as enemies of  the regime.” 79 Gerald Brenan, no sympathizer with collectiviza¬  tion, explains the failure of collectivization as follows (p.  321):   The Central Government, and especially the Communist and  Socialist members of it, desired to bring [the collectives] under  the direct control of the State: they therefore failed to provide  them with the credit required for buying raw materials: as soon  as the supply of raw cotton was exhausted the mills stopped     Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   working. . . . even [the munitions industry in Catalonia] were   harassed by the new bureaucratic organs of the Ministry of Sup¬  ply . 80   He quotes the bourgeois President of Catalonia, Companys, as  saying that “workers in the arms factories in Barcelona had  been working 56 hours and more each week and that no cases  of sabotage or indiscipline had taken place,” until the workers  were demoralized by the bureaucratization—later, militariza¬  tion—imposed by the central government and the Communist  party. 81 His own conclusion is that “the Valencia Government  was now using the P.S.U.C. against the C.N.T.—but not  because the Catalan workers were giving trouble, but because  the Communists wished to weaken them before destroying  them.”   The cited correspondence from Companys to Prieto, accord¬  ing to Vernon Richards (p. 47), presents evidence showing the  success of Catalonian war industry under collectivization and  demonstrating how “much more could have been achieved had  the means for expanding the industry not been denied them by  the Central Government.” Richards also cites testimony by a  spokesman for the subsecretariat of munitions and armament of  the Valencia government admitting that “the'war industry of  Catalonia had produced ten times more than the rest of Spanish  industry put together and [agreeing] . . . that this output could  have been quadrupled as from beginning of September* if  Catalonia had had access to the necessary means for purchasing  raw materials that were unobtainable in Spanish territory.” It is  important to recall that the central government had enormous  gold reserves (soon to be transmitted to the Soviet Union), so  that raw materials for Catalan industry could probably have   ♦The quoted testimony is from September 1, 1937; presumably, the reference  is to September 1936.      ★=    AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   been purchased, despite the hostility of the Western democ¬  racies to the Republic during the revolutionary period (see  below). Furthermore, raw materials had repeatedly been re¬  quested. On September 24, 1936, Juan Fabregas, the CNT  delegate to the Economic Council of Catalonia who was in part  responsible for the collectivization decree cited earlier, reported  that the financial difficulties of Catalonia were created by the  refusal of the central government to “give any assistance in  economic and financial questions, presumably because it has  little sympathy with the work of a practical order which is  being carried out in Catalonia” 82 —that is, collectivization. He  “went on to recount that a Commission which went to Madrid  to ask for credits to purchase war materials and raw materials,  offering 1,000 million pesetas in securities lodged in the Bank of  Spain, met with a blank refusal. It was sufficient that the new  war industry in Catalonia was controlled by the workers of the  C.N.T. for the Madrid Government to refuse any unconditional  aid. Only in exchange for government control would they give  financial assistance.” 83   Broue and Temime take a rather similar position. Comment¬  ing on the charge of “incompetence” leveled against the col¬  lectivized industries, they point out that “one must not neglect  the terrible burden of the war.” Despite this burden, they ob¬  serve, “new techniques of management and elimination of divi¬  dends had permitted a lowering of prices” and “mechanisation  and rationalization, introduced in numerous enterprises . . .  had considerably augmented production. The workers ac¬  cepted the enormous sacrifices with enthusiasm because, in  most cases, they had the conviction that the factory belonged to  them and that at last they were working for themselves and their  class brothers. A truly new spirit had come over the economy of  Spain with the concentration of scattered enterprises, the simpli-  \",\n",
       " '   Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship    fication of commercial patterns, a significant structure of social  projects for aged workers, children, disabled, sick and the per¬  sonnel in general” (pp. 150-51). The great weakness of the  revolution, they argue, was the fact that it was not carried  through to completion. In part this was because of the war; in  part, a consequence of the policies of the central government.  They too emphasize the refusal of the Madrid government, in  the early stages of collectivization, to grant credits or supply  funds to collectivized industry or agriculture—in the case of  Catalonia, even when substantial guarantees were offered by  the Catalonian government. Thus the collectivized enterprises  were forced to exist on what assets had been seized at the time  of the revolution. The control of gold and credit “permitted the  government to restrict and prevent the function of collective  enterprises at will” (p. 144).   According to Broue and Temime, it was the restriction of  credit that finally destroyed collectivized industry. The Com-  panys government in Catalonia refused to create a bank for  industry and credit, as demanded by the CNT and POUM, and  the central government (relying, in this case, on control of the  banks by the socialist UGT) was able to control the flow of  capital and “to reserve credit for private enterprise.” All at¬  tempts to obtain credit for collectivized industry were unsuc¬  cessful, they maintain, and “the movement of collectivization  was restricted, then halted, the government remaining in con¬  trol of industry through the medium of the banks . . . [and  later] through its control of the choice of managers and direc¬  tors,” who often turned out to be the former owners and man¬  agers, under new titles. The situation was similar in the case of  collectivized agriculture (pp. 204 f.).   The situation was duly recognized in the West. The New  York Times, in February 1938, observed: “The principle of    ',\n",
       " '  a - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS   State intervention and control of business and industry, as  against workers’ control of them in the guise of collectivization,  is gradually being established in loyalist Spain by a series of  decrees now appearing. Coincidentally there is to be estab¬  lished the principle of private ownership and the rights of cor¬  porations and companies to what is lawfully theirs under the  Constitution.” 84   Morrow cites (pp. 64-65) a series of acts by the Catalonian  government restricting collectivization, once power had shifted  away from the new institutions set up by the workers’ revolu¬  tion of July 1936. On February 3, the collectivization of the  dairy trade was declared illegal. 85 In April, “the Generalidad  annulled workers’ control over the customs by refusing to cer¬  tify workers’ ownership of material that had been exported and  was being tied up in foreign courts by suits of former owners;  henceforth the factories and agricultural collectives exporting  goods were at the mercy of the government.” In May, as has  already been noted, the collectivization decree of October 24  was rescinded, with the argument that the decree “was dictated  without competency by the Generalidad,” because “there was  not, nor is there yet, legislation of the [Spanish] state to apply”  and “article 44 of the Constitution declares expropriation and  socialization are functions of the State.” A decree of August 28  “gave the government the right to intervene in or take over any  mining or metallurgical plant.” The anarchist newspaper Soli -  daridad Obrera reported in October a decision of the department  of purchases of the Ministry of Defense that it would make  contracts for purchases only with enterprises functioning “on  the basis of their old owners” or “under the corresponding in¬  tervention controlled by the Ministry of Finance and Econ¬  omy.” 86   Returning to Jackson’s statement that “In Catalonia, the CNT    ',\n",
       " '       Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship   factory committees dragged their heels on war production,  claiming that the government deprived them of raw materials  and was favoring the bourgeoisie ” I believe one must conclude  that this statement is more an expression of Jackson’s bias in  favor of capitalist democracy than a description of the historical  facts. At the very least, we can say this much: Jackson presents  no evidence to support his conclusion; there is a factual basis  for questioning it. I have cited a number of sources that the  liberal historian would regard, quite correctly, as biased in  favor of the revolution. My point is that the failure of objec¬  tivity, the deep-seated bias of liberal historians, is a matter  much less normally taken for granted, and that there are good  grounds for supposing that this failure of objectivity has seri¬  ously distorted the judgments that are rather brashly handed  down about the nature of the Spanish revolution.   Continuing with the analysis of Jackson’s judgments, unsup¬  ported by any cited evidence, consider his remark, quoted  above, that in Barcelona “the naive optimism of the revolu¬  tionary conquests of the previous August had given way to  feelings of resentment and of somehow having been cheated.” It  is a fact that by January 1937 there was great disaffection in Bar¬  celona. But was this simply a consequence of “the unsuspected  complexity of modern society”? Looking into the matter a bit  more closely, we see a rather different picture. Under Russian  pressure, the PSUC was given substantial control of the Cata¬  lonian government, “putting into the Food Ministry [in De¬  cember 1936] the man most to the Right in present Catalan  politics, Comorera” 87 —by virtue of his political views, the most  willing collaborator with the general Communist party position.  According to Jackson, Comorera “immediately took steps to end  barter and requisitioning, and became a defender of the peas¬  ants against the revolution” (p. 314); he “ended requisition,       AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS    restored money payments, and protected the Catalan peasants  against further collectivization” (p. 361). This is all that Jack-  son has to say about Juan Comorera.   We learn more from other sources: for example, Borkenau,  who was in Barcelona for the second time in January 1937 and  is universally recognized as a highly knowledgeable and expert  observer, with strong anti-anarchist sentiments. According to  Borkenau, Comorera represented “a political attitude which can  best be compared with that of the extreme right wing of the  German social-democracy. He had always regarded the fight  against anarchism as the chief aim of socialist policy in Spain.  ... To his surprise, he found unexpected allies for his dislike  [of anarchist policies] in the communists.” 88 It was impossible  to reverse collectivization of industry at that stage in the pro¬  cess of counterrevolution; Comorera did succeed, however, in  abolishing the system by which the provisioning of Barcelona  had been organized, namely, the village committees, mostly  under CNT influence, which had cooperated (perhaps, Bor¬  kenau suggests, unwillingly) in delivering flour to the towns.  Continuing, Borkenau describes the situation as follows:   . . . Comorera, starting from those principles of abstract liberal¬  ism which no administration has followed during the war, but of  which right-wing socialists are the last and most religious ad¬  mirers, did not substitute for the chaotic bread committees a  centralized administration. He restored private commerce in bread,  simply and completely. There was, in January, not even a system  of rationing in Barcelona. Workers were simply left to get their  bread, with wages which had hardly changed since May, at in¬  creased prices, as well as they could. In practice it meant that  the women had to form queues from four o’clock in the morning  onwards. The resentment in the working-class districts was natu¬  rally acute, the more so as the scarcity of bread rapidly increased  after Comorera had taken office . 89    ',\n",
       " \"   Objectivity and Libera! Scholarship    In short, the workers of Barcelona were not merely giving  way to “feelings of resentment and of somehow having been  cheated” when they learned of “the unsuspected complexity of  modern society.” Rather, they had good reason to believe that  they were being cheated, by the old dog with the new collar.  George Orwell’s observations are also highly relevant:   Everyone who has made two visits, at intervals of months, to  Barcelona during the war has remarked upon the extraordinary  changes that took place in it. And curiously enough, whether  they went there first in August and again in January, or, like  myself, first in December and again in April, the thing they said  was always the same: that the revolutionary atmosphere had  vanished. No doubt to anyone who had been there in August,  when the blood was scarcely dry in the streets and militia were  quartered in the small hotels, Barcelona in December would have  seemed bourgeois; to me, fresh from England, it was liker to a  workers’ city than anything I had conceived possible. Now [in  April] the tide had rolled back. - Once again it was an ordinary  city, a little pinched and chipped by war, but with no outward  sign of working-class predominance. . . . Fat prosperous men,  elegant women, and sleek cars were everywhere. . . . The officers  of the new Popular Army, a type that had scarcely existed when I  left Barcelona, swarmed in surprising numbers . . . [wearing] an  elegant khaki uniform with a tight waist, like a British Army  officer’s uniform, only a little more so. I do not suppose that  more than one in' twenty of them had yet been to the front, but  all of them had automatic pistols strapped to their belts; we, at  the front, could not get pistols for love or money. . . .* A deep  change had come over the town. There were two facts that were  the keynote of all else. One was that the people—the civil popula¬  tion—had lost much of their interest in the war; the other was  that the normal division of society into rich and poor, upper class  and lower class, was reasserting itself . 90   * Orwell had just returned from the Aragon front, where he had been  serving with the POUM militia in an area heavily dominated by left-  wing (POUM and anarchist) troops.    \"]"
