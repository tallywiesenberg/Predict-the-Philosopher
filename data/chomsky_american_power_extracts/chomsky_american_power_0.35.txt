As matters now stand, it appears unlikely that Vietnamese 
resistance will collapse.The United States seems unable to 
muster the military force to crush this resistance and to guaran¬ 
tee the dominance of the government and social institutions 
that we have determined to be appropriate.There is, therefore, 
some hope that American troops will be withdrawn and the 
Vietnamese left to try to reconstruct something from the wreck¬ 
age.The course of history may be determined, to a very signifi¬ 
cant degree, by what the people of the United States will have 
learned from this catastrophe.Three times in a generation American technology has laid 
waste a helpless Asian country.
