Quite possibly it will lead nowhere, cut off by domes¬ 
tic repression or its “functional equivalent,” to use a favorite 
term of the present administration: the dominance of a liberal 
technocracy who will serve the existing social order in the belief 
that they represent justice and humanity, fighting limited wars 
at home and overseas to preserve stability, promising that the 
future will be better if only the dispossessed will wait patiently, 
and supported by an apathetic, obedient majority, its mind and 
conscience dulled by a surfeit of commodities and by some new 
version of the old system of beliefs and ideas.Perhaps the worst 
excesses may be eliminated.Perhaps a way may be found to 
bring about a fundamental change in American society of a sort 
that can hardly be envisioned today.A great many people have 
been aroused by the Vietnam tragedy and the domestic crisis.There is a new mood of questioning and rebellion among the 
youth of the country, a very healthy and hopeful development, 
by and large, that few would have predicted a decade ago.
