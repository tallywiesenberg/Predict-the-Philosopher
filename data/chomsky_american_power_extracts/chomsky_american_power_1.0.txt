No one who involved himself in antiwar activities as 
late as 1965, as I did, has any reason for pride or satisfaction.This opposition was ten or fifteen years too late.This is one 
lesson we should have learned from the tragedy of Vietnam.For the most part, these essays are elaborated versions of 
lectures given over the past few years.During these years, I 
have taken part in more conferences, debates, forums, teach-ins, 
meetings on Vietnam and American imperialism than I care to 
remember.
