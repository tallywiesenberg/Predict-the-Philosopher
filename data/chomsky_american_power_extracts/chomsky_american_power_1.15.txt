Is it true that 
the Jews are a cancer eating away at the vitality of the German 
people?and so on.Without awareness, I found myself drawn 
into this morass of insane rationality—inventing arguments to 
counter and demolish the constructions of the Bormanns and 
the Rosenbergs.By entering into the arena of argument and counterargu¬ 
ment, of technical feasibility and tactics, of footnotes and cita¬ 
tions, by accepting the presumption of legitimacy of debate on 
certain issues, one has already lost one’s humanity.This is the 
feeling I find almost impossible to repress when going through 
the motions of building a case against the American war in 
Vietnam.
