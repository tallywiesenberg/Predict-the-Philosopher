Anyone who puts a fraction of his mind to the task 
can construct a case that is overwhelming; surely this is now 
obvious.In an important way, by doing so he degrades himself, 
and insults beyond measure the victims of our violence and our 
moral blindness.There may have been a time when American 
policy in Vietnam was a debatable matter.This time is long 
past.It is no more debatable than the Italian war in Abyssinia 
or the Russian suppression of Hungarian freedom.
