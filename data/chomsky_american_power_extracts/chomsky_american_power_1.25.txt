The war is 
simply an obscenity, a depraved act by weak and miserable

pleasant to use such words, but candor permits no less.9

surpass belief.I have in front of me now an Associated Press 
photo from the New York Times with this caption: 

homeless children: Girl holds her wounded baby sister as South 
Vietnamese rangers move through their hamlet.Children had been 
rescued from a bunker under their house, burnt down when U.S. 
helicopters fired on Vietcong.
