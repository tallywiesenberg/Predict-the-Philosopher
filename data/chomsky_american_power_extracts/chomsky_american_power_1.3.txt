The scene is the Mekong Delta, southÂ¬ 
west of Saigon.I cannot describe the pathos of this scene, or the expression on 
the face of the wounded child.How many hundreds of such 
pictures must we see before we begin to care and to act?I suppose this is the first time in history that a nation has so 
openly and publicly exhibited its own war crimes.Perhaps this 
shows how well our free institutions function.
