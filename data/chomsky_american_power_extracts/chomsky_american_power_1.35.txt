Or does it simply 
show how immune we have become to suffering?Probably the 
latter.So at least it would seem, when we observe how opposi¬ 
tion to the war has grown in recent months.There is no doubt 
that the primary cause for this opposition is that the cost of the 
war to us is too great, unacceptable.It is deplorable, but none¬ 
theless true, that what has changed American public opinion 
and the domestic political picture is not the efforts of the “peace 
movement”—still less the declarations of any political spokes¬ 
men—but rather the Vietnamese resistance, which simply will 
not yield to American force.
