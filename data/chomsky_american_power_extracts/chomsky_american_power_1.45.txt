This proves the viability of American democracy.By these standards a still more viable democracy was that of 
fascist Japan in the late 1930s, where more than a dozen cabi¬ 
nets fell under not dissimilar circumstances.The health of our 
system would have been demonstrated by a change of policy 
caused by a recognition that what we have done in Vietnam is 
wrong, a criminal act, that an American “victory” would have 
been a tragedy.Nothing could be more remote from the Ameri¬ 
can political consciousness.So long as this remains true, we are 
fated to relive this horror.
