The primary reason for opposition to the war is its cost to us.A second cause is the feeling that the cost to its victims is too 
great.At first glance, this reaction seems to be at a higher moral 
level than the first, but this is questionable.The principle that 
we should retract our claws when the victim bleeds too much is 
hardly an elevated one.What about opposition to the war on 
the grounds that we have no right to stabilize or restructure 
Vietnamese society, or to carry out the experiments with “mate¬ 
rial and human resources control” that delight the “pacification 
theorist”?
