Funny thing to do to a 
country whose economy and politics you’re paying to enhance.But they say the only way to beat the guerrilla forces is to 
eliminate their source of life (the land and the people), ruin the 
land and concentrate the people into areas you can protect .4 

I think that such a letter tells us a good deal about the mood 
of the country today.A member of the IVS learns that what we 
are trying to do is “eliminate their source of life (the land and 
the people),” and then goes on cheerily and dutifully to do her 
job, helping to restore what has been destroyed.More to the 
point, several hundred thousand citizens of Greater Boston—the 
cultural capital of the United States, they would like to believe 
—may have read that letter and gone on to do their jobs.
