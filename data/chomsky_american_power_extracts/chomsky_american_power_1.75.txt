Urbanization, of course, is that 
“funny thing” that we’re doing to the people of Vietnam.It is 
the process described in the following terms by Don Luce, who 
resigned as director of IVS in late 1967 in protest against 
United States policy, after nine years in the field: 

Less “fortunate” villagers [than those in “pacified” villages] have 
been uprooted from their traditional homes and placed in refugee 
camps that crowd around the cities.These bleak camps are made 
up almost completely of women and children who deeply resent 
having been tom away from their farmlands and way of life, 
away from their ancestral burial grounds, and even away from 
their husbands—who are usually with the Vietcong.Their old 
village usually becomes part of a free strike zone.This means that 
planes can drop bombs anywhere in that area and that anyone 
caught there will be considered a Vietcong and shot.
