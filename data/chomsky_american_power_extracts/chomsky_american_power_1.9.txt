7 Mr. Harsch discusses the frustrations 
of the limited-bombing policy: 

A bomb dropped into a leafy jungle produces no visible result.Even if it hits a truck carrying ammunition the pilot seldom has 
the satisfaction of knowing what he achieved.A hit on a big 
hydroelectric dam is another matter.There is a huge explosion 
visible from anywhere above.The dam can be seen to fall.
