there is no powerful outside force that can call us to account— 
the change will have to come from within. 

I have been speaking only of oppression overseas, but it need 
hardly be emphasized that there is a domestic analogue. The 
reaction to the suffering of oppressed minorities at home is not 
very different from the brutal apathy towards the misery we 
have imposed elsewhere in the world. Opposition to the war in 
Vietnam is based very largely on its cost, and on the failure of 
American power to crush Vietnamese resistance. It is sad, but 
nonetheless true, that the tiny steps to bring freedom to black 
Americans have been taken, for the most part, out of fear. We 
must recognize these facts and regret them deeply, but not be 
paralyzed by this recognition. Anger, outrage, confessions of 
overwhelming guilt may be good therapy; they can also become 
a barrier to effective action, which can always be made to seem 
incommensurable with the enormity of the crime. Nothing is 
easier than to adopt a new form of self-indulgence, no less 
debilitating than the old apathy. The danger is substantial. It is 
hardly a novel insight that confession of guilt can be institu¬ 
tionalized as a technique for evading what must be done. It is 
even possible to achieve a feeling of satisfaction by contem¬ 
plating one’s evil nature. No less insidious is the cry for “revolu¬ 
tion,” at a time when not even the germs of new institutions 
exist, let alone the moral and political consciousness that could 
lead to a basic modification of social life. If there will be a 
“revolution” in America today, it will no doubt be a move to¬ 
wards some variety of fascism. We must guard against the kind 
of revolutionary rhetoric that would have had Karl Marx burn 
down the British Museum because it was merely part of a re¬ 
pressive society. It would be criminal to overlook the serious 
flaws and inadequacies in our institutions, or to fail to utilize

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


the substantial degree of freedom that most of us enjoy, within 
the framework of these flawed institutions, to modify them or 
even replace them by a better social order. One who pays some 
attention to history will not be surprised if those who cry most 
loudly that we must smash and destroy are later found among 
the administrators of some new system of repression. 

Someday the war in Vietnam will end, and with it the re¬ 
newed impulse it has given to self-analysis and the search for 
cures and alternatives. Those who were opposed to the war
