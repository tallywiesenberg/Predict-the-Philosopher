compared the assault on 
Aragon with the subjection of Asturias by Lopez Ochoa in Oc¬ 
tober 1934”—the latter, one of the bloodiest acts of repression 
in modern Spanish history.Although this is an exaggeration, it 
is a fact that the popular organs of administration were wiped 
out by Lister’s legions, and the revolution was now over, so far 
as Aragon was concerned.About these events, Jackson has the following comments: 

On August 11 the government announced the dissolution of the 
Consejo de Aragon , the anarchist-dominated administration which 
had been recognized by Largo Caballero in December, 1936.The 
peasants were known to hate the Consejo, the anarchists had de¬ 
serted the front during the Barcelona fighting, and the very exist¬ 
ence of the Consejo was a standing challenge to the authority of 
the central government.For all these reasons Negrin did not 
hesitate to send in troops, and to arrest the anarchist officials.
