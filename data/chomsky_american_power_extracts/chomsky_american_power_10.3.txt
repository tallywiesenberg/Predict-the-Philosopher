A number of nonanarchists, observing collecti¬ 
vization in Aragon firsthand, gave very favorable reports and 
stressed the voluntary character of collectivization.104 Accord¬ 
ing to Gaston Leval, an anarchist observer who carried out 
detailed investigation of rural collectivization, “in Aragon 75 
percent of small proprietors have voluntarily adhered to the 
new order of things,” and others were not forced to involve 
themselves in collectives.105 Other anarchist observers—Augus¬ 
tin Souchy in particular—gave detailed observations of the 
functioning of the Aragon collectives.Unless one is willing to 
assume a fantastic degree of falsification, it is impossible to 
reconcile their descriptions with the claim that “the peasants 
were known to hate the .Consejo”—unless, of course, one re¬ 
stricts the term “peasant” to “individual farm owner,” in which 
case it might very well be true, but would justify disbanding 
the Council only on the assumption that the rights of the indi¬ 
vidual farm owner must predominate, not those of the landless 
worker.There is little doubt that the collectives were economi¬ 
cally successful, 106 hardly likely if collectivization were forced 
and hated by the peasantry.
