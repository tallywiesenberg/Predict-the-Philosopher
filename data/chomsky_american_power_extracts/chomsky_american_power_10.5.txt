merely because of its costs or its atrocities will fall away. It is 
possible that an American defeat that cannot be disguised, or a 
“victory 77 that opens the way to new savagery, will be accom¬ 
panied by a serious domestic repression that will leave little 
energy or will for the task of re-evaluation and reconstruction of 
ideology and social life. But there are also encouraging signs. 
There is a growing realization that it is an illusion to believe 
that all will be well if only today's liberal hero can be placed in 
the White House, and a growing awareness that isolated, com¬ 
peting individuals can rarely confront repressive institutions 
alone. At best, a few may be tolerated as intellectual gadflies. 
The mass, even under formal democracy, will accept “the 
values that have been inculcated, often accidentally and often 
deliberately by vested interests , 77 values that have the status of 
“unconsciously acquired habits rather than choices . 7710 In a 
fragmented, competitive society, individuals can neither dis¬ 
cover their true interests nor act to defend them, as they cannot 
do so when prevented from free association by totalitarian con¬ 
trols. Recognition of these facts has brought young men to¬ 
gether in various forms of resistance and has given rise to the 
little-known but very impressive attempts at community organ¬ 
izing in many parts of the country; it also apparently moti¬ 
vates many of the spokesmen for “black power . 77 It is interesting

Introduction 


to see how classical ideas of libertarian socialism have found 
their way into the ideology of the “New Left.” Such statements 
as the following have become near cliches—not therefore false or 
unimportant: Our social system has “sacrificed the general in¬ 
terests of human society to the private interests of individ¬ 
uals, and thus systematically undermined a true relationship 
between men”; “Democracy with its motto of equality oj all 
citizens before the law and Liberalism with its right of man 
over his own person both were wrecked on the realities of 
capitalist economy”; “The greatest evil of any form of power is 
just that it always tries to force the rich diversity of social life 
into definite forms and adjust it to particular norms”; 

Political rights do not originate in parliaments; they are rather 
forced upon them from without. And even their enactment into 
law has for a long time been no guarantee of their security. They 
do not exist because they have been legally set down on a piece of 
paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a 
people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the
