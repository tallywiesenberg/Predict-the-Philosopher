took them by assault, carrying 
away and dividing up the harvest and farm implements without 
respecting the collectives that had been formed without vio¬ 
lence or pressure, that were prosperous, and that were a model 
of organization.... As a result, labour in the fields was sus¬ 
pended almost entirely, and a quarter of the land had not been 
prepared at the time for sowing” (p. 200).Once again, it was 
necessary to ameliorate the harsh repression of the collectives, 
to prevent disaster.Summarizing these events, Bolloten de¬ 
scribes the resulting situation as follows: 

But although the situation in Aragon improved in some degree, 
the hatreds and resentments generated by the break-up of the 
collectives and by the repression that followed were never wholly 
dispelled.Nor was the resultant disillusionment that sapped the 
spirit of the Anarchosyndicalist forces on the Aragon front ever 
entirely removed, a disillusionment that no doubt contributed to 
the collapse of that front a few months later.
