by Maruyama, in his analysis of the “theory and psychology of ultra¬ 
nationalism”: “Acts of benevolence could coexist with atrocities, and 
the perpetrators were not aware of any contradiction. Here is revealed 
the phenomenon in which morality is subtly blended with power” {op. 
cit., p. 11). Again, the reader will have no difficulty in supplying 
contemporary examples.

The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


ber 1967), pp. 297-303. The author, a Southeast Asian specialist and 
editorial writer for Asahi Shimbun, notes the similarity to earlier 
Japanese efforts, but feels that the prospects for the American pro¬ 
gram are dim for a number of reasons, among them the following: 

. . the wounds inflicted on Nature, so ruthlessly destroyed for this, are 
too brutal to see. Beautiful grasslands, the verdant forests and the 
rich crops have all been burned by flame throwers, napalm bombs and 
chemical defoliants. The great earth has been gouged and dug over. 
The ugly land, no longer green, has lost its power to attract people and 
to stir deep in the hearts of people a love for their birthplace and their 
motherland.” There is, he feels, little chance that revolutionary devel¬ 
opment will succeed “when Nature has been turned into a scorched 
earth and the system and the traditions born of a race of people have 
been destroyed.”

89. The timing of these events is given in this order in Lu, op. cit., p. 
188. According to Ike, op. cit., p. 108, the order to freeze assets was 
given on the evening of July 25, the announcement that troops would 
be moved south at noon on the 26th. The reasons for the delay in 
transmission of Roosevelt’s offer to the Japanese Foreign Ministry are 
obscure. It appears that there w 7 as still some room for diplomatic 
maneuver at this time. 

90. Schroeder, op. cit., p. 53. He quotes General Miles as saying that 
the United States “today is in a position to wreck completely the 
economic structure of the Japanese empire,” and Admiral Stark as 
predicting that this move (the freezing of assets) would probably lead 
directly to war.

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS

1967). As Steel observes, this generosity is the price we must pay to 
enjoy our imperial role. Compare the remarks of H. Merivale, cited on 
page 58 above. Perhaps the introductory chapters of this book, from 
which these remarks are selected almost at random, are meant as parody, 
in which case they serve as witness to, rather than evidence for, the 
pervasive self-delusion of our highly conformist and ideologically 
committed society. In American scholarship dealing with the interna¬ 
tional role of the United States, it is often difficult to determine what is
