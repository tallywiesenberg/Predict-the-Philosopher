If the South Vietnamese forces of Prime Minister Ky are so 
inadequate in numbers, intelligence, and training that they cannot 
handle entirely the pacification program in the villages . . . , then 
instead of Americans trying to train, indoctrinate, and pacify an 
alien people, the time is long past due for us to withdraw to our 
coastal bases and eventually from Vietnam. 2 

This reaction echoes that of Senator Symington after a recent 
Asian trip: 

If the South Vietnamese do not achieve this pacification, there is 
no point in this country continuing to pour out lives and treasure 
in order to protect a government that can neither consolidate nor 
control what has been taken from them by their own citizens and 
the North Vietnamese. If the United States decides to become the 
major factor in this pacification program [as it has since be¬ 
come] as well as in the fighting of the war [as it became long 
ago], it can only become an extended war of the white man 
against the Asians, on the mainland of Asia. 3 

Symington’s remarks are no doubt accurate, and if past his¬ 
tory is any guide, they will soon be forgotten, as Americans 
become habituated to the new reality. It was, after all, not very 
long ago that a well-known Asian specialist, with close State 
Department connections, was able to draw the following con¬ 
clusion in a review of Southeast Asian affairs:

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


It is unthinkable that the United States would move into the 
country directly, take over the conduct of the warfare against the 
Vietcong, and attempt to build and manage a government for 
Saigon and the countryside. Apart from other difficulties, this 
would offer convincing proof of the Communist charge of “im¬ 
perialism” daily leveled against our government. For the United 
States to carry the war to the north on any large scale would have 
the same result. 4 

Observe that the date of this evaluation was February 1965; 
as we recall, “convincing proof of the Communist charge of 
imperialism” was not long in coming. And today, there is very 
good reason to suppose that we will find ourselves in “an ex¬ 
tended war of the white man against the Asians, on the main¬ 
land of Asia.”
