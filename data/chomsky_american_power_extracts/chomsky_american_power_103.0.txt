results of this corruption. It comments on the successful attack 
by a guerrilla force on the province capital of Quang Tri on 
April 6, and continues: “A few days later, in a series of events 
that were not fully reported at the time, [the guerrillas] moved 
virtually unmolested into Hue while the army and the national 
police fled”—a remarkable event, its significance indicated by 
the fact that it was kept from the American people at the time 
and still has not been frankly discussed. 

In Saigon itself there are clear indications of the same 
demoralization or widespread involvement in guerrilla activi¬ 
ties. For example, on February 13, 1967, Westmoreland’s head¬ 
quarters in central Saigon were subjected to a mortar attack. As

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


the New York Times points out, with considerable understate¬ 
ment, this attack “gives rise to a question of the popular support 
in Saigon for the South Vietnamese government. ... It seemed 
unlikely to observers that the 81mm. mortar and the shells 
could have been transported to the house, that the roof could 
have been cut and the weapon set up without detection by 
someone in the crowded residential district. Until the shells 
were fired . . . , no one called the police.” 

Current reports confirm, once again, that “every program to 
win the allegiance of the countryside for the South Vietnamese 
government has so far failed, in the opinion of most observers. 
To this day, 80% of the peasantry . . . falls under Vietcong 
influence if not outright control.” 7 The very terminology of this 
report gives some insight into the reasons for the recurrent 
failure; it has yet to be demonstrated that the Americans are 
correct in their unquestioned assumption that the peasants of 
Vietnam are objects, incapable of political expression or alle¬ 
giance, to be “controlled” by one side or the other. The report 
continues: “If the South Vietnamese themselves cannot achieve 
support for the government among their own people, it is un¬ 
likely that ‘giant white foreigners’ will be able to do this for 
them.” Yet it is just this attempt to which we are now reduced, 
with the military takeover. And we can be fairly sure that this 
latest step will lead to new and glorious reports of success, 
before the next rude awakening.
