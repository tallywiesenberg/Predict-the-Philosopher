to “win” the war. They plead that the United States lift the 
tight lid that is clamped on political expression and political 
activity so that a government with some claim to legitimacy can

be established, one that can proceed to make a political settle¬ 
ment with the National Liberation Front. Despite the outra¬ 
geous suppression of Buddhist political activity, the Buddhists 
still appear to be confident, as they have been for years, that 
they can function effectively in cooperation with the NLF. The 
recent “Policy Statement” published by the Overseas Vietna¬ 
mese Buddhist Association emphasizes this (as does the touch¬ 
ing and pathetic book by Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnam: Lotus in 
a Sea of Fire) y and, in fact, puts forth a program for South 
Vietnam that is not markedly different from that of the NLF. 

American authorities have repeatedly indicated that they 
share this assessment of the Saigon government and its popular 
base. Both the present Assistant Secretary of State for Far East¬ 
ern Affairs and his predecessor have expressed their belief that 
neutralization of South Vietnam would lead to a Communist 
takeover, and it is widely admitted that the American expedi¬ 
tionary force was introduced to stave off what was in essence a 
political defeat. In his revealing study of the Vietcong, Ameri¬ 
can foreign service officer Douglas Pike concludes, with ample 
evidence, that the NLF victory in the now long-forgotten civil 
war was essentially a political and organizational victory, 
achieved by building a mass movement. The NLF, he states, is 
the only “truly mass-based political party in South Vietnam.” 
Only the Buddhists—whose political organization was smashed 
in the spring of 1966—could realistically hope to take part in a 
coalition with the NLF, in his judgment. General Richard Stil- 
well, at the time second in command in the Southeast Asian 
theater, informed Senator Young that we are putting down “an 
insurrection,” and even General Westmoreland, who now as¬ 
serts that he has seen no signs of insurrection, admitted to 
Senator Young that the majority of the Vietcong fighting in the 
Mekong Delta were born and reared there 9 —thus indicating that
