withdrawal are simply proposing that we eliminate this threat, 
as only we can do. 

It is hardly surprising that the peasantry refuses allegiance to 
a constituent assembly that could muster 3 votes out of 117 for 
the one land-reform measure that was introduced, or that even 
the residents of Saigon are less than enthusiastic about a gov¬ 
ernment so unbelievably corrupt that the secretary of industry 
in Ky’s cabinet seems to be the major supplier of drugs to the 
Vietcong—of course, after receiving a third of a million dollars 
in kickbacks from the American and West German suppliers. 14 
Nor is it obscure why the American government continues to 
use its military force to impose on the people of Vietnam the 
regime of the most corrupt, most reactionary elements in Viet¬ 
namese society. There is simply no one else who will do its 
bidding, and resist the overwhelming popular sentiment for 
peace and, no doubt, neutralism. The United States government 
has on occasion indicated that it would not leave if asked to do 
so “by a left-wing or even neutralist government that, in the 
U.S. view, did not reflect the true feelings of the South Vietna¬ 
mese people or military leaders.” 15 Furthermore, it will see to it 
that no such government will arise, and that no such opinions 
will be publicly expressed. Thus in the last few months, reports 
from South Vietnam indicate that once again a Buddhist at¬ 
tempt to establish a legal political organization were frustrated 
and the leaders arrested (Kahin memorandum, cited above, 
note 8). 

Jean Raffaelli, the one Western correspondent who has re¬ 
mained in North Vietnam, has observed that quite apart from

The Logic of Withdrawal 


any question of politics, there is a human element of grandeur 
in the resistance of the Vietnamese to the assault launched 
against them by the world's most advanced technology. In Le 
Monde, a North Vietnamese doctor “of international reputa¬ 
tion” is quoted as saying: 

... the Americans have demolished everything. All that we have 
built since 1954 is in ruins: hospitals, schools, factories, new 
dwellings. We have nothing more to lose, except for independence 
and liberty. But to safeguard these, believe me, we are ready to 
endure anything.
