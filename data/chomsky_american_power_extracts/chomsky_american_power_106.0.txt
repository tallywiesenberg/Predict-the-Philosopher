constitute a significant proportion of the bombing. 

The political situation remains as before. Elections have been 
held to legitimize the existing regime in American eyes, at least. 
To ensure the proper result, the only avowed “peace candidate,” 
Au Truong Thanh, was ruled off the ballot, as was the candi¬ 
date most likely to be a threat at the polls, General Minh (he 
had previously been barred from the country). “Communists” 
and “neutralists” were excluded by electoral law. In the sena¬ 
torial elections, tickets associated with Tri Quang Buddhists 
were excluded as “proneutralist,” and the trade-union ticket was 
eliminated because “one candidate lacked certification of his 
legal status.” 21 As anticipated, “the candidates are generally an 
aristocratic and urban group,” including few villagers—“about 
90% of them live within Saigon or the surrounding province of

Gia Dinh.” 22 The shenanigans involved in deciding who “won” 
the senatorial elections defy description. 23 Although a number 
of American political scientists declared themselves satisfied 
(recalling Dean Rusk’s description of the May 1965 provincial 
elections as “free elections ... by our standards”), the special 
committee of the South Vietnamese Constituent Assembly rec¬ 
ommended to invalidate; the decision was reversed by a vote of 
58-43 in the full Assembly, under police guard, with the director 
of the national police, General Loan, and his armed bodyguards 
conspicuously in the gallery. Phan Khac Suu, the conservative 
landowner who was Assembly Speaker, refused to announce the 
result, saying, “I am absolutely unwilling to accept the ver¬ 
dict.” 24 Shortly after the elections, Truong Dinh Dzu, who sur¬ 
prised everyone by speaking of peace and who placed second in 
the balloting, was arrested. Also arrested was Au Truong 
Thanh, “by 79 armed men in combat gear” led by General 
Loan. 25 Among the charges: he had applied for an exit visa to 
the United States. “It is up to him to explain why he wants to 
go abroad,” stated General Loan. After being held for eighteen 
hours, he was returned to house arrest, where apparently he 
remains, though it is difficult to obtain information. On Novem¬ 
ber 3, the Saigon government freed 6,270 prisoners in an 
amnesty, including 4,320 “Vietcong suspects,” most of them 
peasants, and 1,120 “political detainees”—“persons who have 
been held, usually without trial, for periods up to three years.” 
A ranking official said, “It’s safe to say that only a tiny fraction 
of the total was released Wednesday.” The government refuses
