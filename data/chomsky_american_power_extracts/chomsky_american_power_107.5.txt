retired professor who is “somewhat to the right in the spectrum 
of Saigon intellectuals.” 34 The problem, he states, is that “at 
this point the only intellectuals of character who have com¬ 
mitted themselves are on the other side.” Ho Chi Minh retains 
his popularity, because “he bridged the gap between Vietnam 
and the modern world.” “Everyone knows and admires Ho.” 
The only hope, as the professor sees it, is for the United States 
to put aside pretense and to appoint a new “governor or pro- 
consul for Vietnam.” 

As far as the military situation is concerned, Senator Mans¬ 
field, one of the best-informed members of the Senate on South¬ 
east Asian affairs, concluded after General Westmoreland’s recent 
reports in Washington that he saw “very little, if anything, in 
the pattern of combat operations to indicate any weakening of 
the ability of the Vietcong to keep on fighting.” He believes that 
the NLF remains “the dominant force in South Vietnam,” and 
points out that its “stronghold” in the Mekong Delta “has hardly 
been touched.” The Front, rather than Hanoi, is “the main fac¬ 
tor to be considered in South Vietnam.” 35 

There are, to be sure, certain “pacified” areas, some even with 
few American troops; for example, much of Tay Ninh Province, 
where the Cao Dai is quite strong. But it is interesting to inves¬ 
tigate the details of this success in “pacification.” Elizabeth 
Pond reports that the basis appears to be “a certain accommo¬ 
dation between the Cao Dai and the Viet Cong.” 36 Among the 
Cao Dai intellectuals, the heroes remain those who advocated 
neutralism—particularly, the former “Cao Dai Pope,” Pham 
Cong Tac, who was exiled under Diem. By some, “the only one 
who has carried on the tradition of Pham Cong Tac” is consid¬ 
ered to be Major Nguyen Thanh Mung, who joined the Viet¬ 
cong with his Cao Dai troops. The relation between this model

mistrust, according to this report. 

There has been no more revealing commentary on the situa¬ 
tion in the American-controlled areas of South Vietnam than 
the testimony elicited by Congressman Donald Riegle from 
Rutherford Poats, in May 1967, released in September. 37
