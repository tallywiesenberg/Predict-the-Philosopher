Mr. Poats had been, for the preceding three years, “the No. 1 
man overseeing our economic program, the so-called ‘other war’ 
in Vietnam,” and had just been promoted to deputy director of 
the Agency for International Development. According to this 
testimony, as Congressman Riegle reports it, “the annual U.S. 
commodity import program in Vietnam is actually a political 
ransom paid to powerful South Vietnamese commercial inter¬ 
ests to insure political stability in South Vietnam, and insure 
their continued support of the war.” Poats agreed with Con¬ 
gressman Riegle’s summary statement that “if we were to with¬ 
draw our AID program, ... the government would likely col¬ 
lapse over there, and for all intents and purposes the war would 
be over,” and that “if this war were conducted in a way that 
required greater economic sacrifices by certain elements in 
Vietnam, the political instability is such that the country might 
fly apart.” The situation is such that “there would not be mili¬ 
tary action by the Vietnamese military forces today had it not 
been for our provision of commercial imports,” because of the 
resulting “inflation, disruption, and loss of morale.” He also 
agreed that “there is certainly a substantial element of truth” in 
Congressman Riegle’s judgment that without the “ransom,” 
commercial interests in South Vietnam would “get their sympa¬ 
thizers out in the streets and bring down the Government” 
(though he felt this judgment to be “harsh”). Congressman 
Riegle concludes that “if we cannot establish some sort of bal-

ance between self-sufficiency . . . versus a growing dependency, 
then we will never get out of this situation. We will be mired 
down there forever. 5 ’ He adds that “all the evidence that piles 
up on the military side and on the nonmilitary side” shows a 
growing dependency. According to Mr. Poats, “that is certainly 
a danger, and in some instances a fair conclusion.” It would 
follow, then, if this assessment is accurate, that “we will be 
mired down there forever.” 

One might compare this testimony with a report by the 
French resident minister in 1897: 

[The only collaborators are] intriguers, disreputable or ignorant, 
whom we [the French] had rigged out with sometimes high 
ranks, which became tools in their hands for plundering the 
country without scruple. . . . Despised, they possessed neither the
