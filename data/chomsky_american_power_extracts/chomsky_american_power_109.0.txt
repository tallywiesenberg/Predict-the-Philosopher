This agony is shared by the most perceptive observers of the 
Vietnam tragedy, even those who are basically in support of the 
American military intervention. Bernard Fall, for example, in 
one of his last articles warned that “it is Viet-Nam as a cultural 
and historic entity which is threatened with extinction,” as “the 
countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military 
machine ever unleashed on an area of this size.” 42 It is ap¬ 
palling beyond words that we permit this to continue. 

When one tries to see what lies behind the official govern¬ 
ment reports, this is the sort of picture that emerges. Of course, 
it is not the picture that the government seeks to present, nor 
the one that it succeeds, by and large, in presenting, given the

enormous propaganda apparatus at its command. It is to the 
great credit of the American press that it does still provide 
information on the basis of which one who is willing to put in 
the time and effort can arrive at some understanding of what is 
taking place in Vietnam. But we must recognize that valuable 
as this is, it has little bearing on the state of American democ¬ 
racy, since the opportunity to do the research that is required to 
separate fact from propaganda is limited to a privileged few. 

In the light of what we have seen in the past three years, it is 
difficult to become excited over such matters as the ambiguity, 
or duplicity, of the American government position on the Gen¬ 
eva agreements, or the numerous violations of domestic and 
international law that have accompanied our intervention in the 
internal affairs of Vietnam. Nevertheless, these matters, and in 
particular the reaction as they have become too clear to over¬ 
look, are quite revealing for anyone concerned with the Ameri¬ 
can war in Vietnam and its implications for the future. It was, 
at one time, quite normal to denounce the “Communists” for 
their disregard of international law and treaty obligations. Now, 
how r ever, many Americans tend to scoff at such matters as irrele¬ 
vant, unrealistic. Suddenly, the Constitution and the system of 
treaties to which we have committed ourselves—the United Na¬ 
tions Charter in particular—have become “outmoded,” inap¬ 
propriate to the complexities of current history, which require a 
powerful executive, free to react with overwhelming military 
force to real or alleged “emergencies” and “attacks”—such as
