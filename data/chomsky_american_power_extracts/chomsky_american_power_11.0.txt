It is easy to see why Caballero was 
not attracted by this bold scheme, given his reliance on the 
eventual backing of the Western democracies.On the basis of 
what we know today, however, Jackson’s summary dismissal of 
revolutionary war is much too abrupt.Furthermore, Bertoni’s observations from the Huesca front 
are borne out by much other evidence, some of it cited earlier.Even those who accepted the Communist strategy of discipline 
and central control as necessary concede that the repressions 
that formed an ineliminable part of this strategy “tended to 
break the fighting spirit of the people .” 110 One can only specu¬ 
late, but it seems to me that many commentators have seriously 
underestimated the significance of the political factor, the po¬ 
tential strength of a popular struggle to defend the achieve¬ 
ments of the revolution.It is perhaps relevant that Asturias, the 
one area of Spain where the system of CNT-UGT committees 
was not eliminated in favor of central control, is also the one 
area where guerrilla warfare continued well after Franco’s vic¬ 
tory.
