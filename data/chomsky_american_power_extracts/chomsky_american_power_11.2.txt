118 I have already 
cited a good deal of evidence indicating that the repression 
conducted by the Popular Front seriously weakened popular 
commitment and involvement in the antifascist war.What was 
evident to George Orwell was also clear to the Barcelona work¬ 
ers and the peasants in the collectivized villages of Aragon: the 
liberal-Communist coalition would not tolerate a revolutionary 
transformation of Spanish society; it would commit itself fully 
to the anti-Franco struggle only after the old order was firmly 
re-established, by force, if necessary.119 

There is little doubt that farm workers in the collectives un¬ 
derstood quite well the social content of the drive towards con¬ 
solidation and central control.We learn this not only from an¬ 
archist sources but also from the socialist press in the spring of 
1937.On May 1, the Socialist party newspaper Adelante had 
the following to say: 

At the outbreak of the Fascist revolt the labor organizations and 
the democratic elements in the country were in agreement that 
the so-called Nationalist Revolution, which threatened to plunge 
our people into an abyss of deepest misery, could be halted only 
by a Social Revolution.
