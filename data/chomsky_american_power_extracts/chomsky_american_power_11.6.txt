Although British neutrality is still maintained, the patrol of the 
Strait and the closing of the harbor will aid the military Rebels 
because Loyalist warships cannot attempt to take Algeciras, now 
in Rebel hands, and completely isolate the Rebels from Morocco .The Rebels now can release some troops, who were rushed back 
to Algeciras, for duty further north in the drive for Madrid.It was reported in Gibraltar tonight that the Rebels had sent a 
transport across the Strait and had landed more troops from 
Morocco for use in the columns that are marching northward 
from headquarters at Seville.This was the second time this year that Britain warned a power 
when she believed her measure of Mediterranean control was 
threatened, and it remains to be seen w r hether the Madrid GovÂ¬ 
ernment will flout the British as the Italians did.If it attempts to 
do so, the British gunners of the Gibraltar fort have authority to 
fire warning shots.
