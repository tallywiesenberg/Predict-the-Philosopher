I have quoted this dispatch in full because it conveys rather 
accurately the character of British “neutrality” in the early 
stages of the war and thenceforth.In May 1938, the British 
ambassador to Spain, Sir Henry Chilton, “expressed the convic¬ 
tion that a Franco victory was necessary for peace in Spain; 
that there was not the slightest chance that Italy and/or Ger¬ 
many would dominate Spain; and that even if it were possible 
for the Spanish Government to win (which he did not believe) 
he was convinced that a victory for Franco would be better for 
Great Britain.” 129 Churchill, who was at first violently opposed 
to the Republic, modified his position somewhat after the crush¬ 
ing of the revolution in the summer of 1937.What particularly 
pleased him was the forceful repression of the anarchists and 
the militarization of the Republic (necessary when “the entire 
structure of civilization and social life is destroyed,” as it had 
been by the revolution, now happily subdued).130 However, 
his good feelings towards the Republic remained qualified.In 
an interview of August 14, 1938, he expressed himself as follows:
