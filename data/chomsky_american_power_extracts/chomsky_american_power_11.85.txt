One can only speculate as to what might have been the 
effects of British support for the Republic.A discussion of this 
matter would take us far afield, into a consideration of British 
diplomacy during the late 1930s.It is perhaps worth mention,

time, perhaps in a year, perhaps in two, the conservative ele¬ 
ments in this country will be looking to Germany as the bul¬ 
wark against Communism in Europe.
