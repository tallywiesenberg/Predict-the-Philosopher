Technically, the United States 
adhered to a position of strict neutrality.However, a careful 
look raises some doubts.According to information obtained by 
Jackson, “the American colonel who headed the Telephone 
Company had placed private lines at the disposal of the Madrid 
plotters for their conversations with Generals Mola and 
Franco,” 137 just prior to the insurrection on July 17.In August,, 
the American government urged the Martin Aircraft Company 
not to honor an agreement made prior to the insurrection to 
supply aircraft to the Republic, and it also pressured the Mexi¬ 
can government not to reship to Spain war materials purchased 
in the United States.138 An American arms exporter, Robert 
Cuse, insisted on his legal right to ship airplanes and aircraft 
engines to the Republic in December 1936, and the State De¬ 
partment was forced to grant authorization.
