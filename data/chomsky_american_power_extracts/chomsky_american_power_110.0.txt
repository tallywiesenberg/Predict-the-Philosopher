AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS

territorial integrity” for all of Vietnam. Apparently, the United 
States had no intention of fulfilling its Geneva commitment, a 
fact that is admitted with remarkable frankness. For example, 
the Honorable Kenneth T. Young, Director of Southeast Asian 
Affairs in the State Department from 1954 to 1958, writes that 
in 1954 “our aim was an independent South Vietnam with a 
strong government responsive to the nationalist aspirations of 
the population.” 44 Thus our aim was to violate our commitment 
at Geneva. This aim was part of our general program of “trying 
to safeguard South Vietnam as part of the ‘retainment’ of all or 
most of non-communist Asia,” “of helping the Vietnamese to 
create stability, security and prosperity south of the 17th paral¬ 
lel” so as “to deter aggression and subversion from the North”— 
all in violation of our commitment at Geneva to a unified Viet¬ 
nam, with supervised elections in 1956. Obviously one could 
hardly have supposed that “North Vietnam,” prior to the 
scheduled elections in 1956, would carry out “aggression and 
subversion,” and as events were to prove, nothing occurred in 
those years that could even remotely be construed in such 
terms, despite the Diemist repression and Diem's refusal (with 
our support) to undertake the 1955 consultations that were 
provided for by the Geneva accords. 

Secretary Dulles, it will be recalled, went still further in his 
aims, as when he advised the French ambassador, prior to the 
conference, that “above all, the deltas of the Red and Mekong 
rivers must be retained as bases from which a counterattack 
could recover what was lost to the Viet Minh at the conference 
table.” 45 It would be interesting, though probably impossible, 
to trace the ways in which the United States and its Saigon ally 
acted on this concept. Bernard Fall claims, on what evidence he 
does not say, that “constantly since 1956” small saboteur groups 
have been parachuted or infiltrated into North Vietnam, though
