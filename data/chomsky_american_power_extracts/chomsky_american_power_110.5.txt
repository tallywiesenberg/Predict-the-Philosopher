“the casualty rate is very high and successes, if any, are few and 
far between.” 40 Richard Goodwin dates these attempts from 
1958. 47 Recall that even according to American propaganda, 
“There was no serious threat [in South Vietnam] until 1959-60, 
when North Vietnam set in motion a systematic effort to seize 
control of South Vietnam by force.” 48 In fact, the American 
government claims only that infiltration of trained South Viet¬ 
namese cadres began in 1959; even just prior to the American 
takeover of the war in early 1965, surveys of Vietcong prisoners 
and defectors found “most native South Vietnamese guerrillas 
unaware of any North Vietnamese role in the war, except as a 
valued ally.” 49 A comparative study of the success of the South 
Vietnamese commandos in North Vietnam and the Northern- 
trained South Vietnamese cadres sent to South Vietnam in the 
1960s might provide an interesting commentary on some of the 
strange ideas about “revolutionary guerrilla war” that appear in 
current American propaganda. 

It is curious, incidentally, that today only the United States 
and the “.Communists” insist that South Vietnam is a separate 
and independent entity. The Saigon authorities maintain, in 
article 1 of the new constitution, that “Vietnam [not South 
Vietnam] is a territorially indivisible, unified, and independent 
republic,” of which they claim to be the rulers; article 107 of the 
constitution specifies that article 1 cannot be amended. Hence 
in their view, even if Ho Chi Minh were to have sent his entire 
army to South Vietnam, he would not have been guilty of “ag¬ 
gression,” but only of insurrection and subversion. 

There is, however, a much more dangerous development than 
the falsification and cynicism of the American government with 
respect to its international commitments and to domestic and 
international law, namely, the tolerance by even enlightened 
American opinion of the notion that we have a perfect right to

the development of social and political institutions of our choice 
in that unfortunate country. It is shameful but undeniable that 
the turmoil over the war in the United States would never have
