“to strengthen the police and security forces and other institu¬ 
tions contributing to a modern police state” in South Viet¬ 
nam. 50 One is no longer even surprised to read the recommen¬ 
dation, from a knowledgeable and quite liberal correspondent, 
that “The United States ought to send [to Vietnam] the best 
people it has, at this sensitive business of political reorienta¬ 
tion,” so that the field will not be left to the NLF. 61 As he 
points out, our Vietnamese “are playing a power game, both 
locally and in Saigon, for their own special privileges and inter¬ 
est,” and they have “little but contempt for the villagers.” 
Therefore, we must find a way to win allegiance for them 
among the peasantry. Imagine how Saville Davis would react 
on reading such a recommendation in Pravda . Both he and his 
readers take for granted, however, that the United States has 
the right to carry out “political reorientation” (not to speak of 
the right to use military force) anywhere in the world. 

The Vietnamese revolutionaries may or may not succeed in 
freeing their country from American domination, but they have 
already succeeded in shattering American complacency with 
regard to our international role. American power is so great that 
no outside force can call us to account; hence the overwhelming 
urgency of the effort to overcome the effects of a generation of 
indoctrination and a long history of self-adulation. We will 
simply compound the tragedy of Vietnam if we do not exploit 
this opportunity to break loose from the stranglehold of ideol-

the values we pretend to hold. 

The first step towards political sanity must be intensive self- 
examination, exposure not only of what we do and what we 
represent in the world today, but also of the attitudes that color 
and distort our perception of our international behavior. A re¬ 
markable expression of these attitudes appears in a deservedly 
famous article by Neil Sheehan, written on his return from 
three years as a war correspondent in Vietnam. 52 From his 
direct observations, he concludes that “for its own strategic and 
political ends, the United States is . . . protecting a non-Com- 
munist Vietnamese social structure that cannot defend itself 
and that perhaps does not deserve to be defended.” “Idealism 
and dedication are largely the prerogative of the enemy”; “in 
Vietnam, only the Communists represent revolution and social
