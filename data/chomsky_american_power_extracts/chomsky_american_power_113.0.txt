The Logic of Withdrawal 


What is important in such statements as this is not the under¬ 
current of racism—though that is bad enough—but rather the 
notion that we are “easy prey” to these yellow dwarves with 
their pocket knives. Obviously, we are “easy prey” to them only 
in their countries, where we have a perfect right to be. 

Why do we have this right? The answer has been given by 
many statesmen and scholars: It is in our national interest. 
President Johnson has expressed the matter quite clearly on 
occasion, for example, in the following statement (November 2, 
1966): 

There are three billion people in the world and we have only 200 
million of them. We are outnumbered 15 to one. If might did 
make right they would sw T eep over the United States and take 
what we have. We have what they want. 

Consequently, “we are going to have to stand and say: 'Might 
doesn't make right' ”—as we are doing in South Vietnam, for 
example. Or in Guatemala, where according to Guatemalan 
Vice-President Marroquin Rojas, “American planes based in 
Panama take part in military operations in Guatemala” in which 
“napalm is frequently used in zones suspected of serving as 
refuge for the rebels.'' 58 

When President Johnson pleads that we are defending our¬ 
selves against a superior force, that we must stand in Vietnam 
or else they will “sweep over the United States and take what 
we have,” he is, unfortunately, representing a substantial, prob¬ 
ably dominant body of American opinion. To us today, it may 
seem difficult to understand how it could be seriously believed, 
thirty years ago, that a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy was threat¬ 
ening the survival of Germany, the bearer of the spiritual values 
of Western civilization. 59 To others today, it may be equally 
difficult to take seriously the picture of the strongest, richest 
nation on earth cowering in terror behind its missiles and nu-
