the Vietnamese from their American saviours.” 61 The IVS 
group paints a grim picture of the consequences of our military 
intervention in Vietnam, in terms that are not unfamiliar to 
readers of the American press. Their resignation was intended 
as a protest against policies which, they predict, can only serve 
to drive still more of the population into association with the 
NLF. They assert that our “commitment” in Vietnam has al¬ 
ways been to one element of Vietnamese society, “the urban- 
educated group, which has felt that a noncommunist, inde¬ 
pendent government would best serve their interests and the 
interests of their compatriots in the rural villages of South Viet¬ 
nam.” That we had a right to make such a commitment and to 
act on it is not questioned in their statement. The “tragedy 
unfolding in Vietnam” to which Senator Morton refers is that 
we were unable to realize this commitment, to construct a 
stable government that would represent the interests of the 
Vietnamese, as these interests are interpreted by “the urban- 
educated group.” 

No one would question the sincerity or dedication of the IVS 
leaders, or their undoubted contributions in their work in South 
Vietnam. But there is every reason to question their assumption 
that we have the right to restructure and organize South Viet¬ 
namese society, by force if necessary (their resignation came in 
the fall of 1967), along lines that we have set. In essence, their 
position is not different from that of Lord Cornwallis, whose 
“permanent settlement” in India in 1793 restructured village 
society, creating a landed aristocracy on the British pattern.

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his belief that this 
civilized arrangement could only benefit the Indians in the long 
run. Of course, the new squirearchy also happened to serve 
British interests; as the British Governor-General Lord William 
Bentinck put it: “If security was wanting against popular 
tumult or revolution, I should say that the 'permanent settle¬ 
ment’ . . . has this great advantage ... of having created a vast 
body of rich landed proprietors deeply interested in the con¬ 
tinuance of British Dominion and having complete command 
over the mass of the people” (1829). Our reasons for wanting to 
control Vietnam are not those of the British in India in 1829, but
