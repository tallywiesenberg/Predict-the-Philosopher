able level, to a stage where our economy and society can hardly 
bear the cost. In this respect, it is true, Vietnam is an aberration. 
In all other respects it is a natural consequence of the policy that 
was described three quarters of a century ago by Brooks Adams, 
in prophetic words, when he proclaimed: “Our geographical posi¬ 
tion, our wealth, and our energy pre-eminently fit us to enter 
upon the development of Eastern Asia and to reduce it to part of 
our economic system.” The suppression of the movement for 
Philippine independence, shortly after, was only the first attempt 
to put into practice the policy of reducing Eastern Asia to part 
of our economic system. At that time, we were defending Chris¬ 
tianity from the savage Moros. Now, we are defending the free 
world from the International Communist Conspiracy. In other

respects, little has changed, except for the scale of our attack. 

Again, the example of the Philippine war illustrates the need 
to turn our attention from the problems of Southeast Asia to 
those of the United States—to the ideological commitments on 
which American initiatives are based, and the national self- 
image that permits them to be tolerated with such equanimity; 
in particular, the unshakable belief in American goodwill and 
generosity that persists through each calamity—notably, among 
the self-styled “hardheaded and pragmatic liberals”—and that 
stultifies political thinking and debases political discourse. We 
can, for example, learn a great deal about the sources of Ameri¬ 
can Vietnamese policy by observing how American scholarship 
comes to terms with the suppression of the Philippine struggle 
for independence—in which, incidentally, there were well over 
100,000 Filipino casualties. Thus Louis Halle argues that “we 
could not hand the Philippines back to the Spanish tyranny, 
and they were in no condition to govern themselves or encom¬ 
pass their own defense. If we simply got out and came home we 
would leave chaos behind,” with the Germans and Japanese 
lurking in wait. Therefore, the United States, “having inad¬ 
vertently become responsible for the Philippines, had no alter¬ 
native to assuming, itself, the obligation of governing and 
defending what consequently became the first item of an Ameri¬ 
can overseas empire.” 63
