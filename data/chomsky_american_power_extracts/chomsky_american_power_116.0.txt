*= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

man, in his recently published study of policy making under the 
Kennedy administration, To Move a Nation, discusses the at¬ 
tempt to concentrate the peasantry in “strategic hamlets” in the 
early 1960s, maintaining that “the primary role of the strategic 
hamlet was to provide [the peasants] ... a free choice between 
the Viet Cong and the government.” As he makes very clear, 
this “free choice” was to be provided by careful police work 
inside the hamlets (“for it seemed obvious that putting up de¬ 
fenses around a village would do no good if the defenses en¬ 
closed Viet Cong agents”); the failure of the program he at¬ 
tributes to the fact that “there had been no real effort to isolate 
the population from the Viet Cong by eliminating Viet Cong 
agents and supporters inside the strategic hamlets and by im¬ 
posing controls on the movement of people and supplies . . . 
Viet Cong supporters and agents . . . had no difficulty repene¬ 
trating the hamlet and continuing subversion.” Thus the pro¬ 
gram failed “to provide the villager with physical security, so 
that he has a choice of refusing to cooperate with the Viet Cong,” 
a “free choice” which is obviously denied him as long as Viet- 
cong supporters are permitted to exist in his village. 

There is no doubt an important difference between this level 
of self-deception and that of Marshal Ky, who describes the 
philosophy of his government as “100 percent social revolu¬ 
tionary,” 68 or CIA analyst George Carver, who tells us of “the 
genuine social revolution now taking place in the urban areas of 
South Vietnam.” 69 The natural reaction to such pronounce¬ 
ments is one of ridicule, but amusement fades when one begins 
to calculate the human cost. 

Let us return to Howard Zinn’s study (cf. note 1), in the light 
of some of these general observations. Zinn has some apt re¬ 
marks about the moral blindness that permits America to re¬ 
main insensitive to the agony of Vietnam. “We listen with the
