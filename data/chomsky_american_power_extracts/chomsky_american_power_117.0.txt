cies: strengthening the Western alliance and rearming Ger¬ 
many, expanding the nuclear arsenal, stemming popular revolu¬ 
tions in the Third World and subverting or strangling those that 
had taken place. Similarly, it is not easy to convince oneself that 
the director of the CIA, Allen Dulles, really believed that Mos¬ 
sadegh was willfully “creating a Communist state,” or that Assis¬ 
tant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas Mann 
was so woefully ignorant of world affairs as to suppose that the 
Dominican revolution in 1965 resulted from the machinations of 
a “Sino-Soviet military bloc.” Rather, one must adapt to current 
styles of acceptable international behavior. It would not do to 
use today the phraseology of Secretary of State Philander Knox, 
who sent marines into Cuba in 1908 saying that “the United 
States does not undertake first to consult the Cuban Government 
if a crisis arises requiring a temporary landing somewhere.” And 
in general, the “international Communist conspiracy” is a perfect 
propaganda device to justify actions that reinforce and extend 
American hegemony, serving our aims just as “bourgeois influ¬ 
ence and American scheming” serve those of Russian imperial¬ 
ism. In both cases there is, of course, a background of fact that

gives a superficial plausibility to the fabrications of the propa¬

Similarly, I think that Zinn does not go far enough in analyz¬ 
ing the justification for the war given by the dissatisfied liberals, 
a very important matter if one hopes to construct a domestic 
political base for a policy of disengagement in Vietnam, or 
more generally, for a significant reorientation of American in¬ 
ternational behavior away from the policy of repression and 
“restructuring” on American terms, disguised as “anti-Commu- 
nism” and “preservation of order.” I have already given a num¬ 
ber of illustrations of the ideological blinders that must be re¬ 
moved before sensible discussion can even begin. Others can 
easily be added. 

Consider, for example, Richard Goodwin’s essay, cited in 
note 47. Goodwin constructs a powerful argument against the 
war, but concludes nevertheless that the war is ultimately justi¬ 
fied, in part on grounds of American self-interest, in part be¬ 
cause of the necessity for “protecting Asia from dominion or 
conquest by a hostile power.” As to the first, “the bedrock vital
