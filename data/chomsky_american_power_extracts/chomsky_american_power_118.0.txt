benevolence, with its various corollaries (“the politics of inad¬ 
vertence,” “the inscrutability of history”), is a major factor that 
stands in the way of the realistic and common-sense proposal 
that Zinn advocates.

The Logic of Withdrawal 


liberals. Goodwin, for example, is too sophisticated to accept 
the Munich analogy, but he goes on to offer a revealing coun¬ 
terthesis. He argues, first of all, that in Vietnam we are combat¬ 
ting not aggression but “internal aggression”—an interesting 
phrase, which refers apparently to “aggression” by a revolution¬ 
ary movement against a government maintained in power by 
foreign arms. And he concludes that what we face is not 
Munich but rather “another episode ... in a long, continuing 
conflict.” Other episodes include our “success” in Greece and 
Turkey, Soviet intervention in Cuba, the invasion of Korea, the 
bombing of Quemoy and Matsu, subversion in the Congo and 
the Central African Republic, fighting in Malaya and the Phil¬ 
ippines and on the Indian border. And now, he adds, “they are 
beginning in Thailand.” 

But with whom are we engaged in this “long, continuing 
conflict”? Certainly not the Soviet Union, which had little to do 
with the Sino-Indian border dispute; nor China, which did not 
start the civil war in Greece; nor Ho Chi Minh, who, for all his 
sins, is not responsible for subversion in the Congo. Nor is 
“international Communism” a very convincing devil, in the 
wake of the Sino-Soviet split, gestures of independence in East¬ 
ern Europe and North Korea, the admitted refusal of North 
Vietnam, even in its present desperate straits, to kowtow to its 
powerful allies. In fact, there is no identifiable adversary. We 
are confronted with a mysterious but dangerous force, which 
cannot be located or specified in any concrete terms, but which 
is there, threatening us. While rejecting the Munich analogy, 
Goodwin, the liberal critic, tacitly accepts the assumption on 
which it is based and which gives it great plausibility. For if 
this force exists, then surely we must stop it in Vietnam before 
it lands on the beaches of Florida or Cape Cod. 

The unpleasant fact is that if one wishes to pursue the
