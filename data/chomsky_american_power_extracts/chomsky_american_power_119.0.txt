careful not to reward, is completed with these instances: (1) 
the cancellation of trade contacts with Japan when the Kishi 
government would not allow the Chinese flag to be flown over 
its mission in Tokyo; (2) various unrealized threats to Hong 
Kong, including an appeal “to Nationalist leaders to make a 
deal”; (3) the suppression of the Tibetan revolt; (4) the Sino- 
Indian border crisis; (5) “encouraging the local communists in 
a direct use of military force, first in Laos and then in South 
Vietnam” (pp. 288 f.). 

It is not easy to decide which of these is the most telling 
example of Chinese aggression; perhaps Burma, in which, ac¬ 
cording to U Thant in 1965, “there has not been a single in¬ 
stance of outside help to the Burmese Communists,” during a 
period when Chinese Nationalist forces roamed northern Burma 
at great cost to the Burmese. It would also be interesting to 
discover what evidence was available to the director of intelli¬ 
gence for the State Department regarding Chinese control, or 
even material assistance, in the cases of Thailand, Malaya, and 
the Philippines—and also to discover why this evidence has 
never been made public. “Chinese aggression” in Indochina, in 
contrast to the responsible and purely defensive posture of the 
Western powers, is of course well documented. As to Laos, 
Hilsman himself repeats much of the well-known story of the 
American attempt to subvert the legitimate government, replac¬ 
ing it by “pro-Western neutralists” and then a right-wing mili¬ 
tary dictatorship—an attempt which continued until 1962 when 
Kennedy, in a dramatic and sensible reversal of policy, agreed 
finally to support the neutralist elements that had previously 
been backed only by the Communist powers. Quite revealing in 
this connection is Hilsman’s judgment that the real Communist

“threat” in Laos “seems more likely to have been an expansion 
of political control based on winning peasant support in the 
villages” (p. 112)—a threat rather like that posed by the 1954 
Geneva agreements, which, the Vietminh thought, “would give 
them half of Vietnam for sure and an excellent opportunity to 
win the other half through political subversion,” i.e., an elec¬ 
toral victory (p. 103). 

Hilsman also has relevant comments on the Sino-Indian 
border dispute. He observes (p. 322) that “the Indians un¬ 
wisely provided the Chinese ample provocation by adopting a
