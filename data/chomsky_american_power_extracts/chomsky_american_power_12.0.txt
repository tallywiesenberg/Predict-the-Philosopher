6. “The Making of a Dove,” The Progressive , 1968, distributed by 
Vietnam Information Project, 100 Maryland Avenue N.E., Washing¬ 
ton, D.C. 20002. This project consists of a group of returned IVS 
workers who are trying to bring to the attention of the American 
people some of the facts about what is happening in the villages of 
Vietnam. They are, in fact, the only Americans who have significant 
firsthand information about this matter. They are to be contrasted 
with the visiting political scientists who seem to believe that interviews 
with captured prisoners or defectors give a fair account of attitudes in 
rural Vietnam. It is worth mentioning that the IVS workers were, as a 
group, more or less committed to the American effort, and even after 
resigning in protest against what they had seen, did not question our

9. See the memorandum by Gabriel Kolko to the Russell Tribunal, 
quoted in Liberation, Vol. 12 (May-June 1967), p. 13. Eisenhower 
regarded this despicable act as “a blot on [the] military honor” of the 
German Commander and warned that he and his cohorts would be 
considered “violators of the laws of war who must face the certain 
consequences of their acts.”

11. All quotes from Rudolf Rocker, “Anarchism and Anarcho-syndi¬ 
calism,” in Paul Eltzbacher, ed., Anarchism (London, Freedom Press, 
1960), pp. 225-68. Equally characteristic of “New Left” thinking is 
the judgment that Rocker quotes from Kropotkin regarding Bolshevik 
Russia: “Russia has shown us the way in which Socialism cannot be 
realized. . . . The idea of workers’ councils for the control of the 
political and economic life of the country is, in itself, of extraordinary 
importance . . . but so long as the country is dominated by the 
dictatorship of a party, the workers’ and peasants’ councils naturally 
lose their significance. They are degraded to the same passive role 
which the representatives of the Estates used to play in the time of the
