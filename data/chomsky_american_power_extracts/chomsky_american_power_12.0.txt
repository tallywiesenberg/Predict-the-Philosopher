Cuse was de¬ 
nounced by Roosevelt as unpatriotic, though Roosevelt was 
forced to admit that the request was quite legal.Roosevelt con¬ 
trasted the attitude of other businessmen to Cuse as follows: 

Well, these companies went along with the request of the Gov¬ 
ernment.There is the 90 percent of business that is honest, I 
mean ethically honest.There is the 90 percent we are always 
pointing at with pride.And then one man does what amounts to 
a perfectly legal but thoroughly unpatriotic act.
