140 There is evidence 
that the American government shared the fears of Churchill 
and others about the dangerous forces on the Republican side.Secretary of State Cordell Hull, for example, informed Roose¬ 
velt on July 23, 1936, that “one of the most serious factors in this 
situation lies in the fact that the [Spanish] Government has 
distributed large quantities of arms and ammunition into the 
hands of irresponsible members of left-wing political organiza¬ 
tions.” 141 

Like Churchill, many responsible Americans began to rethink 
their attitude towards the Republic after the social revolution 
had been crushed.142 However, relations with Franco con¬ 
tinued cordial.In 1957, President Eisenhower congratulated 
Franco on the “happy anniversary” of his rebellion, 143 and Sec¬ 
retary Rusk added his tribute in 1961.Upon criticism, Rusk was 
defended by the American ambassador to Madrid, who ob¬ 
served that Spain is “a nation which understands the implacable 
nature of the communist threat,” 144 like Thailand, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and selected other countries of the Free 
World.
