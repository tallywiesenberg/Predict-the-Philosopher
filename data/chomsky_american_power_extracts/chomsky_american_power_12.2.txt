“In its miserable huts live the poor inhabitants of a poor 
province; eight thousand people, but the streets are not paved, 
the town has no newspaper, no cinema, neither a cafe nor a 
library.On the other hand, it has many churches that have been 
burned.” Immediately after the Franco insurrection, the land 
was expropriated and village life collectivized.“Food, clothing, 
and tools were distributed equitably to the whole population.Money was abolished, work collectivized, all goods passed to- 
the community, consumption was socialized.It was, however, 
not a socialization of wealth but of poverty.” Work continued as 
before.
