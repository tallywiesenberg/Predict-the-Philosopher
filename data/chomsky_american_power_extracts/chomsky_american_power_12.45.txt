The 
same sociologists formulate “the world revolution of the epoch” 
in the following terms: “The major transformation is the decline 
of business (and of earlier social formations) and the rise of 
intellectuals and semi-intellectuals to effective power.” 148 The 
“ultra-left” critic foresaw in these developments a new attack on 
human freedom and a more efficient system of exploitation.The 
Western sociologist sees in the rise of intellectuals to effective 
power the hope for a more humane and smoothly functioning 
society, in which problems can be solved by “piecemeal tech¬ 
nology.” Who has the sharper eye ?At least this much is plain: 
there are dangerous tendencies in the ideology of the welfare 
state intelligentsia who claim to possess the technique and un¬ 
derstanding required to manage our “postindustrial society” and 
to organize an international society dominated by American 
superpower.Many of these dangers are revealed, at a purely 
ideological level, in the study of the counterrevolutionary sub¬ 
ordination of scholarship.The dangers exist both insofar as the 
claim to knowledge is real and insofar as it is fraudulent.
