Insofar 
as the technique of management and control exists, it can be 
used to consolidate the authority of those who exercise it and to 
diminish spontaneous and free experimentation with new social 
forms, as it can limit the possibilities for reconstruction of soci¬ 
ety in the interests of those who are now, to a greater or lesser 
extent, dispossessed.Where the techniques fail, they will be 
supplemented by all of the methods of coercion that modern 
technology provides, to preserve order and stability.For a glimpse of what may lie ahead, consider the Godkin 
lectures of McGeorge Bundy, recently delivered at Harvard.149

^ - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

Bundy urges that more power be concentrated in the executive 
branch of the government, now “dangerously weak in relation 
to its present tasks.” That the powerful executive will act with 
justice and wisdom—this presumably needs no argument.As an 
example of the superior executive who should be attracted to 
government and given still greater power, Bundy cites Robert 
McNamara.
