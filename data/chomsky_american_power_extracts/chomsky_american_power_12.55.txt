Nothing could reveal more clearly the dangers in¬ 
herent in the “new society” than the role that McNamara’s Pen¬ 
tagon has played for the past half-dozen years.No doubt Mc¬ 
Namara succeeded in doing with utmost efficiency that which 
should not be done at all.No doubt he has shown an unparal¬ 
leled mastery of the logistics of coercion and repression, com¬ 
bined with the most astonishing inability to comprehend politi¬ 
cal and human factors.The efficiency of the Pentagon is no less 
remarkable than its pratfalls .150 When understanding fails, 
there is always more force in reserve.
