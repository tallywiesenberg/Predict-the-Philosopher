As the “experiments in 
material and human resources control” collapse and “revolu¬ 
tionary development” grinds to a halt, we simply resort more 
openly to the Gestapo tactics that are barely concealed behind 
the fagade of “pacification .” 151 When American cities explode, 
we can expect the same.The technique of “limited warfare” 
translates neatly into a system of domestic repression—far more 
humane, as will quickly be explained, than massacring those 
who are unwilling to wait for the inevitable victory of the war 
on poverty.Why should a liberal intellectual be so persuaded of the vir¬ 
tues of a political system of four-year dictatorship ?The answer 
seems all too plain.126
