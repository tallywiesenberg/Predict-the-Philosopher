127-34.He observes that “the most profound objection 
to this kind of strategic theory is not its limited usefulness but its 
danger, for it can lead us to believe we have an understanding of 
events and a control over their flow which we do not have.” A still 
more profound objection, I think, is that the pretended objectivity of 
“strategic theory” can be used to justify the attempt to control the flow 
of events.9.Seymour M. Lipset, Political Man (Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday
