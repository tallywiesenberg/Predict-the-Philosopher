comments aptly that “poverty, which is a tragedy in a poor country, 
blights our affluent society with something more than tragedy; being 
unnecessary, it is deeply immoral as well.” He also compares “the 
$904 billion we have spent on military power since World War II” 
with “the $96 billion we have spent, out of our regular national 
budget, on education, health, welfare housing, and community devel¬ 
opment.” In his Challenge to Affluence (New York, Pantheon Books, 
1963), Myrdal concludes that “In society at large there is more equal¬ 
ity of opportunity today than there ever was.But for the bottom layer 
there is less or none” (p. 38).He questions the assumption that 
“America is still the free and open society of its cherished image and 
well-established ideals” and remarks that “as less and less work is 
required of the type that people in the urban and rural slums can offer, 
they will be increasingly isolated and exposed to unemployment and 
plain exploitation.There is an ugly smell rising from the basement of 
the stately American mansion” (p. 49).12.
