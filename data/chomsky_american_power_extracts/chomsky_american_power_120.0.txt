The suggestion that it was the Chinese hard line that was re¬ 
sponsible for the failure of the American policy of subversion in 
Laos is a most interesting one. According to the American re¬ 
porter Arthur Dommen, who appears to be Hilsman’s primary 
source of information on Laos, the Chinese took no action at all 
in Laos until the end of 1959, despite American violations of the 
Geneva agreements by the supplying of arms and military train¬ 
ing by American officers in civilian clothes ; 74 and after that 
their “interference” consisted of offering support for the neutral¬ 
ist Souvanna Phouma government that the United States was 
trying desperately to replace, first by the “pro-Western neutral¬ 
ist” Phoui and then by the outright fascist Phoumi Nosavan. 
However, this is not the point. To Hilsman, the aggressiveness 
of China and Russia is demonstrated by the fact that they sup¬ 
ported the neutralist Souvanna Phouma against the American-

As to the claim that Hanoi decided to begin guerrilla war in 
the South on the basis of Mao Tse-tung’s new hard line, Hils- 
man makes no attempt to substantiate this allegation, which is 
in conflict with whatever is known of the historical record . 75 

Hilsman, recall, was director of intelligence for the State De¬ 
partment and then Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern 
Affairs; he is a Kennedy liberal and an academic expert on 
international affairs. His treatment of historical events and the 
reasoning on which he bases conclusions about such matters as 
“Chinese aggressiveness” can only be described as appalling. Yet 
it represents the best and most sophisticated thinking that is to 
be found near the center of power, so the available information 
indicates. One cannot escape a feeling of alarm on reading 
Hilsman’s study of how policy was set in the Kennedy admin¬ 
istration. 

In discussing Chinese aggressiveness, we must bear in mind 
that there is a clear sense in which China has already shown 
itself to be very aggressive, namely, the following: 

We must recognize that an overt act of war has been committed 
by an enemy when that enemy builds a military force intended
