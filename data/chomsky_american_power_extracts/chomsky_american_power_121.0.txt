varying reactions to the society that is developing. But there is 
nothing to justify our shameful treatment of China in the post¬ 
war years. 

With all the cynicism of the mid-twentieth century, it is nev¬ 
ertheless startling to see how easily the rhetoric of imperialism 
comes to American lips, sometimes muted, sometimes entirely 
overt. Arthur Schlesinger writes that if our killing machine 
achieves a victory in Vietnam, “we may all be saluting the wis-

dom and statesmanship of the American government.” 79 That 
an American military victory might be a tragedy—this is un¬ 
thinkable. Roger Hilsman speaks of “the Korean War, Dien- 
bienphu, the two Laos crises, and Vietnam [as] only the open¬ 
ing guns of what might well be a century-long struggle for 
Asia.” 80 What kind of struggle it will be is clear, if Laos and 
Vietnam are precedents. The foreign editor of Look magazine 
writes: 

The Far East is now our Far West. The western frontier of 
American power today stands on the far side of the Pacific 
Ocean. ... It stretches through the island chain off the Asian 
mainland with three toeholds on the continent, Korea, Vietnam 
and Thailand. . . . We are a Pacific power—the only Pacific 
power. We are there to stay. . . . This is where we have markets 
and, except for Japan, no rival producers. 81 

These sentiments are familiar. It has been a long-standing be¬ 
lief, expressed by Cordell Hull, Henry Wallace, Dean Acheson r 
and many others, that we can escape recurrent economic stag¬ 
nation or internal regimentation only with ever expanding 
markets. These words recall the characteristically direct form¬ 
ulations of Harry Truman, who proclaimed in 1947 (in James 
Warburg’s paraphrase) that “the whole world should adopt the 
American system [which] could survive in America only if it 
became a world system,” 82 noting also that unless the trend 
toward nationalization is reversed, the “American way” and the 
“way of peace” will be threatened. 

And the natural counterpart to this doctrine is neatly ex¬ 
pressed in the 1967 Prize Essay of the United States Naval 
Institute, by Professor Harold Rood of Claremont College, who 
argues as follows:
