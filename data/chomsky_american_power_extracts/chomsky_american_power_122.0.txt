AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


would very likely agree to negotiate the problems of Vietnam 
with a government that would at least respond to its diplomatic 
notes. Just what might emerge from the shattered debris of 
South Vietnamese society, no one can predict with any confi¬ 
dence. It is clear, however, that under the American occupation 
there can be only unending tragedy. A few years ago, the 
Premier of Ceylon commented that “the best form of foreign 
aid the United States can give to small countries is to abstain 
from interfering in their affairs.” As applied to Vietnam, at

Postscript 

Shortly before his death, Bernard Fall told an interviewer the 
story of a Vietnamese who listened to an American general 
boasting of one of the latest victories of the Vietnam campaign. 
“Yes, General, I understand,” said the Vietnamese, “but aren’t 
your victories coming closer and closer to Saigon?” 83 The pre¬

American victories reached Saigon itself. Several months after, 
it seems that the Tet offensive represents a turning point in the 
war. 

For the past decade there have been two versions of the 
tragedy of Vietnam. The first is that of the war correspondents. 
Their message has been that Vietnamese resistance is so deeply 
embedded in the fabric of Vietnamese society that American 
“victory” can be achieved only through annihilation. The sec¬ 
ond is the official story, too familiar to bear repetition. Time 
after time after time the correspondents’ version has been proven 
correct by events. Now, in the wake of the Tet offensive, there 
is only one story. Apart from lonely relics like Joseph Alsop and 
a few Southeast Asian scholars, everyone now seems to under¬ 
stand that there are only two probable endings to the Vietnam
