Robert Shaplen reported from Saigon: 

A dozen separate areas, comprising perhaps sixty or seventy 
blocks, had been totally burned out. These were almost all resi¬ 
dential areas. . . . Most of the damage was the result of rocket 
attacks by American armed helicopters or other planes, though 
some of it had been caused by artillery or ground fighting. ... A 
modern ten-million-dollar textile plant, containing forty thousand 
spindles, was entirely destroyed by bombs because it was sus¬

The correspondent for Le Monde —forced to leave the country 
soon after—reported that

sands of their soldiers without securing a single province or dis¬ 
trict town of significance”—no word from this Southeast Asian 
expert about the means by which this “defeat” was accom¬ 
plished, or its political meaning. 89 American officials on the 
scene manage a somewhat broader view. One official, quoted 
by Charles Mohr, stated: “The Government won the recent 
battles, but it is important to consider how they won. At first
