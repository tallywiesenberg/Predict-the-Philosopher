the Vietcong had won and held everything in some towns ex¬ 
cept the American military compound and a South Vietnamese 
position.” Senator Mansfield is also aware of the realities: “. . . 
the hamlets, villages and the cities are seen to be honeycombed 
with a National Liberation Front infrastructure which has un¬ 
doubtedly existed for many years, which is still intact, and 
which may well be stronger than ever”; there is “not the begin¬ 
ning of a stable political situation” in South Vietnam 90 
In a broadcast from Saigon, Howard Tuchner of NBC stated 
that “there is no doubt that the U.S. military position in Viet¬ 
nam has never been weaker. U.S. officers in Saigon now feel for 
the first time that the United States can lose the war militar¬ 
ily.” 91 The military situation is not widely discussed, but it is 
indicated by a report that “more than 1000 planes and helicop¬ 
ters are reported destroyed or damaged, principally by Russian- 
built 122mm. rockets that have a range of eight miles or more.” 
According to an unidentified congressman, “one-third of the 
U.S. helicopter force in Vietnam has been destroyed or side¬ 
lined indefinitely . . . losses were almost as heavy in fixed wing 
aircraft, particularly in cargo planes.” The Navy is reported to 
have sent a helicopter carrier to the northern part of South 
Vietnam, in the apparent hope that NLF infiltrators will at least 
not succeed in penetrating this sanctuary. 92

In the Mekong Delta, the major cities suffered heavy damage 
—virtual destruction in some instances—as the Americans de¬ 
cided in case after case “to destroy the town in order to save it,” 
in the words of the American major responsible for the victory 
at Ben Tre 93 Still, in April, reports from the countryside are 
confused. However, the general situation is clear from the fact 
that the IVS has withdrawn most of its field workers because of 
“security conditions.” A volunteer reported in February: “The 
number of locations at which we can safely place a volunteer 
have significantly decreased in recent months”; another said 
that “we all knew that security in the countryside was getting 
worse and worse.” 94 According to a South Vietnamese senator, 
Vong A Sang, the government now controls “only one third of 
the country,” the remaining two thirds being occupied by the 
Vietcong 95 The nature of the American war is tersely indicated 
by an American official: “What the Vietcong did was occupy 
the hamlets we pacified just for the purpose of having the allies 
move in and bomb them out. By their presence, the hamlets 
were destroyed.” 96 The same report indicates that in Binh Dinh 
Province—the “showcase” province for pacification—this had
