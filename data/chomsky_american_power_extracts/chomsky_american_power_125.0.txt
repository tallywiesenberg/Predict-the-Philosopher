The Logic of Withdrawal 


Dillin, in the Christian Science Monitor, December 2, 1967, regards 
the book as “sadly incomplete” because it does not draw “conclusions 
about the value of these massive and expensive American efforts.” He 
interprets the book as giving “a mild criticism of the American and 
South Vietnamese roles,” a conclusion which can only amaze anyone 
who has read it, until he realizes that Dillin sees nothing to object to 
in “evacuation and total destruction of four Viet Cong-controlled vil¬ 
lages, including Bensuc,” “a thriving village” of farmers who “were 
healthy and relatively prosperous.” 

John Mecklin {New York Times Book Review, October 29, 1967) 
at least realizes that the reader is likely to feel “violent disgust as the 
enormity of Schell's picture begins to sink in,” and he has to admit 
that “much of Schell's indictment ... is justified, accurate and over¬ 
due.” But he considers it quite unfair; for example, because it fails to 
mention the “monstrous handicaps that plague the United States' 
effort,” specifically, the lack of command authority over the Saigon 
regime (a fact which obviously has no relevance to this purely Ameri¬ 
can operation, conducted without informing the Vietnamese) and “the 
deplorably short tour of duty ... of Americans in Vietnam, making it 
impossible to acquire the kind of experience so badly needed in situa¬ 
tions such as Bensuc.” He thinks, nevertheless, that the book “should 
be required reading in the Pentagon . . . because of its rare pinpointing 
of critical areas where the United States could be doing a better job in 
Vietnam,” presumably, in conducting such operations even more effi¬ 
ciently in the future.
