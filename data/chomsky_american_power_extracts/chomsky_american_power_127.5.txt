domestic opposition and institute the “grim dictatorship” that support¬ 
ers of the American effort were later to deplore, was a clear violation 
of our pledge at Geneva not to use force or threat of force to disturb 
the accords. Secretary Dulles was as candid as Kenneth Young about 
our intention to disregard the Geneva agreements, announcing our 
intention to build up “the truly independent states of Cambodia, Laos 
and southern Vietnam” ( Department of State Bulletin, August 2, 
1954, cited in George M. Kahin and John W. Lewis, The United 
States and Vietnam [New York, The Dial Press, 1967], p. 61). 

It is, incidentally, remarkable that our professed dissatisfaction with 
the accords and announced intention not to observe them is often 
cited today as somehow relieving us from the obligation to honor 
them, as eliminating any onus for this violation.

(New York, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1964), Fall asserts (p. 402) 
that “the infiltration of guerrilla teams” to the North “has been repeat¬ 
edly attempted over the past years and has met with dismal failure. . . . 
Present losses are estimated to run at 85% of the total personnel 
engaged in such operations.” This despite “the air of massive tran¬ 
quillity” that he himself observed in a visit to North Vietnam in the 
fall of 1962, when these operations were in progress: “. . . no guards 
in watchtowers, no airplane patrols. The Hanoi police don’t even carry 
pistols” ( Saturday Evening Post, November 24, 1962, pp. 18-21). Cf. 
the recent eyewitness accounts by David Schoenbrun and others, not¬ 
ing the same phenomenon, which Fall characterizes as “one of the 
most ominous things about North Vietnam.”

from Washington, that the CIA “did in fact deploy saboteurs in the 
North from 1959. They were parachuted in or dropped off the coast 
by patrol boats, and Vice-President Ky commanded the air transport
