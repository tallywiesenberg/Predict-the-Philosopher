wing of the South Vietnam Air Force in 1962 and 1963. He is known 
to have been in charge of the parachute drops. The agents were South 
Vietnamese and were trained by the C.I.A. in Special Forces camps, 
notably the 77th Special Forces Group. The frogmen were trained at 
Da Nang. Apart from destroying bridges and other vulnerable points, 
they were also expected to organize guerrilla warfare, especially in the 
Catholic areas. Both operations were a complete fiasco, 95 per cent 
casualties were admitted in 1963, but the opium trade flourished.” 
Heren’s report goes on to discuss the possible connection between 
these operations and the opium trade, and the reports under investiga¬

the operation for his participation in opium smuggling.
