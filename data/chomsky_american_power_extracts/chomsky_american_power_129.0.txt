Times, June 11, 1967, that “only one officer above the rank of lieuten¬ 
ant colonel did not serve in the French army against the Vietminh in 
the French Indochina war.” Perhaps this is part of the reason why the 
ARVN army has little interest in the war, while “the Vietcong can 
take the same unwilling recruit and turn him into a tiger in six 
months” (American regimental adviser), as it may go part way to¬ 
wards explaining the desertion rates that Randal cites for the elite 
battalions in 1966: 22% for the armed forces as a whole, 31% for the 
rangers, 33% for the marines, and 45% for the airborne battalions. 

54. See Halberstam, op. cit., for some indication of the incredible 
corruption of those to whom he refers as “our Vietnamese.” Their 
cynicism has continually scandalized American reporters. Malcolm 
Browne, for example, reports that Vietnamese military officers have 
ordered hamlets “blown off the map” by American Skyraiders to cover 
cases of graft ( op . cit., p. 210). 

55. Kahin, op. cit. (see note 8), reports that the medical staff of Hue 
hospital estimated that “almost 90% of the w r ar casualties were occa¬ 
sioned by American and South Vietnamese army air bombardments 
and artillery,” and that an American working at Quangnai hospital 
“estimated that about 70% of all civilian war casualties had been 
inflicted by American, South Korean and South Vietnamese aerial 
bombardment and artillery.” Note that these estimates refer to areas 
more or less under American control, w r here victims can hope to reach 
the hospitals. What is amazing is that any substantial number of casu¬ 
alties in such areas are caused by American and allied forces. Even in 
Saigon hospital Kahin saw T many victims of napalm, mostly children— 
he w'as informed by medical students “that it is government policy to 
disperse as widely as possible napalm casualties that are brought to 
hospitals so that visitors will not conclude that there are so many of 
them.” 

American reactions to such discoveries are often astonishing. For 
example, Senator Proxmire inserted into the Congressional Record (May

The Logic of Withdrawal 


26, 1965, S 11799-801) a whitewash of administration policy by Thomas 
Ross in the Chicago Sun-Times, May 23, 1965, to show how real experts 
support the government. Support the government he does. He also points 
out that “the Vietcong have achieved a high degree of immunity” and 
“move freely throughout most of the country with little fear that the local 
populace will betray them to the government.” Military strategy has 
therefore been forced to shift from counterinsurgency to classical war. 
But, he observes, “it is still much too soon to tell whether sophisticated
