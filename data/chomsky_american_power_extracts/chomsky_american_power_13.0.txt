specific vigilance, not just the elaboration of general principles, 
is required from the intellectual community toward specific 
growing dangers to its integrity.” 

Senator Fulbright has developed a similar theme in an im¬ 
portant and perceptive speech. 2 He describes the failure of the 
universities to form “an effective counterweight to the military- 
industrial complex by strengthening their emphasis on the tradi¬ 
tional values of our democracy.” Instead they have “joined the 
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influence.” Specifi¬ 
cally, he refers to the failure of the social scientists, “who ought 
to be acting as responsible and independent critics of the Gov¬ 
ernment’s policies,” but who instead become the agents of these 
policies. “While young dissenters plead for resurrection of the 
American promise, their elders continue to subvert it.” With 
“the surrender of independence, the neglect of teaching, and 
the distortion of scholarship,” the university “is not only failing 
to meet its responsibilities to its students; it is betraying a pub¬ 
lic trust.” 

The extent of this betrayal might be argued; its existence, as a 
threatening tendency, is hardly in doubt. Senator Fulbright 
mentions one primary cause: the access to money and influence. 
Others might be mentioned: for example, a highly restrictive, 
almost universally shared ideology, and the inherent dynamics 
of professionalization. As to the former, Fulbright has cited 
elsewhere the observation of De Tocqueville: “I know of no 
country in which there is so little independence of mind and 
real freedom of discussion as in America.” Free institutions cer¬ 
tainly exist, but a tradition of passivity and conformism restricts 
their use—the cynic might say this is why they continue to exist. 
The impact of professionalization is also quite clear. The “free- 
floating intellectual” may occupy himself with problems be-

cause of their inherent interest and importance, perhaps to little 
effect. The professional, however, tends to define his problems 
on the basis of the technique that he has mastered, and has a 
natural desire to apply his skills. Commenting on this process, 
Senator Clark quotes the remarks of Dr. Harold Agnew, direc¬ 
tor of the Los Alamos Laboratories Weapons Division: “The 
basis of advanced technology is innovation and nothing is more 
stifling to innovation than seeing one’s product not used or
