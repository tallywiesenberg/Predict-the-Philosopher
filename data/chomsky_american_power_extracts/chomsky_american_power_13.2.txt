Eugene Black, testifying be¬ 
fore Congress on the Asian Development Bank, pointed out that 
“when the Bank makes loans you have international bids, and I am 
sure that with our ability and ingenuity in this country, we will get our 
share of the business.We certainly ought to get more than the small 
amount we contribute.” David Bell testified that “the Bank will play a 
major role in carrying forward another policy of our own assistance 
program—strengthening the role of the private sector ... by identify¬ 
ing particular projects which can attract private capital, by helping to 
draw up development plans and stimulate policies which will en¬ 
courage private initiative, and by drawing private capital to the re¬ 
gion.” Nothing here about “the generosity that characterizes our pol¬ 
icy.” 

Equally revealing is the history of programs such as the Alliance for 
Progress.As Senator Gore commented, this program “has in large 
measure come to be a subsidy for American business and American 
exporters” ( Congressional Record, July 22, 1966)—a fairly accurate 
judgment, so it appears.For example, the AID lending program in 
Latin America, according to former Alliance for Progress official Wil¬ 
liam Rogers ( The Twilight Struggle [New York, Random House, 
1967], p. 205), is based on two elements: “a demonstrated balance of 
payments needed to increase the nation’s ability to import U.S. goods 
and services, and the adoption of public policies and programs which 
would insure against capital flight on the international account side or 
the misuse of domestic resources through inefficient budgeting, re¬ 
duced local savings or inflation.” Commenting on this, Robert Smith 
notes that “the latter standard included increased tax revenues, reduc¬ 
tion of budget deficit, elimination of ‘distorting subsidies to public 
activities,’ and the adoption of ‘state incentives to private sector invest¬ 
ment and growth.’” ( New Politics, Vol.6 [Spring 1967], pp.
