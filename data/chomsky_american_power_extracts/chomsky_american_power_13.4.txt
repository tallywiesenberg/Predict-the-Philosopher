It 
should be noted that opposition to social change, and support for the 
counterrevolutionary violence that is used to suppress it, are long¬ 
standing features of American cultural history.Thus according to 
American historian Louis Hartz, “there is no doubt that the appear¬ 
ance of even a mild socialism in 1848, of Ledru Rollin and the 
national workshops, was enough to produce general American dismay.There was no outcry in America against the suppression of the June 
revolt of the workers in Paris, as there was none over the suppression 
of the Communards in 1871.Here was violence, and plenty of it, but 
it was being used for order and law, as one editorial writer put it [in 
the New York Journal of Commerce ].” {The Nature of Revolution,
