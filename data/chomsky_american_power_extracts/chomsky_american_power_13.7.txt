cit., Vol.2, p. 856.As Buttinger explains, “Local elections 
would have given the Vietminh control of most of the rural communi¬ 
ties.The Vietminh was not only popular and in effective political 
control of large regions, but it alone had people with the requisite 
organizational skills to exploit whatever opportunities for democratic 
self-expression the regime opened up.” He adds that “the NLF was 
truly the Vietminh reborn,” and speaks of “the similarity, or better, 
near identity, of the Vietminh and the NLF.”
