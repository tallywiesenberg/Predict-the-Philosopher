bombings and massacres, as well as razing forests and bulldozing 
villages”—all under the paternalistic guidance of the American “ad¬ 
visers.” The American press has yet to cover these events. In general, 
the failure of the press to report events in Latin America is scandal¬ 
ous. The coverage of Latin American events in Le Monde is greater in 
scope (and incomparably greater in depth) than anything to be found 
in the American press, which, like American scholarship, is little con¬ 
cerned with American-directed violence in other countries so long as it 
is reasonably successful. 

The quoted statement of the Guatemalan Vice-President would very 
likely cause something of a commotion in liberal circles were it to be 
published in the American press. However, hardly an eyebrow would be 
raised at other parts of Niedergang’s report, for example, these lines: 
““According to M. Antonio Palacios, of the Bank of Guatemala, ‘two 
thirds of the population live in a primitive manner; the infant mortal¬ 
ity rate is frightful.’ 70 percent of those under 20 have never been to 
school; the average life expectancy is scarcely more than 40 years; 
hunger and lack of hygiene are a veritable scourge; innumerable 
clandestine distilleries produce a fiery brandy called ‘guaro,’ maintain¬ 
ing a destructive alcoholism; 80 percent of doctors practice in the 
capital; outside begins the rule of the ‘sorceror’ and the incantations 
which combine Christianity and the Mayan tradition. Finally, there is 
83 percent illiteracy, one of the highest proportions in all of Latin 
America.” 

Recall that in 1954 the people of Guatemala were taking some 
small steps towards extricating themselves from this torment.

arguments of Martin Heidegger, who, lecturing in 1935, saw Germany 
as “the nation with the most neighbors and hence the most endan¬ 
gered” by the “great pincers,” by the “world character” represented in 
its crudest form in Russia and America, where “the domination ... of 
a cross section of the indifferent mass has become ... an active 
onslaught that destroys all rank and every world-creating impulse of

many, “the most metaphysical of nations,” must forestall “the peril of
