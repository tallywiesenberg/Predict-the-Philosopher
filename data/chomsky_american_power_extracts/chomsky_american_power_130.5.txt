terms of new spiritual energies unfolding historically from out of the 
center,” that is, Germany—in 1935. To Heidegger, in 1935, the cul¬ 
tural mission of Germany is to recapture and advance the “supreme 
possibility of human being, as fashioned by the Greeks”—which is 
quite natural, since along with Greek, “the German language is (in 
regard to its possibilities for thought) at once the most powerful and 
most spiritual of all languages” (p. 57). Compare Thomas Mann, who 
left Germany in 1933 because he could not, as “a German writer, 
made responsible through his habitual use of language, remain silent, 
quite silent, in the face of all the irreparable evil which has been 
committed daily, and is being committed in my country, against body, 
soul and spirit, against justice and truth, against men and man” 
(quoted in George Steiner, Language and Silence [New York, Atheneum 
Publishers, 1967], p. 102). 

60. James Reston, New York Times, November 24, 1967. Reston 
does not question that it is “in defending this doctrine” that men are 
dying in Vietnam, that this “principle” is in fact what motivates Wash¬ 
ington; but he admits that in the “profound spiritual bewilderment” 
caused by the immense destruction, it is becoming difficult “to believe 
in the cause.” A few days earlier (November 15), he had mused on 
one of the great “mysteries and tragedies in Vietnam,” “the Hanoi 
Government’s continuing refusal to talk about a negotiated settle¬ 
ment.” The reason for this “continuing refusal” (which will come as a 
surprise to those who have been reading the news columns of the 
Times for the past three years) is, he feels, that “Ho Chi Minh and his 
associates simply cannot believe that the U.S. would make such sacri¬ 
fices of men and treasure simply to defend the principle of opposing 
military aggression—and then withdraw when the principle is sus¬ 
tained”; Reston is convinced that “President Johnson is perfectly sin¬ 
cere” in “his offers to make peace and withdraw.” 

61. Thruston Morton, who inserted the IVS statement “Vietnam: An 
Inside View,” from which quotations follow, in the Congressional 
Record, December 13, 1967, S18499. Senator Morton himself became

disillusioned about the war because our “present military operations” 
appear to be failing “to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese.” 
We cannot succeed in this goal, he feels, when “at least one-third of 
the total population of Vietnam are refugees who have been driven 
from their land and their homes by U.S. military action.” What is 
remarkable is that he reacts to this atrocity by raising questions about 
whether we can succeed, and that he nowhere questions the legitimacy 
of our attempt to win their hearts and minds.
