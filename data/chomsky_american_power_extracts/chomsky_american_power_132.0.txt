The poll was mentioned in the New York Times, November 27, in an item 
dealing with a domestic poll headed “Johnson Finds Gain in Poll.” The 
manner in which it was reported was such that few would be aware of 
these highly significant facts, and the figures were not given. In Novem¬ 
ber, the British Daily Mail reported that 66% of those questioned in a 
poll said Britain should not support the United States, 21% that it should. 

It is unfortunate that the press does not see fit to make this informa¬ 
tion readily available. In countries where the government is somewhat 
responsive to public opinion, this enormous groundswell of opposition 
to the United States will sooner or later be translated into diplomatic

isolation and, perhaps, an attempt to construct a counterforce to con¬ 
tain American power. The consequences of such a move could be 
disastrous. No one stands to gain, in the long run, by the concealing of 
these facts.

June 10, 1967, pp. 15-16. Halle’s comments are little more than a para¬ 
phrase of McKinley’s famous statement of how divine guidance led him 
to the solution of the problem of how to deal with the Philippines: 

I don’t know how it was, but it came; 1) that we could not give them 
back to Spain—that would be cowardly and dishonorable; 2) that we 
could not turn them over to France or Germany—our commercial rivals 
in the Orient—that would be bad business and discreditable; 3) that 
we could not leave them to themselves—they were unfit for self- 
government—and they would soon have anarchy and misrule over there 
worse than Spain’s was; and 4) that there was nothing left for us to do 
but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize 
and Christianize them, and by God’s grace do the very best we could by 
them, as our fellowmen for whom Christ also died. And then I went to 
bed, and went to sleep and slept soundly. . . .

the North began in February 1965, these infiltrators were overwhelm¬
