AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


largely unarmed. For a summary of relevant evidence, see Draper, op. cit., 
and I. F. Stone, “A Reply to the White Paper,” in I. F. Stone’s 
Weekly, March 8, 1965, reprinted in Marcus G. Raskin and Bernard B. 
Fall, eds., The Vietnam Reader (New York, Vintage, 1965), pp. 155-62. 
The “White Paper” itself, along with Stone’s devastating analysis, is re¬ 
printed in Martin E. Gettleman, ed., Vietnam: History, Documents, and 
Opinions on a Major World Crisis (Greenwich, Conn., Fawcett, 1965), 
pp. 284-316. 

71. See for example, P. J. Honey, “The Foreign Policy of North 
Vietnam,” in John D. Montgomery and Albert 0. Hirschman, eds., 
Public Policy (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1967), 
Vol. 16, pp. 160-S0. Honey cites as one of the “main requirements of 
North Vietnamese foreign policy,” “to resist Chinese attempts to 
dominate Vietnam.” Similarly, in his Communism in North Vietnam 
(Cambridge, Mass., The M.I.T. Press, 1963), he points out that Pham 
Van Dong, second in command in North Vietnam, is “no political 
extremist but rather a cautious moderate” who “has stated that he 
believes Asia’s problems can be solved only through cooperation with 
the white races,” and that Vo Nguyen Giap is violently anti-Chinese— 
it is for this reason, he goes on to say, that he remains in control of 
the army. In fact, Honey concludes, “there are excellent grounds for 
the belief that the principal raison d’etre of such a powerful army in 
North Vietnam today is to protect North Vietnam against possible 
Chinese aggression.” Similar views are expressed by just about every¬ 
one who has considered the matter. It is particularly interesting that 
they are shared by Honey, whose militant anti-Communism reaches 
outlandish levels and frequently leads him to pure fabrication—e.g., 
his contention that the North Vietnamese refused to agree to negotia¬ 
tions at the beginning of 1965 ( Public Policy, Vol. 16, p. 180)—and 
to amazing allegations, for example, that some significant portion of the 
antiwar activity in Britain and the United States is initiated by the Com¬ 
munist parties and financed by Hanoi—including, as a special reward to 
loyal supporters, free trips to North Vietnam {ibid., p. 168). One won¬ 
ders whether his analyses of North Vietnam, which are apparently taken 
seriously by policy planners, show as much of a sense of reality as his 
perception of events in Britain and the United States. 

72. It is worth recalling that the Soviet Union has much better rea¬ 
sons than we do for taking seriously the lesson of Munich.
