The Logic of Withdrawal

to look back to the reports dating from the period in question, before 
the necessity arose to rewrite history so as to justify later overt Ameri¬ 
can aggression. For example, William Henderson, at the time an ex¬ 
ecutive of the Council on Foreign Relations specializing in Far East¬ 
ern affairs, wrote: “From the beginning Diem ran his government 
along the lines of a police state,” with vigorous suppression of political 
opposition, totalitarian methods to stimulate popular support, and so 
on. “By the middle of 1956 . . . Diem had still to prove that his 
professed devotion to the democratic cause represented anything more 
than a fagade to disguise the increasingly plain reality of stern dic¬ 
tatorship.” By 1958, there had “been little moderation of the grim 
dictatorship which Diem has exerted from the beginning.” “One result 
[of this grim dictatorship] has been the growing alienation of the 
intelligentsia. . . . Another has been the renewal of armed dissidence in 
the South” (Lindholm, op. cit., pp. 343 f.). In the same volume, 
David Hotham, correspondent for the London Times and the Econ¬ 
omist in Vietnam from 1955 to 1957, describes the “pacification” 
methods of the South Vietnamese army: “They consist of killing, or 
arresting without either evidence or trial, large numbers of persons 
suspected of being Vietminh or ‘rebels’” (p. 359). Possibly these 
events had as much to do with the renewal of insurgency as Mao’s 
musings about the East and the West Wind. 

As to the shift from “peaceful coexistence,” it is interesting to note 
that the Third Party Congress of the Lao Dong party of North Viet¬ 
nam, in September 1960, announced a major defense cutback to finance 
economic development. At the time, P. J. Honey summarized the 

results of this congress as indicating that “Vietnam will follow the 

Russian policy of peaceful co-existence based on the possibility of 
avoiding war” (“North Vietnam’s Party Congress,” China Quarterly, 
No. 4 [October-December 1960], p. 74; cited in Kahin and Lewis, op. 
cit., p. 116). Bernard Fall makes the same point (Last Reflections on 
a War, p. 203). Now, however, the official line is that at this congress 
the Lao Dong party set out on its attempt to conquer the South, and, 
as Hilsman puts it (op. cit., p. 419), the NLF was “duly formed” a 
few months later. For discussion of the forming of the NLF from 

somewhat more independent sources, see Buttinger, op. cit., Kahin
