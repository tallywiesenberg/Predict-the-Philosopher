and Lewis, op. cit., and even Douglas Pike, Viet Cong (Cambridge, 
Mass., The M.I.T. Press, 1966), all of whom present evidence to 
refute this claim, convenient for the purposes of State Department 
propaganda but otherwise without merit.

78. The fact that this is known in Asia is apparently what frightens 
American planners like Walt Rostow, who points out that a primary 
threat posed by China is “the possibility that the Chinese Communists 
can prove to Asians by progress in China that Communist methods are 
better and faster than democratic methods”—such as the democratic 
methods of South Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea, for example 
(Walt W. Rostow and R. W. Hatch, An American Policy in Asia 
[New York, Technology Press and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1955], p. 
6). The reality of this “threat” is clear from the mixed reactions to 
China’s development in the Asian countries, a combination of fear and 
admiration. Frederick Clairmonte maintains: “Starting the industriali¬ 
zation race with lower production levels than India, with a ruptured 
administration frame and a larger population than India’s and consid¬ 
erably less foreign aid at its disposal, the dramatic successes that 
catapulted China into the slipstream of growth signalized the pivotal 
importance of the agrarian revolution” ( Economic Liberalism and 
Underdevelopment [Bombay and London, Asia Publishing House, 
1960], p. 309). He cites reports from China by Indian delegations in 
the mid-1950s which attribute Chinese success in collectivization 
(which “appeared no less than a miracle”) to “a ferment in people’s 
minds,” not fear, and he himself concludes that the real success of the 
Chinese is the construction of a mass base of support, with rural 
activists from the peasants’ associations—a development lacking in 
India. 

The ambivalence of bourgeois Asian reaction to China is nicely 
reflected in a report of a visit to China by Philippine journalist Car¬ 
men Guerrero-Nakpil in the Asia Magazine , September 4, 1966. Awed 
as well as frightened, she describes with evident distaste the ever¬ 
present “little figure in blue, never alone,” who has emerged “from the 
invincible chaos of civil war, famine, and social injustice” and is now 
“not an individual, but the social man,” governed in his actions not by

terror or the state police but by the fear of “social disgrace,” by the 
very fact “that he is a public man,” committed to a vision of “ulti¬ 
mate, uncompromising social truth.” The report closes with an inter¬ 
view with a factory manager, who laughs as he discusses commune 
production and international affairs. “It is discomforting laughter. 
Why are they so happy?”

They nevertheless tell us a good deal about the nature of the battle of 
Hue. 

The American press has carried little direct reporting from Hue. 
Marc Riboud reports in Le Monde, April 13, 1968, that in the ten 
days he spent in Hue in early April he saw two journalists—both 
Japanese—from an international press corps of 495. He cites as offi¬ 
cial statistics: 4,100 civilians killed, 4,500 severely wounded, 18,000
