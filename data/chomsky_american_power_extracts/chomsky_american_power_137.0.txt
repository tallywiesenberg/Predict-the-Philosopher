The Bitter Heritage 


nary deployment of American armies, navies and military bases 
thousands of miles from the United States and mobilized . . . 
against no one but themselves.” In fact, one need hardly be a 
dogmatic Marxist-Leninist to draw the conclusion that we are 
interested in encircling China. This is precisely, for example, 
the view of Charles Wolf, senior economist of the RAND Cor¬ 
poration, who regards it as our major foreign policy task to 
make China “willing to live with this fear” of American encir¬ 
clement (see the congressional hearings before the Subcommit¬ 
tee on the Far East and the Pacific, January 27, 1966). Schles- 
inger evidently thinks of his interpretation as consistent with 
our “philosophical heritage—empirical, pragmatic, ironic, plu¬ 
ralistic, competitive.” It just may be, however, that a more ap¬ 
propriate adjective is “inane.” 

Schlesinger is as aware of what we are doing in Vietnam as 
any reader of the New York Times or /. F. Stone's Weekly . He 
emphasizes that “the war began as an insurrection within South 
Vietnam which, as it has gathered momentum, has attracted 
increasing support and direction from the North” and that the 
result of our bombing of North Vietnam “was to bring North 
Vietnamese forces south of the border,” though on a scale 
which is dwarfed by our own invasion of the country. He real¬ 
izes that “if we continue the pursuit of total military victory, we 
will leave the tragic country gutted and devastated by bombs, 
burned by napalm, turned into a wasteland by chemical defoli¬ 
ation, a land of ruin and wreck,” with its “political and institu¬ 
tional fabric” pulverized. He knows that “our bombers roam 
over the hapless country, dumping more tonnage of explosives 
each month than we were dropping per month on all Europe 
and Africa during the Second World War—more in a year than 
we dropped on the entire Pacific during the Second World 
War.” And he understands the effects on the civilian population

of this attack, unprecedented in scale in the history of warfare. 
All of this arouses in the author feelings of great compassion— 
for President Johnson. (“No thoughtful American can withhold 
sympathy as President Johnson ponders the gloomy choices 
which lie ahead.”) 

It is not that Schlesinger is incapable of indignation. He is
