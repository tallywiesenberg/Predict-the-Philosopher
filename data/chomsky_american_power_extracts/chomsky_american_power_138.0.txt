style, differs from that of Alsop in two important respects: first, 
in its skepticism as to the immediacy of an American victory; 
second, in its inability to imagine that any right-thinking Amer¬ 
ican could fail to be in favor of an outright American victory, if 
only it could be achieved by the means now being employed 
(which will, to be sure, turn the country into “a land of ruin 
and wreck”). Thus “we all pray” that American armed might 
will be successful, but the more sophisticated of us doubt that 
Alsop’s prediction will come true. 

Although Schlesinger now insists that “aggression from the 
North” will hardly do as an explanation for the war in South 
Vietnam, the old habits break through in his usage of the term 
“the South Vietnamese.” Thus our goal in Vietnam “should be 
the creation and stabilization of secure areas where the South 
Vietnamese might themselves undertake social and institutional 
development.” In fact, the areas where the South Vietnamese 
themselves have undertaken social and institutional develop¬ 
ment are those where the Vietcong have been in control, for 
example, in large parts of the Mekong Delta prior to the brutal

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


American and South Korean campaigns of the last few months. 
Ample documentation to support this conclusion is presented 
by Douglas Pike (who, in Schlesinger’s judgment, is “the most 
careful student of the Viet Cong”) in his recent book, Viet 
Cong . It would seem, then, that if our goal is to allow the South 
Vietnamese themselves to undertake social and institutional 
development, we should simply withdraw, or at the very least 
permit negotiations among indigenous South Vietnamese forces 
to the exclusion of outside powers, among which, of course, we 
ourselves are dominant by an overwhelming margin. 

But the South Vietnamese that Schlesinger has in mind are 
those whose claim to legitimacy is based on American arms 
(including the “South Vietnamese” in the military junta). Thus, 
in his lexicon, “South Vietnamese” is to be understood rather in 
the manner of the Japanese terminology of a quarter of a cen¬ 
tury ago, in which the “legitimate Chinese government” was 
that of Wang Ching-wei, the puppet ruler whom they installed 
(see page 194 above). The only appropriate comments regard¬ 
ing this conception of Rusk, Schlesinger, et al. are those of the 
American note of December 30, 1938, to Japan, which denied 
“that there is need or warrant for any one Power to take upon
