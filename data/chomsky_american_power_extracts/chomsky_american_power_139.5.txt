The Bitter Heritage 


by the North Vietnamese during the Tet truce as “extra evi¬ 
dence that they were not sincere in their statement on negotia¬ 
tions,” while maintaining that United States logistic operations 
carried out during the truce period were different because they 
“did not send men and supplies across the border into North 
Vietnam but were in South Vietnam only” ( New York Times, 
February 17, 1967). To go back to earlier precedents, it is the 
same attitude that permits Schlesinger (in his A Thousand 
Days) to express his horror at the discovery of Cuban arms 
cached in Venezuela, but to think nothing of the extensive 
American military aid that has been used to institute or support 
repressive regimes throughout the continent. The underlying 
assumption is that the United States does have a warrant “to 
take upon itself to prescribe what shall be the terms and condi¬ 
tions of a ‘new order’ in areas not under its sovereignty and to 
constitute itself the repository of authority and the agent of 
destiny in regard thereto.” 

Every competent observer has pointed out that “the war in 
South Vietnam has been between the large, professionally 
trained army of an unpopular government and the amateur 
military wing of a strong, nationalistically based political move¬ 
ment in which the Communists have formed the spearhead” 
(Michael Field, The Prevailing Wind). For this reason, the 
Saigon authorities have never wavered from their demand, ex¬ 
pressed in a statement of March 1, 1965, that negotiations are 
unthinkable unless the “Communists” show their sincerity “by 
withdrawing beforehand their armed units and their political 
cadres from South Vietnamese territory” (italics mine). The 
demand is appropriate; by their own repeated admission, the 
Saigon authorities have no hope of maintaining themselves in 
an open political arena. It is hardly necessary to document the 
fact that this has been the dominant American position as well,

in effect, as Schlesinger himself emphasizes.
