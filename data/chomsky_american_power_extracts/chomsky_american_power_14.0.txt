the experimental stations, and the universities,” with “the sci¬ 
entists, the mathematicians, the economists, and the engineers 
of the new computer technology”—“not only the best talents, 
but eventually the entire complex of social prestige and social 
status, will be rooted in the intellectual and scientific communi¬ 
ties.” 7 A careful look at the “skeletal structure” of this new 
society, if such it is, is hardly reassuring. As Daniel Bell points 
out, “it has been war rather than peace that has been largely 
responsible for the acceptance of planning and technocratic 
modes in government,” and our present “mobilized society” is 
one that is geared to the “social goal” of “military and war 
preparedness.” Bell’s relative optimism regarding the new soci¬ 
ety comes from his assumption that the university is “the place 
where theoretical knowledge is sought, tested, and codified in a 
disinterested way” and that “the mobilized postures of the Cold 
War and the space race” are a temporary aberration, a reaction

to Communist aggressiveness. In contrast, a strong argument 
can be made that the university has, to a significant degree, 
betrayed its public trust; that matters of foreign policy are very 
much “a reflex of internal political forces” as well as of eco¬ 
nomic institutions (rather than “a judgment about the national 
interest, involving strategy decisions based on the calculations 
of an opponent’s strength and intentions”); that the mobiliza¬ 
tion for war is not “irony” but a natural development, given our 
present social and economic organization; that the technologists 
who achieve power are those who can perform a service for 
existing institutions; and that nothing but catastrophe is to be 
expected from still further centralization of decision making in 
government and a narrowing base of corporate affiliates. The 
experience of the past few years gives little reason to feel opti¬ 
mistic about these developments. 

Quite generally, what grounds are there for supposing that 
those whose claim to power is based on knowledge and tech¬ 
nique will be more benign in their exercise of power than those 
whose claim is based on wealth or aristocratic origin? On the 
contrary, one might expect the new mandarin to be dangerously 
arrogant, aggressive, and incapable of adjusting to failure, as 
compared with his predecessor, whose claim to power was not 
diminished by honesty as to the limitations of his knowledge, 
lack of work to do, or demonstrable mistakes. 8 In the Vietnam 
catastrophe, all of these factors are detectable. There is no point
