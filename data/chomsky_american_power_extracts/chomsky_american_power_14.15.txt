As Roger Hilsman puts it, the real Pathet Lao “threat” was 
“expansion of political control based on winning peasant support in the 
villages” {To Move a Nation , [Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday & Com¬ 
pany, Inc., 1967], p. 112).The lack of support for the Pathet Lao was 
amply demonstrated in the 1958 elections, in which 9 of their 13 
candidates won, and Souphanouvong, the leading Pathet Lao figure, 
received more votes than any other candidate in the country.It was 
this election victory that set off the American attempts at subversion.As Dommen says, “once again the United States threw its support to 
the most feudal elements of the society.” 

To Charles Wolf, all of this demonstrates that counterinsurgency, 
like insurgency, can succeed without concern for popular loyalty and 
participation.37.
