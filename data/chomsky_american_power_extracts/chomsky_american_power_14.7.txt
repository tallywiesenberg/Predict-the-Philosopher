They are no defenders of capitalism; not capital, but intellect 
should direct labor.The more so, since now society is such a compliÂ¬ 
cated structure, based on abstract and difficult science, that only the 
highest intellectual acumen is capable of embracing, grasping and 
handling it.Should the working masses, from lack of insight, fail to 
acknowledge this need of superior intellectual lead, should they stupidly 
try to take the direction into their own hands, chaos and ruin will be 
the inevitable consequence.48.See note 7.
