South Vietnam for the past year. But the symbolism of this act 
casts its shadow over any critique of American institutions. 
When the bombings of North Vietnam began, Jean Lacouture 
commented aptly that these acts, and the documents produced 
to justify them, simply reveal that the American leaders regard 
themselves as having the right to strike where and when they 
wish. They reveal, in effect, that these leaders regard the world 
as an American preserve, to be governed and organized in ac¬ 
cordance with superior American wisdom and to be controlled, 
if necessary, by American power. At this moment of national 
disgrace, as American technology is running amuck in Southeast 
Asia, a discussion of American schools can hardly avoid noting 
the fact that these schools are the first training ground for the 
troops that will enforce the muted, unending terror of the status 
quo in the coming years of a projected American century; for 
the technicians "who will be developing the means for extension 
of American power; for the intellectuals who can be counted 
on, in significant measure, to provide the ideological justifica¬ 
tion for this particular form of barbarism and to decry the 
irresponsibility and lack of sophistication of those who will find 
all of this intolerable and revolting. 

Thirty years ago, Franz Borkenau concluded a brilliant study 
of the crushing of the popular revolution in Spain with this 
comment: “In this tremendous contrast with previous revolu¬ 
tions one fact is reflected. Before these latter years, counter¬ 
revolution usually depended upon the support of reactionary 
powers, which were technically and intellectually inferior to the 
forces of revolution. This has changed with the advent of fas¬ 
cism. Now, every revolution is likely to meet the attack of the 
most modern, most efficient, most ruthless machinery yet in 
existence. It means that the age of revolutions free to evolve 
according to their own laws is over . 5,1

Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools 


It would have taken a fair amount of foresight, at that time, 
to realize that the prediction would be proved accurate, with 
substitution of “liberal imperialism” for “fascism,” and that the 
United States would, in a generation, be employing the most 
efficient and most ruthless machinery in existence to ensure that 
revolutionary movements will not evolve according to their own 
laws, to guarantee that its own particular concept of civilization 
and justice and order will prevail. And it would have required 
considerable insight, in the late 1930s, to realize that before too
