that we—unilaterally, as in Vietnam—designate as illegitimate 
will face the most efficient and ruthless machinery that can be 
developed by modern technology. 

In minor ways, world opinion can serve as some kind of 
brake on full-scale utilization of the technology of terror and 
destruction. There has, as yet, been no use of nuclear weapons 
in Vietnam; and although rural populations are considered fair 
game for any sort of military attack, urban areas, where the 
butchery would be more evident to the outside world, are still 
relatively immune. Similarly, the use of gas attacks and chemi¬ 
cal warfare has been extended only slowly, as habituation per¬ 
mits each gradual increment to pass unnoticed . 2 But ultimately, 
the only effective brake can be popular revulsion on a mass

scale in the United States itself. Consequently, the level of cul¬ 
ture that can be achieved in the United States is a life-and- 
death matter for large masses of suffering humanity. This too is 
a fact that must color any discussion of contemporary American 
institutions. 

It is easy to be carried away by the sheer horror of what the 
daily press reveals and to lose sight of the fact that this is 
merely the brutal exterior of a deeper crime, of commitment to 
a social order that guarantees endless suffering and humiliation 
and denial of elementary human rights. It is tragic that the 
United States should have become, in Toynbee’s words, “the 
leader of a world-wide anti-revolutionary movement in defense 
of vested interests.” For American intellectuals and for the 
schools, there is no more vital issue than this indescribable 
tragedy. 

No one would seriously propose that the schools attempt to 
deal directly with such contemporary events as the American 
attack on the rural population of Vietnam or the backgrounds 
in recent history for the atrocities that are detailed in the mass 
media. No sane person would have expected the schools in 
France, for example, to explore the character of and justifica¬ 
tion for the Algerian war, or the schools in Russia to have dealt 
honestly with the crushing of the Hungarian revolution, or the 
schools in Italy to have analyzed the invasion of Ethiopia in an 
objective way, or the schools in England to have exposed the 
contemporary suppression of Irish nationalism. Rut it is perhaps
