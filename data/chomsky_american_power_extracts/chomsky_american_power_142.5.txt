not ridiculous to propose that the schools might direct them¬ 
selves to something more abstract, to an attempt to offer stu¬ 
dents some means for defending themselves from the onslaught 
of the massive government propaganda apparatus, from the 
natural bias of the mass media, and—to turn specifically to our 
present topic—from the equally natural tendency of significant

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


segments of the American intellectual community to offer their 
allegiance, not to truth and justice, but to power and the effec¬ 
tive exercise of power. 

It is frightening to observe the comparative indifference of 
American intellectuals to the immediate actions of their govern¬ 
ment and its long-range policies, and their frequent willingness 
—often eagerness—to play a role in implementing these poli¬ 
cies. This is not the place to illustrate in detail; in any event, I 
do not command the rhetoric to speak, in the only accurate and 
appropriate terms, of the actual conduct of the war and the way 
it has been tolerated at home. But more superficial examples 
make the point well enough. 

Only marginal groups of American academics have reacted to 
the fact that while the United States stands in the way of the 
only sort of meaningful negotiations, namely, negotiations 
among indigenous South Vietnamese political forces to the ex¬ 
clusion of the foreign invaders from the United States and 
Korea, and (on a vastly different scale) from North Vietnam, it 
nevertheless is able to persist in its pretense of interest in a 
“negotiated settlement” with no outcry of protest against this 
farce. When Secretary Rusk openly admits that we cannot ac¬ 
cept the North Vietnamese proposals of April 1965 because 
they require that the Saigon government be supplanted by a 
broad, national democratic coalition representing existing polit¬ 
ical forces in the country, there is no public denunciation of the 
cynicism of the position he upholds. When the press reports 
that the electoral law commission in South Vietnam faces the 
“awesome task” of running “honest elections” while making sure 
that the Communists do not win and that no Communists or 
“neutralists whose actions are advantageous to the Commu¬ 
nists” appear on the ballot, there is little editorial comment, few 
letters to the editor, no general dismay. There is little point in
