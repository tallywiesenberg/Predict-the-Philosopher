Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools 


multiplying examples. One can only be appalled at the willing¬ 
ness of American intellectuals, who, after all, have access to the 
facts, to tolerate or even approve of this deceitfulness and 
hypocrisy. Instead of shocked denunciations, we hear and read 
mock-serious discussions of the rationality of the American at¬ 
tempt to drive the North Vietnamese by force towards the 
negotiations that they had been demanding; of the sincere 
American desire to permit the South Vietnamese people to elect 
freely the government of their choice (now that the domestic 
opposition has been crushed and all Communist and neutralist 
candidates excluded); of the “great complexity” of international 
affairs (which, strangely, did not seem to justify Russian domi¬ 
nation of East Europe or the Japanese attempt to impose a new 
order in Asia); of the judicious restraint of the administration, 
presumably, in refraining from genocide at a single stroke; and 
so on. Or what is worse, we read of the “bedrock vital interest 
of the United States” in demonstrating that its military power, 
once committed for whatever reason, cannot be forced to with¬ 
draw—a viewpoint which, had it been accepted by the world’s 
second superpower as well, would have brought the history of 
Western civilization to a close in 1962, and which, if consist¬ 
ently pursued, must lead either to a Pax Americana or to a 
devastating world conflict. 

Traditionally, the role of the intellectual, or at least his self- 
image, has been that of a dispassionate critic. Insofar as that 
role has been lost, the relation of the schools to intellectuals 
should, in fact, be one of self-defense. This is a matter that 
should be seriously considered. It is, to be sure, ridiculous to 
propose that the schools, in any country, deal objectively with 
contemporary history—they cannot sufficiently free themselves 
from the pressures of ideology for that. But it is not necessarily 
absurd to suppose that in Western democracies, at least, it
