pose that high school students were exposed to the best of 
current American scholarship, for example, George Taylor’s re¬ 
cent study for the Council on Foreign Relations, The Philip¬ 
pines and the United States. Here they would learn how, half a 
century after the bloody suppression of the native independ¬ 
ence movement at a cost of well over 100,000 lives in the years 
1898-1900, the country achieved nominal independence and the 
surface forms of democracy. They would also learn that the 
United States is guaranteed long-term military bases and un¬ 
paralleled economic privileges; that for three fourths of the 
population, living standards have not risen since the Spanish 
occupation; that 70 percent of the population is estimated to 
have tuberculosis; that profits flowing to the United States have 
exceeded new investment in each postwar year; that the demo¬ 
cratic forms give a new legitimacy to an old elite, allied now to 
American interests. They would read that “Colonial policy had 
tended to consolidate the power of an oligarchy that profited 
. . . from the free trade relationship and would be likely to re¬

record shows that we are more than equal to the task.” It is at

Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools 


least possible that to a young mind, still uncontaminated by 
cant and sophistry, such a study can teach a revealing lesson, 
not only about what American dominance is likely to mean 
concretely, in the Third World, but also about the way in which 
American intellectuals are likely to interpret this impact. 

In general, the history of imperialism and of imperialist 
apologia, particularly as seen from the point of view of those at 
the wrong end of the guns, should be a central part of any 
civilized curriculum. But there are other aspects to a program of 
intellectual self-defense that should not be overlooked. In an 
age of science and technology, it is inevitable that their prestige 
will be employed as an ideological instrument—specifically,,
