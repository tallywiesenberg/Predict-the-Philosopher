that the social and behavioral sciences will in various ways be 
made to serve in defense of national policy or as a mask for 
special interest. It is not merely that intellectuals are strongly 
tempted, in a society that offers them prestige and affluence, to 
take what is now called a “pragmatic attitude” (in a perverse 
sense of “pragmatism” which is, sad to say, not without some 
historical justification, as shown in the Dewey-Bourne inter¬ 
change during the First World War—see Introduction, pages 
5-7), that is, an attitude that one must “accept,” not criti¬ 
cally analyze or struggle to change, the existing distribution of 
power, domestic or international, and the political realities that 
flow from it, and must work only for “slow measures of im¬ 
provement” in a technological, piecemeal manner. It is not 
merely that having taken this position (conceivably with some 
justification, at a particular historical moment), one is strongly 
tempted to provide it with an ideological justification of a very 
general sort. Rather, what we must also expect is that political 
elites will use the terminology of the social and behavioral sci¬ 
ences to protect their actions from critical analysis—the non¬ 
specialist does not, after all, presume to tell physicists and engi-

neers how to build an atomic reactor. And for any particular 
action, experts can certainly be found in the universities who 
will solemnly testify as to its appropriateness and realism. This 
is not a matter of speculation; thus we already find, in congres¬ 
sional testimony, the proposal by a leading political scientist 
that we try to impose mass starvation on a quarter of the 
human race, if their government does not accept our dictates. 
And it is commonly argued that the free-floating intellectual, 
who is now outdated, has no business questioning the conclu¬ 
sions of the professional expert, equipped with the tools of 
modern science. 

This situation again carries a lesson for the schools, one to 
which teachers in particular should be quite sensitive, bom¬ 
barded as they have been in recent years by authoritative con¬ 
clusions about what has been “demonstrated” with regard to 
human learning, language, and so on. The social and behavioral 
sciences should be seriously studied not only for their intrinsic 
interest, but so that the student can be made quite aware of 
exactly how little they have to say about the problems of man
