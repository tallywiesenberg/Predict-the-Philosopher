and society that really matter. They should, furthermore, be 
studied in the context of the physical sciences, so that the stu¬ 
dent can be brought to appreciate clearly the limits of their 
intellectual content. This can be an important way to protect a 
student from the propaganda of the future, and to put him in a 
position to comprehend the true nature of the means that are 
sure to be used to conceal the real significance of domestic or 
international policy. 

Suppose, however, that contrary to all present indications, 
the United States will stop short of using its awesome resources 
of violence and devastation to impose its passionately held 
ideology and its approved form of social organization on large 
areas of the world. Suppose, that is, that American policy ceases

Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools 


to be dominated by the principles that were crudely outlined by 
President Truman almost twenty years ago, when he suggested 
in a famous and important speech that the basic freedom is free¬ 
dom of enterprise and that the whole world should adopt 
the American system, which could survive in ’America only 
if it became a world system (see note 82, page 293). It

be achieved in the United States is a matter of overwhelming 
importance for the rest of the world. If we want to be truly 
utopian, we may consider the possibility that American re¬ 
sources might be used to alleviate the terrorism that seems to be 
an inevitable correlate of modernization, if we can judge from 
past and present history. We can conceive of the possibility that 
the schools, or the intellectuals, might pay serious attention to 
questions that have been posed for centuries, that they might 
ask whether society must, indeed, be a Hobbesian bellum 
omnium contra omnes , and might inquire into the contempo¬ 
rary meaning of Rousseau’s protest that it is contrary to natural 
right that “a handful of men be glutted with superfluities while 
the starving multitude lacks necessities.” They might raise the 
moral issue faced, or avoided, by one who enjoys his wealth and 
privilege undisturbed by the knowledge that half of the chil¬ 
dren born in Nicaragua will not reach five years of age, or that 
only a few miles away there is unspeakable poverty, brutal 
suppression of human rights, and almost no hope for the future; 
and they might raise the intellectual issue of how this can be 
changed. They might ask, with Keynes, how long we must con¬ 
tinue to “exalt some of the most distasteful of human qualities
