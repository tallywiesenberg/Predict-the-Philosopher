into the position of the highest virtues,” setting up “avarice and 
usury and precaution . . . [as] . . . our gods,” and pretending to 
ourselves that “fair is foul and foul is fair, for foul is useful and 
fair is not.” If American intellectuals will be preoccupied with

such questions as these, they can have an invaluable civilizing 
influence on society and on the schools. If, as is more likely, 
they regard them with disdain as mere sentimental nonsense, 
then our children will have to look elsewhere for enlightenment 
and guidance.

2. This essay was written in June 1966; it now goes to press again in 
May 1968. On the use of gas in Vietnam, see Seymour Hersh, “Poison 
Gas in Vietnam,” New York Review of Books , May 9, 1968. On 
current plans for chemical warfare, Science , May 24, 1968, contains 
the following note (p. 863): 

Expanded Chemical Warfare: The Air Force has told Congress that 
it will spend $70.8 million on 10 million gallons of chemicals used for 
Vietnam defoliation and crop-killing in the fiscal year beginning 1 July, 
a $24.9 million increase over this year’s figure. Next year’s expanded 
efforts are in line with the continuing increase in the U.S. chemical 
warfare program in Vietnam. In the first 9 months of 1967, 843,606 
acres in Vietnam were drenched with defoliants and 121,400 acres with 
crop-killing chemicals, a figure which slightly exceeded the totals for 
the whole of 1966. 

In its issue of May 10, 1968, Science carries a letter by Thomas 0. 
Perry of the Harvard University Forest, who comments as follows on 
chemical warfare (p. 601) : 

The DOD can raise the red herring of “long-term” effects, but there 
can be no doubt about the short-term effects: 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T kill 
the green vegetation. When followed by fire bombs, the dead foliage 
and twigs bum, as they did on some 100,000 acres (about 40,000 
hectares) in the “Iron Triangle” last spring.
