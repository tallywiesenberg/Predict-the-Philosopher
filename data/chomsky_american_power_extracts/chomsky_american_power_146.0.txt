^ - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

Hiroshima and Nagasaki, surely among the most unspeakable 
crimes in history? To an undergraduate in 1945-1946—to any¬

by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian

complicity in them—these questions had particular significance 
and poignancy. 

With respect to the responsibility of intellectuals, there are
