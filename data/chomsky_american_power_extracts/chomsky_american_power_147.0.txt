ernment propaganda apparatus is such that the citizen who 
does not undertake a research project on the subject can hardly 
hope to confront government pronouncements with fact. 1 

The deceit and distortion surrounding the American invasion 
of Vietnam are by now so familiar that they have lost their 
power to shock. It is therefore well to recall that although new 
levels of cynicism are constantly being reached, their clear 
antecedents w r ere accepted at home with quiet toleration. It is a 
useful exercise to compare government statements at the time 
of the invasion of Guatemala in 1954 with Eisenhower’s admis¬ 
sion—to be more accurate, his boast—a decade later that Amer¬ 
ican planes were sent “to help the invaders.” 2 Nor is it only in 
moments of crisis that duplicity is considered perfectly in order. 
“New Frontiersmen,” for example, have scarcely distinguished 
themselves by a passionate concern for historical accuracy, even 
when they are not being called upon to provide a “propaganda 
cover” for ongoing actions. For example, Arthur Schlesinger 
describes the bombing of North Vietnam and the massive esca¬ 
lation of military commitment in early 1965 as based on a “per¬ 
fectly rational argument”: “. . . so long as the Vietcong thought 
they were going to win the war, they obviously would not be 
interested in any kind of negotiated settlement.” 3 The date is 
important. Had the statement been made six months earlier, 
one could attribute it to ignorance. But this statement appeared 
after months of front-page news reports detailing the United 
Nations, North Vietnamese, and Soviet initiatives that preceded 
the February 1965 escalation and that, in fact, continued for 
several weeks after the bombing began, after months of soul- 
searching by Washington correspondents who were trying des¬ 
perately to find some mitigating circumstances for the startling 
deception that had been revealed. (Chalmers Roberts, for

example, wrote with unconscious irony that late February 1965 
“hardly seemed to Washington to be a propitious moment for 
negotiations [since] Mr. Johnson . . . had just ordered the first 
bombing of North Vietnam in an effort to bring Hanoi to a 
conference table where bargaining chips on both sides would 
be more closely matched/ 54 ) Coming at this moment, Schles- 
inger’s statement is less an example of deceit than of contempt 
—contempt for an audience that can be expected to tolerate
