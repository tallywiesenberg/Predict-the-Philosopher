fied Germany would not be permitted to join a Western mili¬ 
tary alliance. 12 And he has also momentarily forgotten his own 
characterization of the strategy of the Truman and Eisenhower 
administrations: “to avoid any serious negotiation with the So¬ 
viet Union until the West could confront Moscow with German 
rearmament within an organized European framework, as a fait 
accompli ” 13 —to be sure, in defiance of the Potsdam agree¬ 
ments. 

But most interesting of all is Rostow’s reference to Iran. The 
facts are that there was a Russian attempt to impose by force a 
pro-Soviet government in Northern Azerbaijan that would 
grant the Soviet Union access to Iranian oil. This was rebuffed 
by superior Anglo-American force in 1946, at which point the 
more powerful imperialism obtained full rights to Iranian oil for 
itself, with the installation of a pro-Western government. We 
recall what happened when, for a brief period in the early

1950s, the only Iranian government with something of a popu¬ 
lar base experimented with the curious idea that Iranian oil 
should belong to the Iranians. What is interesting, however, is 
the description of Northern Azerbaijan as part of “the free 
world spectrum of defense.” It is pointless, by now, to comment 
on the debasement of the phrase “free world.” But by what law 
of nature does Iran, with its resources, fall within Western do¬ 
minion? The bland assumption that it does is most revealing of 
deep-seated attitudes towards the conduct of foreign affairs. 

In addition to this growing lack of concern for truth, we find, 
in recent statements, a real or feigned naivete with regard to 
American actions that reaches startling proportions. For exam¬ 
ple, Arthur Schlesinger has recently characterized our Vietna¬ 
mese policies of 1954 as “part of our general program of inter¬ 
national goodwill.” 14 Unless intended as irony, this remark 
shows either a colossal cynicism or an inability, on a scale that 
defies comment, to comprehend elementary phenomena of con¬ 
temporary history. Similarly, what is one to make of the testi¬ 
mony of Thomas Schelling before the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, January 27, 1966, in which he discusses the two 
great dangers if all Asia “goes Communist”? 16 First, this would 
exclude “the United States and what we call Western civiliza¬ 
tion from a large part of the world that is poor and colored and
