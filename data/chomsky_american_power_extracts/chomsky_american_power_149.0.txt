The Responsibility of Intellectuals 


ter, in the general history of imperialist apologia—this inno¬ 
cence becomes increasingly distasteful as the power it serves 
grows more dominant in world affairs and more capable, there¬ 
fore, of the unconstrained viciousness that the mass media 
present to us each day. We are hardly the first power in history 
to combine material interests, great technological capacity, and 
an utter disregard for the suffering and misery of the lower 
orders. The long tradition of naivete and self-righteousness that 
disfigures our intellectual history, however, must serve as a 
warning to the Third World, if such a warning is needed, as to 
how our protestations of sincerity and benign intent are to be 
interpreted. 

The basic assumptions of the “New Frontiersmen 55 should be 
pondered carefully by those who look forward to the involve¬ 
ment of academic intellectuals in politics. For example, I have 
referred to Arthur Schlesinger’s objections to the Bay of Pigs 
invasion, but the reference was imprecise. True, he felt that it 
was a “terrible idea, 55 but “not because the notion of sponsoring 
an exile attempt to overthrow Castro seemed intolerable in 
itself. 55 Such a reaction would be the merest sentimentality, un¬ 
thinkable to a tough-minded realist. The difficulty, rather, was 
that it seemed unlikely that the deception could succeed. The 
operation, in his view, was ill-conceived but not otherwise ob¬ 
jectionable. 17 In a similar vein, Schlesinger quotes with ap¬ 
proval Kennedy’s “realistic 55 assessment of the situation resulting 
from Trujillo’s assassination: “There are three possibilities in 
descending order of preference: a decent democratic regime, a 
continuation of the Trujillo regime or a Castro regime. We 
ought to aim at the first, but we really can’t renounce the sec¬ 
ond until we are sure that we can avoid the third.” ls The 
reason why the third possibility is so intolerable is explained a 
few pages later: “Communist success in Latin America would
