tained that we have in effect already achieved “the egalitarian 
and socially mobile society which the ‘free floating intellectuals' 
associated with the Marxist tradition have been calling for 
during the last hundred years.” Granting the obvious general 
rise in standard of living, the judgment of Gunnar Myrdal 
seems far more appropriate to the actual situation when he 
says: “The common idea that America is an immensely rich and 
affluent country is very much an exaggeration. American afflu¬ 
ence is heavily mortgaged. America carries a tremendous bur¬ 
den of debt to its poor people. That this debt must be paid is 
not only a wish of the do-gooders. Not paying it implies a risk 
for the social order and for democracy as we have known it.” 11 
Surely the claim that all groups can easily enter the mass-con¬ 
sumption economy and “erase the visible demarcations” is a 
considerable exaggeration. 

Similar evaluations of American society appear frequently in 
contemporary scholarship. To mention just one example, con¬ 
sider the analysis that Adam Ulam gives of Marx’s concept of 
capitalism: “One cannot blame a contemporary observer like 
Marx for his conviction that industrial fanaticism and self-right¬ 
eousness were indelible traits of the capitalist. That the capital¬ 
ist would grow more humane, that he would slacken in his 
ceaseless pursuit of accumulation and expansion, were not im¬ 
pressions readily warranted by the English social scene of the 
1840’s and ’50’s.” 12 Again, granting the important changes in 
industrial society over the past century, it still comes as a sur¬ 
prise to hear that the capitalist has slackened in his ceaseless 
pursuit of accumulation and expansion. 13 

Remarks such as these illustrate a failure to come to grips 
with the reality of contemporary society which may not be 
directly traceable to the newly found (or at least hopefully 
sought) access to power and affluence, but which is, neverthe-
