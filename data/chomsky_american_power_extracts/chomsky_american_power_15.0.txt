Also relevant is the history of collectivization in China, which, as 
compared with the Soviet Union, shows a much higher reliance on 
persuasion and mutual aid than on force and terror, and appears to 
have been more successful.See Thomas P. Bernstein, “Leadership and 
Mass Mobilisation in the Soviet and Chinese Collectivization Cam¬ 
paigns of 1929-30 and 1955-56: A Comparison/’ China Quarterly, 
No.31 (July-September 1967), pp.1-47, for some interesting and 
suggestive comments and analysis.The scale of the Chinese Revolution is so great and reports in depth 
are so fragmentary that it would no doubt be foolhardy to attempt a 
general evaluation.
