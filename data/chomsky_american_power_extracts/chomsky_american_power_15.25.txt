There is also much useful information in what to my mind is the 
best general history of the Civil War, La Revolution et la guerre 
d'Espagne, by Pierre Broue and Emile Temime (Paris, Les Editions de 
Minuit, 1961).A concise and informative recent account is contained 
in Daniel Guerin, UAnarchisme (Paris, Gallimard, 1965).In his ex¬ 
tensive study, The Spa?iish Civil War (New York, Harper & Row, 
Publishers, 1961; paperback ed.1963), Hugh Thomas barely refers to 
the popular revolution, and some of the major events are not men¬ 
tioned at all—see, for example, note 97 below.60.
