what was 
truly revolutionary in the Spanish Civil War resulted from the direct 
actions of the workers and pauperized peasants, and not because of a 
specific form of labor organization nor an especially gifted leader¬ 
ship.” I think that the record bears out this analysis, and I also think 
that it is this fact that accounts for the distaste for the revolutionary 
phase of the Civil War and its neglect in historical scholarship.61.An illuminating eyewitness account of this period is that of Franz 
Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit (1938; reprinted Ann Arbor, Univer¬ 
sity of Michigan Press, 1963).62.Figures from Guerin, UAnarchisme, p. 154.
