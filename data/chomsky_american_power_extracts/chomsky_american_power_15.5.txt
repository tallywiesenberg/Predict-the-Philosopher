new privileged elite. 

Various strands of this ideology are drawn together in a re¬ 
cent article by Zbigniew Brzezinski, 14 in which a number of the 
conceptions and attitudes that appear in recent social thought 
are summarized—I am tempted to say “parodied.” Brzezinski 
too sees a “profound change” taking place in the intellectual 
community, as “the largely humanist-oriented, occasionally 
ideologically-minded intellectual-dissenter, who sees his role 
largely in terms of proffering social critiques, is rapidly being 
displaced either by experts and specialists, who become in¬ 
volved in special governmental undertakings, or by the gener- 
alists-integrators, who become in effect house-ideologues for 
those in power, providing overall intellectual integration for 
disparate actions.” He suggests that these “organisation-ori¬ 
ented, application-minded intellectuals” can be expected to in¬ 
troduce broader and more relevant concerns into the political 
system—though there is, as he notes, a danger that “intellectual 
detachment and the disinterested search for truth” will come to 
an end, given the new access of the “application-minded intellect¬ 
uals” to “power, prestige, and the good life.” They are a new 
meritocratic elite, “taking over American life, utilising the uni¬ 
versities, exploiting the latest techniques of communications, 
harnessing as rapidly as possible the most recent technological 
devices.” Presumably, their civilizing impact is revealed by the 
great progress that has been made, in this new “historical era” 
that America alone has already entered, with respect to the prob¬ 
lems that confounded the bumbling political leaders of past eras 
—the problems of the cities, of pollution, of waste and destruc¬ 
tiveness, of exploitation and poverty. Under the leadership of this 
“new breed of politicians-intellectuals,” America has become “the 
creative society; the others, consciously and unconsciously, are

emulative.” We see this, for example, in mathematics, the bio¬ 
logical sciences, anthropology, philosophy, cinema, music, his¬ 
torical scholarship, and so on, where other cultures, hopelessly 
outdistanced, merely observe and imitate what America creates. 
Thus we move towards a new world-wide “ ‘super-culture/ 
strongly influenced by American life, with its own universal 
electronic-computer language,” with an enormous and growing 
“psycho-cultural gap” separating America from the rest of the 
“developed world.”
