opposed the policy of joining the government and argued for an al¬ 
ternative, more typically anarchist strategy to which I will return

Republic of 1931: “It is always the old dog with a new collar.” Events 
were to prove the accuracy of this analysis.Berneri had been a leading spokesman of Italian anarchism.He left 
Italy after Mussolini’s rise to power, and came to Barcelona on July 
19, 1936.He formed the first Italian units for the antifascist war, 
according to anarchist historian Rudolf Rocker ( The Tragedy of Spain 
[New York, Freie Arbeiter Stimme, 1937], p. 44).
