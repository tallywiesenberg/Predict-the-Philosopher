He was murdered, 
along with his older comrade Barbieri, during the May Days of 1937.(Arrested on May 5 by the Communist-controlled police, he was shot 
during the following night.)Hugh Thomas, in The Spanish Civil War , 
p. 428, suggests that “the assassins may have been Italian Commu¬ 
nists” rather than the police.Thomas’ book, which is largely devoted 
to military history, mentions Berneri’s murder but makes no other 
reference to his ideas or role.Berneri’s name does not appear in Jackson’s history.
