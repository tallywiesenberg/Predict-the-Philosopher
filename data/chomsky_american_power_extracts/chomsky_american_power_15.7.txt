they [say] The Communist Party is our party.’ 
Comrades, what emotion the peasants display when they utter these 
words” (cited in Bolloten, p. 86).There is some interesting specula¬ 
tion about the backgrounds for the writing of this very important book 
in H. R. Southworth, Le mythe de la croisade de Franco (Ruedo 
Iberico, Paris, 1964; Spanish edition, same publisher, 1963).The Communist headquarters in Valencia had on the wall two 
posters: “Respect the property of the small peasant” and “Respect the 
property of the small industrialist” (Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit, 
p. 117).Actually, it was the rich farmer as well who sought protection 
from the Communists, whom Borkenau describes as constituting the 
extreme right wing of the Republican forces.By early 1937, according 
to Borkenau, the Communist party was “to a large extent ... the party 
of the military and administrative personnel, in the second place the 
party of the petty bourgeoisie and certain well-to-do peasant groups, in 
the third place the party of the employees, and only in the fourth place 
the party of the industrial workers” (p. 192).
