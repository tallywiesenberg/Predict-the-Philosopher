Actually, the situation that Brenan describes is not as strange a one 
as he suggests.It is, rather, a natural consequence of Bolshevik elitism 
that the “Red bureaucracy” should act as a counterrevolutionary force 
except under the conditions where its present or future representatives 
are attempting to seize power for themselves, in the name of the 
masses whom they pretend to represent.66.Bolloten, op .cit., p. 189.
