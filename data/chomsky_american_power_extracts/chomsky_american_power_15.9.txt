The legalization of revolutionary actions 
already undertaken and completed recalls the behavior of the “revolu¬ 
tionary vanguard” in the Soviet Union in 1918.Cf.Arthur Rosenberg, 
A History of Bolshevism (1932; republished in translation from the 
original German, New York, Russell and Russell, Publishers, 1965), 
Ch.6.He describes how the expropriations, “accomplished as the 
result of spontaneous action on the part of workers and against the 
will of the Bolsheviks,” were reluctantly legalized by Lenin months 
later and then placed under central party control.
