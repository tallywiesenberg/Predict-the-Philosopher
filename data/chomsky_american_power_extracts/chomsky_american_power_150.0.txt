very lack of dogmatism.” 

Such intellectual contributions as these suggest the need for a 
correction to De Gaulle’s remark, in his memoirs, about the 
American “will to power, cloaking itself in idealism.” By now, 
this will to power is not so much cloaked in idealism as it is 
drowned in fatuity. And academic intellectuals have made their 
unique contribution to this sorry picture. 

Let us, however, return to the war in Vietnam and the re¬ 
sponse that it has aroused among American intellectuals. A strik¬ 
ing feature of the recent debate on Southeast Asian policy has 
been the distinction that is commonly drawn between “respon¬ 
sible criticism,” on the one hand, and “sentimental” or “emo¬ 
tional” or “hysterical” criticism, on the other. There is much to 
be learned from a careful study of the terms in which this 
distinction is drawn. The “hysterical critics” are to be identified, 
apparently, by their irrational refusal to accept one fundamen¬ 
tal political axiom, namely, that the United States has the right 
to extend its power and control without limit, insofar as is 
feasible. Responsible criticism does not challenge this assump¬ 
tion, but argues, rather, that we probably can’t “get away with 
it” at this particular time and place. 

A distinction of this sort seems to be what Irving Kristol has 
in mind, for example, in his analysis of the protest over Vietnam 
policy, in Encounter, August 1965. He contrasts the responsible

critics, such as Walter Lippmann, the New York Times , and 
Senator Fulbright, with the “teach-in movement/’ “Unlike the 
university protesters,” he maintains, “Mr. Lippmann engages in 
no presumptuous suppositions as to ‘what the Vietnamese peo¬ 
ple really want’—he obviously doesn’t much care—or in legalis¬ 
tic exegesis as to whether, or to what extent, there is ‘aggres¬ 
sion’ or ‘revolution’ in South Vietnam. His is a realpolitik point 
of view; and he will apparently even contemplate the possibility 
of a nuclear war against China in extreme circumstances.” This 
is commendable, and contrasts favorably, for Kristol, with the 
talk of the “unreasonable, ideological types” in the teach-in 
movement, who often seem to be motivated by such absurdities 
as “simple, virtuous ‘anti-imperialism.’ ” who deliver “harangues 
on ‘the power structure,’ ” and who even sometimes stoop so 
low as to read “articles and reports from the foreign press on
