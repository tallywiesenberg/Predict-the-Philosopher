reaffirmed” our interest “in the progress of the people across the 
Pacific”) and his advisers, who deserve “the understanding sup¬ 
port of those who want restraint.” It is these men who deserve 
the credit for the fact that “the bombing of the North has been 
the most accurate and the most restrained in modern warfare” 
—a solicitude which will be appreciated by the inhabitants, or 
former inhabitants, of Nam Dinh and Phu Ly and Vinh. It is 
these men, too, who deserve the credit for what was reported 
by Malcolm Browne as long ago as May 1965: “In the South,

huge sectors of the nation have been declared ‘free bombing 
zones/ in which anything that moves is a legitimate target. Tens 
of thousands of tons of bombs, rockets, napalm and cannon fire 
are poured into these vast areas each week. If only by the laws 
of chance, bloodshed is believed to be heavy in these raids.” 

Fortunately for the developing countries, Bundy assures us, 
“American democracy has no enduring taste for imperialism,” 
and “taken as a whole, the stock of American experience, un¬ 
derstanding, sympathy and simple knowledge is now much the 
most impressive in the world.” It is true that “four-fifths of all 
the foreign investing in the world is now done by Americans” 
and that “the most admired plans and policies . . . are no better 
than their demonstrable relation to the American interest”—just 
as it is true, so we read in the same issue of Foreign Affairs, that 
the plans for armed action against Cuba were put into motion a 
few weeks after Mikoyan visited Havana, “invading what had 
so long been an almost exclusively American sphere of influ¬ 
ence.” Unfortunately, such facts as these are often taken by 
unsophisticated Asian intellectuals as indicating a “taste for im¬ 
perialism.” For example, a number of Indians have expressed 
their “near exasperation” at the fact that “we have done every¬ 
thing we can to attract foreign capital for fertilizer plants, but 
the American and the other Western private companies know 
we are over a barrel, so they demand stringent terms which we 
just cannot meet ,” 22 while “Washington . . . doggedly insists 
that deals be made in the private sector with private enter¬ 
prise .” 23 But this reaction, no doubt, simply reveals once again 
how the Asian mind fails to comprehend the “diffuse and com¬ 
plex concepts” of Western thought. 

It may be useful to study carefully the “new, good ideas 
about Vietnam” that are receiving a “prompt and respectful 
hearing” in Washington these days. The United States Govern-
