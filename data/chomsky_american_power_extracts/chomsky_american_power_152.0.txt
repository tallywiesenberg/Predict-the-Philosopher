healthy “realpolitik point of view” that Irving Kristol so much 
admires. 

But, one may ask, why restrict ourselves to such indirect 
means as mass starvation? Why not bombing? No doubt this 
message is implicit in the remarks to the same committee of the 
Reverend R. J. de Jaegher, regent of the Institute of Far East¬ 
ern Studies, Seton Hall University, who explains that like all 
people who have lived under Communism, the North Vietna¬ 
mese “would be perfectly happy to be bombed to be free” (p. 
345). 

Of course, there must be those who support the Communists. 
But this is really a matter of small concern, as the Honorable 
Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern 
Affairs from 1953 to 1959, points out in his testimony before the 
same committee. He assures us that “The Peiping regime . . . 
represents something less than 3 percent of the population” (p. 
402). 

Consider, then, how fortunate the Chinese Communist lead¬ 
ers are, compared to the leaders of the Vietcong, who, accord¬ 
ing to Arthur Goldberg, represent about “one-half of one per¬ 
cent of the population of South Vietnam,” that is, about one 
half the number of new Southern recruits for the Vietcong dur¬ 
ing 1965, if we can credit Pentagon statistics. 25 

In the face of such experts as these, the scientists and philos¬ 
ophers of whom Kristol speaks would clearly do well to con¬ 
tinue to draw their circles in the sand. 

Having settled the issue of the political irrelevance of the 
protest movement, Kristol turns to the question of what moti¬ 
vates it—more generally, what has made students and junior 
faculty “go left,” as he sees it, amid general prosperity and

under liberal, welfare state administrations. This, he notes, “is a 
riddle to which no sociologist has as yet come up with an an¬ 
swer.” Since these young people are well off, have good futures, 
etc., their protest must be irrational. It must be the result of 
boredom, of too much security, or something of this sort. 

Other possibilities come to mind. It might be, for example,
