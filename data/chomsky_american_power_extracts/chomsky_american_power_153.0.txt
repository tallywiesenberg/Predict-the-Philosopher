quences, as do the sciences he is attempting to mimic. He sim¬ 
ply suggests a terminology and provides a fagade of rationality. 
When particular policy conclusions are drawn, they are sup¬ 
ported only by ex cathedra remarks for which no support is 
even suggested (e.g., “The civil defense line probably should be 
drawn somewhere below $5 billion annually” to keep from pro¬ 
voking the Russians—why not $50 billion, or $5?). What is 
more, Kahn is quite aware of this vacuity; in his more judicious 
moments he claims only that “there is no reason to believe that 
relatively sophisticated models are more likely to be misleading 
than the simpler models and analogies frequently used as an aid 
to judgment.” For those whose humor tends towards the maca¬ 
bre, it is easy to play the game of “strategic thinking” a la Kahn, 
and to prove what one wishes. For example, one of Kahn’s basic 
assumptions is that “an all-out surprise attack in which all re¬ 
sources are devoted to counter-value targets would be so irra¬ 
tional that, barring an incredible lack of sophistication or actual

insanity among Soviet decision makers, such an attack is highly 
unlikely.” A simple argument proves the opposite. Premise 1: 
American decision makers think along the lines outlined by 
Herman Kahn. Premise 2: Kahn thinks it would be better for 
everyone to be red than for everyone to be dead. Premise 3: If 
the Americans were to respond to an all-out counter-value at¬ 
tack, then everyone would be dead. Conclusion: The Americans 
will not respond to an all-out counter-value attack, and therefore 
it should be launched without delay. Of course, one can carry 
the argument a step further. Fact: The Russians have not car¬ 
ried out an all-out counter-value attack. It follows that they are 
not rational. If they are not rational, there is no point in “stra¬ 
tegic thinking.” Therefore . . . 

Of course this is all nonsense, but nonsense that differs from 
Kahn's only in the respect that the argument is of slightly 
greater complexity than anything to be discovered in his work. 
What is remarkable is that serious people actually pay attention 
to these absurdities, no doubt because of the facade of tough¬ 
mindedness and pseudoscience. 

It is a curious and depressing fact that the “antiwar move¬ 
ment” falls prey all too often to similar confusions. In the fall of 
1965, for example, there was an International Conference on 
Alternative Perspectives on Vietnam, which circulated a pam¬
