The Responsibility of Intellectuals 


well-guarded secret. In the case of Vietnam, if those who feel 
themselves to be experts have access to principles or informa¬ 
tion that would justify what the American government is doing 
in that unfortunate country, they have been singularly ineffec¬ 
tive in making this fact known. To anyone who has any famil¬ 
iarity with the social and behavioral sciences (or the “policy 
sciences”), the claim that there are certain considerations and 
principles too deep for the outsider to comprehend is simply an 
absurdity, unworthy of comment. 

When we consider the responsibility of intellectuals, our 
basic concern must be their role in the creation and analysis of 
ideology. And in fact, Kristol’s contrast between the unreason¬ 
able ideological types and the responsible experts is formulated 
in terms that immediately bring to mind Daniel Bell’s interest¬ 
ing and influential essay on the “end of ideology,” 26 an essay 
which is as important for what it leaves unsaid as for its actual 
content. Bell presents and discusses the Marxist analysis of 
ideology as a mask for class interest, in particular quoting 
Marx’s well-known description of the belief of the bourgeoisie 
“that the special conditions of its emancipation are the general 
conditions through which alone modern society can be saved 
and the class struggle avoided.” He then argues that the age of 
ideology is ended, supplanted, at least in the West, by a general 
agreement that each issue must be settled on its own individual 
terms, within the framework of a welfare state in which, pre¬ 
sumably, experts in the conduct of public affairs will have a 
prominent role. Bell is quite careful, however, to characterize 
the precise sense of “ideology” in which “ideologies are ex¬ 
hausted.” He is referring only to ideology as “the conversion of 
ideas into social levers,” to ideology as “a set of beliefs, infused 
with passion, . . . [which] . . . seeks to transform the whole of a 
way of life.” The crucial words are “transform” and “convert

interest in converting ideas into social levers for the radical
