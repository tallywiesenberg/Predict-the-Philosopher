that social science can support a technology of social tinkering 
on a domestic or international scale. He then takes a further 
step, proceeding, in a familiar way, to claim universal validity 
for what is in fact a class interest: he argues that the special 
conditions on which his claims to power and authority are 
based are, in fact, the general conditions through which alone 
modern society can be saved; that social tinkering within a 
welfare state framework must replace the commitment to the 
“total ideologies” of the past, ideologies which were concerned 
with a transformation of society. Having found his position of 
power, having achieved security and affluence, he has no fur¬ 
ther need for ideologies that look to radical change. The scholar- 
expert replaces the “free-floating intellectual” who “felt that the 
wrong values were being honored, and rejected the society,” 
and who has now lost his political role (now, that is, that the 
right values are being honored). 

Conceivably, it is correct that the technical experts who will 
(or hope to) manage the “postindustrial society” will be able to 
cope with the classic problems without a radical transformation 
of society. Just so, it is conceivably true that the bourgeoisie 
was right in regarding the special conditions of its emancipation

as the general conditions through which alone modern society 
would be saved. In either case, an argument is in order, and 
skepticism is justified where none appears. 

Within the same framework of general utopianism, Bell goes 
on to pose the issue between welfare state scholar-experts and 
Third World ideologists in a rather curious way. He points out, 
quite correctly, that there is no issue of Communism, the content 
of that doctrine having been “long forgotten by friends and 
foes alike.” Rather, he says, “the question is an older one: 
whether new societies can grow by building democratic institu¬ 
tions and allowing people to make choices—and sacrifices— 
voluntarily, or whether the new elites, heady with power, will 
impose totalitarian means to transform their countries.” The 
question is an interesting one; it is odd, however, to see it 
referred to as “an older one.” Surely he cannot be suggesting 
that the West chose the democratic way—for example, that in 
England during the industrial revolution, the farmers voluntar¬ 
ily made the choice of leaving the land, giving up cottage 
industry, becoming an industrial proletariat, and voluntarily de¬ 
cided, within the framework of the existing democratic institu¬
