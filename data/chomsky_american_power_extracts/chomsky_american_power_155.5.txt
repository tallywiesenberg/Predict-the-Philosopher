tions, to make the sacrifices that are graphically described in the 
classic literature on nineteenth-century industrial society. One 
may debate the question whether authoritarian control is neces¬ 
sary to permit capital accumulation in the underdeveloped 
w r orld, but the Western model of development is hardly one 
that we can point to with any pride. It is perhaps not surprising 
to find a Walt Rostow referring to “the more humane processes 
[of industrialization] that Western values would suggest.” 27 
Those who have a serious concern for the problems that face 
backward countries and for the role that advanced industrial 
societies might, in principle, play in development and moderni-

The Responsibility of Intellectuals 


zation must use somewhat more care in interpreting the signifi¬ 
cance of the Western experience. 

Returning to the quite appropriate question, whether “new 
societies can grow by building democratic institutions” or only 
by totalitarian means, I think that honesty requires us to recog¬ 
nize that this question must be directed more to American intel¬ 
lectuals than to Third World ideologists. The backward coun¬ 
tries have incredible, perhaps insurmountable problems, and 
few available options; the United States has a wide range of 
options, and has the economic and technological resources, 
though evidently neither the intellectual nor the moral re¬ 
sources, to confront at least some of these problems. It is easy 
for an American intellectual to deliver homilies on the virtues of 
freedom and liberty, but if he is really concerned about, say, 
Chinese totalitarianism or the burdens imposed on the Chinese 
peasantry in forced industrialization, then he should face a task 
that is infinitely more significant and challenging—the task of 
creating, in the United States, the intellectual and moral cli¬ 
mate, as well as the social and economic conditions, that would 
permit this country to participate in modernization and devel¬ 
opment in a way commensurate with its material wealth and 
technical capacity. Massive capital gifts to Cuba and China 
might not succeed in alleviating the authoritarianism and terror 
that tend to accompany early stages of capital accumulation, 
but they are far more likely to have this effect than lectures on 
democratic values. It is possible that even without “capitalist 
encirclement” in its varying manifestations, the truly democratic 
elements in revolutionary movements—in some instances so¬ 
viets and collectives, for example—might be undermined by an 
“elite” of bureaucrats and technical intelligentsia; but it is a
