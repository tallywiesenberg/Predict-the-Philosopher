revolutionary movements now have to face, will guarantee this 
result. The lesson, for those who are concerned to strengthen 
the democratic, spontaneous, and popular elements in develop¬ 
ing societies, is quite clear. Lectures on the two-party system, or 
even the really substantial democratic values that have been in 
part realized in Western society, are a monstrous irrelevance in 
the face of the effort that is required to raise the level of culture 
in Western society to the point where it can provide a “social 
lever” for both economic development and the development of 
true democratic institutions in the Third World—and for that 
matter, at home as well. 

A good case can be made for the conclusion that there is 
indeed something of a consensus among intellectuals who have 
already achieved power and affluence, or who sense that they 
can achieve them by “accepting society” as it is and promoting 
the values that are “being honored” in this society. And it is also 
true that this consensus is most noticeable among the scholar- 
experts who are replacing the free-floating intellectuals of the 
past. In the university, these scholar-experts construct a “value- 
free technology” for the solution of technical problems that 
arise in contemporary society, 28 taking a “responsible stance” 
towards these problems, in the sense noted earlier. This con¬ 
sensus among the responsible scholar-experts is the domestic 
analogue to that proposed, in the international arena, by those 
who justify the application of American power in Asia, what¬ 
ever the human cost, on the grounds that it is necessary to 
contain the “expansion of China” (an “expansion” which is, to 
be sure, hypothetical for the time being) 29 —to translate from 
State Department Newspeak, on the grounds that it is essential 
to reverse the Asian nationalist revolutions, or at least to pre¬ 
vent them from spreading. The analogy becomes clear when we 
look carefully at the ways in which this proposal is formulated.
