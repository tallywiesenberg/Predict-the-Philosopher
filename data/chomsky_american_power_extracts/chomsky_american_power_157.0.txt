achieve independence from foreign domination or to overthrow 
semifeudal structures supported by foreign powers, or if the 
Chinese irrationally refuse to respond properly to the schedule 
of reinforcement that we have prepared for them, if they object 
to being encircled by the benign and peace-loving “rich men” 
who control the territories on their borders as a natural right, 
then, evidently, we must respond to this belligerence with ap¬ 
propriate force. 

It is this mentality that explains the frankness with which the 
United States government and its academic apologists defend 
the American refusal to permit a political settlement in Vietnam 
at a local level, a settlement based on the actual distribution of 
political forces. Even government experts freely admit that the 
National Liberation Front is the only “truly mass-based political 
party in South Vietnam”; 33 that the NLF had “made a con¬ 
scious and massive effort to extend political participation, even 
if it was manipulated, on the local level so as to involve the peo¬ 
ple in a self-contained, self-supporting revolution” (p. 374); 
and that this effort had been so successful that no political 
groups, “with the possible exception of the Buddhists, thought 
themselves equal in size and power to risk entering into a coali¬ 
tion, fearing that if they did the w T hale would swallow the min¬ 
now” (p. 362). Moreover, they concede that until the introduc¬ 
tion of overwhelming American force, the NLF had insisted 
that the struggle “should be fought out at the political level and 
that the use of massed military might was in itself illegitimate. 
. . . The battleground was to be the minds and loyalties of the 
rural Vietnamese, the weapons were to be ideas” (pp. 91-92; cf. 
also pp. 93, 99-108, 155 f.); and correspondingly, that until mid- 
1964, aid from Hanoi “was largely confined to two areas—doc-

trinal know-how and leadership personnel” (p. 321). Captured 
NLF documents contrast the enemy's “military superiority” 
with their own “political superiority” (p. 106), thus fully con¬ 
firming the analysis of American military spokesmen who define 
our problem as how, “with considerable armed force but little 
political power, [to] contain an adversary who has enormous 
political force but only modest military power.” 34 

Similarly, the most striking outcome of both the Honolulu 
conference in February and the Manila conference in October 
was the frank admission by high officials of the Saigon govern¬
