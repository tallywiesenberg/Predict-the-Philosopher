solutions that are put under the label of neutralization,” this 
would amount to capitulation to the Communists . 37 According 
to this reasoning, then, South Vietnam must remain, perma¬ 
nently, an American military base. 

All of this is of course reasonable, so long as we accept the 
fundamental political axiom that the United States, with its 
traditional concern for the rights of the weak and downtrodden, 
and with its unique insight into the proper mode of develop¬ 
ment for backward countries, must have the courage and the 
persistence to impose its will by force until such time as other 
nations are prepared to accept these truths—or simply to aban¬ 
don hope.

truth, it is also his duty to see events in their historical perspec¬ 
tive. Thus one must applaud the insistence of the Secretary of 
State on the importance of historical analogies, the Munich 
analogy, for example. As Munich showed, a powerful and ag¬ 
gressive nation with a fanatic belief in its manifest destiny will 
regard each victory, each extension of its power and authority, 
as a prelude to the next step. The matter was very well put by 
Adlai Stevenson, when he spoke of “the old, old route whereby 
expansive powers push at more and more doors, believing they 
will open, until, at the ultimate door, resistance is unavoidable 
and major war breaks out.” Herein lies the danger of appease¬ 
ment, as the Chinese tirelessly point out to the Soviet Union, 
which they claim is playing Chamberlain to our Hitler in Viet¬ 
nam. Of course, the aggressiveness of liberal imperialism is not 
that of Nazi Germany, though the distinction may seem rather 
academic to a Vietnamese peasant who is being gassed or in¬ 
cinerated. We do not want to occupy Asia; we merely wish, to 
return to Mr. Wolf, “to help the Asian countries progress 
toward economic modernization, as relatively ‘open’ and stable 
societies, to which our access, as a country and as individual 
citizens, is free and comfortable .” 38 The formulation is appro¬ 
priate. Recent history shows that it makes little difference to us 
what form of government a country has as long as it remains an 
“open society,” in our peculiar sense of this term—a society, 
that is, which remains open to American economic penetration 
or political control. If it is necessary to approach genocide in 
Vietnam to achieve this objective, then this is the price we must
