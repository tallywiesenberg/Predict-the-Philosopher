thing so complex it was felt that it would be a self-defeating 
thing.” 

Fortunately, this particular story has a happy ending. The 
remarks just quoted were made in February 1966, and within a 
few weeks, the Indian government had seen the light, as we 
read in a series of reports in the New York Times. The criticism, 
inside India, that “the American Government and the World 
Bank would like to arrogate to themselves the right to lay down 
the framework in which our economy must function,” was 
stilled (April 24); and the Indian government accepted the 
conditions for resumed economic aid, namely, “that India pro¬ 
vide easier terms for foreign private investment in fertilizer 
plants” and that the American investors “have substantial man¬ 
agement rights” (May 14). The development is summarized in 
a dispatch datelined April 28, from New Delhi, in these terms: 

There are signs of change. The Government has granted easy 
terms to private foreign investors in the fertilizer industry, is 
thinking about decontrolling several more industries and is ready 
to liberalize import policy if it gets sufficient foreign aid. . . . 
Much of what is happening now is a result of steady pressure 
from the United States and the International Bank for Recon¬ 
struction and Development, which for the last year have been 
urging a substantial freeing of the Indian economy and a greater 
scope for private enterprise. The United States pressure, in par¬ 
ticular, has been highly effective here because the United States 
provides by far the largest part of the foreign exchange needed to 
finance India’s development and keep the wheels of industry turn¬ 
ing. Call them “strings,” call them “conditions” or whatever one 
likes, India has little choice now but to agree to many of the 
terms that the United States, through the World Bank, is putting 
on its aid. For India simply has nowhere else to turn. 

The heading of the article refers to this development as In¬ 
dia’s “drift from socialism to pragmatism.” 

Even this was not enough, however. Thus we read a few
