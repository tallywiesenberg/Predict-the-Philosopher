It is impossible even to imagine what Brzezinski thinks a 
“universal electronic-computer language” may be, or what cul¬ 
tural values he thinks will be created by the new “technologi¬ 
cally dominant and conditioned technetron” who, he apparently 
believes, may prove to be the true “repository of that indefinable 
quality we call human.” It would hardly be rewarding to try to 
disentangle Brzezinski’s confusions and misunderstandings. What 
is interesting, rather, is the way his dim awareness of current de¬ 
velopments in science and technology is used to provide an 
ideological justification for the “increasing role in the key de¬ 
cision-making institutions of individuals with special intellectual 
and scientific attainments,” the new “organisation-oriented, ap¬ 
plication-minded intellectuals” based in the university, “the 
creative eye of the massive communications complex.” 

Parallel to the assumption that all is basically well at home is 
the widely articulated belief that the problems of international 
society, too, would be subject to intelligent management were it 
not for the machinations of the Communists. One aspect of this 
complacence is the belief that the Cold War was entirely the 
result of Russian (later Chinese) aggressiveness. For example, 
Daniel Bell has described the origins of the Cold War in the 
following terms: “When the Russians began stirring up the 
Greek guerrilla EAM in what had been tacitly acknowledged at

Teheran as a British sphere of influence, the Communists began 
their cry against Anglo-American imperialism. Following the 
rejection of the Marshall Plan and the Communist coup in 
Czechoslovakia in February, 1948, the Cold War was on in 
earnest.’’ 15 Clearly, this will hardly do as a balanced and objec¬ 
tive statement of the origins of the Cold War, but the distortion 
it reflects is an inherent element in Bell’s optimism about the 
new society, since it enables him to maintain that our Cold War 
posture is purely reactive, and that once Communist belliger¬ 
ence is tamed, the new technical intelligentsia can turn its at¬ 
tention to the construction of a more decent society. 

A related element in the ideology of the liberal intellectual is 
the firm belief in the fundamental generosity of Western policy 
towards the Third World. Adam Ulam again provides a typical 
example: “Problems of an international society undergoing an 
economic and ideological revolution seem to defy ... the gen¬ 
erosity—granted its qualifications and errors—that has charac¬ 
terized the policy of the leading democratic powers of the 
West.” 16 Even Hans Morgenthau succumbs to this illusion. He
