This brilliant book received little notice at the 
time of its first publication, no doubt because the picture Orwell drew 
was in sharp conflict with established liberal dogma.The attention that 
it has received as a cold-war document since its republication in 1952 
would, I suspect, have been of little comfort to the author.71.Cited by Rocker, The Tragedy of Spain, p. 28.141
