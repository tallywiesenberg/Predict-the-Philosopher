It is because of the 
essential accuracy of Borkenau’s account that I think Hobsbawm {op.cit.)is quite mistaken in believing that the Communist policy “was 
undoubtedly the only one which could have won the Civil War.” In 
fact, the Communist policy was bound to fail, because it was predi¬ 
cated on the assumption that the Western democracies would join the 
antifascist effort if only Spain could be preserved as, in effect, a 
Western colony.Once the Communist leaders saw the futility of this 
hope, they abandoned the struggle, which was not in their eyes an 
effort to win the Civil War, but only to serve the interests of Russian 
foreign policy.I also disagree with Hobsbawm’s analysis of the 
anarchist revolution, cited earlier, for reasons that are implicit in this 
entire discussion.
