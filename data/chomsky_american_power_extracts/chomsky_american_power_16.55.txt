They kindled in everyone 
the required sense of responsibility, and knew how by eloquent appeals 
to keep alive the spirit of sacrifice for the general welfare of the people.As a Social Democrat I speak here with inner joy and sincere 
admiration of my experience in Catalonia.The anti-capitalist trans¬ 
formation took place here without their having to resort to a dictator¬ 
ship.The members of the syndicates are their own masters, and carry 
on production and the distribution of the products of labor under their 
own management with the advice of technical experts in whom they 
have confidence.The enthusiasm of the workers is so great that they 
scorn any personal advantage and are concerned only for the welfare 
of all.
