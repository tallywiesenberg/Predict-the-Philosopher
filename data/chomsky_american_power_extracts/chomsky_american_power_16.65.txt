46—47.83.Ibid.Richards suggests that the refusal of the central government 
to support the Aragon front may have been motivated in part by the 
general policy of counterrevolution.‘‘This front, largely manned by 
members of the C.N.T.-F.A.I., was considered of great strategic im¬ 
portance by the anarchists, having as its ultimate objective the linking 
of Catalonia with the Basque country and Asturias, i.e., a linking of 
the industrial region [of Catalonia] w r ith an important source of raw 
materials.” Again, it would be interesting to undertake a detailed in¬ 
vestigation of this topic.
