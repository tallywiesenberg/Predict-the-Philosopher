briefly below (see note 33). 

It is interesting to see the first, somewhat oblique published reac¬ 
tions to The Politics of Escalation by those who defend our right to 
conquer South Vietnam and institute a government of our choice. For 
example, Robert Scalapino ( New York Times Magazine , December 

II, 1966) argues that the thesis of the book implies that our leaders 
are “diabolical.” Since no right-thinking person can believe this, the 
thesis is refuted. To assume otherwise would betray “irresponsibility,” 
in a unique sense of this term—a sense that gives an ironic twist to the 
title of this chapter. He goes on to point out the alleged central 
weakness in the argument of the book, namely, the failure to perceive 
that a serious attempt on our part to pursue the possibilities for a 
diplomatic settlement would have been interpreted by our adversaries 
as a sign of weakness.

5. At other times, Schlesinger does indeed display admirable scholarly 
caution. For example, in his introduction to The Politics of Escalation 
he admits that there may have been “flickers of interest in negotia¬ 
tions” on the part of Hanoi. As to the administration’s lies about 
negotiations and its repeated actions undercutting tentative initiatives 
towards negotiations, he comments only that the authors may have 
underestimated military necessity and that future historians may prove 
them wrong. This caution and detachment must be compared with 
Schlesinger’s attitude towards renewed study of the origins of the Cold 
War: in a letter to the New York Review of Books, October 20, 1966, 
he remarks that it is time to “blow the whistle” on revisionist attempts 
to show that the Cold War may have been the consequence of some¬ 
thing more than mere Communist belligerence. We are to believe, 
then, that the relatively straightforward matter of the origins of the 
Cold War is settled beyond discussion, whereas the much more com¬ 
plex issue of why the United States shies away from a negotiated 
settlement in Vietnam must be left to future historians to ponder.
