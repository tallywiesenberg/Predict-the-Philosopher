continues, the United States is not certain that all of these are volun¬ 
tary adherents. This is not the first such demonstration of Communist 
duplicity. Another example was seen in the year 1962, when according 
to United States government sources 15,000 guerrillas suffered 30.000 
casualties. See Arthur Schlesinger, A Thousand Days, p. 982.

On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties (New York, The 
Free Press, 1960), pp. 369-75. I have no intention here of entering into 
the full range of issues that have been raised in the discussion of the 
“end of ideology” for the past dozen years. It is difficult to see how a 
rational person could quarrel with many of the theses that have been 
put forth, e.g., that at a certain historical moment the “politics of 
civility” is appropriate, and perhaps efficacious; that one who advo¬ 
cates action (or inaction—a matter less frequently noted) has a re¬ 
sponsibility to assess its social cost; that dogmatic fanaticism and 
“secular religions” should be combated (or if possible ignored); that 
technical solutions to problems should be implemented, where possi¬ 
ble; that “le dogmatisme ideologique devait disparaitre pour que les 
idees reprissent vie” (Aron); and so on. Since this is sometimes taken to 
be an expression of an “anti-Marxist” position, it is worth keeping in 
mind that such sentiments as these have no bearing on non-Bolshevik 
Marxism, as represented, for example, by such figures as Luxemburg, 
Pannekoek, Korsch, Arthur Rosenberg, and many others.

important, given the clear commitments of those who apply it. The 
problems with which research is concerned are those posed by the 
Pentagon or the great corporations, not, say, by the revolutionaries of

northeast Brazil or by SNCC. Nor am I aware of a research project 
devoted to the problem of how poorly armed guerrillas might more 
effectively resist a brutal and devastating military technology—surely 
the kind of problem that would have interested the free-floating intel¬ 
lectual who is now hopelessly out of date. 

29. In view of the unremitting propaganda barrage on “Chinese 
expansionism/’ perhaps a word of comment is in order. Typical of 
American propaganda on this subject is Adlai Stevenson’s assessment, 
shortly before his death (cf. New York Times Magazine, March 13,
