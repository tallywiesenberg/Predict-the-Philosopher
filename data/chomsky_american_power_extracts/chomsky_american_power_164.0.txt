ceivable that at some future time a powerful China may be expan¬ 
sionist. We may speculate about such possibilities if we wish, but it is 
American aggressiveness that is the central fact of current politics.

service officer working at the Center for International Studies, MIT, 
poses a contrast between our side, which sympathizes with “the usual 
revolutionary stirrings . . . around the world because they reflect 
inadequate living standards or oppressive and corrupt governments,” 
and the backers of “revolutionary guerrilla warfare,” which “opposes 
the aspirations of people while apparently furthering them, manipu¬ 
lates the individual by persuading him to manipulate himself.” Revo¬ 
lutionary guerrilla warfare is “an imported product, revolution from 
the outside” (other examples besides the Vietcong are “Stalin’s ex¬ 
portation of armed revolution,” the Haganah in Palestine, and the 
Irish Republican Army—see pp. 32-33). The Vietcong could not be an 
indigenous movement since it has “a social construction program of 
such scope and ambition that of necessity it must have been created in 
Hanoi” (p. 76—but on pp. 77-79 we read that “organizational activity 
had gone on intensively and systematically for several years” before 
the Lao Dong party in Hanoi had made its decision “to begin building 
an organization”). On p. 80 we find that “such an effort had to be the 
child of the North,” even though elsewhere we read of the prominent 
role of the Cao Dai (p. 74), “the first major social group to begin 
actively opposing the Diem government” (p. 222), and of the Hoa

Pike takes it as proof of Communist duplicity that in the South the 
party insisted it was “Marxist-Leninist,” thus “indicating philosophic 
but not political allegiance,” whereas in the North it described itself as 
a “Marxist-Leninist organization,” thus “indicating that it was in the 
main-stream of the world-wide Communist movement” (p. 150). And 
so on. Also revealing is the contempt for “Cinderella and all the other 
fools [who] could still believe there was magic in the mature world if 
one mumbled the secret incantation: solidarity, union, concord”; for
