Coffin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber to two-year prison sentences for 
“conspiracy.” For details, see Noam Chomsky, Paul Lauter, and Florence 
Howe, “Reflections on a Political Trial,” New York Review of Books, August 
22, 1968, pp. 23-30. The Pentagon demonstration, which by some estimates in¬ 
volved several hundred thousand people, was a remarkable, unforgettable 
manifestation of opposition to the war. The spirit and character of the demon¬ 
strations are captured, with marvelous accuracy and perception, in Norman 
Mailer’s The Armies of the Night (New York, New American Library, 1968).

*— AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

For many of the participants, the Washington demonstrations 
symbolized the transition “from dissent to resistance.” I will 
return to this slogan and its meaning, but I want to make clear 
at the outset that I do feel it to be not only accurate with 
respect to the mood of the demonstrations but, properly inter¬ 
preted, appropriate to the present state of protest against the 
war. There is an irresistible dynamics to such protest. One may 
begin by writing articles and giving speeches about the war, by 
helping in many ways to create an atmosphere of concern and 
outrage. A courageous few will turn to direct action, refusing to 
take their place alongside the “good Germans” we have all 
learned to despise. Some will be forced to this decision when 
they are called up for military service. The dissenting senators, 
writers, and professors will watch as young men refuse to serve 
in the armed forces, in a war that they detest. What then ? Can 
those who write and speak against the war take refuge in the 
fact that they have not urged or encouraged draft resistance, 
but have merely helped to develop a climate of opinion in 
which any decent person will want to refuse to take part in a 
miserable war ? It is a very thin line. Nor is it very easy to watch 
from a position of safety while others are forced to take a grim 
and painful step. The fact is that most of the one thousand draft 
cards and other documents turned in to the Justice Department 
on October 20 came from men who can escape military service 
but who insisted on sharing the fate of those who are less privi¬ 
leged. In such ways the circle of resistance widens. Quite apart 
from this, no one can fail to see that to the extent that he restricts 
his protest, to the extent that he rejects actions that are open to 
him, he accepts complicity in what the government does. Some 
will act on this realization, posing sharply a moral issue that no 
person of conscience can evade.
