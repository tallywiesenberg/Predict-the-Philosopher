AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


war. They have to face this decision alone, or almost alone. We 
should ask ourselves why this is so. 

Why, for example, does Senator Mansfield feel “ashamed for 
the image they have portrayed of this country, 1 ” and not feel 
ashamed for the image of this country portrayed by the institu¬ 
tion these young people were confronting, an institution di¬ 
rected by a sane and mild and eminently reasonable man who 
can testify calmly before Congress that the amount of ordnance 
expended in Vietnam has surpassed the total expended in Ger¬ 
many and Italy in World War II ? Why is it that Senator Mans¬ 
field can speak in ringing phrases about those who are not 
living up to our commitment to “a government of laws”—refer¬ 
ring to a small group of demonstrators, not to the ninety-odd 
responsible men on the Senate floor who are watching, with full 
knowledge, as the state they serve clearly, flagrantly violates the 
explicit provisions of the United Nations Charter, the supreme 
law 7 of the land? He kmrws quite w^ell that prior to our invasion 
of Vietnam there was no armed attack against any state. It was 
Senator Mansfield, after all, w T ho informed us that “when the 
sharp increase in the American military effort began in early 
1965, it w^as estimated that only about 400 North Vietnamese 
soldiers w r ere among the enemy forces in the South w T hich 
totaled 140,000 at that time”; and it is the Mansfield Report 
from w 7 hich we learn that at that time there were 34,000 Ameri¬ 
can soldiers already in South Vietnam, in violation of our 
“solemn commitment” at Geneva in 1954. 

The point should be pursued. After the first International 
Days of Protest in October 1965, Senator Mansfield criticized 
the “sense of utter irresponsibility” shown by the demonstrators. 
He had nothing to say then, nor has he since, about the “sense 
of utter irresponsibility” showm by Senator Mansfield and others 
w r ho stand by quietly and vote appropriations as the cities and

villages of North Vietnam are demolished, as millions of refu¬ 
gees in the South are driven from their homes by American 
bombardment. He has nothing to say about the moral standards 
or the respect for law of those who have permitted this 
tragedy.
