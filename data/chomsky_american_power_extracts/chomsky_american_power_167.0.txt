determine just what was taking place at the Pentagon. All we 
could see was the surging of the crowd. From secondhand re¬ 
ports, I understand that the marchers passed through and 
around the front line of troops and took up a position, which 
they maintained, on the steps of the Pentagon. It soon became 
obvious that it was wrong for the few organizers of the march 
and the mostly middle-aged group that had gathered near them 
to remain at the speakers’ platform while the demonstrators 
themselves, most of them quite young, were at the Pentagon. (I 
recall seeing near the platform Robert Lowell, Dwight Mac¬ 
donald, Monsignor Rice, Sidney Lens, Benjamin Spock and his 
wife, Dagmar Wilson, Donald Kalish.) Dave Dellinger sug¬ 
gested that we try to approach the Pentagon. We found a place 
not yet blocked by the demonstrators, and walked up to the line 
of troops standing a few feet from the building. Dellinger sug¬ 
gested that those of us who had not yet spoken at the rally talk 
directly to the soldiers through a small portable sound system. 
From this point on, my impressions are rather fragmentary. 
Monsignor Rice spoke, and I followed. As I was speaking, the 
line of soldiers advanced, moving past me—a rather odd expe-

suppose, that we were there because we didn’t want the sol¬ 
diers to kill and be killed, but I do remember feeling that the 
way I was putting it seemed silly and irrelevant. 

The advancing line of soldiers had partially scattered the 
small group that had come with Dellinger. Those of us who had 
been left behind the line of soldiers regrouped, and Dr. Spock 
began to speak. Almost at once, another line of soldiers 
emerged from somewhere, this time in a tightly massed forma¬ 
tion, rifles in hand, and moved slowly forward. We sat down. 
As I mentioned earlier, I had no intention of taking part in any 
act of civil disobedience, until that moment. But when that 
grotesque organism began slowly advancing—more grotesque 
because its cells were recognizable human beings—it became 
obvious that one could not permit that thing to dictate what 
one was going to do. I was arrested at that point by a federal 
marshal, presumably for obstructing the soldiers (the technical 
term for this behavior is “disorderly conduct”) I should add 
that the soldiers, so far as I could see (which was not very far), 
seemed rather unhappy about the whole matter, and were 
being about as gentle as one can be when ordered (I presume
