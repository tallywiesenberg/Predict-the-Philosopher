further encourage the ideologists and administrators of forceful 
repression. What is more, one hopes that participants in non¬ 
violent resistance will themselves become human beings of a 
more admirable sort. No one can fail to be impressed by the 
personal qualities of those who have grown to maturity in the 
civil rights movement. Whatever else it may have accom¬ 
plished, the civil rights movement has made an inestimable 
contribution to American society in transforming the lives and 
characters of those who took part in it. Perhaps a program of 
principled, nonviolent resistance can do the same for many 
others, in the particular circumstances that we face today. It is 
not impossible that this may save the country from a terrible 
future, from yet another generation of men who think it clever 
to discuss the bombing of North Vietnam as a question of tac¬ 
tics and cost-effectiveness, or who support our attempt to con¬ 
quer South Vietnam, with the human cost that they well know, 
blandly asserting that “our primary motivation is self-interest— 
the self-interest of our own country in this shrinking world” 
(Citizens Committee for Peace with Freedom, New York 
Times , October 26, 1967). 

Returning to the demonstrations, I must admit that I was 
relieved to find people whom I had respected for years in the 
prison dormitory—Norman Mailer, Jim Peck, Dave Dellinger, 
and a number of others. I think it was reassuring to many of the 
kids who were there to be able to feel that they were not totally 
disconnected from a world that they knew and from people 
whom they admired. It was moving to see that defenseless 
young people who had a great deal to lose w r ere willing to be 
jailed for what they believed—young instructors from state uni¬ 
versities, college kids who have a very bright future if they are 
willing to toe the line, many others whom I could not identify. 

What comes next? Obviously, that is the question on every-
