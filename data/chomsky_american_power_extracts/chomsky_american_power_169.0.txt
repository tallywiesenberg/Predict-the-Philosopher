nents of the war give to the political and social problems of 
Vietnam. Those who were opposed to the Japanese conquest of 
Manchuria a generation ago did not place emphasis on the 
political and social and economic problems of Manchuria, but 
on those of Japan. They did not engage in farcical debate over 
the exact degree of support for the puppet emperor, but looked 
to the sources of Japanese imperialism. Now opponents of the 
war can much more easily shift attention to the source of the 
aggression, to our own country, its ideology and institutions. 
We can ask whose “interest” is served by 100,000 casualties and 
100 billion dollars expended in the attempt to subjugate a small 
country halfway around the world. We can point to the absur¬ 
dity of the idea that we are “containing China” by destroying 
popular and independent forces on its borders, and to the cyni¬ 
cism of the claim that we are in Vietnam because “to Ameri¬ 
cans, peace and freedom are inseparable” and because “sup¬ 
pression of freedom” must not “go unchallenged” (the Citizens 
Committee again). We can ask why it is that those who make 
this claim do not suggest that an American expeditionary force 
be sent to Taiwan, to Rhodesia, to Greece, or to Mississippi, but 
only to Vietnam, where, they want us to believe, the master 
aggressor Mao Tse-tung is following a Hitlerian course in his 
cunning way, committing aggression without troops and an¬ 
nouncing world conquest by insisting, through the medium of 
Lin Piao, that indigenous wars of national liberation can expect 
little from China beyond applause. We can ask why Secretary 
McNamara reads such statements as a new Mein Kampj —or 
why those who admit that “a Vietnamese communist regime

Survey, August 1967) nevertheless sign statements which pre¬ 
tend that in Vietnam we are facing the expansionist aggressors 
from Peking. We can ask what factors in American ideology 
make it so easy for intelligent and well-informed men to say that 
we “insist upon nothing for South Vietnam except that it be free 
to chart its own future” (Citizens Committee) although they 
know quite well that the regime we imposed excluded all those 
who took part in the struggle against French colonialism, “and 
properly so” (Secretary Rusk, 1963) ; that we have since been 
attempting to suppress a “civil insurrection” (General Stillwell) 
led by the only “truly mass-based political party in South Viet¬
