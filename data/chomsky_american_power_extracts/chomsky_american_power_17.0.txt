substitute words for acts while concentrating upon domestic 
issues.” Still, we cannot be certain of this and must therefore 
continue our efforts to tame the dragon. One of the gravest 
problems posed by China is its policy of “isolationist fanaticism” 
—obviously, a serious threat to peace. Another danger is the

terrifying figure of Mao Tse-tung, a romantic, who refuses to 
accept the “bureaucratism essential to the ordering of this 
enormously complex, extremely difficult society.” The moder¬ 
ate scholars would feel much more at ease with the familiar sort 
of technical expert, who is committed to the “triumph of bu¬ 
reaucratism” and who refrains from romantic efforts to under¬ 
mine the party apparatus and the discipline it imposes. 

Furthermore, the moderate scholars announce their support 
for “our basic position” in Vietnam. A Communist victory in 
Vietnam, they argue, would “gravely jeopardize the possibilities 
for a political equilibrium in Asia, seriously damage our credi¬ 
bility, deeply affect the morale—and the policies—of our Asian 
allies and the neutrals.” By a “political equilibrium,” they do 
not, of course, refer to the status quo as of 1945-1946 or as 
outlined by international agreement at Geneva in 1954. They do 
not explain why the credibility of the United States is more 
important than the credibility of the indigenous elements 
in Vietnam who have dedicated themselves to a war of national 
liberation. Nor do they explain why the morale of the military 
dictatorships of Thailand and Taiwan must be preserved. They 
merely hint darkly of the dangers of a third world war, dangers 
which are real enough and which are increased when advocates 
of revolutionary change face an external counterrevolutionary 
force. In principle, such dangers can be lessened by damping 
revolutionary ardor or by withdrawing the counterrevolutionary 
force. The latter alternative, however, is unthinkable, irrespon¬ 
sible. 

The crucial assumption in the program of the moderate 
scholars is that we must not encourage “those elements com¬ 
mitted to the thesis that violence is the best means of effecting 
change.” It is important to recognize that it is not violence as 
such to which the moderate scholars object. On the contrary,
