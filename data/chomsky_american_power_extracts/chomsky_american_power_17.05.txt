Orwellâ€™s description of Barcelona in 
December (pp.4-5), when he arrived for the first time, deserves more 
extensive quotation: 

It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the 
working class was in the saddle.Practically every building of any 
size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or 
with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was 
scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the 
revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its 
images burnt.Churches here and there were being systematically 
demolished by gangs of workmen.Every shop and cafe had an 
inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks 
had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black.
