Waiters 
and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal.Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily dis¬ 
appeared.Nobody said “Senor” or “Don” or even “Usted”; everyone 
called everyone else “Comrade” and “Thou,” and said “Salud!” instead 
of “Buenos dias.” Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time 
of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a 
lecture from an hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy.There 
were no private motor cars, they had all been commandeered, and all 
the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted 
red and black.The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming 
from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining 
advertisements look like daubs of mud.
