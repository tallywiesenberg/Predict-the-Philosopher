Down the Ramblas, the wide 
central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed con¬ 
stantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary 
songs all day and far into the night.And it was the aspect of the 
crowds that was the queerest thing of all.In outward appearance it 
was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to 
exist.Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were 
no “well-dressed” people at all.Practically everyone wore rough 
working-class clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of the militia 
uniform.
