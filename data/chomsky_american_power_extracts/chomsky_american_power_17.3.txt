There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still ex¬ 
tremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and 
no beggars except the gipsies.Above all, there was a belief in the 
revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into 
an era of equality and freedom.Human beings were trying to behave 
as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.In the 
barbers’ shops were Anarchist notices (the barbers were mostly An¬ 
archists) solemnly explaining that barbers were no longer slaves.In 
the streets were coloured posters appealing to prostitutes to stop being 
prostitutes.
