To anyone from the hard-boiled, sneering civilization of the 
English-speaking races there was something rather pathetic in the 
literalness with which these idealistic Spaniards took the hackneyed 
phrases of revolution.At that time revolutionary ballads of the 
naiVest kind, all about proletarian brotherhood and the wickedness of 
Mussolini, were being sold on the streets for a few centimes each.I 
have often seen an illiterate militiaman buy one of these ballads, 
laboriously spell out the words, and then, when he had got the hang 
of it, begin singing it to an appropriate tune.Recall the dates.Orwell arrived in Barcelona in late December 1936.
