peasants without enthusiasm, who would sabotage it until it failed.Vol¬ 
untary collectivization may seem the longer course, but the example of

who are profoundly realistic and practical, whereas forced collectiviza¬ 
tion would end by discrediting socialized agriculture” (cited by Bolloten

the anarchist and left-socialist spokesmen were often violated in prac¬
