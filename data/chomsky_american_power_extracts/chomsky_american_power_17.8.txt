153-54), “A British cruiser and 
two British destroyers had closed in upon the harbour, and no doubt 
there were other warships not far away.The English newspapers gave 
it out that these ships were proceeding to Barcelona ‘to protect British 
interests/ but in fact they made no move to do so; that is, they did not 
land any men or take off any refugees.There can be no certainty 
about this, but it was at least inherently likely that the British Gov¬ 
ernment, which had not raised a finger to save the Spanish Govern¬ 
ment from Franco, would intervene quickly enough to save it from its 
own working class.” This assumption may well have influenced the left- 
wing leadership to restrain the Barcelona workers from simply taking 
control of the whole city, as apparently they could easily have done in 
the initial stages of the May Days.Hugh Thomas comments (The Spanish Civil War , p. 428) that 
there was “no reason” for Orwell’s “apprehension” on this matter.In 
the light of the British record with regard to Spain, it seems to me that 
Thomas is simply unrealistic, as compared with Orwell, in this re¬ 
spect.
