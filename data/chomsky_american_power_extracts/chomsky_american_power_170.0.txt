far), is not only a highly principled and courageous act, but one 
that might receive broad support and become politically effec¬ 
tive. It might, furthermore, succeed in raising the issues of pas¬ 
sive complicity in the war which are now much too easily 
evaded. Those who face these issues may even go on to free 
themselves from the mind-destroying ideological pressures of 
American life, and to ask some serious questions about Amer- 
ca’s role in the world, and the sources, in American society, for 
this criminal behavior. 

Moreover, I feel that this objection to resistance is not prop¬ 
erly formulated. The “peace movement” exists only in the fanta¬ 
sies of the paranoid right. Those who find some of the means 
employed or ends pursued objectionable can oppose the war in 
other ways. They will not be read out of a movement that does

not exist; they have only themselves to blame if they do not 
make use of the other forms of protest that are available. 

I have left to the end the most important question, the one 
about which I have least to say. This is the question of the 
forms resistance should take. We all take part in the war to a 
greater or lesser extent, if only by paying taxes and permitting 
domestic society to function smoothly. A person has to choose 
for himself the point at which he will simply refuse to take part 
any longer. Reaching that point, he will be drawn into resist¬ 
ance. I believe that the reasons for resistance I have already 
mentioned are cogent ones: they have an irreducible moral ele¬ 
ment that admits of little discussion. The issue is posed in its 
starkest form for the boy who faces induction, and in a form 
that is somewhat more complex for the boy who must decide 
whether to participate in a system of selective service that may 
pass the burden from him to others less fortunate and less privi¬ 
leged. It is difficult for me to see how anyone can refuse to 
engage himself, in some way, in the plight of these young men. 
There are many ways to do so: legal aid and financial support; 
participation in support demonstrations; draft counseling, or¬ 
ganization of draft-resistance unions or community-based re¬ 
sistance organizations; assisting those who wish to escape the 
country; the steps proposed by the clergymen who recently 
announced that they are ready to share the fate of those who 
will be sent to prison. About this aspect of the program of 
resistance I have nothing to say that will not be obvious to
