*= AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

A third option would be an invasion of North Vietnam. This 
would saddle us with two unwinnable guerrilla wars instead of 
one, but if the timing is right, it might be used as a device to 
rally the citizenry around the flag. 

A fourth possibility is an attack on China. We could then 
abandon Vietnam and turn to a winnable war directed against 
Chinese industrial capacity. Such a move should win the 
election. No doubt this prospect also appeals to that insane 
rationality called “strategic thinking/’ If we intend to keep 
armies of occupation or even strong military bases on the Asian 
mainland, we would do well to make sure that the Chinese do 
not have the means to threaten them. Of course, there is the 
danger of a nuclear holocaust, but it is difficult to see why this 
should trouble those whom John McDermott calls the “crisis 
managers,” the same men who were willing, in 1962, to accept a 
high probability of nuclear war to establish the principle that 
we, and we alone, have the right to keep missiles on the borders 
of a potential enemy. 

There are many who regard “negotiations” as a realistic alter¬ 
native, but I do not understand the logic or even the content of 
this proposal. If we stop bombing North Vietnam we might 
well enter into negotiations with Hanoi, but there would then 
be very little to discuss. As to South Vietnam, the only negotia¬ 
ble issue is the withdrawal of foreign troops; other matters can 
only be settled among whatever Vietnamese groups have sur¬ 
vived the American onslaught. The call for “negotiations” 
seems to me not only empty, but actually a trap for those who 
oppose the war. If we do not agree to withdraw our troops, the 
negotiations will be deadlocked, the fighting will continue, 
American troops will be fired on and killed, the military will 
have a persuasive argument to escalate, to save American lives. 
In short, the Symington solution: we offer them peace on our

Of the realistic options, only withdrawal (however dis¬
