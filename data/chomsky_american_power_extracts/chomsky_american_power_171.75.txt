Personally, I feel that disruptive acts of this sort would be 
justified were they likely to be effective in averting an imminent 
tragedy. I am skeptical, however, about their possible effectiveÂ¬ 
ness. At the moment, I cannot imagine a broad base for such 
action, in the white community at least, outside the universities.
