AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


★== 

X. As he analyzes the situation, “the war will end when the 
American middle class wants it to” and “what will cause the 
middle class to want an end to the war will be the conjunction

in effort and money to deal with taxes, inflation, disruption, and 
obstruction at home.” It follows, then, “that the most effective 
antiwar activities are those which are the most disruptive, the 
most costly, those which most undermine the authority of the 
government domestically and in its war policy”—ghetto rebel¬

authority to be questioned and that will “escalate the cost” to 
the government. He therefore opposes the individual act of 
“confrontation” and describes the “notion of the alternatives— 
the military, prison, or exile” sketched in my article as “too 
limited, constrained by lack of experience and by lack of a full 
comprehension of what is to be done.” “We have work to do, or 
simply lives to live, and don’t intend to make their job easier or 
our lives more miserable.” His advice is “to make them pay the 
piper, who called the tune. That is what black folks know, who 
sing and dance all the time.” 

My own remarks, accompanying these letters, were not in¬

reaction to the same questions. I have added a few paragraphs 
for publication here. 

Mr. Y and William X agree that middle-class attitudes will be 
decisive in determining the outcome of the American war in 
Vietnam, and that these attitudes will be shaped not by moral 
but by “pragmatic” considerations, considerations of cost. Yet
