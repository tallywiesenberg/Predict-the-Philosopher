uprooting the NLF political and administrative structure in the 
Mekong Delta (with the inevitable solemn statement from 
Freedom House applauding this exercise of limited means to 
show that violence doesn’t pay). The purpose of dissent is to 
mobilize opinion against the use of American force to impose a 
political solution in Vietnam—to the hideous extent it is used 
today, to the still more barbaric extent of tomorrow, or in fact, 
to any extent at all—whatever the costs may be. This is the 
crucial problem that dissent must face with respect to Vietnam 
as well as all of the other countries where American force is 
being used directly, or where American arms and military train¬ 
ing are contributing to internal repression. Contrary to Mr. Y, 
then, I feel that dissent should aim to convince the American 
people that the war is wrong, and to explain why this or any 
similar use of force is wrong. 

Consider next the assumption that opposition to the war will 
mount as its costs visibly increase. It follows that we should 
attempt to increase these costs. Resistance, properly conducted, 
can serve to increase the domestic cost of American aggression 
and can therefore help shape the attitudes of the “pragmatic 
middle classes” of whom Mr. Y speaks, as it can help shape the 
decisions of those who must calculate these costs in setting the 
course of American foreign policy. Mr. Y is surely wrong in 
supposing that those who undertake resistance do so to preserve 
their moral purity. Mr. X’s letter is ample testimony to the fact 
that resistance can be, and I feel quite generally is, undertaken 
as a political act. One may argue that it is misguided, but not

that it is apolitical. Of course, the resister must choose his tac¬ 
tics so as to maximize the probability that the developing oppo¬ 
sition will take a civilized form—in the case of Vietnam, with¬ 
drawal rather than annihilation—and he must accompany his 
resistance with the kind of dissent that will seek to raise the 
general level of political and moral consciousness. These, it 
seems to me, are the conclusions that one should draw from the 
analysis of the situation that Mr. Y proposes. 

To me it seems that draft resistance meets these conditions. 
The principle is clear and unambiguous. An individual’s refusal 
to carry out the criminal acts of his government sets the stage, in 
the most effective way possible, for the attempt to demonstrate 
the criminal nature of these acts. Furthermore, the resistance is
