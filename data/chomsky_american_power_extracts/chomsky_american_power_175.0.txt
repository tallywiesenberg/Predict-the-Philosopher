Nevertheless, we might as well face up to the overwhelming 
probability that the choice in November will be between barely 
distinguishable policies. Senator McCarthy’s candidacy might 
be important as an educational effort (it can hardly be re¬ 
garded as a political effort) if McCarthy were to raise serious 
issues and break free from the narrow limits of what passes for 
political discussion in this country today, but as yet he has not 
done so. It is a remarkable fact that in this democracy, not a 
single public figure, no segment of the mass media, advocates 
the position which, according to the recent international Gallup 
polls, is that of the overwhelming majority in most of the “free 
world”—that the United States should withdraw from Vietnam.

Supplement to “On Resistance” 


The basic issues are not discussed in the mass media and are 
not raised in the political arena. These are the realities that we 
must face in determining an appropriate mode of political action. 

To summarize, draft resistance can make use of the inegali¬ 
tarian nature of American society as a technique for increasing 
the cost of American aggression, and it threatens values that are 
important to those in a decision-making position. (One who 
shares these values must then ask how they benefit our victims, 
and what price our victims must pay to secure these values from 
any risk.) It is difficult to judge how heavily such costs will 
weigh in the balance, but I think that Mr. Y is not justified in 
contending that the goal of resistance can only be to safeguard 
one’s purity of conscience. 

Of course, resistance might backfire; it might lead the “prag¬ 
matic opposition” to demand a harsh and brutal victory. How¬ 
ever, the danger seems to me slight. There is no reason why a 
principled and obviously courageous and highly moral act 
should have this consequence. Rather, I think it is likely to 
cause others to consider their own complicity, in their work, in 
their payment of war taxes, in their preservation of the domestic 
peace that permits the warmakers to operate freely. Further¬ 
more, it is important to bear in mind that any political act 
carries with it a potential danger of this sort. For example, it is 
not unlikely that President Johnson would react to a threat at 
the polls with a sharp escalation, on the theory (probably cor¬ 
rect) that this would gain him at least short-term support. I see 
no reason to believe that nonviolent resistance is more likely to 
have this consequence than electoral politics. Quite the con¬ 
trary.
