and a useful insight into university-sponsored research at its best. 
My guess is that talk of disruptive acts is a fantasy. 

I have said nothing about ghetto rebellions. These may affect 
the war, in one or another way, but they are not acts under¬

an institution hurriedly conceived a few months ago to teach the 
grim lessons derived from the Detroit and Newark riots. . . . 

The report goes on to describe the new, “more devastating” 
types of tear gas now available, and the ways in which grenades
