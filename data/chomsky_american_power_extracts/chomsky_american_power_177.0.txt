assistance to those who refuse to serve in Vietnam, who wish to 
increase the political cost of repression by standing alongside 
the young men w T ho will inevitably suffer most severely. Think¬ 
ing in still more long-range terms, it may be that the most 
significant steps towards a reform of American society will 
prove to be the efforts of the very courageous and unsung few 
who are devoting themselves to community organizing, often 
using the draft and its inequities as a point of entry into com¬ 
munities that provide the mass base for American repression, 
and seeking to create both consciousness and organizational 
structure for resistance on the part of those who bear the heavi¬ 
est burdens but who are, for the present, passive victims of an 
unchallenged coercive ideology. The national RESIST organi¬ 
zation is attempting to provide the framework for a range of 
such activities, using as a basis the Call To Resist Illegitimate 
Authority (most of which appeared as an advertisement in the 
New York Review of Books on October 12, 1967). With all of 
the necessary qualifications, I feel that involvement in this effort 
is the most effective form of political action against this and 
future wars that is now open to a concerned citizen. 

Those of us who are not under direct attack and who are rela¬ 
tively free to choose a course of action have a responsibility to 
the victims of American power that we must face with unwaver¬ 
ing seriousness. In considering some tactic of protest or resist¬ 
ance, we must ask what its consequences are likely to be for the 
people of Vietnam or of Guatemala or of Harlem, and what effect 
it will have on the building of a movement against war and op¬ 
pression, a movement that will help to create a society in which 
one can live without fear and without shame. We have to search 
for ways to persuade vast numbers of Americans to commit them¬ 
selves to this task, and we must devise ways to convert this

commitment into effective action. The goal may seem so remote 
as to be a fantasy, but for those who are serious, this is the only 
strategy that can be considered. Persuasion may involve deeds as 
well as words; it may involve the construction of institutions 
and social forms, even if only in microcosm, that overcome the 
competitiveness and the single-minded pursuit of self-interest 
that proves a mechanism of social control as effective as that of 
a totalitarian state. But the goal must be to design and construct 
alternatives to the present ideology and social institutions that 
are more compelling on intellectual and moral grounds, and that 
can draw to them masses of Americans who find that these al¬
