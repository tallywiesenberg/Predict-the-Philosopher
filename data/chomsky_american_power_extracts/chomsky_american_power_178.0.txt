justified in themselves when regarded in a narrow sense may be 
very wrong when considered in the light of their probable conse¬ 
quences. And a failure to approach those who can be reached, a 
failure to act with strength and determination when one can do 
so in a constructive way, is no less thoughtless and indefensible. 
These are very general remarks, and not very helpful, perhaps, 
when we face the concrete question of w T hat we can do right now. 
Still. I think that such guidelines as these must form the frame¬ 
work for these decisions. 

One final remark. The Vietnam war is the most obscene ex¬ 
ample of a frightening phenomenon of contemporary history— 
the attempt by our country to impose its particular concept of

self-determination, and to international cooperation. At the 
same time, we enjoy a high degree of internal freedom. We can 
speak and write and organize. Resisters may be punished se¬ 
verely, but they will not be sent to slave-labor camps or gas 
chambers. Given these facts, resistance is feasible even for those 
who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, 
for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of 
the attempt to impose American hegemony. Resistance cannot 
now significantly deplete the manpower pool that makes possi¬ 
ble the use of American power for global repression, nor can it, 
at the moment, significantly impede the research, production, 
and supply on which this exercise of power rests. But it can 
contribute significantly towards raising the domestic costs of 
this attempt and eliminating the apathy and passivity that may 
permit it to succeed. It therefore has a potential significance 
that extends far beyond Vietnam. It may help to save other 
small countries from the fate of Vietnam, and indeed, to save 
the world from indescribable catastrophe.
