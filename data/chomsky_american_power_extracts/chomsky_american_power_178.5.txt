As the great peasant revolutions raged in China more than a 
century ago, Karl Marx wrote in the New York Tribune about 

the effect the Chinese revolution seems likely to exercise on the 
civilized world. It may seem a strange and a very paradoxical

rooted in revulsion, and to this extent is a tribute to a strain of 
decency in Western culture, difficult as it is to pronounce these 
words amidst the barbarism of the Vietnam war. The disorder 
spreading through the Western world is not solely or even pri¬
