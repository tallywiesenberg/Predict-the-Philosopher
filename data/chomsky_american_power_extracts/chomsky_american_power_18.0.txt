order and reform. Ithiel Pool formulates the central issue as 
follows: 

In the Congo, in Vietnam, in the Dominican Republic, it is clear 
that order depends on somehow compelling newly mobilized 
strata to return to a measure of passivity and defeatism from 
which they have recently been aroused by the process of mod¬ 
ernization. At least temporarily, the maintenance of order re¬ 
quires a lowering of newly acquired aspirations and levels of 
political activity. 20 

This is what “we have learned in the past thirty years of inten¬ 
sive empirical study of contemporary societies. 55 Pool is merely 
describing facts, not proposing policy. A corresponding version 
of the facts is familiar on the domestic scene: workers threaten 
the public order by striking for their demands, the impatience 
of the Negro community threatens the stability of the body 
politic. One can, of course, imagine another way in which order 
can be preserved in all such cases: namely, by meeting the 
demands, or at the very least by removing the barriers that 
have been placed, by force which may be latent and disguised, 
in the way of attempts to satisfy the “newly acquired aspira¬ 
tions. 55 But this might mean that the wealthy and powerful 
would have to sacrifice some degree of privilege, and it is there¬ 
fore excluded as a method for maintenance of order. Such pro¬ 
posals are likely to meet with little sympathy from Pool’s new 
mandarins. 

From the doubly privileged position of the American scholar, 
the transcendent importance of order, stability, and nonvio¬ 
lence (by the oppressed) seems entirely obvious: to others, the

matter is not so simple. If we listen, we hear such voices as this, 
from an economist in India: 

It is disingenuous to invoke “democracy,” “due process of law,” 
“non-violence,” to rationalise the absence of action. For mean¬ 
ingful concepts under such conditions become meaningless since, 
in reality, they justify the relentless pervasive exploitation of the 
masses; at once a denial of democracy and a more sinister form 
of violence perpetrated on the overwhelming majority through 
contractual forms . 21
