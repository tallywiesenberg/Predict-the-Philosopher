The Anarchists of Spain, through the C.N.T., are doing one of 
the biggest constructive jobs ever done by the working class.At the 
front they are fighting Fascism.Behind the front they are actually 
constructing the new workers’ society.They see that the war against 
Fascism and the carrying through of the social revolution are insepara¬ 
ble.Those who have seen them and understood what they are doing must 
honor them and be grateful to them.
