munist behavior”; and “the Viet-Cong inherited, after Geneva, 
much of the popular support and sympathies previously at¬ 
tached to the Viet-Minh in the South.” After the fall of Diem, 
matters became still worse: “. . . vast regions that had been 
under government control quickly came under the influence of 
the Viet-Cong.” By late 1964 the pacification of Quang Nam 
Province had become “all but impossible,” and the worst of it is 
that “the battle for Quang Nam was lost by the government to 
Viet-Cong forces recruited for the most part from within the 
province.” 22 By 1966, the Vietcong seem so well entrenched in 
rural areas that “only a highly imaginative and comprehensive 
counterinsurgency campaign, with nearly perfect execution and 
substantial military support, would be capable of dislodging

such a powerful and extensive insurgent apparatus.” 

A major difficulty we face is the “progressive social and 
economic results” shown by the Vietcong efforts. An AID report 
in March 1965 explains the problem. Comparing “our ‘new life 
hamlets’ ” to the Vietcong hamlets, the report comments as fol¬ 
lows: 

The basic differences are that the VC hamlets are well organized, 
clean, economically self supporting and have an active defense 
system. For example, a cottage industry in one hamlet was as 
large as has been previously witnessed anywhere in Chuong Thien 
province. New canals are being dug and pineapples are under 
cultivation. The VC also have a relocation program for younger 
families. These areas coincide with the areas just outside the planned 
GVN sphere of interest. Unless the USOM/GVN activities exhibit a 
more qualitative basis [sic], there is little likelihood of changing the 
present attitudes of the people. For example, in one area only five 
kilometers from the province capital, the people refused medical 
assistance offered by ARVN medics. 

However, all is not lost. Even though “the Viet-Cong strength 
in the countryside has made a ‘quantum leap’ from its position 
of early 1962,” there is a compensating factor, namely, “the 
counterinsurgent military capability was revolutionized by sub¬ 
stantial American troop inputs.” This allows us entirely new 
options. For example, we can implement more effectively some 
of the “experiments with population and resources control 
methods” that were tried by the USOM and the National Police 
as early as 1961, though with little success. Given the new possi¬ 
bilities for “material and human resources control,” we may
