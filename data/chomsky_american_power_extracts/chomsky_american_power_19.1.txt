In certain communes, such as Bordon and Calaceite, 
even seed was confiscated and the peasants are now unable to work 
the land.” 

The estimate that 30% of the collectives were destroyed is consistent 
with figures reported by Peirats ( Los anarquistas en la crisis politica 
espahola, p. 300).He points out that only 200 delegates attended the 
congress of collectives of Aragon in September 1937 (“held under the 
shadow of the bayonets of the Eleventh Division” of Lister) as com¬ 
pared with 500 delegates at the congress of the preceding February.Peirats states that an army division of Catalan separatists and another 
division of the PSUC also occupied parts of Aragon during this opera¬ 
tion, while three anarchist divisions remained at the front, under or¬ 
ders from the CNT-FAI leadership.Compare Jackson’s explanation of 
the occupation of Aragon: “The peasants were known to hate the 
Consejo, the anarchists had deserted the front during the Barcelona 
fighting, and the very existence of the Consejo was a standing chal¬ 
lenge to the authority of the central government” (italics mine).10S.
