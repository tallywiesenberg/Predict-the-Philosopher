Bombing the dam would hurt people.Every dam 
taken out would give more reason for claiming that “the enemy is 
hurting.” In theory, if he can be “hurt” enough his government 
should be more inclined to go to the conference table.Despite all of these advantages of bombing dams, Harsch ap¬ 
parently believes that it is more reasonable to bomb trucks.The 
reason is that “there is no evidence that this causing of pain to 
civilians in North Vietnam” has had the effect of persuading 
their government to enter into negotiations.Furthermore, the 
effect of terror bombing is slight in a nonindustrialized country.
