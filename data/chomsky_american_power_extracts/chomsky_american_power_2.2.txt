The 
pattern of the bombing in the delta seems evident—to interdict 
agricultural production.No military targets are visible in the 
dikes.The heaviest artillery pieces we saw were antiquated rifles 
of the peasant militia.As a historical reference point, recall that German High Com¬ 
missioner Seyss-Inquart was condemned to death at Nuremberg 
for opening the dikes in Holland at the time of the Allied inva¬ 
sion.9 Since the editors of the Christian Science Monitor did not 
feel that this disclosure required editorial comment, I do not 
know whether they regarded Harsch’s sensible argument for the 
bombing of trucks rather than dams as now counterbalanced by 
other considerations.
