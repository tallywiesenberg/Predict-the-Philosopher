What can one say about a country 
where such an idea can even be considered?You have to weep 
for this country.These and a thousand other examples testify to moral degen¬ 
eration on such a scale that talk about the “normal channels” of 
political action and protest becomes meaningless or hypocriti¬ 
cal.We have to ask ourselves whether what is needed in the 
United States is dissent—or denazification.The question is a 
debatable one.
