The 
reaction to the suffering of oppressed minorities at home is not 
very different from the brutal apathy towards the misery we 
have imposed elsewhere in the world.Opposition to the war in 
Vietnam is based very largely on its cost, and on the failure of 
American power to crush Vietnamese resistance.It is sad, but 
nonetheless true, that the tiny steps to bring freedom to black 
Americans have been taken, for the most part, out of fear.We 
must recognize these facts and regret them deeply, but not be 
paralyzed by this recognition.Anger, outrage, confessions of 
overwhelming guilt may be good therapy; they can also become 
a barrier to effective action, which can always be made to seem 
incommensurable with the enormity of the crime.
