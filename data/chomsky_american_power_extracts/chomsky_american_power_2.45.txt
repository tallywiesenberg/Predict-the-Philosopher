Nothing is 
easier than to adopt a new form of self-indulgence, no less 
debilitating than the old apathy.The danger is substantial.It is 
hardly a novel insight that confession of guilt can be institu¬ 
tionalized as a technique for evading what must be done.It is 
even possible to achieve a feeling of satisfaction by contem¬ 
plating one’s evil nature.No less insidious is the cry for “revolu¬ 
tion,” at a time when not even the germs of new institutions 
exist, let alone the moral and political consciousness that could 
lead to a basic modification of social life.
