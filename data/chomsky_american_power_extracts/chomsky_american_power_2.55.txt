“victory 77 that opens the way to new savagery, will be accom¬

energy or will for the task of re-evaluation and reconstruction of 
ideology and social life.But there are also encouraging signs.There is a growing realization that it is an illusion to believe

the White House, and a growing awareness that isolated, com¬ 
peting individuals can rarely confront repressive institutions 
alone.At best, a few may be tolerated as intellectual gadflies.
