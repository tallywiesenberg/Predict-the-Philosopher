They 
do not exist because they have been legally set down on a piece of 
paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a 
people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the 
violent resistance of the populace.Where this is not the case, 
there is no help in any parliamentary opposition or any Platonic 
appeals to the constitution.One compels respect from others 
when one knows how to defend one’s dignity as a human being.This is not only true in private life; it has always been the same in 
political life as well.11 

To me it seems that the revival of anarchist thinking in the 
“New Left” and the attempts to put it into effect are the most 
promising development of the past years, and that if this devel¬ 
opment can solidify, it offers some real hope that the present 
American crisis will not become an American and world catas¬ 
trophe.
