We may also be able to avoid a 
fate that was—according to an often quoted story—outlined by 
Einstein on another occasion, when he was asked what sort of 
weapons might be used in a possible Third World War.His 
answer was that he did not know what weapons would be used 
in World War III, but he was sure that the Fourth World War 
would be fought with stones and clubs.Notes
