Introduction 


Professor Huntington has since expanded on these thoughts in “The 
Bases of Accommodation,” Foreign Affairs, Vol.46, No.4 (July 1968), 
pp.642-56.He explains that the Viet Cong is “a powerful force which 
cannot be dislodged from its constituency so long as the constituency con¬ 
tinues to exist.” Evidently, we must therefore ensure that the constitu¬ 
ency—the rural population—ceases to exist.
