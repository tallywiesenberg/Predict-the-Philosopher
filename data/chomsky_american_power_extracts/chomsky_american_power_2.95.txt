A Himmler or a Streicher 
would have advanced one obvious solution.This liberal social scientist, 
however, suggests another: that we drive the peasants into the cities by 
force (“urbanization”), putting off until after the war the “massive gov¬ 
ernment programs” that “will be required either to resettle migrants in 
rural areas or to rebuild the cities and promote peacetime urban employ¬ 
ment.” This policy may prove to be “the answer to ‘wars of national 
liberation,’ ” an answer that we have “stumbled upon” in Vietnam, “in 
an absent-minded way.” 

Professor Huntington disputes the view of Sir Robert Thompson that 
peasant-based insurgency is immune “to the direct application of mechani¬ 
cal and conventional power.” Not so: “...in the light of recent events, 
this statement needs to be seriously qualified.
