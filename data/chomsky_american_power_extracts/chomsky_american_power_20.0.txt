arming the peasants to defend their own communities.” If we 
rarely reach the third stage, this is because we have not yet 
learned to “share the sense of urgency of the revolutionary 
cause,” or “to nourish these attitudes” among our “Vietnamese 
associates.” Thus we understand that the “real revolution” is the 
one we are implementing, “in contrast to the artificially stimu¬ 
lated and controlled revolution of Diem and the Communists,” 
but we have difficulties in communicating this fact to the Viet¬ 
namese peasant or to our “Vietnamese associates.” What is 
needed, clearly, is better training for American officials, and of 
course, true national dedication to this humanitarian task. 

A grave defect in our society, this political scientist argues, is 
our tendency to avoid “an active American role in the fostering 
of democratic institutions abroad.” The pacification program in 
Vietnam represents an attempt to meet our responsibility to 
foster democratic institutions abroad, through rational methods 
of material and human resources control. Refusal to dedicate 
ourselves to this task might be described as “a policy more 
selfish and timid than it was broad and enlightened,” 23 to use 
the terminology of an earlier day. 

When we strip away the terminology of the behavioral sci¬ 
ences, we see revealed, in such work as this, the mentality of 
the colonial civil servant, persuaded of the benevolence of the 
mother country and the correctness of its vision of world order, 
and convinced that he understands the true interests of the 
backward peoples whose welfare he is to administer. In fact, 
much of the scholarly work on Southeast Asian affairs reflects 
precisely this mentality. As an example, consider the August 
1967 issue of Asian Survey, fully devoted to a Vietnam 
symposium in which a number of experts contribute their 
thoughts on the success of our enterprise and how it can be 
moved forward.
