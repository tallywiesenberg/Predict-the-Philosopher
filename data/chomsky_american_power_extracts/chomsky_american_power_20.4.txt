The earliest quasi-official reference that I 
know of is in Herbert Feis, The Spanish Story, (New York, Alfred A. 
Knopf, 1948), where data is given in an appendix.Jackson {op.cit., 
p. 256) refers to this matter, without noting that Texaco was violating 
a prior agreement with the Republic.He states that the American 
government could do nothing about this, since “oil w T as not considered 
a war material under the Neutrality Act.” He does not point out, 
however, that Robert Cuse, the Martin Company, and the Mexican 
government w r ere put under heavy pressure to withhold supplies from 
the Republic, although this too w*as quite legal.As noted, the Texaco 
Company was never even branded “unethical” or “unpatriotic,” these 
epithets of Roosevelt’s being reserved for those who tried to assist the 
Republic.
