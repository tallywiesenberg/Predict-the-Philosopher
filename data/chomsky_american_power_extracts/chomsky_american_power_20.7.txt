To conclude these observations about the international reaction, 
it should be noted that the Vatican recognized the Franco govern¬ 
ment de facto in August 1937 and de jure in May 1938.Immedi¬ 
ately upon Franco’s final victory, Pope Pius XII made the following 
statement: “Peace and victory have been willed by God to Spain ...which has now given to proselytes of the materialistic atheism of our 
age the highest proof that above all things stands the eternal value of 
religion and of the Spirit.” Of course, the position of the Catholic 
Church has since undergone important shifts—something that cannot 
be said of the American government.
