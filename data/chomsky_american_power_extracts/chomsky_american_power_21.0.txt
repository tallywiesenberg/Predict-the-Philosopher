THE REVOLUTIONARY PACIFISM 
OF A. J. MUSTE 


ON THE BACKGROUNDS 

OF THE PACIFIC WAR 


INTRODUCTORY COMMENT 

The title and subtitle of this essay may seem unrelated; hence 
a word of explanation may be useful.The essay was written for 
a memorial number of Liberation which, as the editor expressed 
it, “gathered together a series of articles that deal with some of 
the problems with which A. J. struggled.” I think that Muste’s 
revolutionary pacifism was, and is, a profoundly important doc¬ 
trine, both in the political analysis and the moral conviction that 
it expresses.The circumstances of the antifascist war subjected it 
to the most severe of tests.Does it survive this test?
