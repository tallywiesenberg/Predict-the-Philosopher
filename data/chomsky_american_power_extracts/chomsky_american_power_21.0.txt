sists of luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings financed by 
Chinese businessmen or affluent Vietnamese with relatives or 
connections within the regime. The buildings are destined to be 
rented to Americans. Saigon’s workers live, as they always have, 
in fetid slums on the city’s outskirts. . . . Bars and bordellos, 
thousands of young Vietnamese women degrading themselves as 
bar girls and prostitutes, gangs of hoodlums and beggars and 
children selling their older sisters and picking pockets have be¬ 
come ubiquitous features of urban life. 

Many have remarked on the striking difference between the 
way in which the press and the visiting scholar describe what 
they see in Vietnam. It should occasion no surprise. Each is 
pursuing his own craft. The reporter’s job is to describe what he 
sees before his eyes; many have done so with courage and even 
brilliance. The colonial administrator, on the other hand, is con¬ 
cerned to justify what he has done and what he hopes to do, 
and—if an “expert” as well—to construct an appropriate ideo¬ 
logical cover, to show that we are just and righteous in what we 
do, and to put nagging doubts to rest. One sees moral degrada¬ 
tion and fetid slums; the other, prosperity and well-being—and 
if kindly old Uncle Sam occasionally flicks his ashes on someone 
by mistake, that is surely no reason for tantrums. 

Returning to the collection of scholarly and objective studies 
in Asian Survey, the first, by Kenneth Young, president of the

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


Asia Society, describes our difficulties in “transferring innova¬ 
tions and institutions to the Vietnamese” and calls for the assist¬ 
ance of social scientists in overcoming these difficulties. Social 
scientists should, he feels, study “the intricacies that effectively 
inhibit or transfer what the Americans, either by government 
policy or by the technician’s action, want to introduce into the 
mind of a Vietnamese or into a Vietnamese organization.” The 
problem, in short, is one of communication. For this objective 
scholar, there is no question of our right to “transfer innovations 
and institutions to the Vietnamese,” by force if necessary, or of 
our superior insight into the needed innovations or appropriate 
institutions. In just the same way, Lord Cornwallis understood 
the necessity of “transferring the institution” of a squirearchy to 
India—as any reasonable person could see, this was the only 
civilized form of social organization.
