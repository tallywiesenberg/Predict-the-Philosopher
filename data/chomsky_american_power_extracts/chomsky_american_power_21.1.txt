similarities between Japan’s escapades and our own—both in 
character and in rationalization—with the fundamental differ¬ 
ence that Japan’s appeal to national interest, which was not 
totally without merit, becomes merely ludicrous when translated 
into a justification for American conquests in Asia.This essay touches on all of these questions: on Muste’s revo¬

the Second World War; on the backgrounds of Japan’s imperial 
ventures; on the Western reaction and responsibility; and, by 
implication, on the relevance of these matters to the problems 
of contemporary imperialism in Asia.No doubt the essay 
would be more coherent were it limited to one or two of these 
themes.
