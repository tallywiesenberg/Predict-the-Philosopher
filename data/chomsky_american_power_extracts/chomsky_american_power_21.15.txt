I am sure that it would be more clear if it advocated a 
particular “political line.” After exploring these themes, I can 
suggest nothing more than the tentative remarks of the final 
paragraph.In a crucial essay written forty years ago , 1 A. J. Muste ex¬ 
plained the concept of revolutionary nonviolence that was the 
guiding principle of an extraordinary life.“In a world built on 
violence, one must be a revolutionary before one can be a paci¬ 
fist.” “There is a certain indolence in us, a wish not to be dis¬ 
turbed, which tempts us to think that when things are quiet, all 
is well.Subconsciously, we tend to give the preference to ‘social 
peace,’ though it be only apparent, because our lives and pos¬ 
sessions seem then secure.Actually, human beings acquiesce 
too easily in evil conditions; they rebel far too little and too 
seldom.
