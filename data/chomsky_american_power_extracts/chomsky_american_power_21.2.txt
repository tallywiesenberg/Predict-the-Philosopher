system is based, and all the evil—material and spiritual—this 
entails for the masses of men throughout the world....So long 
as we are not dealing honestly and adequately with this ninety 
percent of our problem, there is something ludicrous, and per¬

violence employed by the rebels against oppression.” Never in 
American history have these thoughts been so tragically appro¬ 
priate as today.The task of the revolutionary pacifist is spelled out more fully 
in the final paragraph of the essay.Those who can bring themselves to renounce wealth, position and 
power accruing from a social system based on violence and put¬ 
ting a premium on acquisitiveness, and to identify themselves in 
some real fashion with the struggle of the masses toward the 
light, may help in a measure—more, doubtless, by life than by 
words—to devise a more excellent way, a technique of social 
progress less crude, brutal, costly and slow than mankind has yet 
evolved.
