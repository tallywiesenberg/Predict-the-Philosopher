It is a remarkable tribute to A. J. Muste that his life’s work 
can be measured by such standards as these.His essays are 
invariably thoughtful and provocative; his life, however, is an 
inspiration with hardly a parallel in twentieth-century America.Muste believed, with Gandhi, that “unjust laws and practices 
survive because men obey them and conform to them.This they 
do out of fear.There are things they dread more than the 
continuance of the evil.” He enriched half a century of Ameri¬ 
can history with a personal commitment to these simple truths.
