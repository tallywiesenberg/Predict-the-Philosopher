His efforts began in a time when “men believed that a better 
human order, a classless and warless world, a socialist society, if 
you please, could be achieved,” a time when the labor move-

ment could be described as “that remarkable combination of 
mass power, prophetic idealism and utopian hope.” They con¬ 
tinued through the general disillusionment of war and depres¬ 
sion and antiradical hysteria, to the days when American soci¬ 
ologists could proclaim that “the realization that escapes no one 
is that the egalitarian and socially mobile society which the 'free- 
floating intellectuals’ associated with the Marxist tradition have 
been calling for during the last hundred years has finally 
emerged in the form of our cumbersome, bureaucratic mass 
society, and has in turn engulfed the heretics.” 2 And finally, still 
not “engulfed,” he persisted in his refusal to be one of the 
obedient, docile men who are the terror of our time, to the 
moment when our “egalitarian and socially mobile society” is 
facing a virtual rebellion from the lower depths, when young 
men are being faced every day with the questions posed at 
Nuremberg as their country devotes itself to enforcing the “sta¬ 
bility” of the graveyard and the bulldozed village, and when 
the realization that escapes no one is that something is drasti¬ 
cally wrong in American society.In one of his last published essays, Muste describes himself as 
an “unrepentant unilateralist, on political as well as moral 
grounds.” 3 In part, he bases his position on an absolute moral 
commitment that one may accept or reject, but that cannot be 
profitably debated.In part, he defends it on grounds that seem 
to me not very persuasive, a psychological principle that “like 
produces like, kindness provokes kindness,” hence an appeal to 
“the essential humanity of the enemy.” 4 It is very difficult to 
retain a faith in the “essential humanity” of the SS trooper 
or the commissar or the racist blinded with hate and fear, or, 
for that matter, the insensate victim of a lifetime of anti-Com- 
munist indoctrination.When the enemy is a remote technician 
programming B-52 raids or “pacification,” there is no possibility

for a human confrontation and the psychological basis for 
nonviolent tactics, whatever it may be, simply evaporates.A society that is capable of producing concepts like “un- 
American” and “peacenik”—of turning “peace” into a dirty 
word—has advanced a long way towards immunizing the indi¬ 
vidual against any human appeal.
