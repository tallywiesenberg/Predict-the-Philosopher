American society has reached 
the stage of near total immersion in ideology.The commitment 
has vanished from consciousness—what else can a right-think¬ 
ing person possibly believe?Americans are simply “pragmatic,” 
and they must bring others to this happy state.Thus an official 
of the Agency for International Development can write, with 
no trace of irony, that our goal is to move nations “from doctri¬ 
naire reliance on state enterprise to a pragmatic support of 
private initiative,” 5 and a headline in the New York Times can 
refer to Indian capitulation to American demands concerning 
the conditions of foreign investment as India's “drift from so¬ 
cialism to pragmatism” (see page 355 below).With this narrow¬ 
ing of the range of the thinkable comes an inability to compre¬ 
hend how the weak and dispossessed can resist our benevolent 
manipulation of their lives, an incapacity to react in human 
terms to the misery that we impose.
