Furthermore, it does not require an 
unusual political intelligence to urge world-wide de-escalation 
on the great power that by any objective standard is the most 
aggressive in the world—as measured by the number of gov¬ 
ernments maintained by force or subverted by intrigue, by 
troops and bases on foreign soil, by willingness to use the most 
awesome “killing machine” in history to enforce its concept of 
world order.It would be more enlightening to consider the program of 
revolutionary pacifism in the context of a decade ago, when 
international gangsterism was more widely distributed, with the 
British engaged in murderous repression in Kenya, the French 
fighting the last of their dirty colonial wars, and the Soviet 
Union consolidating its Eastern European empire with brutality 
and deceit.But it is the international situation of December 
1941 that provides the most severe test for Muste’s doctrine.There is a great deal to be learned from a study of the events 
that led up to an armed attack, by a competing imperialism, on 
American possessions and the forces defending them, and even 
more from a consideration of the varying reactions to these 
events and their aftermath.If Muste’s revolutionary pacifism is 
defensible as a general political program, then it must be defen¬ 
sible in these extreme circumstances.
