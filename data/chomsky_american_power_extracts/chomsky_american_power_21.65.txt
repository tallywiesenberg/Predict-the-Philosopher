Since nothing of the sort was ever attempted, one can only 
speculate as to the possible outcome of such a course.The 
accuracy of Muste’s forecast unfortunately requires little com¬ 
ment.Furthermore, a plausible case can be made for his analy¬ 
sis of the then existing situation, a matter of more than aca¬ 
demic interest in view of developments in Asia since that 
time.As I mentioned, the point of view that Muste expressed was a 
rather isolated one.To see how little the intellectual climate has 
changed, it is enough to consider the lengthy debate over the 
decision to drop the bomb.
