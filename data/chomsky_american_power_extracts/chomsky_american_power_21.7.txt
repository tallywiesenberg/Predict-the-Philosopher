What has been at issue is the ques¬ 
tion whether this constituted the last act of World War II or the 
first phase of American postwar diplomacy; or whether it was 
justified as a means of bringing the war to a quick conclusion.Only rarely has the question been raised whether there was any 
justification for American victory in the Pacific war; and this 
issue, where faced at all, has been posed in the context of the 
Cold War—that is, was it wise to have removed a counter¬ 
weight to growing Chinese power, soon to become “Commu¬ 
nist” power ?A fairly typical American view is probably that expressed by 
historian Louis Morton: 

In the late summer and autumn of 1945 the American people had 
every reason to rejoice.Germany and Japan had been defeated, 
and American troops, victorious everywhere, would soon be re¬ 
turning home.Unprecedented evil had been overcome by the 
greatest display of force ever marshaled in the cause of human 
freedom.
