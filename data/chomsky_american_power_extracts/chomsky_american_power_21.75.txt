The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


It is remarkable that such an attitude should be so blandly 
expressed and easily accepted.Is it true that in August 1945 the 
American people “had every reason to rejoice”—at the sight of a 
Japanese countryside devastated by conventional bombing in 
which tens of thousands of civilians had been massacred, not to 
speak of the horrifying toll of two atom bombs (the second 
being, so it appears, history’s most abominable experiment); or 
at the news of a final gratuitous act of barbarism, trivial in the 
context of what had just taken place, a thousand-plane raid 
launched after the Japanese surrender had been announced but, 
technically, before it was officially received?10 To Secretary of 
War Stimson it seemed “appalling that there had been no pro¬ 
test over the air strikes we were conducting against Japan 
which led to such extraordinarily heavy losses of life”; he felt 
that “there was something wrong with a country where no one 
questioned that.” What then are we to say of a country that 
still, twenty years later, is incapable of facing the question of 
war guilt?
