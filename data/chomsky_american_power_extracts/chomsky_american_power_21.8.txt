It is not, of course, that the question of war guilt has gone 
out of fashion.No trip to Germany is complete, even today, 
without a ritual sigh and wringing of hands over the failure of 
the German people to face up to the sins of the Nazi era, or the 
German school texts which glide so easily over the Nazi atrociÂ¬ 
ties and the question of war guilt.This is a sure sign of the 
corruption of their nature.Just recently, a group of American 
liberal intellectuals gave their impressions of a tour of West 
Germany in the Atlantic Monthly (May 1967).None failed to 
raise the question of war guilt.
