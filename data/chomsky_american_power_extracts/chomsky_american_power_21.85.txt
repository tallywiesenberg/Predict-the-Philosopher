One comments that “however 
disparate our temperaments or our political emphases, we were 
plainly a group made coherent by our shared suspicions of 
Germany’s capacity for political health ... we had not forgot¬ 
ten, nor could we forget, that we were in the country which had

been able to devise, and implement, Nazism.” The same com¬ 
mentator is impressed with the “dignity and fortitude” with 
which young Germans “carry an emotional and moral burden 
unmatched in history: they have to live with the knowledge 
that their parent generation, and often their own parents, per¬ 
petrated the worst atrocities on the record of mankind.” An¬ 
other, a fervent apologist for the American war in Vietnam, 
asks, “How does a human being ‘come to terms’ with the fact 
that his father was a soulless murderer, or an accomplice to 
soulless murder?” Several “were offended by the way the camp 
[Dachau] had been fixed up, prettified.” (Does the “prettifka- 
tion” of Hiroshima—or, to take a closer analogue, the prettifica- 
tion of Los Alamos—provoke the same response?)To their 
credit, a few refer to Vietnam; but not once is a question raised 
—even to be dismissed—as to American conduct in the Second 
World War, or the “emotional and moral burden” carried by 
those whose “parent generation” stood by while two atom 
bombs were used against a beaten and virtually defenseless 
enemy.To free ourselves from the conformism and moral blindness 
that have become a national scandal, it is a good idea occasion¬ 
ally to read the measured reactions of conservative Asians to 
some of our own exploits.Consider, for example, the words of 
the Indian justice Radhabinod Pal, the leading Asian voice at 
the Tokyo Tribunal that assessed the war guilt of the Japanese.In his carefully argued (and largely ignored) dissenting opin¬ 
ion to the decision of the tribunal, he has the following remarks 
to make: 

The Kaiser Wilhelm II was credited with a letter to the Austrian 

Kaiser Franz Joseph in the early days of that war, w'herein he 

stated as follows: “My soul is torn, but everything must be put to 

fire and sword; men, women and children and old men must be
