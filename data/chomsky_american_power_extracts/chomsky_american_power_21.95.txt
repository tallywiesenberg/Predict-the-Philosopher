We need not stop here to consider whether or not “the atom 
bomb comes to force a more fundamental searching of the na¬ 
ture of warfare and of the legitimate means for the pursuit of 
military objectives.” It would be sufficient for my present purpose 
to say that if any indiscriminate destruction of civilian life and 
property is still illegitimate in warfare, then, in the Pacific war, 
this decision to use the atom bomb is the only near approach to 
the directives of the German Emperor during the first World War 
and of the Nazi leaders during the second World War.Nothing 
like this could be traced to the credit of the present accused.11 

When we lament over the German conscience, we are de¬ 
manding of them a display of self-hatred—a good thing, no 
doubt.But for us the matter is infinitely more serious.It is not a 
matter of self-hatred regarding the sins of the past.
