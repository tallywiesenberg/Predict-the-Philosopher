Like the 
German Kaiser, we believe that everything must be put to fire 
and sword, so that the war will be more quickly finished—and 
we act on this belief.Unlike the German Kaiser, our soul is not 
torn.We manage a relative calm, as we continue, today, to 
write new chapters of history with the blood of the helpless and 
innocent.169 


* - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

Returning to Muste’s radical pacifism in the context of 1941, 
recall that the first of his proposals was that there be no attempt 
“to fasten sole war-guilt on any nation.” The second was that 
measures be taken to assure to all peoples equitable access to 
markets and essential materials.The immediate cause of the 
attack on Pearl Harbor was the recognition, by the Japanese 
military, that it was “now or never.” The Western powers con¬ 
trolled the raw materials on which their existence depended, 
and these supplies were being choked off in retaliation for ex¬ 
pansion on the mainland and association with Germany and 
Italy in the Tripartite Pact.
