In short, by the late 1920s, Japan was 
what in modern political parlance is called a “democracy” and 
was attempting to play the normal role of a great power.A portent of danger lay in the virtual independence of the 
armed forces from the civilian government.The “dual diplo¬ 
macy” to which this gave rise was shortly to have disastrous 
consequences.The great European war of 1914-1918 gave Japan an oppor¬ 
tunity to extend its “rights and interests” in China and provided 
new markets for expanding Japanese industry.The revival of 
European competition came as a severe blow, and postwar 
diplomacy attempted vainly to construct a new and stable in¬ 
ternational system that would integrate Japan with the other 
imperialist powers.
