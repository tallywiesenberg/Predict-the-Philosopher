In good faith, Japan accepted the subordi¬ 
nate role assigned it and consented, throughout the twenties, to 
be a well-behaved member of the imperialist club.The Wash¬ 
ington Conference of 1921-1922 established the naval forces of 
America, England, and Japan in the ratio of 5:5:3, accepting 
the American position of “equality of security” rather than the 
Japanese goal of “equality of armaments.” As Schroeder com¬ 
ments, “the American argument was that Japan, a state sur¬ 
rounded on all sides by historic enemies and powerful rivals, 
had a superior natural situation for defense, while the United 
States, in the midst of two oceans without a powerful enemy on 
two continents, had defensively an inferior natural endow¬ 
ment.” 13 

The Washington Conference arrangements were renegotiated 
in the London Naval Treaty of 1930 involving Japan, Great 
Britain, and the United States.The matter is discussed in detail 
in a study by James Crowley.14 In the negotiations leading to 
this treaty, Secretary of State Stimson placed emphasis on “the

unusual problems posed by the necessity of the United States to 
defend two coastlines and on the ‘great concessions’ which the 
American government had made at the time of the Washington 
Conference.” Crowley points out that “throughout the 1920’s, 
Japan faithfully adhered to the terms of the Washington Con¬ 
ference treaties.” At issue in the subsequent negotiations was 
the question whether Japan could maintain its primary objec¬ 
tive: “supremacy over the American fleet in Japanese home 
waters.” The London Treaty, in effect, required that Japan 
abandon this objective.The London Treaty “did not render 
England a second-class naval power, nor did it endanger the 
safety of the United States or its insular possessions in the Pa¬ 
cific,” but it did compromise “the principle of Japanese naval 
hegemony in Japan’s own waters.” 

The domestic opposition to the treaty in Japan was a very 
serious matter.
