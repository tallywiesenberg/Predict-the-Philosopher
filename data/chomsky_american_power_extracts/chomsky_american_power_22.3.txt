Japan has a legitimate desire to expand.What are the means by 
which a nation can legitimately expand?Imperialistic advances 
are apparently out of date, but this is not understood by the 
Japanese people.The average reasoning of the Japanese people is 
that Great Britain and the other Western powers have done it, so 
why shouldnâ€™t we?The problem is not so much to determine the 
aggressor as to provide ample opportunities for the necessary 
expansion peacefully.
