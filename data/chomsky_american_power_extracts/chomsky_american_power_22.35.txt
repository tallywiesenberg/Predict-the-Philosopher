Through the mid-1920s the Japanese were, generally, the 
most sympathetic of the imperialist powers to the Kuomintang 
in its attempt to unify China.In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek stated

that the Japanese policy differed from the “oppressive” attitude 
of Britain and the United States, and Eugene Ch’en, then a 
high Kuomintang official, contrasted Japan's nonparticipation in 
the imperialist bombardment of Nanking to the “cruelty in¬ 
herent in the Western civilization”; this “indicated Japan’s 
friendship for China.” The goal of Japanese diplomacy was to 
strengthen the anti-Communist elements in the Kuomintang 
and, at the same time, to support the rule of the warlord Chang 
Tso-lin over an at least semi-independent Manchuria.At the 
time, this seemed not totally unreasonable, although the legal 
position of Japan was insecure and this policy was sure to come 
into conflict with Chinese nationalism.According to one author¬ 
ity: 

As of 1927 Manchuria was politically identifiable with China 
only insofar as its overlord, Chang Tso-lin, was also commander- 
in-chief of the anti-Kuomintang coalition controlling Peking.But 
Chang’s economic and military base in the Three Eastern Prov¬ 
inces was entirely distinct from China, and in the past he had 
occasionally proclaimed Manchuria’s independence.
