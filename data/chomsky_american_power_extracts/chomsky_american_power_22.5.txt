power bloc” guaranteed by military force, or in continuing to 
abide by “the new rules of diplomacy established by Occidental 
and satiated powers.” 21 The issue was resolved in September 
1931, when Kwantung Army officers provoked a clash with 
Chinese forces (the “Mukden incident”) and proceeded to take 
full control of Manchuria.China, not unexpectedly, refused the 
Japanese offers to negotiate, insisting that “evacuation is a pre¬

defense” against Chinese “bandits,” the Kwantung Army 
established control by force, and in August 1932 the Japanese 
government, under strong military and popular pressure, recog¬ 
nized Manchuria as the new, “independent” state of Man- 
chukuo, under the former Manchu emperor, Pu Yi.
