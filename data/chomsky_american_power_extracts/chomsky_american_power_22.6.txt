For all of these reasons, Shigemitsu felt 
justified in requesting troops, which “succeeded in dislodging 
the Chinese forces from the Shanghai district and restoring law 
and order”—a “familiar procedure,” as Lippmann rightly ob¬ 
served, and not without present-day parallels.26 

As far as Japan itself is concerned, the events of 1931-1932 
were quite serious in their impact.According to the outstanding 
Japanese political scientist Masao Maruyama, “the energy of 
radical fascism stored up in the preparatory period now burst 
forth in full concentration under the combined pressure of 
domestic panic and international crises such as the Manchurian 
Incident, the Shanghai Incident, and Japan’s withdrawal from 
the League of Nations.” 27 Furthermore, “the issue of the in¬ 
fringement of the supreme command,” raised when the civilian 
leadership had overruled the military leaders and in effect 
capitulated to the West at the London Naval Conference, “was 
a great stimulus to the fascist movement” (p. 81).In 1932 a 
series of assassinations of important political figures (including 
Prime Minister Inukai) contributed further to the decline of 
civilian power and the strengthening of the hand of the mili¬ 
tary.The international reaction to these events was ambiguous.
