The Japanese position of the mid-thirties is described as 
follows by Royama.Japan’s aim is 

not to conquer China, or to take any territory from her, but 
instead to create jointly with China and Manchukuo a new order 
comprising the three independent states.In accordance with this 
programme, East Asia is to become a vast self-sustaining region 
where Japan will acquire economic security and immunity from 
such trade boycotts as she has been experiencing at the hands of 
the Western powers.30 

This policy was in conflict with Chinese nationalism and with 
the long-term insistence of the United States on the Open Door 
policy in China.179 


AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


From 1928 there had been an increasing divergence between 
the policies of the civilian Japanese governments, which at¬ 
tempted to play the game of international politics in accordance 
with the rules set by the dominant imperialist powers, and the 
Kwantung Army, which regarded these rules as unfair to Japan 
and was also dissatisfied with the injustice of domestic Japanese 
society.
