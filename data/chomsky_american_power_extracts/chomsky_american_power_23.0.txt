enemy). This was, of course, prior to “the advent of massive 
American aid, and the GVN’s strategic hamlet program.” With 
the American takeover of the war, the emphasis shifted to mili¬ 
tary rather than political action, and ultimately, North Viet¬ 
namese involvement and perhaps control; “beginning in 1965, 
large numbers of regular army troops from North Vietnam were 
sent into South Vietnam.” 

In short, w T hat we see is a contrast between the Dai Viet and 
VNQDD, representing South Vietnamese nationalism, and the 
NLF, an extrinsic alien force. One must bear in mind that Sacks 
would undoubtedly accept Pike’s factual description as ac¬ 
curate, but, like Pike, would regard it as demonstrating nothing, 
since we are the ultimate arbiters of what counts as “genuine 
Vietnamese nationalism.” 

An interesting counterpoint to Sacks’s exposition of national¬ 
ist versus Communist forces is provided in David Wurfel’s care¬ 
ful analysis, in the same issue of Asian Survey, of the “Saigon 
political elite.” He argues that “this elite has not substantially 
changed its character in the last few years” (i.e., since 1962), 
though there may be a few modifications: “Formerly, only 
among the great landlords were there those who held significant 
amounts of both political and economic power; grandiose cor¬ 
ruption may have allowed others to attain that distinction in 
recent years.” Continuing, “the military men in post-Diem cabi¬ 
nets all served under Bao Dai and the French in a civil or 
military capacity.” Under the French, “those who felt most 
comfortable about entering the civil service were those whose 
families were already part of the bureaucratic-intellectual elite. 
By the early 1950’s they saw radicalism, in the form of the Viet 
Minh, as a threat to their own position. The present political 
elite is the legacy of these developments.” Although, he ob¬ 
serves, things might change, “the South Vietnamese cabinets

and perhaps most of the rest of the political elite have been 
constituted by a highly westernized intelligentsia. Though the 
people of South Vietnam seem to be in a revolutionary mood, 
this elite is hardly revolutionary.” The NLF constitutes a 
“counter-elite,” less Westernized: of the NLF Central Commit¬ 
tee members, “only 3 out of 27 report studying in France.” 

The problem of “restructuring government” is further ana¬
