In general, the Kwantung Army regarded the thirty million 
people of Manchuria—half of whom had immigrated since the 
initiation of Japanese development efforts a quarter of a cen¬ 
tury earlier—as “suffering masses who had been sacrificed to 
the misrule of warlords and the avarice of wicked officials, 
masses deriving no benefits of civilization despite the natural 
abundance of the region .” 34 Furthermore, the Army regarded 
Manchuria as “the fortress against Russian southern advance¬ 
ment, which became increasingly threatening as Soviet influ¬

parent.” 35 With many Japanese civilians, it felt that “Under the 
leadership of Chiang Kai-shek and with the support of the 
Western democratic powers which wanted to keep China in a 
semi-colonial state safe from the continental advance of the 
Japanese, China was rapidly becoming a military-fascist coun¬ 
try” 36 and had no right to dominate Manchuria.To use the 
kind of terminology favored by Secretary Rusk, it was unwilling 
to sacrifice the Manchurian people to their more powerful or 
better organized neighbors, and it engaged in serious efforts to 
win the hearts and minds of the people and to encourage the 
responsible Chinese leadership that had itself been working for 
Manchurian independence.37 

In fact, a case can be made that “had it not been for Western 
intervention, which strengthened China, the Tibetans and 
Mongols would have simply resumed their own national sov¬ 
ereignty after the fall of the Manchu empire” in 1911, as would 
the Manchurians.With considerable Western prodding, the Na¬ 
tionalist government had abandoned the original demand for 
union with equality of Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Moslems, 
and Tibetans and taken the position that China should rule the 
outer dominions.
