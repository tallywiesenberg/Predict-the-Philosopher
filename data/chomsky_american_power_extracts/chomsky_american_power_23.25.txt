The great 
majority of Japanese are astonishingly capable of really fooling 
themselves....It isnâ€™t that the Japanese necessarily has his 
tongue in his cheek when he signs the obligation.It merely means 
that when the obligation runs counter to his own interests, as he 
conceives them, he will interpret the obligation to suit himself 
and, according to his own lights and mentality, he will very likely 
be perfectly honest in so doing..
