These special interests had repeatedly been recognized by the 
United States.Both China and Japan regarded the Root-Taka- 
hira Agreement of 1908 as indicating “American acquiescence 
in the latter’s position in Manchuria.” 44 Secretary of State 
Bryan, in 1915, stated that “the United States frankly recog¬ 
nized that territorial contiguity creates special relations be¬ 
tween Japan and these districts” (Shantung, South Manchuria, 
and East Mongolia); and the Lansing-Ishii Notes of 1917 stated 
that “territorial propinquity creates special relations between 
countries, and consequently, the Government of the United 
States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, par¬ 
ticularly in the part to which her possessions are contiguous.” 46 
In fact, the United States for several years regarded the 
Kuomintang as in revolt against the legitimate government of 
China, and even after Chiang’s massacre of Communists in 
1927, showed little pro-Nationalist sympathy.As late as 1930, 
the American minister to China saw no difference between the 
Kuomintang and the warlord rebels in Peking, and wrote that

that are drifting over the land at the head of odd bands of 
troops.” 46 

At the same time, the United States insisted on preserving its 
special rights, including the right of extraterritoriality, which 
exempted American citizens from Chinese law.In 1928, there 
were more than 5,200 American marines in China protecting 
these rights (the Japanese army in Manchuria at the time was 
about 10,000 troops).47 The other imperialist powers were even 
more insistent on protecting their rights, and persisted in their 
anti-Nationalist attitudes right through the Manchurian inci¬ 
dent.
