namely, “the fact that the great population of Asia offers a 
valuable outlet for the products of our industries and that as 
our industries develop we will be more and more interested in 
cultivating an outlet for them”.51 Also typical is his explanation 
of the attitude we should adopt “toward these oriental peoples 
for whose future we became responsible.” What we make of 
them will be “peculiarly the product of American idealism”; in 
their future “we shall continue to be interested as a father must 
be interested in the career of his son long after the son has left 
the family nest.” 52 He was concerned, in fact, that native Amer¬

Asian wards, and hoped rather that the “new period of Ameri¬ 
can international relations” would be “characterized by the 
acquisitive, practical side of American life rather than its ideal¬ 
istic and altruistic side.”
