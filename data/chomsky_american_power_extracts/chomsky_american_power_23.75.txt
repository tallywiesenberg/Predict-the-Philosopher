The depression of 1929 marked the final collapse of the at¬ 
tempt of Japanese civilians to live by the rules established by 
the Western powers.Just as the depression struck, the new 
Hamaguchi cabinet adopted the gold standard in an attempt to 
link the Japanese economy more closely with the West, fore¬ 
going the previous attempts at unilateral Sino-Japanese “co¬ 
prosperity.” An immediate consequence was a drastic decline in 
Japanese exports.In 1931, Japan was replaced by the United 
States as the major exporter to China.Japanese exports to the 
United States also declined severely, in part as a result of the 
Smoot-Hawley tariff of June 1930, in part because of the dra¬ 
matic fall in the price of silk.55 For an industrialized country 
such as Japan, with almost no domestic supplies of raw mate¬ 
rials, the decline in world trade was an unmitigated disaster.
