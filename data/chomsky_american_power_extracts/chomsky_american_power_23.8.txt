The Japanese diplomat Mamoru Shigemitsu describes the crisis 
succinctly: 

The Japanese were completely shut out from the European coloÂ¬ 
nies.In the Philippines, Indo-China, Borneo, Indonesia, Malaya, 
Burma, not only were Japanese activities forbidden, but even 
entry.Ordinary trade was hampered by unnatural discriminatory 
treatment....In a sense the Manchurian outbreak was the result 
of the international closed economies that followed on the first 
World War.
