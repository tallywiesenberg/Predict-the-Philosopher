dedication of the guerrillas. Throughout history, however, colo¬ 
nial administrators have had their difficulties in comprehending 
or coming to grips with this phenomenon. 

In the course of his analysis of our dilemma in Vietnam, Pool 
explains some of the aspects of our culture that make it difficult 
for us to understand such matters clearly. We live in “a guilt 
culture in which there is a tradition of belief in equality.” For 
such reasons, we find it hard to understand the true nature of 
Vietcong land redistribution, which is primarily “a patronage 
operation” in which “dissatisfied peasants band together in a 
gang to despoil their neighbors” and “then reward the deserving 
members of the cabal.” 

This terminology recalls Franz Borkenau’s description of the 
“streak of moral indifference” in the history of Russian revolu¬ 
tionism, which permitted such atrocities as the willingness “to 
Expropriate,’ by means of robbery, the individual property of

individual bourgeois.” 28 Our side, in contrast, adheres to the 
“tradition of belief in equality” when we implement land re¬ 
form. For example, the New York Times, December 26, 1967, 
reports a recent conference of experts studying the “Taiwan 
success in land reform,” one of the real success stories of Ameri¬ 
can intervention. “The Government reimbursed the former 
landlords in part (30 per cent) with shares of four large public 
enterprises taken over from the Japanese. The remainder was 
paid in bonds. . . . Many speakers at the conference singled out 
the repayment as the shrewdest feature of the Taiwan program. 
It not only treated the landlords fairly, they said, but it also 
redirected the landlords’ energies and capital towards industry,” 
thus advancing the “wholesale restructuring of society” in the 
only healthy and humane direction. 

In a side remark, Pool states that “in lay public debates now 
going on one often hears comments to the effect that Viet¬ 
namese communism, because it is anti-Chinese, would be like 
Yugoslav communism.” It would, of course, be ridiculous to 
argue such a causal connection, and, in fact, I have never heard 
it proposed in “lay public debate” or anywhere else. Rather, 
what has been maintained by such laymen as Hans Morgen- 
thau, General James Gavin, and others is that Vietnamese 
Communism is likely to be Titoist, in the sense that it will strive
