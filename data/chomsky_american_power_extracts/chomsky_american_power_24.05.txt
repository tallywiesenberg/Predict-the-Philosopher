Similarly, revised commercial arrange¬ 
ments with Cuba in 1934 were designed to eliminate Japanese 
competition in textiles, copper wire, electric bulbs, and cello¬ 
phane.61 

The 1936 IPR conference continues the story.Writing on 
“trade and trade rivalry between the United States and Japan,” 
William W. Lockwood observes that American preponderance 
in Philippine trade “is attributable in large degree to the Closed 
Door policy of the United States, which has established Ameri¬ 
can products in a preferential position.Were Japanese business 
men able to compete on equal terms, there is no doubt but that 
Japan’s share of the trade would advance rapidly.” 62 At the 
same time, American tariffs on many Japanese items exceeded 
100 percent.Japan did not have the resiliency to absorb such a serious 
shock to its economy.
