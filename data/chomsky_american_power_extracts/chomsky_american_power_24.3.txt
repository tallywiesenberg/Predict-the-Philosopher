Its goal was not enrichment of Japan, but 
rather cooperation (on Japanese terms, of course).Japan would 
provide capital and technical assistance; at the same time, it 
would succeed in freeing itself from dependence on the West 
for strategic raw materials.Japanese leaders repeatedly made clear that they intended no 
territorial aggrandizement.To use the contemporary idiom,, 
they emphasized that their actions were “not intended as a 
threat to China” and that “China knows that Japan does not 
want a wider war,” although, of course, they would “do every¬ 
thing they can to protect the men they have there.” 67 They 
were quite willing to negotiate with the recalcitrant Chinese 
authorities, and even sought third-power intervention.68 Such 
Japanese leaders as To jo and Matsuoka emphasized that no 
one, surely, could accuse Japan of seeking mere economic gain.
