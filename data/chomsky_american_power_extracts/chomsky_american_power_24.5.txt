we do not believe in exploitation, piracy, imperial¬ 
ism or war-mongering.In fact, we have used our wealth to help 
other countries and our military strength to defend the inde¬ 
pendence of small nations” 75 (in the manner indicated in note 
62, for example).Many similar remarks might be cited, but it is 
depressing to continue.A wave of revulsion swept through the world as the brutality 
of the Japanese attack on China became known.When notified 
of the intention of the Japanese government to bomb Nanking, 
the United States responded as follows: “The Government is of 
the opinion that any bombardment of an extensive zone con¬ 
taining a sizeable population engaged in their peaceful pursuits 
is inadmissible and runs counter to the principles of law and 
humanity.” 76 Now that these principles have been repealed, it 
is difficult to recapture the feeling of horror at the events them¬ 
selves and of contempt for those who had perpetrated them.
