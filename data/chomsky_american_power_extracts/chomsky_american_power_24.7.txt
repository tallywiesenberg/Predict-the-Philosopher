The insurgents should be given an 
opportunity to alter their misconceived notions and to become 
good citizens.This is why the operation for the inducement of 
surrender has such grave significance.A continuing problem was the “nearly universal phenomenon in 
Manchuria that the insurgent groups return to their original 
state of operation as soon as the subjugation period is termi¬ 
nated and troops are withdrawn.” 79 To counter this tendency, a 
number of methods were used, with considerable success.Communist groups were heavily infiltrated and alienation was 
created within the guerrilla groups.The formerly anti-Japanese 
Korean community was won over by “sociopolitical and accom¬ 
panying psychological changes” (“revolutionary development,” 
in modern phraseology), specifically, by offering them “the pos¬ 
sibility of owning land and escaping from the control of their 
Chinese landlords” (Lee, p. 23).
