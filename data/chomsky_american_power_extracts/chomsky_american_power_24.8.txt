[Lee, p. 25] 

The obvious answer to this problem was a system of “col¬ 
lective hamlets.” By the end of 1937, the Police Affairs Head¬ 
quarters reported that over 10,000 hamlets had been organized 
accommodating 5,500,000 people.The collective hamlets, Lee 
informs us, were set up with considerable ruthlessness.Families were ordered to move from their farm homes with little 
or no notice, even if the collective hamlets were not ready.Some 
farmers were forced to move just before the sowing season, mak¬ 
ing it impossible for them to plant any seeds that year, while 
others were ordered to move just before harvest.Many farm¬ 
houses seem to have been destroyed by troops engaged in mop-up 
operations before preparations had been made for the farmers’ 
relocation.
