The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


The Japanese undertook a number of what are now called 
population control methods,” including registration of resi¬ 
dents, issuance of residence certificates, unscheduled searches, 
and so on.80 They also made use of the method of reward and 
punishment recommended by more recent theorists of pacifica¬ 
tion (see Lee, pp.39-40).81 The Japanese understood that “it was 
totally unrealistic to expect reforms or innovations to be ini¬ 
tiated by those who were already well off” and therefore re¬ 
placed the former “local gentry’ 5 by “young and capable ad¬ 
ministrative personnel” who were “trained to assist the local 
administrators through the Hsueh-ho-hui, the government- 
sponsored organization to recruit mass support for the Man- 
chukuo regime” (p. 46).
