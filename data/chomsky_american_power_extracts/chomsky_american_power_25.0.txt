Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


“there’s a vacuum and that is ideal for the Vietcong because 
they’ve got an organization to fill the vacuum.” This observation 
points to a difficulty that has always plagued the American 
effort. As Joseph Buttinger points out, the Diem regime too was 
unable to experiment with “freely constituted organizations” 
because these “would have been captured by the Vietminh .” 29 

Mitchell’s informative study supports an approach to counter¬ 
insurgency that has been expressed by Roger Hilsman, who 
explains that in his view, modernization “cannot help much in a 
counterguerrilla program,” because it “inevitably uproots estab¬ 
lished social systems [and] produces political and economic 
dislocation and tension.” He therefore feels that popularity of 
governments, reform, and modernization may be “important 
ingredients,” but that their role in counterinsurgency “must be 
measured more in terms of their contributions to physical se¬ 
curity .” 30 

Before leaving this symposium on social science and Vietnam, 
we should take note of the scholarly detachment that permits 
one not to make certain comments or draw certain conclusions. 
For example, John Bennett discusses the important matter of 
“geographic and job mobility”: “Under the dual impact of im¬ 
proved opportunities elsewhere and deteriorating security at 
home, people are willing to move to a hitherto unbelievable 
extent.” No further comment on this “willingness,” which pro¬ 
vides such interesting new opportunities for the restructuring of 
Vietnamese society. John Donnell discusses the unusual success 
of pacification in Binh Dinh Province, particularly in the areas 
controlled by the Koreans, who “have tended to run their own 
show with their own methods and sometimes have not allowed 
the RD teams sent from Saigon all the operational leeway de¬ 
sired,” and who have been “extremely impressive in eliminating 
NLF influence.” Again, no comment is given on these methods,
