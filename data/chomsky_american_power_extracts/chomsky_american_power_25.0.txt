Many abuses at the village level were 
also eliminated, in an attempt to wean the villagers from their 
traditional belief that the government is merely an agency of 
exploitation.Extensive propaganda efforts were conducted to 
win the hearts and minds of the villagers (cf.pp.55 f.).In 
comparison with American efforts at pacification, the Japanese 
appear to have achieved considerable success—if these docu¬ 
ments can be believed—in part, apparently, because Japan was 
not committed to guaranteeing the persistence of the old semi- 
feudal order and was less solicitous of property rights.
