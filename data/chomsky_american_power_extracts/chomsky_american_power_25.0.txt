“there’s a vacuum and that is ideal for the Vietcong because 
they’ve got an organization to fill the vacuum.” This observation 
points to a difficulty that has always plagued the American 
effort. As Joseph Buttinger points out, the Diem regime too was 
unable to experiment with “freely constituted organizations” 
because these “would have been captured by the Vietminh .” 29 

Mitchell’s informative study supports an approach to counter¬ 
insurgency that has been expressed by Roger Hilsman, who 
explains that in his view, modernization “cannot help much in a 
counterguerrilla program,” because it “inevitably uproots estab¬ 
lished social systems [and] produces political and economic 
dislocation and tension.” He therefore feels that popularity of 
governments, reform, and modernization may be “important 
ingredients,” but that their role in counterinsurgency “must be 
measured more in terms of their contributions to physical se¬ 
curity .” 30 

Before leaving this symposium on social science and Vietnam, 
we should take note of the scholarly detachment that permits 
one not to make certain comments or draw certain conclusions. 
For example, John Bennett discusses the important matter of 
“geographic and job mobility”: “Under the dual impact of im¬ 
proved opportunities elsewhere and deteriorating security at 
home, people are willing to move to a hitherto unbelievable 
extent.” No further comment on this “willingness,” which pro¬ 
vides such interesting new opportunities for the restructuring of 
Vietnamese society. John Donnell discusses the unusual success 
of pacification in Binh Dinh Province, particularly in the areas 
controlled by the Koreans, who “have tended to run their own 
show with their own methods and sometimes have not allowed 
the RD teams sent from Saigon all the operational leeway de¬ 
sired,” and who have been “extremely impressive in eliminating 
NLF influence.” Again, no comment is given on these methods,

amply reported in the press , 31 or on the significance of the fact 
that Koreans are eliminating NLF influence from Vietnamese 
villages, and not allowing the Vietnamese government cadres 
the leeway desired. 

Mitchell draws no policy conclusions from his study, but oth¬ 
ers have seen the point: recall the remarks of the moderate 
scholars on the dangers of social reform. Other scholars have 
carried the analysis much further. For example, Charles Wolf, 
senior economist of the RAND Corporation, discusses the mat¬ 
ter in a recent book . 32 Wolf considers two “theoretical models” 
for analyzing insurgency problems. The first is the approach of 
the hearts-and-minds school of counterinsurgency, which em¬ 
phasizes the importance of popular support. Wolf agrees that it 
is no doubt “a desirable goal” to win “popular allegiance to a 
government that is combating an insurgent movement,” but this 
objective, he argues, is not appropriate “as a conceptual frame¬ 
work for counterinsurgency programs.” His alternative ap¬ 
proach has as its “unifying theme” the concept of “influencing 
behavior , rather than attitudes.” Thus, “confiscation of chick¬ 
ens, razing of houses, or destruction of villages have a place in 
counterinsurgency efforts, but only if they are done for a strong 
reason: namely, to penalize those who have assisted the insur¬ 
gents. . . . whatever harshness is meted out by government 
forces [must be] unambiguously recognizable as deliberately 
imposed because of behavior by the population that contributes 
to the insurgent movement.” Furthermore, it must be noted that 
“policies that would increase rural income by raising food 
prices, or projects that would increase agricultural productivity 
through distribution of fertilizer or livestock, may be of nega¬ 
tive value during an insurgency . . . since they may actually 
facilitate guerrilla operations by increasing the availability of 
inputs that the guerrillas need.” More generally: “In setting up

economic and social improvement programs, the crucial point is 
to connect such programs with the kind of population behavior 
the government wants to promote.” The principle is to reward 
the villages that cooperate and to provide penalties for the 
behavior that the government is trying to discourage. “At a
