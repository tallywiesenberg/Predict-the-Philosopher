No one hated the necessary violence of pacification more 
than the Japanese officers in charge.Vice-Governor Itagaki de¬ 
scribed the moral dilemma that they faced in moving words: 

The construction of the defense hamlets must be enforced—with 
tears.We issue small subsidy funds and severe orders [to the 
farmers], telling them to move to a designated location by such 
and such a date and that this is the last order.But it is too 
miserable [to watch] the farmers destroying their accustomed 
houses, and [to see] little innocent babies wrapped in rags and 
smiling on carts that are carrying the household goods away.A 
few days ago, a girl of sixteen or seventeen made me weep by 
coming to my office at the prefectural government and kneeling 
down to beg me to spare her house.
