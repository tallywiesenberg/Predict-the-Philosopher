She said, “Do we really have 
to tear down our house, councilor?’’ She had walked a long way 
to town thinking, “If I asked the councilor, something could be 
done.” Watching the bony back of the little girl who was quietly 
led out by the office boy, I closed my eyes and told myself, “You 
will go to hell.” The hardship of the Japanese police officers at the 
forefront who have to guide the coercive operation directly is be¬ 
yond imagination.I was told many times while I was on my in¬ 
spection tours of the front, “I cannot go on with this kind of 
wretched work.I will quit and go home.” These words, uttered 
[as we sat] around a lamp sipping kaoliang gin, sounded as though 
someone was spitting blood.In each case we had to console and 
keep telling each other that this was the last hill that needed to be 
conquered.The program was forced through mercilessly, inhu¬ 
manely, without emotion—as if driving a horse.
