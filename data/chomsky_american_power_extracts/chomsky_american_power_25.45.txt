the Japanese Army tried its “Chinghsiang” (Clean Hamlet) 
operations in Soochow in Central China and its “Ailutsun” 
(Railway Defense Village) program in Shangtung Province in 
North China....The concept of “Chinghsiang” lies in making 
the village or hamlet the basis for reforming government at the 
grass-root level; and, by concentrating all military, political, eco¬ 
nomic and ideological effort on a single village, in building it up 
into a peaceful, stabilized and secure area; then by using this 
village as a model district, in gradually extending security and 
stability to cover the whole “hsien” (county), the whole province 
and eventually the whole country.
