On July 2, 1941, a 
decision was made to move troops to southern Indochina.The 
decision was known to the American government, since the 
Japanese diplomatic code had been broken.On July 24, Presi¬ 
dent Roosevelt informed the Japanese ambassador that if Japan 
would refrain from this step, he would use his influence to 
achieve the neutralization of Indochina.This message did not 
reach the Japanese Foreign Ministry until July 27.On July 26, 
Japan announced publicly its plans to move troops to southern 
Indochina and the United States government ordered all Japa¬ 
nese assets in the United States to be frozen.
