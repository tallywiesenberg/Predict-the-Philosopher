On November 7, 1941, Japan offered to accept “the principle 
of nondiscrimination in commercial relations" in the Pacific, in¬ 
cluding China, if this principle “were adopted throughout the 
world."The qualification was, needless to say, quite unthinka¬ 
ble.Hulks final demand was that the principle be applied in the 
Japanese occupied areas and that Japan withdraw all forces 
from China and Indochina.The Western powers could not be 
expected to respond in kind in their dominions.A few days later 
came “the day that will live in infamy."
