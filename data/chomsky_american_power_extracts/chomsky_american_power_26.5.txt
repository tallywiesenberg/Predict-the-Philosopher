If anything can be more frightening than the behav¬ 
ior of the self-styled “pragmatic” and “tough-minded” policy makers 
of the Kennedy administration in this crisis, it is the attitude that

“finest hour,” in which he demonstrated his skill at the game of 
“nuclear chicken” (cf.historian Thomas Bailey, New York Times 
Magazine, November 6, 1965).7.“Where Are We Going?” Essays, pp.234-60.
