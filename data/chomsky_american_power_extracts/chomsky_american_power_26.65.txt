Arnold wanted as big a finale as possible, hoping that USASTAF 
could hit the Tokyo area in a 1,000-plane mission: the Twentieth Air 
Force had put up 853 B-29’s and 79 fighters on 1 August, and Arnold 
thought the number could be rounded out by calling on Doolittle's 
Eighth Air Force.Spaatz still wanted to drop the third atom bomb on 
Tokyo but thought that battered city a poor target for conventional 
bombing; instead, he proposed to divide his forces between seven targets.Arnold was apologetic about the unfortunate mixup on the 11th and, ac¬ 
cepting Spaatz’ amendment, assured him that his orders had been “co¬ 
ordinated with my superiors all the way to the top.” The teleconference 
ended with a fervid “Thank God” from Spaatz..
