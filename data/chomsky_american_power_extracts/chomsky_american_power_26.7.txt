..From the Marianas, 

449 B-29’s went out for a daylight strike on the 14th, and that night, 
with top officers standing by at Washington and Guam for a last- 
minute cancellation, 372 more were airborne.Seven planes dispatched 
on special bombing missions by the 509th Group brought the number 
of B-29’s to 828, and with 186 fighter escorts dispatched, USASTAF 
passed Arnold’s goal with a total of 1,014 aircraft.There were no 
losses, and before the last B-29 returned President Truman announced 
the unconditional surrender of Japan.
