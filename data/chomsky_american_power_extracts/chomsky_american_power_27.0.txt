protect a ruling elite from internal insurgency. 35 

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of scholarly work such as 
this is the way in which behavioral-science rhetoric is used to 
lend a vague aura of respectability. One might construct some 
such chain of associations as this. Science, as everyone knows, is 
responsible, moderate, unsentimental, and otherwise good. Be¬ 
havioral science tells us that we can be concerned only with 
behavior and control of behavior. Therefore we should be con¬ 
cerned only with behavior and control of behavior ; 36 and it is 
responsible, moderate, unsentimental, and otherwise good to 
control behavior by appropriately applied reward and punish-

ment. Concern for loyalties and attitudes is emotional and un¬ 
scientific. As rational men, believers in the scientific ethic, 
we should be concerned with manipulating behavior in a desir¬ 
able direction, and not be deluded by mystical notions of 
freedom, individual needs, or popular will. 

Let me make it clear that I am not criticizing the behavioral 
sciences because they lend themselves to such perversion. On 
other grounds, the “behavioral persuasion” seems to me to lack 
merit; it seriously mistakes the method of science and imposes 
pointless methodological strictures on the study of man and 
society, but this is another matter entirely. It is, however, fair to 
inquire to what extent the popularity of this approach is based 
on its demonstrated achievements, and to what extent its appeal 
is based on the ease with which it can be refashioned as a new 
coercive ideology with a faintly scientific tone. (In passing, I 
think it is worth mention that the same questions can be raised 
outside of politics, specifically, in connection with education 
and therapy.) 

The assumption that the colonial power is benevolent and has 
the interests of the natives at heart is as old as imperialism 
itself. Thus the liberal Herman Merivale, lecturing at Oxford in 
1840, lauded the “British policy of colonial enlightenment” 
which “stands in contrast to that of our ancestors,” who cared 
little “about the internal government of their colonies, and kept 
them in subjection in order to derive certain supposed commer¬ 
cial advantages from them,” whereas we “give them commercial 
advantages, and tax ourselves for their benefit, in order to give 
them an interest in remaining under our supremacy, that we
