Shigemitsu describes the Manchurian inci¬ 
dent as, in effect, one aspect of an attempted coup, of which the 
domestic aspect failed.From his viewpoint, “Manchuria was an out¬ 
lying district belonging to and colonized by China,” a “sparsely popu¬ 
lated, backward country on the borders of China.” By 1930, the 
“revolutionary diplomacy” of China was attempting to reverse and 
overthrow the unequal treaties, including long-standing Japanese in¬ 
terests.At a time when the only solution to world problems was free 
trade, Europe was reverting to a closed autarchic economy and block¬ 
ing trade between Japan and the colonial possessions of the European 
powers, and the League of Nations was following the policy of keep¬ 
ing the world static, in the interests of established imperialism.The 
Kwantung Army acted unilaterally, to protect what they took to be 
the legitimate interests of Japan in Manchuria.Later steps to defend 
Manchukuo were determined in part by the threat of ultimate Com¬ 
munist encirclement (by Communist Chinese and the Soviet Union), 
and in part as an attempt to “counter the world movement to closed 
economies,” which required that the Japanese must attempt “to attain 
self-sufficiency.” This view of the situation, to which I return below, 
was not unrealistic.
