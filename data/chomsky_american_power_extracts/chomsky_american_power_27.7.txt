Comparisons are difficult, but it seems that the Japanese were 
considerably more successful in establishing a functioning puppet gov¬ 
ernment in Manchuria than the United States has ever been in Viet¬ 
nam, just as the Germans were more successful in converting French 
nationalist forces to their ends in occupied and Vichy France than the 
United States has been in Vietnam.On the insurgency that developed 
in Manchuria, and the Japanese attempts to suppress it, see below, 
pages 195-201.38.Quotes and paraphrase from Owen Lattimore, “China and the 
Barbarians,” in Joseph Barnes, ed., Empire in the East (Garden City,
