ventionist,” recognizing “that it goes counter to all the tradi¬ 
tional conventions of diplomatic usage.” Some may ask whether 
“we have the moral right to interfere in the properly autono¬ 
mous affairs of others,” but Henderson feels that the Com¬ 
munist threat fully justifies such interference and urges that we 
be ready to “use our ‘special forces’ when the next bell rings,” 
with no moral qualms or hesitation. The second barrier is that 
“our knowledge is pitifully inadequate.” He therefore calls on 
the academic community, which will be only too willing to 
oblige, to supply “the body of expertise and the corps of spe¬ 
cialists,” the knowledge, the practitioners, and the teachers, to 
enable us to conduct such a “resourceful diplomacy” more 
effectively. 

Turning to the liberal wing, we find that Roger Hilsman has a 
rather similar message in his study of the diplomacy of the 
Kennedy administration, To Move a Nation. He informs us that 
the most divisive issue among the “hardheaded and pragmatic 
liberals” of the Kennedy team was how the United States 
should deal with the problem of “modern guerrilla warfare, as 
the Communists practice it.” The problem is that this “is inter¬ 
nal war, an ambiguous aggression that avoids direct and open 
attack violating international frontiers” (italics his). Appar¬ 
ently, the hardheaded and pragmatic liberals were never di¬ 
vided on the issue of our right to violate international frontiers 
in reacting to such “internal war.” As a prime example of the 
“kind of critical, searching analysis” that the new, liberal, re¬ 
vitalized State Department was trying to encourage, Hilsman 
cites a study directed to showing how the United States might 
have acted more effectively to overthrow the Mossadegh gov¬ 
ernment in Iran. Allen Dulles was “fundamentally right,” ac¬ 
cording to Hilsman, in judging that Mossadegh in Iran (like 
Arbenz in Guatemala) had come to power (to be sure,

tion of creating a Communist state”—a most amazing statement 
on the part of the State Department chief of intelligence; and 
Dulles was fundamentally right in urging support from the 
United States “to loyal anti-Communist elements” in Iran and 
Guatemala to meet the danger, even though “no invitation was
