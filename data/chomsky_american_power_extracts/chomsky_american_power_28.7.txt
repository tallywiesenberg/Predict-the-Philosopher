This “interruption” continued, for example, with 
the policies of Magsaysay, who “cleared away the ambivalence which 
had arisen in the persistent experimentation with public corporations 
of various kinds by a firm avowal that public policy would reflect faith 
in and dependence upon private enterprise” (Frank H. Golay, “Eco¬ 
nomic Collaboration: The Role of American Investment,” in ibid., p. 
109).One effect of this “improvement” in “the political and economic 
aspects of the investment climate” was that from 1957 to 1963 “earn¬ 
ings accruing to American foreign investors were in excess of twice 
the amount of direct foreign investment in the Philippines,” an inter¬ 
esting case of foreign aid.In fact, the preferential trade relations 
forced on the Philippines in 1946 virtually guaranteed American 
domination of the economy.Two Filipino economists, writing in the 
same volume, point out that “acceptance of the Trade Act by the 
Philippines was the price for war damage payments.In view of the 
prevailing economic circumstances, Filipinos had no alternative but to 
accept, after considerable controversy and with obvious reluctance” 
(p. 132).
