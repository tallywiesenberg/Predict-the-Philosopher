“Despite the vigor of the Japanese government’s efforts to convey 
the idea that they wanted American aid in achieving a quick settlement 
[in 1937], United States officials again failed to understand the situa¬ 
tion” (Borg, op.cit.y p. 466).Unfortunately for the Japanese apolo¬ 
gists, they were unable to use some of the devices available to their 
current American counterparts to explain the failure of the Chinese to 
accept their honorable offers.For example, the director of Harvard’s 
East Asian Research Center, John King Fairbank, thoughtfully ex¬ 
plains that “when we offer to negotiate we are making an honorable 
offer which, in our view, is a civilized and normal thing to do,” but the 
Asian mind does not share our belief “in the supremacy of law and the 
rights of the individual protected by law through due process” and is 
thus unable to perceive our honorable intent and obvious sincerity 
(Boston Globe y August 19, 1967).It is only those rather superficial 
critics who do not understand the Asian mind who insist on taking the 
North Vietnamese literally when they state that negotiations can fol¬ 
low a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, or who point out 
the moral absurdity of the plea that both the victim and his assailant 
“cease their violence.”
