See Chong-sik Lee, Counterinsurgency in Manchuria: The Japa¬ 
nese Experience, RAND Corporation Memorandum RM-5012-ARPA, 
January 1967, unlimited distribution.I am indebted to Herbert Bix for 
bringing this study to my attention.As is very often the case with 
RAND Corporation studies, it is difficult to determine whether it was 
written seriously or with tongue in cheek.There is no reason to ques¬ 
tion the scholarship, however.The original documents translated in 
the memorandum are particularly interesting.
