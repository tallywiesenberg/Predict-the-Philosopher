the wounds inflicted on Nature, so ruthlessly destroyed for this, are 
too brutal to see.Beautiful grasslands, the verdant forests and the 
rich crops have all been burned by flame throwers, napalm bombs and 
chemical defoliants.The great earth has been gouged and dug over.The ugly land, no longer green, has lost its power to attract people and 
to stir deep in the hearts of people a love for their birthplace and their 
motherland.” There is, he feels, little chance that revolutionary devel¬ 
opment will succeed “when Nature has been turned into a scorched 
earth and the system and the traditions born of a race of people have 
been destroyed.”
