“power in our time has more intelligence in its service, and 
allows that intelligence more discretion as to its methods, than

Senator Fulbright has developed a similar theme in an im¬

universities to form “an effective counterweight to the military- 
industrial complex by strengthening their emphasis on the tradi¬ 
tional values of our democracy.” Instead they have “joined the 
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influence.” Specifi¬ 
cally, he refers to the failure of the social scientists, “who ought 
to be acting as responsible and independent critics of the Gov¬ 
ernment’s policies,” but who instead become the agents of these 
policies.“While young dissenters plead for resurrection of the 
American promise, their elders continue to subvert it.” With 
“the surrender of independence, the neglect of teaching, and 
the distortion of scholarship,” the university “is not only failing 
to meet its responsibilities to its students; it is betraying a pub¬ 
lic trust.” 

The extent of this betrayal might be argued; its existence, as a 
threatening tendency, is hardly in doubt.
