The professional, however, tends to define his problems 
on the basis of the technique that he has mastered, and has a 
natural desire to apply his skills.Commenting on this process, 
Senator Clark quotes the remarks of Dr. Harold Agnew, direc¬ 
tor of the Los Alamos Laboratories Weapons Division: “The 
basis of advanced technology is innovation and nothing is more 
stifling to innovation than seeing one’s product not used or 
ruled out of consideration on flimsy premises involving public 
world opinion” 3 —“a shocking statement and a dangerous one,” 
as Clark rightly comments.In much the same way, behavioral 
scientists who believe themselves to be in possession of certain 
techniques of control and manipulation will tend to search for 
problems to which their knowledge and skills might be rele¬ 
vant, defining these as the “important problems”; and it will 
come as no surprise that they occasionally express their con¬ 
tempt for “flimsy premises involving public world opinion” that 
restrict the application of these skills.Thus among engineers, 
there are the “weapons cultists” who construct their bombs and 
missiles, and among the behavioral scientists, we find the tech¬ 
nicians who design and carry out “experiments with population 
and resources control methods” in Vietnam.4 

These various factors—access to power, shared ideology, pro¬ 
fessionalization—may or may not be deplorable in themselves, 
but there can be no doubt that they interact so as to pose a 
serious threat to the integrity of scholarship in fields that are 
struggling for intellectual content and are thus particularly sus¬ 
ceptible to the workings of a kind of Gresham’s law.
