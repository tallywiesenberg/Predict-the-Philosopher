The first part of “Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship” is based 
on a lecture by the same title originally delivered as part of the 
Albert Schweitzer Lecture Series at New York University, 
which appears in Power and Consciousness in Society, New 
York University Press, New York. We gratefully acknowledge
