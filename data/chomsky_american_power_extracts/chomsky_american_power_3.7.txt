Daniel Bell, for example, wrote that “in

tained that we have in effect already achieved “the egalitarian 
and socially mobile society which the ‘free floating intellectuals' 
associated with the Marxist tradition have been calling for 
during the last hundred years.” Granting the obvious general 
rise in standard of living, the judgment of Gunnar Myrdal 
seems far more appropriate to the actual situation when he 
says: “The common idea that America is an immensely rich and 
affluent country is very much an exaggeration.American afflu¬ 
ence is heavily mortgaged.America carries a tremendous bur¬ 
den of debt to its poor people.That this debt must be paid is 
not only a wish of the do-gooders.Not paying it implies a risk 
for the social order and for democracy as we have known it.” 11 
Surely the claim that all groups can easily enter the mass-con¬ 
sumption economy and “erase the visible demarcations” is a 
considerable exaggeration.
