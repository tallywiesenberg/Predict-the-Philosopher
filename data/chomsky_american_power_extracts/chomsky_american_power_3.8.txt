Under the leadership of this 
“new breed of politicians-intellectuals,” America has become “the 
creative society; the others, consciously and unconsciously, are

emulative.” We see this, for example, in mathematics, the bio¬ 
logical sciences, anthropology, philosophy, cinema, music, his¬ 
torical scholarship, and so on, where other cultures, hopelessly 
outdistanced, merely observe and imitate what America creates.Thus we move towards a new world-wide “ ‘super-culture/ 
strongly influenced by American life, with its own universal 
electronic-computer language,” with an enormous and growing 
“psycho-cultural gap” separating America from the rest of the 
“developed world.” 

It is impossible even to imagine what Brzezinski thinks a 
“universal electronic-computer language” may be, or what cul¬ 
tural values he thinks will be created by the new “technologi¬ 
cally dominant and conditioned technetron” who, he apparently 
believes, may prove to be the true “repository of that indefinable 
quality we call human.” It would hardly be rewarding to try to 
disentangle Brzezinski’s confusions and misunderstandings.What 
is interesting, rather, is the way his dim awareness of current de¬ 
velopments in science and technology is used to provide an 
ideological justification for the “increasing role in the key de¬ 
cision-making institutions of individuals with special intellectual 
and scientific attainments,” the new “organisation-oriented, ap¬ 
plication-minded intellectuals” based in the university, “the 
creative eye of the massive communications complex.” 

Parallel to the assumption that all is basically well at home is 
the widely articulated belief that the problems of international 
society, too, would be subject to intelligent management were it 
not for the machinations of the Communists.One aspect of this 
complacence is the belief that the Cold War was entirely the 
result of Russian (later Chinese) aggressiveness.For example, 
Daniel Bell has described the origins of the Cold War in the 
following terms: “When the Russians began stirring up the 
Greek guerrilla EAM in what had been tacitly acknowledged at
