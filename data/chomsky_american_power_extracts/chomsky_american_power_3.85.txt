Following the 
rejection of the Marshall Plan and the Communist coup in 
Czechoslovakia in February, 1948, the Cold War was on in 
earnest.’’ 15 Clearly, this will hardly do as a balanced and objec¬ 
tive statement of the origins of the Cold War, but the distortion 
it reflects is an inherent element in Bell’s optimism about the 
new society, since it enables him to maintain that our Cold War 
posture is purely reactive, and that once Communist belliger¬ 
ence is tamed, the new technical intelligentsia can turn its at¬ 
tention to the construction of a more decent society.A related element in the ideology of the liberal intellectual is 
the firm belief in the fundamental generosity of Western policy 
towards the Third World.Adam Ulam again provides a typical 
example: “Problems of an international society undergoing an 
economic and ideological revolution seem to defy ... the gen¬ 
erosity—granted its qualifications and errors—that has charac¬ 
terized the policy of the leading democratic powers of the 
West.” 16 Even Hans Morgenthau succumbs to this illusion.He 
summarizes a discussion of intervention with these remarks: 
“We have intervened in the political, military and economic 
affairs of other countries to the tune of far in excess of $100 
billion, and we are at present involved in a costly and risky war 
in order to build a nation in South Vietnam.Only the enemies 
of the United States will question the generosity of these efforts, 
which have no parallel in history.” 17 Whatever one may think 
about the $100 billion, it is difficult to see why anyone should 
take seriously the professed “generosity” of our effort to build a 
nation in South Vietnam, any more than the similar professions 
of benevolence by our many forerunners in such enterprises.
