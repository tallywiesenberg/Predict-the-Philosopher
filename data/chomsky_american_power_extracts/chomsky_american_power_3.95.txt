for “our basic position” in Vietnam.A Communist victory in 
Vietnam, they argue, would “gravely jeopardize the possibilities 
for a political equilibrium in Asia, seriously damage our credi¬ 
bility, deeply affect the morale—and the policies—of our Asian 
allies and the neutrals.” By a “political equilibrium,” they do 
not, of course, refer to the status quo as of 1945-1946 or as 
outlined by international agreement at Geneva in 1954.They do 
not explain why the credibility of the United States is more 
important than the credibility of the indigenous elements 
in Vietnam who have dedicated themselves to a war of national 
liberation.
