Ronald Steel, Pax Americana (New York, The Viking Press, 
1967).As Steel observes, this generosity is the price we must pay to 
enjoy our imperial role.Compare the remarks of H. Merivale, cited on 
page 58 above.Perhaps the introductory chapters of this book, from 
which these remarks are selected almost at random, are meant as parody, 
in which case they serve as witness to, rather than evidence for, the 
pervasive self-delusion of our highly conformist and ideologically 
committed society.In American scholarship dealing with the internaÂ¬ 
tional role of the United States, it is often difficult to determine what is 
irony and what is sentimentality.
