Consider, 
for example, the reaction of Senator Young to the news that the 
South Vietnamese forces are unwilling to do what amounts to 
police work, so that so-called “pacification” must be taken over 
by the American army: 

If the South Vietnamese forces of Prime Minister Ky are so 
inadequate in numbers, intelligence, and training that they cannot 
handle entirely the pacification program in the villages ..., then 
instead of Americans trying to train, indoctrinate, and pacify an 
alien people, the time is long past due for us to withdraw to our 
coastal bases and eventually from Vietnam.2 

This reaction echoes that of Senator Symington after a recent 
Asian trip: 

If the South Vietnamese do not achieve this pacification, there is 
no point in this country continuing to pour out lives and treasure 
in order to protect a government that can neither consolidate nor 
control what has been taken from them by their own citizens and 
the North Vietnamese.
