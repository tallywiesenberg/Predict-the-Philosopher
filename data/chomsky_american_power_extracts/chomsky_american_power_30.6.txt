Observe that the date of this evaluation was February 1965; 
as we recall, “convincing proof of the Communist charge of 
imperialism” was not long in coming.And today, there is very 
good reason to suppose that we will find ourselves in “an ex¬ 
tended war of the white man against the Asians, on the main¬ 
land of Asia.” 

Far from being naive, the analysis of the situation that leads 
to the call for withdrawal—not eventual but immediate—seems 
to me entirely realistic; and the dimensions of the Vietnamese 
tragedy are so awesome that whatever the prospects for success 
may be, the responsible citizen must spare no effort to create 
the political climate, the background of insight and understand¬ 
ing, in which this call will become a powerful one.The urgency 
of this matter can hardly be exaggerated.It seems unlikely that 
the Johnson administration will be willing to face the 1968 elec¬ 
tions with an unwinnable war on its hands.The prospects are 
therefore for sharp escalation, perhaps a forced confrontation 
with China.
