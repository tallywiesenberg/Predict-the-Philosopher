To this day, 80% of the peasantry ...falls under Vietcong 
influence if not outright control.” 7 The very terminology of this 
report gives some insight into the reasons for the recurrent 
failure; it has yet to be demonstrated that the Americans are 
correct in their unquestioned assumption that the peasants of 
Vietnam are objects, incapable of political expression or alle¬ 
giance, to be “controlled” by one side or the other.The report 
continues: “If the South Vietnamese themselves cannot achieve 
support for the government among their own people, it is un¬ 
likely that ‘giant white foreigners’ will be able to do this for 
them.” Yet it is just this attempt to which we are now reduced, 
with the military takeover.
