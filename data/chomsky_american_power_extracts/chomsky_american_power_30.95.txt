But we are very weak politically and without 
the strong political support of the population which the NLF 
have.Thus now if we defeat them militarily, they can come to 
power because of their greater political strength.We now have 
(thanks to the support of our Allies) a strong military instruÂ¬ 
ment.But we are without a political instrument that can compete 
with the communists in the south.Such a political instrument we 
must now begin to create, a process that will take a generation.
