Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


draw American troops from the country.” This, however, would 
be “irrational,” because throughout the non-Communist world 
“respect for American patience and tolerance in dealing with 
nondemocratic governments would decline”; furthermore, 
“Thailand’s security and economic progress would be jeopard¬ 
ized.” To the pragmatic liberal, it is clear that confidence in our 
commitment to military dictatorships such as that in Thailand 
must be maintained, as in fact was implied by the moderate 
scholars’ document discussed earlier; and it would surely be 
unfortunate to endanger the prospects for further development 
along the lines that were initiated in such a promising way 
under American influence, and that are now secured by some 
40,000 American troops. 

A second alternative would be neutralization of Thailand and 
other nations in Southeast Asia. This also is irrational. For one 
thing, “the withdrawal of the American military presence would 
not be matched by the removal of any Communist forces”— 
there being no nonindigenous Communist forces—and there¬ 
fore we would gain nothing by this strategy. Furthermore, we* 
could never be certain that there would not be “infiltration of 
Communist insurgents in the future.” And finally, “the Thai 
leaders have decided to cooperate with the United States,” for 
reasons that are hardly obscure. 

A third alternative would be to use our power in Thailand to 
“push political and economic reforms.” But this policy alterna¬ 
tive would “do great damage to American strategy in Thailand 
and other non-Communist nations.” And what is more, “exten¬ 
sive interference in the domestic affairs of other nations, no 
matter how well intentioned, is contrary to American tradi¬ 
tions,” as our postwar record in Thailand clearly demon¬ 
strates. 43 

Therefore, we must turn to the fourth alternative, and main-

tain our present policy. “This alternative is probably the most 
rational and realistic. The military policy can be enhanced if it 
is realized that only American military power is capable of 
preventing large-scale overt aggression in Southeast Asia, and
