is unrealistic to speak of a cease fire until after we have built up 
our political strength to the point where we can compete with the 
communists successfully.He goes on to say that the war must be carried to North Viet¬ 
nam, with the commitment of a million American troops, then 
probably to China as well.Finally, he argues that “it might be 
necessary to move on to World War III so as to insure that 
communist power was fully removed from Vietnam,” a not 
unrealistic forecast, if the United States continues to insist that 
its proteges be spared the defeat that they know to be a cer¬ 
tainty if the struggle is ever permitted to shift to the political 
arena, where they lack “the strong political support of the popu¬ 
lation which the NLF have.” 

Buddhist leaders appear to share this analysis.In the cited 
memorandum, Kahin quotes Buddhist spokesmen, obviously 
unidentified, who point out that the present Saigon regime, 
dependent for its life on United States support, can do nothing 
to “win” the war.They plead that the United States lift the 
tight lid that is clamped on political expression and political 
activity so that a government with some claim to legitimacy can
