Despite the outra¬ 
geous suppression of Buddhist political activity, the Buddhists 
still appear to be confident, as they have been for years, that 
they can function effectively in cooperation with the NLF.The 
recent “Policy Statement” published by the Overseas Vietna¬ 
mese Buddhist Association emphasizes this (as does the touch¬ 
ing and pathetic book by Thich Nhat Hanh, Vietnam: Lotus in 
a Sea of Fire) y and, in fact, puts forth a program for South 
Vietnam that is not markedly different from that of the NLF.American authorities have repeatedly indicated that they 
share this assessment of the Saigon government and its popular 
base.Both the present Assistant Secretary of State for Far East¬ 
ern Affairs and his predecessor have expressed their belief that 
neutralization of South Vietnam would lead to a Communist 
takeover, and it is widely admitted that the American expedi¬ 
tionary force was introduced to stave off what was in essence a 
political defeat.In his revealing study of the Vietcong, Ameri¬ 
can foreign service officer Douglas Pike concludes, with ample 
evidence, that the NLF victory in the now long-forgotten civil 
war was essentially a political and organizational victory, 
achieved by building a mass movement.
