The NLF, he states, is 
the only “truly mass-based political party in South Vietnam.” 
Only the Buddhists—whose political organization was smashed 
in the spring of 1966—could realistically hope to take part in a 
coalition with the NLF, in his judgment.General Richard Stil-

theater, informed Senator Young that we are putting down “an

The basis for the success of the insurrection is not very ob¬ 
scure.Denis Warner, as anti-Communist as any newsman who 
has worked in Southeast Asia, pointed out years ago that “in 
hundreds of villages all over South-East Asia the only people 
working at the grass roots for an uplift in people's living stand¬ 
ards are the Communists.” 10 And to the Communist agit-prop 
successes, the Americans have contributed mightily, for ex* 
ample, with the terroristic bombing policy.American sources 
indicate that in the first year of American bombing of the South, 
1965, local recruitment for the Vietcong tripled.11 The head of 
the Saigon office of Asahi Shimbun concludes that “It is certain 
that the escalation and spread of the war, even though its re¬ 
sults may be advantageous to the Saigon Government itself, only 
serves to heighten still further opposition to the war among the 
general population,” adding that “The number of draft-dodgers 
and deserters among young South Vietnamese is a sign of the 
failure of the war, by and large, to win the support of young 
people, who tend to view it as an American war.” 12 And the 
situation can only worsen.
