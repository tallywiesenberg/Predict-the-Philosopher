Saigon authorities indicate that there 
are now some two million refugees, most of them, according to 
the reports of war correspondents, victims of American bom¬ 
bardment or forced resettlement.An Associated Press report 
from Saigon gives the following shattering forecast: 

The United States high command, preoccupied for two years with 
hunting down North Vietnamese regulars, now is looking more 
toward the populated valleys and lowlands where the enemy 
wields potent political influence and gets his sustenance.Quick 
gains are hoped for by forced resettlement of chronically Com¬ 
munist areas, followed up with scorched-earth operations that 
deny enemy troops all food, shelter, and material support.Cen¬ 
tral highlands valleys are being denuded of all living things; people 
ringing the Communist war zones in the South have been moved.229
