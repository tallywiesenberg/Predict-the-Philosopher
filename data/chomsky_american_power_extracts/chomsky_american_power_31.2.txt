withdrawal are simply proposing that we eliminate this threat, 
as only we can do.It is hardly surprising that the peasantry refuses allegiance to 
a constituent assembly that could muster 3 votes out of 117 for 
the one land-reform measure that was introduced, or that even 
the residents of Saigon are less than enthusiastic about a gov¬

in Ky’s cabinet seems to be the major supplier of drugs to the 
Vietcong—of course, after receiving a third of a million dollars 
in kickbacks from the American and West German suppliers.14 
Nor is it obscure why the American government continues to 
use its military force to impose on the people of Vietnam the 
regime of the most corrupt, most reactionary elements in Viet¬ 
namese society.There is simply no one else who will do its 
bidding, and resist the overwhelming popular sentiment for 
peace and, no doubt, neutralism.
