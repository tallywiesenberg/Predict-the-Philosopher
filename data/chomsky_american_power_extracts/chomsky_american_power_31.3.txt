We have nothing more to lose, except for independence 
and liberty.But to safeguard these, believe me, we are ready to 
endure anything.In South Vietnam, the American attack has been far more 
severe, and direct report from its victims is lacking.But some 
statistics tell the story well enough.According to American 
sources, the Vietcong are “able to enlist an estimated 7,000 
recruits a month.” 16 Recently, an extensive propaganda barrage 
has enthusiastically proclaimed that in March 1967 there were 
5,557 defectors from the Vietcong, almost twice as many as in 
any previous month.
