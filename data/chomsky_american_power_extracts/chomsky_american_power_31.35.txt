Only the careful reader would have noted 
that of these “defectors” 630 were identified as military men and 
301 as political cadres, the rest being peasants, probably coming 
for a free meal.17 Seven thousand new recruits and 630 defec¬ 
tors—these figures indicate graphically by what means the 
American war in Vietnam must be won.The preceding description is based on reports in early 1967.Rereading it in January 1968, I need hardly emphasize how 
little the situation has changed.The savage battering of the 
Vietnamese continues without pause; in scale, it is unique in the 
history of warfare.
