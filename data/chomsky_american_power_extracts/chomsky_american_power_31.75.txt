Occasionally, spokesmen 
for the American government have expressed themselves quite 
clearly about the prospects for negotiations.For example, Gen¬ 
eral Maxwell Taylor stated in August 1965: 

... the army is the power in South Vietnam.The generals are 
completely committed.They’ve burned all their bridges behind 
them.They would never tolerate a government that was caught 
surreptitiously or overtly negotiating with Hanoi or with the Viet- 
cong.
