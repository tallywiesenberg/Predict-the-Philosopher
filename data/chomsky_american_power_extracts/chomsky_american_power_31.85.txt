area and the Saigon government is one of strong mutual 
mistrust, according to this report.There has been no more revealing commentary on the situa¬ 
tion in the American-controlled areas of South Vietnam than 
the testimony elicited by Congressman Donald Riegle from 
Rutherford Poats, in May 1967, released in September.37 

Mr. Poats had been, for the preceding three years, “the No.1 
man overseeing our economic program, the so-called ‘other war’ 
in Vietnam,” and had just been promoted to deputy director of 
the Agency for International Development.According to this 
testimony, as Congressman Riegle reports it, “the annual U.S. 
commodity import program in Vietnam is actually a political 
ransom paid to powerful South Vietnamese commercial inter¬ 
ests to insure political stability in South Vietnam, and insure 
their continued support of the war.” Poats agreed with Con¬ 
gressman Riegle’s summary statement that “if we were to with¬ 
draw our AID program, ... the government would likely col¬ 
lapse over there, and for all intents and purposes the war would 
be over,” and that “if this war were conducted in a way that 
required greater economic sacrifices by certain elements in 
Vietnam, the political instability is such that the country might 
fly apart.” The situation is such that “there would not be mili¬ 
tary action by the Vietnamese military forces today had it not 
been for our provision of commercial imports,” because of the 
resulting “inflation, disruption, and loss of morale.” He also 
agreed that “there is certainly a substantial element of truth” in 
Congressman Riegle’s judgment that without the “ransom,” 
commercial interests in South Vietnam would “get their sympa¬ 
thizers out in the streets and bring down the Government” 
(though he felt this judgment to be “harsh”).
