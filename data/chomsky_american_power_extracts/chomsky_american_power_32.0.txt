power over adjoining regions.” Such a base would permit the 
formation of a regional organization, under our dominance, that 
would make possible “direct intervention in Korea, Vietnam,. 
Laos and Cambodia” without the onus of unilateral interven¬ 
tion (“in the face of brazen communist aggression, it is not the 
fact of intervention as such that constitutes the issue but rather 
its unilateral character”). 

We must understand that for the preservation of Western 
interests, there is no reasonable alternative to the construction 
of such a base of power in territories over which we possess 
direct sovereignty. We cannot maintain the “historic connec¬ 
tion” between Asia and the West unless we participate in Asian 
affairs “through the exercise of power and influence.” We must 
accept “the fact that we are engaged in a serious struggle for 
cultural survival that involves that continuous presence of 
Western-oriented communities” in Asia. It is an illusion to be¬ 
lieve that we can retreat from Asia and leave it to its own 
devices, for our own Western culture must be understood as “a 
minority movement of recent date in the evolution of civiliza¬ 
tion.” and it cannot be taken for granted that Asia will remain

“incapable of intervening in our affairs.” Thus to defend our¬ 
selves, we must intervene with force in the affairs of Asia. If we 
fail to establish “our industrial enterprise system” universally, 
we will have to “defend our privileges and gains by means of 
the continuing, brutalizing, and costly exercise of superior force 
in every corner of the globe.” 

Why are we justified in forceful intervention in the affairs of 
Asia? “One obvious justification for United States intervention 
in Asian affairs lies in our leadership of the world struggle 
against communism. Communist political and economic infiltra¬ 
tion among a majority of the world’s peoples appears to Ameri¬ 
can political leadership to be fatal to our safety and progress; 
this attitude is supported almost unanimously by public opin¬ 
ion.” Pursuing this logic a few steps further, we will soon have 
the same “obvious justification” for taking out China with nu¬ 
clear weapons—and perhaps France as well, for good meas¬ 
ure.
