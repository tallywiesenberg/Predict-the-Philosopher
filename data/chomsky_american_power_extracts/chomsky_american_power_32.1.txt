Christopher Lydon, the Boston Globe correspondent who ac¬ 
companied General Gavin on his recent trip to Vietnam, con¬ 
cluded a series of articles reporting his impressions with a quo¬ 
tation from Ton That Thien, managing editor of the Vietnam 
Guardian, which was suppressed by the Saigon regime when it 
printed a report questioning the official claim that Assembly 
member Tran Van Van was assassinated by the Vietcong.Thien 
defines what he sees as the only possible American “victory”: 

You cannot defeat the other side militarily unless you devote the 
next 30 or 40 years to it.You can win if you keep killing for a 
generation.You simply exterminate all the Vietnamese—the way 
you killed the Indians in America—and there will be no more 
war.Lydon comments: “This agony, if not utter desperation, among 
what seemed to me the most sensitive and patriotic Vietnamese, 
about the burden of American arms on their country is the 
overriding impression I carry back from this tortured capital.” 41 
This agony is shared by the most perceptive observers of the 
Vietnam tragedy, even those who are basically in support of the 
American military intervention.
