In the light of what we have seen in the past three years, it is 
difficult to become excited over such matters as the ambiguity, 
or duplicity, of the American government position on the Gen¬ 
eva agreements, or the numerous violations of domestic and 
international law that have accompanied our intervention in the 
internal affairs of Vietnam.Nevertheless, these matters, and in 
particular the reaction as they have become too clear to over¬ 
look, are quite revealing for anyone concerned with the Ameri¬ 
can war in Vietnam and its implications for the future.It was, 
at one time, quite normal to denounce the “Communists” for 
their disregard of international law and treaty obligations.Now, 
how r ever, many Americans tend to scoff at such matters as irrele¬ 
vant, unrealistic.Suddenly, the Constitution and the system of 
treaties to which we have committed ourselves—the United Na¬ 
tions Charter in particular—have become “outmoded,” inap¬ 
propriate to the complexities of current history, which require a 
powerful executive, free to react with overwhelming military 
force to real or alleged “emergencies” and “attacks”—such as 
the alleged Tonkin Bay attack.
