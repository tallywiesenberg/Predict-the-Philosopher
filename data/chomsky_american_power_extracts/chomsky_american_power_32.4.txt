Secretary Dulles, it will be recalled, went still further in his 
aims, as when he advised the French ambassador, prior to the 
conference, that “above all, the deltas of the Red and Mekong 
rivers must be retained as bases from which a counterattack 
could recover what was lost to the Viet Minh at the conference 
table.” 45 It would be interesting, though probably impossible, 
to trace the ways in which the United States and its Saigon ally 
acted on this concept.Bernard Fall claims, on what evidence he 
does not say, that “constantly since 1956” small saboteur groups 
have been parachuted or infiltrated into North Vietnam, though

The Logic of Withdrawal 


“the casualty rate is very high and successes, if any, are few and 
far between.” 40 Richard Goodwin dates these attempts from 
1958.47 Recall that even according to American propaganda, 
“There was no serious threat [in South Vietnam] until 1959-60, 
when North Vietnam set in motion a systematic effort to seize 
control of South Vietnam by force.” 48 In fact, the American 
government claims only that infiltration of trained South Viet¬ 
namese cadres began in 1959; even just prior to the American 
takeover of the war in early 1965, surveys of Vietcong prisoners 
and defectors found “most native South Vietnamese guerrillas 
unaware of any North Vietnamese role in the war, except as a 
valued ally.” 49 A comparative study of the success of the South 
Vietnamese commandos in North Vietnam and the Northern- 
trained South Vietnamese cadres sent to South Vietnam in the 
1960s might provide an interesting commentary on some of the 
strange ideas about “revolutionary guerrilla war” that appear in 
current American propaganda.It is curious, incidentally, that today only the United States 
and the “.Communists” insist that South Vietnam is a separate 
and independent entity.The Saigon authorities maintain, in 
article 1 of the new constitution, that “Vietnam [not South 
Vietnam] is a territorially indivisible, unified, and independent 
republic,” of which they claim to be the rulers; article 107 of the 
constitution specifies that article 1 cannot be amended.
