Further justification is that the defense of our western sea¬ 
board “requires that the North Pacific be controlled as a virtual 
American lake,” a fact which “provides one basis for United 
States intervention in power struggles throughout the region,” 
to preserve the security of this mare nostrum . Our “victory over 
Japan left a power vacuum in Southeast Asia and the Far East 
that was tempting to communist aggression; therefore, we had 
to step in and use our military power.” “Island possessions, such 
as Guam, those of the strategic trust territories, and probably 
Okinawa, remain indispensable, if not to the narrow defense of 
our shores, certainly to the military posture essential to our total 
security and world aims .” 45 Apart from the magnificent scope 
of this vision, rarely equaled by our forerunners, the termi¬ 
nology is not unfamiliar. 

There are, to be sure, certain restraints that we must observe

as we design our policy of establishing an “operational base” for 
exercise of power in the Far East; specifically, “policy must rest 
on political and social objectives that are acceptable to, or 
capable of being imposed upon, all participating elements ” 
Obviously, it would not be pragmatic to insist upon policies 
that are not capable of being imposed upon the participating 
elements in our new dominions. 

These proposals are buttressed with a brief sketch of the 
consequences of Western dominion in the past, for example, the 
“Indian success story,” in which “enterprise capital proved a 
useful incentive to fruitful social change in the subcontinent of 
India and its environs,” a development flawed only by the pas¬ 
sivity shown by “traditional Asian social systems” as they imi¬ 
tated “the industrial ideology of their colonial tutor.” An impor¬ 
tant lesson to us is the success of the “neutral Pax Britannica” in 
imposing order, so that “commerce could flourish and its fruits 
compensate for vanished liberties.” 

Adam spares us the observation that the ungrateful natives 
sometimes fail to appreciate these centuries of solicitude. Thus 
to a left-wing member of the Congress party in India: “The story 
is that the British, in the process of their domination over India, 
kept no limits to brutality and savagery which man is capable
