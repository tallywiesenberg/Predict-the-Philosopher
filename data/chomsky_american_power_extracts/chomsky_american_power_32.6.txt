protecting a non-Com- 
munist Vietnamese social structure that cannot defend itself 
and that perhaps does not deserve to be defended.” “Idealism 
and dedication are largely the prerogative of the enemy”; “in 
Vietnam, only the Communists represent revolution and social 
change” and “despite their brutality and deceit, remain the only 
Vietnamese capable of rallying millions of their countrymen to 
sacrifice and hardship in the name of the nation and the only 
group not dependent on foreign bayonets for survival.” On our 
side are the military, and the “mandarins drawn from the mer¬ 
chant and landowning families” who had collaborated with the 
French just as they collaborate with us.53 He points out that 
the existing social system defends privilege and that “many 
young Vietnamese of peasant origin join the Vietcong because 
the Communists ...offer them their best hope of avoiding a life 
on the rung of the ladder where they began—at the bottom.” 
He describes the new construction in Saigon, virtually all “lux¬ 
ury apartments, hotels and office buildings financed by Chinese 
businessmen or affluent Vietnamese with relatives or connec¬ 
tions within the regime .
