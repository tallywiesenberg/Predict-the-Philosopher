ask himself “whether the United States or any nation has the 
right to inflict this suffering and degradation on another people 
for its own ends.” The reason: any other course “might under¬ 
mine our entire position in Southeast Asia.”

contents of this article and the conclusions that Sheehan ex¬ 
presses.But there is a more important point that has received 
very little attention.Sheehan begins his account by saying that 
when he arrived in Vietnam he 

believed in what my country was doing in Vietnam.
