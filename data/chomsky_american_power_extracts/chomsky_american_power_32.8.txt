It is for this reason that one 
cannot be too hopeful about the prospects of reaching liberal 
American opinion in any fundamental way, on the central issues 
of war and peace, freedom, and national self-determination.There are few who challenge the assumption that we have a 
perfect right to determine the legitimate elements in South 
Vietnamese society, or to use force to impose the social and 
political institutions that we, in our wisdom and benevolence, 
have selected for South Vietnam—so long as this attempt is not 
too costly to make it worthwhile.The spectrum of “responsible 55 
opinion extends from those who proclaim openly that we have 
this right to those who formulate our goals in a way that pre¬ 
supposes it.As to the latter, consider the final report to Con¬ 
gress by Defense Secretary McNamara, probably as sane a 
voice as one is likely to hear in Washington these days.We are 
fighting in Vietnam, he says, “to preserve the principle that 
political change must not be brought about by externally di¬ 
rected violence and military force.
