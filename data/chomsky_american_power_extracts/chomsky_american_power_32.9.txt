Rather, it is the principle that the 
United States, and the United States alone, may intervene in 
the internal affairs of other nations to guarantee political sta¬ 
bility and even to restructure their society.Secretary Mc¬ 
Namara is of course aware of the fact that the role of North 
Vietnam in “externally directed violence” has always been, and 
now remains, far slighter than our own; it is the department that 
he headed—the Department of Defense—that has provided most 
of the evidence on this matter.But North Vietnamese inter¬ 
ference has been in support of social change of a sort that we 
define as illegitimate, whereas ours is in support of stability 
(or occasionally, restructuring) that we have determined to be 
quite proper.To be concise, we are fighting in Vietnam in ful¬ 
fillment of our role as international judge and executioner— 
nothing less.Secretary McNamara’s formulation of our goals in Vietnam is 
given in calm and measured tones and is for this reason decep¬ 
tively reassuring.
