With less subtlety, the same presuppositions 
are expressed in the words of a congressman from Texas,

knife.67

The Logic of Withdrawal 


What is important in such statements as this is not the under¬ 
current of racism—though that is bad enough—but rather the 
notion that we are “easy prey” to these yellow dwarves with 
their pocket knives.Obviously, we are “easy prey” to them only 
in their countries, where we have a perfect right to be.Why do we have this right?The answer has been given by 
many statesmen and scholars: It is in our national interest.
