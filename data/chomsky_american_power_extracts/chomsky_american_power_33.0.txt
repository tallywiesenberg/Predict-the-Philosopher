Such a reaction to centuries of selfless and tender care might 
cause some surprise, until we realize that it is probably only an 
expression of the enormous guilt felt by the beneficiary of these 
attentions. 

A generation ago, there were other political leaders who 
feared the effect of Communist gains on their safety and 
progress, and who, with the almost unanimous support of pub¬ 
lic opinion, set out to improve the world through forceful inter-

Adam has little to tell us that is new.

The examples of counterrevolutionary subordination that I 
have so far cited have for the most part been drawn from 
political science and the study of international, particularly 
Asian, affairs—rather dismal branches of American scholarship, 
by and large, and so closely identified with American imperial 
goals that one is hardly astonished to discover the widespread 
abandonment of civilized norms. In opening this discussion, 
however, I referred to a far more general issue. If it is plausible 
that ideology will in general serve as a mask for self-interest, 
then it is a natural presumption that intellectuals, in interpret¬

position, condemning popular movements and mass participa¬ 
tion in decision making, and emphasizing rather the necessity 
for supervision by those who possess the knowledge and under¬ 
standing that is required (so they claim) to manage society and

element in the anarchist critique of Marxism a century ago was 
the prediction that, as Bakunin formulated it:

not destroy [the state] but must strengthen it and place it at the 
complete disposal of their benefactors, guardians, and teachers—
