President Johnson has expressed the matter quite clearly on 
occasion, for example, in the following statement (November 2, 
1966): 

There are three billion people in the world and we have only 200 
million of them.We are outnumbered 15 to one.If might did 
make right they would sw T eep over the United States and take 
what we have.We have what they want.Consequently, “we are going to have to stand and say: 'Might 
doesn't make right' ”—as we are doing in South Vietnam, for 
example.
