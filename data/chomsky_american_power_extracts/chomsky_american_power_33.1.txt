People in the so- 
called “peace movement” have a tendency to regard Lyndon 
Johnson as an illegitimate usurper who does not represent the 
mainstream of American opinion.They are probably deluding 
themselves.Statements such as those just quoted may very well 
reflect prevailing American attitudes, and one who wishes to 
think realistically about the American imperial role would do 
w r ell to bear this in mind—as he should bear in mind the fact 
that this is a country in which a leading liberal commentator, 
after all that has happened in the past three years, can describe 
the American war in Vietnam in these terms: 

[America] is fighting a war now on the principle that military 
power shall not compel South Vietnam to do what it does not 
want to do, that man does not belong to the state.This is the 
deepest conviction of Western Civilization, and rests on the old 
doctrine that the individual belongs not to the state but to his 
Creator, and therefore has “inalienable rights” as a person, which 
no magistrate or political force may violate.60 

As I have just pointed out, we are not the first nation to have 
seen itself as fighting to defend the “deepest convictions of 
Western civilization.” When James Reston, with the access to 
information that he has, can seriously contend that we have been 
fighting to preserve the inalienable rights of the people of Viet¬ 
nam against “military power” or “political force,” we can see 
w T hat a long road lies ahead before there is any hope that this 
country will recover its political sanity.
