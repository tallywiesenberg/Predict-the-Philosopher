The colonialist mentality that colors the American perception 
of the Vietnam war is strikingly evident in the reactions of those 
who are turning against the war as its monstrous character

The Logic of Withdrawal 


becomes too plain to hide.Several months ago, for example, the 
top leaders of the International Voluntary Services resigned— 
some after almost a decade of work in Vietnamese villages— 
“because they believed that our military action was proving 
counterproductive, and threatened to alienate the majority of 
the Vietnamese from their American saviours.” 61 The IVS 
group paints a grim picture of the consequences of our military 
intervention in Vietnam, in terms that are not unfamiliar to 
readers of the American press.Their resignation was intended 
as a protest against policies which, they predict, can only serve 
to drive still more of the population into association with the 
NLF.They assert that our “commitment” in Vietnam has al¬ 
ways been to one element of Vietnamese society, “the urban- 
educated group, which has felt that a noncommunist, inde¬ 
pendent government would best serve their interests and the 
interests of their compatriots in the rural villages of South Viet¬ 
nam.” That we had a right to make such a commitment and to 
act on it is not questioned in their statement.The “tragedy 
unfolding in Vietnam” to which Senator Morton refers is that 
we were unable to realize this commitment, to construct a 
stable government that would represent the interests of the 
Vietnamese, as these interests are interpreted by “the urban- 
educated group.” 

No one would question the sincerity or dedication of the IVS 
leaders, or their undoubted contributions in their work in South 
Vietnam.
