These remarks are perfectly apropos today.I 
quote them to dispel the thought that Vietnam is merely a 
unique aberration, a blunder, merely a result of “the politics of 
inadvertence,” without roots in our history and without signifi¬ 
cance for the future.There is of course a sense in which the liberal critics are correct 
when they refer to the Vietnam war as an “aberration.” In Viet¬ 
nam, we lost control.The Vietnamese refused to play the game 
the way they were expected to when the war was simulated on 
the RAND Corporation computers.They did not realize that 
they were supposed to yield when the pressure reached a certain 
point.
