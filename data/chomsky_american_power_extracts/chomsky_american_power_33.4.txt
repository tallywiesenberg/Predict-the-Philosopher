Therefore, we were forced to escalate beyond any reason¬ 
able level, to a stage where our economy and society can hardly 
bear the cost.In this respect, it is true, Vietnam is an aberration.In all other respects it is a natural consequence of the policy that 
was described three quarters of a century ago by Brooks Adams, 
in prophetic words, when he proclaimed: “Our geographical posi¬ 
tion, our wealth, and our energy pre-eminently fit us to enter 
upon the development of Eastern Asia and to reduce it to part of 
our economic system.” The suppression of the movement for 
Philippine independence, shortly after, was only the first attempt 
to put into practice the policy of reducing Eastern Asia to part 
of our economic system.At that time, we were defending Chris¬ 
tianity from the savage Moros.Now, we are defending the free 
world from the International Communist Conspiracy.
