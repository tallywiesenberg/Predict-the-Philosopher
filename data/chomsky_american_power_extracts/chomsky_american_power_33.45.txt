AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


respects, little has changed, except for the scale of our attack.Again, the example of the Philippine war illustrates the need 
to turn our attention from the problems of Southeast Asia to 
those of the United States—to the ideological commitments on 
which American initiatives are based, and the national self- 
image that permits them to be tolerated with such equanimity; 
in particular, the unshakable belief in American goodwill and 
generosity that persists through each calamity—notably, among 
the self-styled “hardheaded and pragmatic liberals”—and that 
stultifies political thinking and debases political discourse.We 
can, for example, learn a great deal about the sources of Ameri¬ 
can Vietnamese policy by observing how American scholarship 
comes to terms with the suppression of the Philippine struggle 
for independence—in which, incidentally, there were well over 
100,000 Filipino casualties.Thus Louis Halle argues that “we 
could not hand the Philippines back to the Spanish tyranny, 
and they were in no condition to govern themselves or encom¬ 
pass their own defense.If we simply got out and came home we 
would leave chaos behind,” with the Germans and Japanese 
lurking in wait.
