Consider, for example, Richard Goodwin’s essay, cited in 
note 47.Goodwin constructs a powerful argument against the 
war, but concludes nevertheless that the war is ultimately justi¬ 
fied, in part on grounds of American self-interest, in part be¬ 
cause of the necessity for “protecting Asia from dominion or 
conquest by a hostile power.” As to the first, “the bedrock vital 
interest of the United States,” which must serve as the “single 
standard” against which any step in policy making must be 
tested, is “to establish that American military power, once 
committed to defend another nation, cannot be driven from the 
field”—even if, as in the case in question, an American with¬
