Still more interesting, however, is the second argument: that 
we must protect Asia from dominion or conquest by a hostile 
power.I will not dwell on the fact that all reputable authorities 
agree that the Vietnamese are strongly anti-Chinese, 71 so that if 
we were really interested in containing Chinese expansionism, 
we should presumably be supporting Ho Chi Minh, along with 
all popular, indigenous forces on the border of China, whatever 
their domestic character.What seems to me most revealing, 
however, is the reason that Goodwin cites as underlying our 
commitment to protect Asia from outside force.It is “the almost 
idealistic, compelling conviction that the one nation with the 
power to prevent it should not stand aside while nations unwill¬ 
ingly submit to foreign domination.” Thus we must not “un¬ 
dermine the central world purpose of the United States—the 
creation of an international order of independent states.” It 
does not occur to him that by suppressing a victorious insurrec¬ 
tion, we are precisely undermining this “central world purpose” 
and forcing a nation to “submit to foreign domination.” Nor 
does he take note of the fact that we are unable to form a 
puppet government with even the legitimacy of those set up by 
Germany and Japan—we have not, for example, been able to 
find a national figure of the stature of Petain or Wang Ching- 
wei to mask our aggression.This sentimental faith in American 
benevolence, with its various corollaries (“the politics of inad¬ 
vertence,” “the inscrutability of history”), is a major factor that 
stands in the way of the realistic and common-sense proposal 
that Zinn advocates.
