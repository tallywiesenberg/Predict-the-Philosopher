liberals.Goodwin, for example, is too sophisticated to accept 
the Munich analogy, but he goes on to offer a revealing coun¬ 
terthesis.He argues, first of all, that in Vietnam we are combat¬ 
ting not aggression but “internal aggression”—an interesting 
phrase, which refers apparently to “aggression” by a revolution¬ 
ary movement against a government maintained in power by 
foreign arms.And he concludes that what we face is not 
Munich but rather “another episode ... in a long, continuing 
conflict.” Other episodes include our “success” in Greece and 
Turkey, Soviet intervention in Cuba, the invasion of Korea, the 
bombing of Quemoy and Matsu, subversion in the Congo and 
the Central African Republic, fighting in Malaya and the Phil¬ 
ippines and on the Indian border.And now, he adds, “they are 
beginning in Thailand.” 

But with whom are we engaged in this “long, continuing 
conflict”?
