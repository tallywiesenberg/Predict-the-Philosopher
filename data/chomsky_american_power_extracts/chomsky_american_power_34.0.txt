Certainly not the Soviet Union, which had little to do 
with the Sino-Indian border dispute; nor China, which did not 
start the civil war in Greece; nor Ho Chi Minh, who, for all his 
sins, is not responsible for subversion in the Congo.Nor is 
“international Communism” a very convincing devil, in the 
wake of the Sino-Soviet split, gestures of independence in East¬ 
ern Europe and North Korea, the admitted refusal of North 
Vietnam, even in its present desperate straits, to kowtow to its 
powerful allies.In fact, there is no identifiable adversary.We 
are confronted with a mysterious but dangerous force, which 
cannot be located or specified in any concrete terms, but which 
is there, threatening us.While rejecting the Munich analogy, 
Goodwin, the liberal critic, tacitly accepts the assumption on 
which it is based and which gives it great plausibility.
