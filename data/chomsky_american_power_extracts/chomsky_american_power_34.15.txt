It is not easy to decide which of these is the most telling 
example of Chinese aggression; perhaps Burma, in which, ac¬ 
cording to U Thant in 1965, “there has not been a single in¬ 
stance of outside help to the Burmese Communists,” during a 
period when Chinese Nationalist forces roamed northern Burma 
at great cost to the Burmese.It would also be interesting to 
discover what evidence was available to the director of intelli¬ 
gence for the State Department regarding Chinese control, or 
even material assistance, in the cases of Thailand, Malaya, and 
the Philippines—and also to discover why this evidence has 
never been made public.“Chinese aggression” in Indochina, in 
contrast to the responsible and purely defensive posture of the 
Western powers, is of course well documented.As to Laos, 
Hilsman himself repeats much of the well-known story of the 
American attempt to subvert the legitimate government, replac¬ 
ing it by “pro-Western neutralists” and then a right-wing mili¬

Geneva agreements, which, the Vietminh thought, “would give 
them half of Vietnam for sure and an excellent opportunity to 
win the other half through political subversion,” i.e., an elec¬ 
toral victory (p. 103).
