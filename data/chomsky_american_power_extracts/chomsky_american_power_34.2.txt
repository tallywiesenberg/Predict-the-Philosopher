Hilsman also has relevant comments on the Sino-Indian 
border dispute.He observes (p. 322) that “the Indians un¬ 
wisely provided the Chinese ample provocation by adopting a 
forward strategy—establishing isolated outposts behind the 
Chinese outposts that India felt had encroached on what they 
considered their rightful territory—and Prime Minister Nehru, 
in the early fall of 1962, announced publicly that the Indian 
Army had been ordered to clear India’s territory of the Chi¬ 
nese aggressors.” He points out that the unilateral Chinese pull¬ 
back of their victorious armies showed that we face “not only a 
powerful enemy but a politically skillful one” (p. 338).He does 
not, unfortunately, go into the background of the conflict, but 
excellent Western sources exist that thoroughly refute the sim¬ 
plistic view r —advanced, to my knowledge, by not a single 
Western scholar—that the border dispute was merely, or even 
primarily, a matter of “Chinese aggression.” The issue of Tibet 
we need not discuss, since whatever the facts may be—and if 
Western scholarship is to be trusted, they are not simply what is 
claimed by American propaganda—Tibet is internationally 
recognized as a region of China; one might with equal logic 
accuse the United States of aggression in Watts, or in the Mis¬ 
sissippi Delta, where, reports indicate, thousands are starving 
while Washington plays politics.Elsewhere, Hilsman demonstrates Chinese aggressiveness on 
the basis of the principle of post hoc ergo propter hoc:

The Logic of Withdrawal 


It was in November 1957, following the Soviet Sputnik success, 
that Mao proclaimed that the “East Wind prevails over the West 
Wind” and so heralded the shift from the “Bandung” policy of 
peaceful coexistence back to a hard line.In South Vietnam inci¬ 
dents of guerrilla terrorism and assassination began to mount.
