The same claim is made in connection with his discussion of the 
difficulties faced by the “pro-Western neutralist” Phoui Sanani- 
kone, who came to power through American intrigue in 
Laos: 

Phoui and his policy also had the misfortune to come to the 
test just when Communist policy was changing away from the 
“peaceful coexistence” of the Bandung spirit to the hard line 
enunciated by Mao Tse-tung in his “East Wind Over West Wind” 
speech in Moscow in November 1957.It was during the next year 
that Hanoi, following this new hard line, reached the decision to 
begin the guerrilla war against the South.[P. 119] 

The suggestion that it was the Chinese hard line that was re¬ 
sponsible for the failure of the American policy of subversion in 
Laos is a most interesting one.According to the American re¬ 
porter Arthur Dommen, who appears to be Hilsman’s primary 
source of information on Laos, the Chinese took no action at all 
in Laos until the end of 1959, despite American violations of the 
Geneva agreements by the supplying of arms and military train¬ 
ing by American officers in civilian clothes ; 74 and after that 
their “interference” consisted of offering support for the neutral¬ 
ist Souvanna Phouma government that the United States was 
trying desperately to replace, first by the “pro-Western neutral¬ 
ist” Phoui and then by the outright fascist Phoumi Nosavan.
