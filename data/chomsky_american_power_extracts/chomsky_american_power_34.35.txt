Yet 
it represents the best and most sophisticated thinking that is to 
be found near the center of power, so the available information 
indicates.One cannot escape a feeling of alarm on reading 
Hilsman’s study of how policy was set in the Kennedy admin¬ 
istration.In discussing Chinese aggressiveness, we must bear in mind 
that there is a clear sense in which China has already shown 
itself to be very aggressive, namely, the following: 

We must recognize that an overt act of war has been committed 
by an enemy when that enemy builds a military force intended 
for our eventual destruction, and that the destruction of that 
force before it can be launched or employed is defensive action 
and not aggression.As a nation we must understand that an overt 
act of war has been committed long before the delivery of that 
first blow.76 

One wonders how long it will be before the American Air Force 
undertakes defensive action against such overt acts of war on 
the part of the Chinese.
