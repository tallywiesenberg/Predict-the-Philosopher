Pharisaic editorial writers like Joseph Alsop and 
others periodically announce with contemptible pleasure Chinese 
famines which exist, fortunately, only in their imaginations; but 
their editorials are often read in countries with pro-American 
governments where famine actually rages.Sooner or later truth 
will out, and it is then doubly unfavorable to the Americans, first 
because it is disgusting to see the world’s most overfed country 
rejoicing that others—even if they are Communist—are suffering 
from hunger, and secondly because one discovers that it is not in 
China but in their own camp—in Central or South America, for 
example—that people are dying of malnutrition ...today a 
Kwangtung peasant eats much better than a peasant in Kerala in 
India—and this is known in Asia.
