Our allies and our bases in Taiwan, 
Camranh Bay, Thailand, also have the right to demand 
the same kind of security which each of them now helps furnish 
to Alaska and Hawaii.And so on, indefinitely.Of course, we 
have heard all of this before.Japan once needed Manchuria for 
survival—without Manchuria, it was a “potted plant,” without 
roots.And to secure Manchuria it was obviously necessary to 
ensure that North China was “friendly,” and then all of China, 
and Southeast Asia, and on to the Pacific war.
