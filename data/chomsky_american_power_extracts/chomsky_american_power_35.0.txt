ertheless, the limited information that we have about popular 
movements in Asia, specifically, suggests certain similar features 
that deserve much more serious and sympathetic study than 
they have so far received. 56 Inadequate information makes it 
hazardous to try to develop any such parallel, but I think it is 
quite possible to note long-standing tendencies in the response 
of liberal as well as Communist intellectuals to such mass move¬ 
ments. 

As I have already remarked, the Spanish Civil War is not 
only one of the critical events of modern history but one of the 
most intensively studied as well. Yet there are surprising gaps. 
During the months following the Franco insurrection in July 
1936, a social revolution of unprecedented scope took place 
throughout much of Spain. It had no “revolutionary vanguard” 
and appears to have been largely spontaneous, involving masses 
of urban and rural laborers in a radical transformation of social 
and economic conditions that persisted, with remarkable suc¬ 
cess, until it was crushed by force. This predominantly anar¬ 
chist revolution and the massive social transformation to which it 
gave rise are treated, in recent historical studies, as a kind of 
aberration, a nuisance that stood in the way of successful prose¬ 
cution of the war to save the bourgeois regime from the Franco 
rebellion. Many historians would probably agree with Eric 
Hobsbawm 57 that the failure of social revolution in Spain “was 
due to the anarchists,” that anarchism was “a disaster,” a kind of

“moral gymnastics” with no “concrete results,” at best “a pro¬ 
foundly moving spectacle for the student of popular religion.” 
The most extensive historical study of the anarchist revolu¬ 
tion 58 is relatively inaccessible, and neither its author, now liv¬ 
ing in southern France, nor the many refugees who will never 
write memoirs but who might provide invaluable personal tes¬ 
timony have been consulted, apparently, by writers of the 
major historical works. 59 The one published collection of doc¬ 
uments dealing with collectivization 60 has been published only 
by an anarchist press and hence is barely accessible to the 
general reader, and has also rarely been consulted—it does not, 
for example, appear in Jackson’s bibliography, though Jackson’s 
account is intended to be a social and political, not merely a 
military, history. In fact, this astonishing social upheaval seems 
to have largely passed from memory. The drama and pathos of
