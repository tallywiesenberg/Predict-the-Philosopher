He quotes a captured 
prisoner who says, “We will all die, but we will not surrender”; 
and he concludes that “Vietnam will be destroyed.” Spokesmen 
for the NLF and North Vietnam, however, have long argued 
that they can win on the battlefield.In the past their estimates 
have been realistic.It may be that the Tet offensive—which 
brought home to the American public that the official version of 
the Vietnamese story was an illusion or a lie—may also have 
persuaded American policy planners that there are no military 
options remaining, short of drastically changing the nature of 
the war and taking a long step towards World War III.If so, 
this raises the prospects for peace, that is, for withdrawal of the 
American troops.Withdrawal may be called a “negotiated set¬ 
tlement” ; it may be called “victory.” What is important is not 
the words but the substance: the return of Vietnam to the 
Vietnamese.
