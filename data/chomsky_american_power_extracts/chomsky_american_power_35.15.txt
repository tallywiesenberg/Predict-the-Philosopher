It is conceivable, though unlikely, that the Vietnamese resist¬ 
ance will settle for less.One lesson that has been taught them in 
the past twenty years is that the only victories that last are 
military ones.The great powers cannot be trusted.They will 
resort to treachery and subversion to undermine any diplomatic 
settlement.It seems unlikely that the NLF will lay down their 
arms so long as they are able to maintain control of substantial 
parts of South Vietnam, or that they will accept token representa¬ 
tion in a coalition, just as it is unlikely that the French resistance 
twenty-five years ago would have terminated its struggle had it 
been offered the ministry of health in the Vichy government.
