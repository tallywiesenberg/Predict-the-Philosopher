It is a devastating indictment of 
the state of American democracy that only a major military 
defeat was able to bring about these changes in the political 
climate.If the past is any guide, only continuing military set¬ 
backs in Vietnam and the threat of serious dislocation at home 
will succeed in moving the government towards concrete steps 
that might lead to peace.For the first time, there seems a real 
hope that the war will end without extermination of the Viet¬ 
namese.Nevertheless, those who have devoted themselves to 
working for peace in Vietnam can only be saddened by the 
realization that they have failed to create the consciousness in 
this country that we have no right to win a military victory.It is 
the miraculous heroism of the Vietnamese resistance that has 
forced these tentative moves towards peace in Vietnam.
