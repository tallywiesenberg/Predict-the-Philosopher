To say 
this is not to make a political judgment with regard to the 
various forces in Vietnamese society, but only to recognize the 
bare and inescapable facts.For the so-called “peace move¬ 
ment,” the recent events pose a major challenge.The “peace 
movement” has been getting by for too long with cheap jokes 
about LBJ and with concentration on peripheral issues such as 
the bombing of North Vietnam.The challenge it now faces is to 
create the understanding that we have no right to set any con¬ 
ditions at all on a political settlement in Vietnam; that Ameri¬ 
can military force must be withdrawn from Vietnam, and from 
the other simmering Vietnams throughout the world; that 
American power and resources and technical skills must be used 
to build and not to repress or to “contain” or to destroy.275
