from anarchist sources: in Aragon, 450 collectives with half a 
million members; in the Levant, 900 collectives accounting for 
about half the agricultural production and 70 percent of mar¬ 
keting in this, the richest agricultural region of Spain; in Castile, 
300 collectives with about 100,000 members. 62 In Catalonia, 
the bourgeois government headed by Companys retained 
nominal authority, but real power was in the hands of the 
anarchist-dominated committees. 

The period of July through September may be characterized

as one of spontaneous, widespread, but unconsummated social 
revolution. 63 A number of anarchist leaders joined the govern¬ 
ment ; the reason, as stated by Federica Montseny on January 3, 
1937, was this: . . the anarchists have entered the government 
to prevent the Revolution from deviating and in order to carry 
it further beyond the war, and also to oppose any dictatorial 
tendency, from wherever it might come.’ 764 The central gov¬

lonia, under the control of the Communist-dominated PSUC— 
largely as a result of the valuable Russian military assistance. 
Communist success was greatest in the rich farming areas of the 
Levant (the government moved to Valencia, capital of one of 
the provinces), where prosperous farm owners flocked to the 
Peasant Federation that the party had organized to protect the 
wealthy farmers; this federation “served as a powerful instru¬ 
ment in checking the rural collectivization promoted by the 
agricultural workers of the province.” 65 Elsewhere as well, 
counterrevolutionary successes reflected increasing Communist 
dominance of the Republic. 

The first phase of the counterrevolution was the legalization 
and regulation of those accomplishments of the revolution that 
appeared irreversible. A decree of October 7 by the Commu¬ 
nist Minister of Agriculture, Vicente Uribe, legalized certain 
expropriations—namely, of lands belonging to participants in 
the Franco revolt. Of course, these expropriations had already 
taken place, a fact that did not prevent the Communist press 
from describing the decree as “the most profoundly revolution¬ 
ary measure that has been taken since the military uprising.” 66 
In fact, by exempting the estates of landowners who had not 
directly participated in the Franco rebellion, the decree repre¬
