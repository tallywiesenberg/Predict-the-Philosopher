the Socialist Federation of Land Workers, affiliated with the 
UGT. The demand for a much broader decree was unaccepta¬ 
ble to the Communist-led ministry, since the Communist party 
was “seeking support among the propertied classes in the anti- 
Franco coup” and hence “could not afford to repel the small 
and medium proprietors who had been hostile to the working 
class movement before the civil war.” 67 These “small proprie¬ 
tors,” in fact, seem to have included owners of substantial 
estates. The decree compelled tenants to continue paying rent 
unless the landowners had supported Franco, and by guaran¬ 
teeing former landholdings, it prevented distribution of land to 
the village poor. Ricardo Zabalza, general secretary of the Fed¬ 
eration of Land Workers, described the resulting situation as 
one of “galling injustice”; “the sycophants of the former political 
bosses still enjoy a privileged position at the expense of those 
persons who were unable to rent even the smallest parcel of 
land, because they were revolutionaries.” 63 

To complete the stage of legalization and restriction of what 
had already been achieved, a decree of October 24, 1936, 
promulgated by a CNT member who had become Councilor for 
Economy in the Catalonian Generalitat, gave legal sanction to 
the collectivization of industry in Catalonia. In this case too, the 
step was regressive, from the revolutionary point of view. Col¬ 
lectivization was limited to enterprises employing more than a 
hundred workers, and a variety of conditions were established 
that removed control from the workers’ committees to the state 
bureaucracy. 69 

The second stage of the counterrevolution, from October 
1936 through May 1937, involved the destruction of the local 
committees, the replacement of the militia by a conventional 
army, and the re-establishment of the prerevolutionary social 
and economic system, wherever this was possible. Finally, in
