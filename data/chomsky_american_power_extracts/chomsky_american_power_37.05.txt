He points out that American troops are “regaining a spirit 
that was characteristic of U.S. troops in the winning of a continent 
from the turbulent Indian tribes,” as they fight a war where “an 
American can’t tell the VC from the ‘friendlies,’ ” where “the smiling 
face of the farmer on his water buffalo beyond the airstrip fence could 
be a VC who plans to throw T a grenade at you or your airplane,” where 
the Tri Quang Buddhists have “become an instrument in the hands of 
the enemies of the people of South Viet Nam,” where “the agitation 
over gas is another reminder that protecting a people against commu¬ 
nist aggression usually is a thankless job,” etc., etc.43.Richard A. Falk et al.f Vietnam and International Law (Flanders,
