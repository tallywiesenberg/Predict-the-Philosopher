“United States Policy and Vietnamese Political Viability,” 1954— 
1967, Asian Survey , Vol.7 (August 1967), pp.507-14.He adds the 
obscure remark that if this independent South Vietnam were viable, 
strong, popular, enlightened, and effective, “then the foreign and dip¬ 
lomatic repercussions of two Vietnams de facto would be easier to 
handle, particularly for regulating the relations between North and 
South Vietnam in future consultations and elections which we in 
Washington envisaged coming at some time, perhaps in 1956 or possi¬ 
bly a little later.” But the Geneva agreements that we were pledged to 
uphold say nothing about “two Vietnams de facto” nor about an 
“independent South Vietnam” as “a strong, viable state.” Obviously, it 
is absurd to speak of a viable, independent state bounded by a provi¬ 
sional demarcation line which “should not in any way be interpreted 
as constituting a political or territorial boundary.” It is interesting, 
incidentally, that Mr. Young can summarize the American effort to 
“promote political viability” in Vietnam from 1954 to 1967 with not a 
mention of what happened to those elections that were “envisaged 
coming ... in 1956 or possibly a little later.” 

Richard Falk has commented on the hypocrisy of the accusation 
that North Vietnam challenged world order by its “indirect aggres-

Saigon’s establishment, rather than the subsequent attempt at its re¬ 
moval, of a political frontier at the seventeenth parallel represented 
the coercive challenge to world order,” since the “political settlement 
at Geneva in 1954 provided a formula for the nullification (rather 
than one for the maintenance) of the division” (“International Law and 
the United States Role in Vietnam,” Yale Law Journal, Vol.76 [May 
1967], p. 1118).
