Similarly, the United States effort to build up the 
military strength of the Saigon regime, which enabled it to crush 
domestic opposition and institute the “grim dictatorship” that support¬ 
ers of the American effort were later to deplore, was a clear violation 
of our pledge at Geneva not to use force or threat of force to disturb 
the accords.Secretary Dulles was as candid as Kenneth Young about 
our intention to disregard the Geneva agreements, announcing our 
intention to build up “the truly independent states of Cambodia, Laos 
and southern Vietnam” ( Department of State Bulletin, August 2, 
1954, cited in George M. Kahin and John W. Lewis, The United 
States and Vietnam [New York, The Dial Press, 1967], p. 61).It is, incidentally, remarkable that our professed dissatisfaction with 
the accords and announced intention not to observe them is often 
cited today as somehow relieving us from the obligation to honor 
them, as eliminating any onus for this violation.45.Cited in R. Scigliano, op.
