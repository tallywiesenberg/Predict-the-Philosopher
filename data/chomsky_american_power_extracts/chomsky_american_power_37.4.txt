There are many other such reports.To mention a 
recent one, Louis Heren writes in the London Times, April 20, 1968, 
from Washington, that the CIA â€œdid in fact deploy saboteurs in the 
North from 1959.They were parachuted in or dropped off the coast 
by patrol boats, and Vice-President Ky commanded the air transport 
wing of the South Vietnam Air Force in 1962 and 1963.He is known 
to have been in charge of the parachute drops.The agents were South 
Vietnamese and were trained by the C.I.A.
