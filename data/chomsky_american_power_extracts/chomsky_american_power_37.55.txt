Polls taken for CBS in November 
1966 and February 1967 indicate that even “among strong anti-Com- 
munist South Vietnamese ...exposed primarily to government propa¬ 
ganda there still appears to be a rejection of the American idea that 
the war is a consequence of ‘aggression from the North’ ” (Richard 
Falk, “International Law and the United States Role in Vietnam,” p. 
1102 n.).The results are reported in the Times , March 22, 1967.
