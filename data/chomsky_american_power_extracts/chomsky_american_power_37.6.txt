Even in this biased sample of South Vietnamese opinion, 83% were in 
favor of (and 5% opposed to) reunification with the North after the

often been emphasized, even by those committed to the American 
effort in Vietnam, that “it would be a serious mistake to consider 
Communist power in South Vietnam as based predominantly on ter¬

outside of the State Department, that “the historical fact is that force 
in the struggle for the South was first used by the Diem regime, not by 
the Communists,” that the latter was, moreover, far more restrained, 
that although “guidance and assistance from the North” may have 
been an important factor in the “amazing success” of the NLF, “it 
would have made little headway without wide popular support,” and 
that “the war started as a civil war in the South,” well before the 
alleged infiltration began (Joseph Buttinger, Vietnam: A Dragon Em¬
