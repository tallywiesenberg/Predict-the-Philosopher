Saville Davis, Christian Science Monitor, October 21, 1967.52.“Not a Dove, But No Longer a Hawk,” New York Times Maga¬ 
zine, October 9, 1966.53.As to the military, Jonathan Randal points out in the New York 
Times, June 11, 1967, that “only one officer above the rank of lieuten¬ 
ant colonel did not serve in the French army against the Vietminh in 
the French Indochina war.” Perhaps this is part of the reason why the 
ARVN army has little interest in the war, while “the Vietcong can 
take the same unwilling recruit and turn him into a tiger in six 
months” (American regimental adviser), as it may go part way to¬ 
wards explaining the desertion rates that Randal cites for the elite 
battalions in 1966: 22% for the armed forces as a whole, 31% for the 
rangers, 33% for the marines, and 45% for the airborne battalions.
