55.Kahin, op.cit.(see note 8), reports that the medical staff of Hue 
hospital estimated that “almost 90% of the w r ar casualties were occa¬ 
sioned by American and South Vietnamese army air bombardments 
and artillery,” and that an American working at Quangnai hospital 
“estimated that about 70% of all civilian war casualties had been 
inflicted by American, South Korean and South Vietnamese aerial 
bombardment and artillery.” Note that these estimates refer to areas 
more or less under American control, w r here victims can hope to reach 
the hospitals.What is amazing is that any substantial number of casu¬ 
alties in such areas are caused by American and allied forces.
