Jackson presumes (p. 259) that Soviet support for the Repub¬ 
lican cause in Spain was guided by two factors: first, concern 
for Soviet security; second, the hope that a Republican victory 
would advance “the cause of worldwide people’s revolution’ 
with which Soviet leaders hoped to identify themselves.” They 
did not press their revolutionary aims, he feels, because “for the 
moment it was essential not to frighten the middle classes or the 
Western governments.” 

As to the concern for Soviet security, Jackson is no doubt 
correct. It is clear that Soviet support of the Republic was one 
aspect of the attempt to make common cause with the Western 
democracies against the fascist threat. However, Jackson’s con¬ 
ception of the Soviet Union as a revolutionary power—hopeful 
that a Republican victory would advance “the interrupted 
movement toward world revolution” and seeking to identify it¬ 
self with “the cause of the world-wide ‘people’s revolution’ ” 
—seems to me entirely mistaken. Jackson presents no evidence 
to support this interpretation of Soviet policy, nor do I know of 
any. It is interesting to see how differently the events were 
interpreted at the time of the Spanish Civil War, not only by 
anarchists like Rocker but also by such commentators as Gerald 
Brenan and Franz Borkenau, who were intimately acquainted 
with the situation in Spain. Brenan observes that the counter¬ 
revolutionary policy of the Communists (which he thinks was 
“extremely sensible”) was

the policy most suited to the Communists themselves. Russia is a 
totalitarian regime ruled by a bureaucracy: the frame of mind of 
its leaders, who have come through the most terrible upheaval in 
history, is cynical and opportunist: the whole fabric of the state 
is dogmatic and authoritarian. To expect such men to lead a 
social revolution in a country like Spain, where the wildest ideal¬ 
ism is combined with great independence of character, was out of 
the question. The Russians could, it is true, command plenty of 
idealism among their foreign admirers, but they could only 
harness it to the creation of a cast-iron bureaucratic state, where 
everyone thinks alike and obeys the orders of the chief above 
him . 74
