In fact, there is some evidence of popular resent¬ 
ment to the expanding use of napalm, a development which is not sur¬ 
prising if one has observed a hospital ward full of bleeding women and 
children seared from head to toe.” While Mr. Ross and Senator Proxmire 
may await the evidence, others will draw their own conclusions, even be¬ 
fore the inevitable study by the RAND Corporation.56.Excerpts from his secret testimony appear in the New York 
Times, February 2, 1968.The Vietcong will be happy to learn, from 
his testimony, that we do not “seek the surrender of Vietcong forces; 
we would be content to see them lay down their arms and take their 
place as peaceful citizens of South Vietnam, or move to the North if 
they so desire.” Presumably, the distinction between “surrendering” 
and “laying down one’s arms” is explained in the censored part of the 
testimony.The remark recalls that of another leading dove, Arthur Goldberg, 
who announced our position before the United Nations, in what was 
widely described as a “conciliatory” statement, as being: “No military 
forces, armed personnel or bases [are] to be maintained in North or 
South Vietnam except those under the control of the respective gov¬ 
ernments” (New York Times, September 22, 1967).
