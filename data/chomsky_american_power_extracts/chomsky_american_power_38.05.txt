The Vietcong, in 
other words, need not surrender; we ask only that it go out of existÂ¬ 
ence as a military force.And when the government we have instituted 
establishes total military control, we will have no further interest in 
retaining our army in Vietnam.The German High Command could 
have outlined its goals in France in just the same terms.57.Lyndon B. Johnson, Congressional Record , March 15, 1948, House,
