Compare Thomas Mann, who 
left Germany in 1933 because he could not, as “a German writer, 
made responsible through his habitual use of language, remain silent, 
quite silent, in the face of all the irreparable evil which has been 
committed daily, and is being committed in my country, against body, 
soul and spirit, against justice and truth, against men and man” 
(quoted in George Steiner, Language and Silence [New York, Atheneum 
Publishers, 1967], p. 102).60.James Reston, New York Times, November 24, 1967.Reston 
does not question that it is “in defending this doctrine” that men are 
dying in Vietnam, that this “principle” is in fact what motivates Wash¬ 
ington; but he admits that in the “profound spiritual bewilderment” 
caused by the immense destruction, it is becoming difficult “to believe 
in the cause.” A few days earlier (November 15), he had mused on 
one of the great “mysteries and tragedies in Vietnam,” “the Hanoi 
Government’s continuing refusal to talk about a negotiated settle¬ 
ment.” The reason for this “continuing refusal” (which will come as a 
surprise to those who have been reading the news columns of the 
Times for the past three years) is, he feels, that “Ho Chi Minh and his 
associates simply cannot believe that the U.S. would make such sacri¬ 
fices of men and treasure simply to defend the principle of opposing 
military aggression—and then withdraw when the principle is sus¬ 
tained”; Reston is convinced that “President Johnson is perfectly sin¬ 
cere” in “his offers to make peace and withdraw.”

Record, December 13, 1967, S18499.
