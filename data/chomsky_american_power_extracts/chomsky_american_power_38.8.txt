16, pp.160-S0.Honey cites as one of the “main requirements of 
North Vietnamese foreign policy,” “to resist Chinese attempts to 
dominate Vietnam.” Similarly, in his Communism in North Vietnam 
(Cambridge, Mass., The M.I.T.Press, 1963), he points out that Pham 
Van Dong, second in command in North Vietnam, is “no political 
extremist but rather a cautious moderate” who “has stated that he 
believes Asia’s problems can be solved only through cooperation with 
the white races,” and that Vo Nguyen Giap is violently anti-Chinese— 
it is for this reason, he goes on to say, that he remains in control of 
the army.In fact, Honey concludes, “there are excellent grounds for 
the belief that the principal raison d’etre of such a powerful army in 
North Vietnam today is to protect North Vietnam against possible 
Chinese aggression.” Similar views are expressed by just about every¬ 
one who has considered the matter.
