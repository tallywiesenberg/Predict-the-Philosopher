It is particularly interesting that 
they are shared by Honey, whose militant anti-Communism reaches 
outlandish levels and frequently leads him to pure fabrication—e.g., 
his contention that the North Vietnamese refused to agree to negotia¬ 
tions at the beginning of 1965 ( Public Policy, Vol.16, p. 180)—and 
to amazing allegations, for example, that some significant portion of the 
antiwar activity in Britain and the United States is initiated by the Com¬ 
munist parties and financed by Hanoi—including, as a special reward to 
loyal supporters, free trips to North Vietnam {ibid., p. 168).One won¬ 
ders whether his analyses of North Vietnam, which are apparently taken 
seriously by policy planners, show as much of a sense of reality as his 
perception of events in Britain and the United States.72.It is worth recalling that the Soviet Union has much better rea¬ 
sons than we do for taking seriously the lesson of Munich.
