cit., pp.343 f.).In the same volume, 
David Hotham, correspondent for the London Times and the Econ¬ 
omist in Vietnam from 1955 to 1957, describes the “pacification” 
methods of the South Vietnamese army: “They consist of killing, or 
arresting without either evidence or trial, large numbers of persons 
suspected of being Vietminh or ‘rebels’” (p. 359).Possibly these 
events had as much to do with the renewal of insurgency as Mao’s 
musings about the East and the West Wind.As to the shift from “peaceful coexistence,” it is interesting to note 
that the Third Party Congress of the Lao Dong party of North Viet¬ 
nam, in September 1960, announced a major defense cutback to finance 
economic development.
