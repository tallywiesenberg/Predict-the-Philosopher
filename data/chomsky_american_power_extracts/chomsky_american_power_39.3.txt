78.The fact that this is known in Asia is apparently what frightens 
American planners like Walt Rostow, who points out that a primary 
threat posed by China is “the possibility that the Chinese Communists 
can prove to Asians by progress in China that Communist methods are 
better and faster than democratic methods”—such as the democratic 
methods of South Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea, for example 
(Walt W. Rostow and R. W. Hatch, An American Policy in Asia 
[New York, Technology Press and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1955], p. 
6).The reality of this “threat” is clear from the mixed reactions to 
China’s development in the Asian countries, a combination of fear and 
admiration.Frederick Clairmonte maintains: “Starting the industriali¬ 
zation race with lower production levels than India, with a ruptured 
administration frame and a larger population than India’s and consid¬ 
erably less foreign aid at its disposal, the dramatic successes that 
catapulted China into the slipstream of growth signalized the pivotal 
importance of the agrarian revolution” ( Economic Liberalism and 
Underdevelopment [Bombay and London, Asia Publishing House, 
1960], p. 309).He cites reports from China by Indian delegations in 
the mid-1950s which attribute Chinese success in collectivization 
(which “appeared no less than a miracle”) to “a ferment in people’s 
minds,” not fear, and he himself concludes that the real success of the 
Chinese is the construction of a mass base of support, with rural 
activists from the peasants’ associations—a development lacking in 
India.
