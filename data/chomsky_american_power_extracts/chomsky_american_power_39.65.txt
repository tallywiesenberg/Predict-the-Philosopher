Marc Riboud reports in Le Monde, April 13, 1968, that in the ten 
days he spent in Hue in early April he saw two journalists—both 
Japanese—from an international press corps of 495.He cites as offi¬ 
cial statistics: 4,100 civilians killed, 4,500 severely wounded, 18,000 
of the city’s 20,000 houses damaged or destroyed, the majority de¬ 
stroyed.Riboud attempted to see one of the “mass graves” of victims 
of the North Vietnamese troops that have been reported by the Amer¬ 
ican Mission, but without success.According to the information he 
could gather, ARVN behavior compared quite unfavorably with that 
of the North Vietnamese and Vietcong, though the deepest bitterness 
and resentment is directed against the Americans, whose “blind and 
systematic bombardment” have turned Hue into “an assassinated 
city.”
