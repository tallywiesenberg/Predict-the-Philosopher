AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


insurrection at an “acceptable” cost, to ourselves or to Vietnam.It is of more than historical interest to understand this critique, 
to determine the assumptions that underlie it, to appreciate the 
attitude towards the American role in international affairs that 
it reveals.It has always been possible that the Vietnamese affair 
might end in a global war or in an attempt by our former allies 
to construct a counterweight to American power.If the conse¬ 
quences are, on the other hand, something approaching the 
effective extermination of the Vietnamese (with no interna¬ 
tional repercussions) or a return of Vietnam to its own popula¬ 
tion with the withdrawal of the American army of occupation, 
then it is likely that we will revert to policies that fall within the 
responsible mainstream of thought and ideology, and that are 
illuminated by the kind of critique of the aberration of Vietnam 
—where the situation escaped our control—represented by 
Schlesinger’s analysis.The essential feature of Schlesinger’s critique of the American 
escalation in Vietnam is that it has a purely tactical basis.
