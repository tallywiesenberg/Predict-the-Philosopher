Nor do they explain why the morale of the military 
dictatorships of Thailand and Taiwan must be preserved.They 
merely hint darkly of the dangers of a third world war, dangers 
which are real enough and which are increased when advocates 
of revolutionary change face an external counterrevolutionary 
force.In principle, such dangers can be lessened by damping 
revolutionary ardor or by withdrawing the counterrevolutionary 
force.The latter alternative, however, is unthinkable, irrespon¬ 
sible.The crucial assumption in the program of the moderate 
scholars is that we must not encourage “those elements com¬ 
mitted to the thesis that violence is the best means of effecting 
change.” It is important to recognize that it is not violence as 
such to which the moderate scholars object.
