they approve of our violence in Vietnam, which, as they are 
well aware, enormously exceeds that of the Vietnamese enemy.To further underline this point, they cite as our greatest tri¬ 
umph in Southeast Asia the “dramatic changes” which have 
taken place in Indonesia—the most dramatic being the mas¬ 
sacre of several hundred thousand people.But this massacre, 
like our extermination of Vietnamese, is not a use of violence to 
effect social change and is therefore legitimate.What is more, it 
may be that those massacred were largely ethnic Chinese and 
landless peasants, and that the “countercoup” in effect re-estab¬ 
lished traditional authority more firmly.19 If so, all the more 
reason why we should not deplore this use of violence; and in 
fact, the moderate scholars delicately refrain from alluding to it 
in their discussion of dramatic changes in Indonesia.
