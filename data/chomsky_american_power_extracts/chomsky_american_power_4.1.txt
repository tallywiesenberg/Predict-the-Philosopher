We must 
conclude that when these scholars deplore the use of violence to 
effect change, it is not the violence but rather steps toward social 
change that they find truly disturbing.Social change that de¬ 
parts from the course we plot is not to be tolerated.The threat 
to order is too great.So great is the importance of stability and order that even 
reform of the sort that receives American authorization must 
often be delayed, the moderate scholars emphasize.“Indeed, 
many types of reform increase instability, however desirable 
and essential they may be in long-range terms.
