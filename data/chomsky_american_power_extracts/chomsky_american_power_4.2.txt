This is what “we have learned in the past thirty years of inten¬ 
sive empirical study of contemporary societies.55 Pool is merely 
describing facts, not proposing policy.A corresponding version 
of the facts is familiar on the domestic scene: workers threaten 
the public order by striking for their demands, the impatience 
of the Negro community threatens the stability of the body 
politic.One can, of course, imagine another way in which order 
can be preserved in all such cases: namely, by meeting the 
demands, or at the very least by removing the barriers that 
have been placed, by force which may be latent and disguised, 
in the way of attempts to satisfy the “newly acquired aspira¬ 
tions.55 But this might mean that the wealthy and powerful 
would have to sacrifice some degree of privilege, and it is there¬ 
fore excluded as a method for maintenance of order.
