For one thing, “as in China, the insurgents in Vietnam 
have exploited the Confucian tenets of ethical rule both by their 
attacks on government corruption and by exemplary Com¬ 
munist behavior”; and “the Viet-Cong inherited, after Geneva, 
much of the popular support and sympathies previously at¬ 
tached to the Viet-Minh in the South.” After the fall of Diem, 
matters became still worse: “...vast regions that had been 
under government control quickly came under the influence of 
the Viet-Cong.” By late 1964 the pacification of Quang Nam 
Province had become “all but impossible,” and the worst of it is 
that “the battle for Quang Nam was lost by the government to 
Viet-Cong forces recruited for the most part from within the 
province.” 22 By 1966, the Vietcong seem so well entrenched in 
rural areas that “only a highly imaginative and comprehensive 
counterinsurgency campaign, with nearly perfect execution and 
substantial military support, would be capable of dislodging

such a powerful and extensive insurgent apparatus.” 

A major difficulty we face is the “progressive social and 
economic results” shown by the Vietcong efforts.An AID report 
in March 1965 explains the problem.
