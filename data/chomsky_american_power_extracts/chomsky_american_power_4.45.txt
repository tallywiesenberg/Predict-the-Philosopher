Comparing “our ‘new life 
hamlets’ ” to the Vietcong hamlets, the report comments as fol¬ 
lows: 

The basic differences are that the VC hamlets are well organized, 
clean, economically self supporting and have an active defense 
system.For example, a cottage industry in one hamlet was as 
large as has been previously witnessed anywhere in Chuong Thien 
province.New canals are being dug and pineapples are under 
cultivation.The VC also have a relocation program for younger 
families.These areas coincide with the areas just outside the planned 
GVN sphere of interest.
