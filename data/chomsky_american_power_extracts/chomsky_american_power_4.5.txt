Unless the USOM/GVN activities exhibit a 
more qualitative basis [sic], there is little likelihood of changing the 
present attitudes of the people.For example, in one area only five 
kilometers from the province capital, the people refused medical 
assistance offered by ARVN medics.However, all is not lost.Even though “the Viet-Cong strength 
in the countryside has made a ‘quantum leap’ from its position 
of early 1962,” there is a compensating factor, namely, “the 
counterinsurgent military capability was revolutionized by sub¬ 
stantial American troop inputs.” This allows us entirely new 
options.For example, we can implement more effectively some 
of the “experiments with population and resources control 
methods” that were tried by the USOM and the National Police 
as early as 1961, though with little success.
