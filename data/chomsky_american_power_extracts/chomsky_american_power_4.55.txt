Given the new possi¬ 
bilities for “material and human resources control,” we may 
even recapture some of the population—a serious matter: 
“Given the enormous numbers of South Vietnamese citizens 
presently allied with the Viet-Cong (for whatever reason), the 
recovery of these peasants for the national cause must be made 
one of the central tasks of the pacification enterprise.”

- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

If we are going to succeed in implementing “material and 
human resources control,” we must moderate ARVN behavior 
somehow.Thus, according to an AID report of February 1965, 
“A high incident rate of stealing, robbing, raping and obtain¬ 
ing free meals in the rural areas has not endeared the popula¬ 
tion towards ARVN or Regional Forces.” Nor did it improve 
matters when many civilians witnessed a case in which an 
ARVN company leader killed a draft dodger, disemboweled him, 
“took his heart and liver out and had them cooked at a restau¬ 
rant,” after which “the heart and liver were eaten by a number 
of soldiers.” Such acts cause great difficulties, especially in try¬ 
ing to combat an enemy so vile as to practice “exemplary 
Communist behavior.” 

More generally, “the success of pacification requires that 
there be survivors to be pacified,” and given “the sheer magni¬ 
tude of American, Korean, Australian and indigenous Viet¬ 
namese forces,” which has so severely “strained the economic and 
social equilibrium of the nation,” it is sometimes difficult to 
ensure this minimal condition.There are other problems, for example, “the difficulty of 
denying food to the enemy” in the Mekong Delta; “the hunger 
for land ownership,” which, for some curious reason, is never 
satisfied by our friends in Saigon; the corruption; occasional 
bombing of the “wrong” village; the pervasive “Viet-Cong in¬ 
filtration of military and civilian government organization”; the 
fact that when we relocate peasants to new hamlets, we often 
leave “the fox still in the henhouse,” because of inadequate 
police methods; and so on.Still, we have a good “pacification theory,” which involves 
three steps: “elimination of the Viet-Cong by search-and-de- 
stroy operations, protection and control of the population and 
its resources by police and military forces, and preparing and

arming the peasants to defend their own communities.” If we 
rarely reach the third stage, this is because we have not yet 
learned to “share the sense of urgency of the revolutionary 
cause,” or “to nourish these attitudes” among our “Vietnamese 
associates.” Thus we understand that the “real revolution” is the 
one we are implementing, “in contrast to the artificially stimu¬ 
lated and controlled revolution of Diem and the Communists,” 
but we have difficulties in communicating this fact to the Viet¬ 
namese peasant or to our “Vietnamese associates.” What is 
needed, clearly, is better training for American officials, and of 
course, true national dedication to this humanitarian task.A grave defect in our society, this political scientist argues, is 
our tendency to avoid “an active American role in the fostering 
of democratic institutions abroad.” The pacification program in 
Vietnam represents an attempt to meet our responsibility to 
foster democratic institutions abroad, through rational methods 
of material and human resources control.
