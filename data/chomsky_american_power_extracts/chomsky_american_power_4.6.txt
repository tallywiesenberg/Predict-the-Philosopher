Refusal to dedicate 
ourselves to this task might be described as “a policy more 
selfish and timid than it was broad and enlightened,” 23 to use 
the terminology of an earlier day.When we strip away the terminology of the behavioral sci¬ 
ences, we see revealed, in such work as this, the mentality of 
the colonial civil servant, persuaded of the benevolence of the 
mother country and the correctness of its vision of world order, 
and convinced that he understands the true interests of the 
backward peoples whose welfare he is to administer.In fact, 
much of the scholarly work on Southeast Asian affairs reflects 
precisely this mentality.As an example, consider the August 
1967 issue of Asian Survey, fully devoted to a Vietnam 
symposium in which a number of experts contribute their 
thoughts on the success of our enterprise and how it can be 
moved forward.41 


AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


The introductory essay by Samuel Huntington, chairman of 
the department of government at Harvard, is entitled “Social 
Science and Vietnam.” It emphasizes the need “to develop 
scholarly study and understanding of Vietnam” if our “involve¬ 
ment” is to succeed, and expresses his judgment that the papers 
in this volume “demonstrate that issues and topics closely con¬ 
nected to policy can be presented and analyzed in scholarly and 
objective fashion.” 

Huntington’s own contribution to “scholarly study and under¬ 
standing of Vietnam” includes an article in the Boston Globe, 
February 17, 1968.
