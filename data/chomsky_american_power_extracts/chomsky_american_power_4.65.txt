Here he describes the “momentous changes 
in Vietnamese society during the past five years,” specifically, 
the process of urbanization.This process “struck directly at the 
strength and potential appeal of the Viet Cong.” “So long as the 
overwhelming mass of the people lived in the countryside, the 
VC could win the war by winning control of those people—and 
they came very close to doing so in both 1961 and 1964.But the 
American sponsored urban revolution undercut the VC rural 
revolution.” The refugees fleeing from the rural areas found not 
only security but also “prosperity and economic well-being.” 
“While wartime urban prosperity hurt some, the mass of the 
poor people benefited from it.” 

The sources of urbanization have been described clearly 
many times, for example, by this American spokesman in Viet¬ 
nam: “There have been three choices open to the peasantry.One, to stay where they are; two, to move into the areas con¬ 
trolled by us; three, to move off into the interior towards the 
Vietcong..
