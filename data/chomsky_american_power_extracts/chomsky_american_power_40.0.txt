where in these essays I have quoted his remark that, contrary 
to his expectations, the American attempt to “suppress the re¬ 
sistance” by widening the war might still meet with success, so 
that “we may all be saluting the wisdom and statesmanship of the 
American government.” Schlesinger’s critique of the policy of es¬ 
calation is “pragmatic,” in that it does not question our ends but 
only the likelihood of our achieving them.In this sense it is 
“responsible criticism”; it diverges from the approach of the 
Johnson administration, or for that matter, the position of the 
“responsible” critics who take a stronger imperialist position, 
only in its judgment as to the potential effectiveness of certain 
methods that are being employed in our attempt to organize 
Vietnamese society in our perceived interest and in what we 
determine to be the interests of the Vietnamese.Investigation

The Bitter Heritage 


of this liberal critique shows how remote from the mainstream 
of American opinion, that opinion which might be influential in 
decision making, is a point of view that would be considered 
quite moderate in the spectrum of world opinion: namely, that 
the United States has no unilateral right to determine by force 
the course of development of the nations of the Third World.As a specimen of liberal American ideology, Schlesinger’s 
book also provides some insight into one fairly significant aspect 
of the complex matter of imperialist expansion.No doubt ideol¬ 
ogy has its roots in real or at least perceived interests; it is, 
however, no novel observation that ideology can have a life of 
its own, contributing to the design and implementation of pol¬ 
icy in a way that may, on occasion, even conflict with the inter¬ 
ests from which it arose.
