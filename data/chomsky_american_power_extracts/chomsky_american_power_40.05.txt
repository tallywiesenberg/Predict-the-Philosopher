The postwar American anti-Commu- 
nist paranoia provides many examples.In part, it provided a 
convenient—and occasionally plausible—justification for the 
kind of interventionism that had long characterized American 
policy, in ever extending domains.In part it no doubt func¬ 
tioned as an almost independent basis for specific policy deci¬ 
sions, leading to actions that go beyond what is demanded by 
the interests that foreign policy in a general way attempts to 
serve.Our China policy provides a number of examples of this 
phenomenon.Another is the behavior of the Eisenhower admin¬ 
istration in Cuba in 1960 (as described by Ambassador Philip 
Bonsai in Foreign Affairs , January 1967), when the Castro gov¬ 
ernment demanded that American and British oil refineries 
process Soviet rather than Venezuelan oil.
