It is, for example, of interest to learn of the extent to which 
Schlesinger attributes our present tribulations to bureaucratic 
stupidity rather than Machiavellian intent.He raises the ques¬ 
tion, “which already haunts the American conscience,” as to 
whether we are “really carrying out this policy, as we constantly 
proclaim, to save the people we are methodically destroying,” 
or are we “doing it for less exalted purposes of our own.7 ’ The 
question is not directly answered, but the implication is that 
stupidity and ignorance, rather than pursuit of self-interest, are 
to blame for the bitter heritage.Viewing the development of 
American policy from the outside, it seems not too difficult to 
construct a rationale.But Schlesinger’s judgment must be given 
weight.
