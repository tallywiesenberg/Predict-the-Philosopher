against no one but themselves.” In fact, one need hardly be a 
dogmatic Marxist-Leninist to draw the conclusion that we are 
interested in encircling China.This is precisely, for example, 
the view of Charles Wolf, senior economist of the RAND Cor¬ 
poration, who regards it as our major foreign policy task to 
make China “willing to live with this fear” of American encir¬ 
clement (see the congressional hearings before the Subcommit¬ 
tee on the Far East and the Pacific, January 27, 1966).Schles- 
inger evidently thinks of his interpretation as consistent with 
our “philosophical heritage—empirical, pragmatic, ironic, plu¬ 
ralistic, competitive.” It just may be, however, that a more ap¬ 
propriate adjective is “inane.” 

Schlesinger is as aware of what we are doing in Vietnam as 
any reader of the New York Times or /.F. Stone's Weekly .He 
emphasizes that “the war began as an insurrection within South 
Vietnam which, as it has gathered momentum, has attracted 
increasing support and direction from the North” and that the 
result of our bombing of North Vietnam “was to bring North 
Vietnamese forces south of the border,” though on a scale 
which is dwarfed by our own invasion of the country.
