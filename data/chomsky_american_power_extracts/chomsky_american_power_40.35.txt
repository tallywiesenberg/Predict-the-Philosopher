One wonders 
whether he would have been equally offended by a comparable 
“outpouring of emotion” in Italy in 1935, or Russia in 1956.But 
as far as American actions are concerned, “it is not only idle but

censure, except for its failure to keep up with the press reports 
of what was actually taking place.True, Kennedy introduced 
an army of over 15,000 men, nearly three times the size of the 
Condor Legion sent by Hitler to “fight Communism” in an ear¬

of international affairs has a certain internal consistency.
