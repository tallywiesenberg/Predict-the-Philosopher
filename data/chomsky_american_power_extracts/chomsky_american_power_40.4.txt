He 
was opposed to the abortive Cuba invasion in 1961, because of 
his feeling that the planned deception was not likely to succeed, 
not out of any principled objection to such an action.Similarly, 
today, he refers with skepticism to Joseph Alsop’s prediction 
that before too long “the Vietnamese war will look successful” 
from the American point of view, but adds that “we all pray 
that Mr. Alsop will be right.” The liberal view, Schlesinger 
style, differs from that of Alsop in two important respects: first, 
in its skepticism as to the immediacy of an American victory; 
second, in its inability to imagine that any right-thinking Amer¬ 
ican could fail to be in favor of an outright American victory, if 
only it could be achieved by the means now being employed 
(which will, to be sure, turn the country into “a land of ruin 
and wreck”).Thus “we all pray” that American armed might 
will be successful, but the more sophisticated of us doubt that 
Alsop’s prediction will come true.Although Schlesinger now insists that “aggression from the 
North” will hardly do as an explanation for the war in South 
Vietnam, the old habits break through in his usage of the term 
“the South Vietnamese.” Thus our goal in Vietnam “should be 
the creation and stabilization of secure areas where the South 
Vietnamese might themselves undertake social and institutional 
development.” In fact, the areas where the South Vietnamese 
themselves have undertaken social and institutional develop¬ 
ment are those where the Vietcong have been in control, for 
example, in large parts of the Mekong Delta prior to the brutal

American and South Korean campaigns of the last few months.Ample documentation to support this conclusion is presented 
by Douglas Pike (who, in Schlesinger’s judgment, is “the most 
careful student of the Viet Cong”) in his recent book, Viet 
Cong .
