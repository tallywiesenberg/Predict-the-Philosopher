It would seem, then, that if our goal is to allow the South 
Vietnamese themselves to undertake social and institutional 
development, we should simply withdraw, or at the very least 
permit negotiations among indigenous South Vietnamese forces 
to the exclusion of outside powers, among which, of course, we 
ourselves are dominant by an overwhelming margin.But the South Vietnamese that Schlesinger has in mind are 
those whose claim to legitimacy is based on American arms 
(including the “South Vietnamese” in the military junta).Thus, 
in his lexicon, “South Vietnamese” is to be understood rather in 
the manner of the Japanese terminology of a quarter of a cen¬ 
tury ago, in which the “legitimate Chinese government” was 
that of Wang Ching-wei, the puppet ruler whom they installed 
(see page 194 above).The only appropriate comments regard¬ 
ing this conception of Rusk, Schlesinger, et al.are those of the 
American note of December 30, 1938, to Japan, which denied 
“that there is need or warrant for any one Power to take upon 
itself to prescribe what shall be the terms and conditions of a 
‘new order’ in areas not under its sovereignty and to constitute 
itself the repository of authority and the agent of destiny in 
regard thereto.” 

In the same vein, Schlesinger’s “middle course” would offer 
the Vietcong the prospect of participating in the future political 
life of Vietnam, “conditioned on their laying down their arms, 
opening up their territories and abiding by the ground rules of 
free elections.” Since there is no compensating demand that the 
Americans withdraw and that the Saigon army lay down their 
arms and open up their territories, Schlesinger’s middle course,

in essential respects, does not even go as far as the position of 
the Pentagon, which, on the surface at least, commits us to 
withdrawal after “Viet Cong military units would be deac¬ 
tivated.” Either proposal requests only that the other side sur¬ 
render, after which we guarantee them political rights.
