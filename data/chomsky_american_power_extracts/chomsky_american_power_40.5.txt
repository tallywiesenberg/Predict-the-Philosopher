A true “middle course,” demanding capitulation of no faction 
in the civil struggle, would advocate withdrawal of all foreign 
troops (American, South Korean, North Vietnamese, and other 
minor contingents), negotiations among existing political forces 
in South Vietnam—that is, the National Liberation Front and 
whatever other forces still have not been crushed by Marshal 
Ky’s American-supported storm troopers—to form a coalition 
government.As is admitted on all sides, adoption of this middle 
course would lead to the collapse of the Saigon regime, a fact 
which, along with the general unwillingness of the Saigon army 
to fight or even remain in uniform, should lead us, as Schles- 
inger puts it, to “wonder all the more about the political side of 
the war.” 

This course has in fact been repeatedly proposed, by the 
NLF, despite Schlesinger’s blanket assertion that “Hanoi and 
the Viet Cong will not negotiate so long as they think they can 
win.” It is possible that the repeated Hanoi and NLF initiatives 
towards negotiation and their demand for a coalition govern¬ 
ment will prove to be a deception, but there is no doubt that it 
is a deception simply to deny the existence of these initiatives or 
to ignore the content of the NLF program—a program which, 
since 1960, has been calling for the formation of “a broad national 
democratic coalition administration ...including representatives 
of all strata of people, nationalities, political parties, religious 
communities, and patriotic personalities” (see Kahin and Lewis, 
U.S. in Vietnam , Appendix 6-B).
