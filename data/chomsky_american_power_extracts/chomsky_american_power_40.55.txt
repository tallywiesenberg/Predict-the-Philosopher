Similarly, it is a deception to assert blandly, as Schlesinger

does, that “Hanoi has put such stress on the withdrawal ol 
American troops as a condition precedent to negotiation,” in the 
face of the frequent insistence from Hanoi that the demand for 
withdrawal is put forth as “a basis” for negotiations.Jean Lacouture commented in Le Nouvel Observateur, Jan¬ 
uary 1967, that United States government officials are the last 
people on earth who are unaware of the fundamental elements 
of the XLF program of 1962.He might have added that Arthur 
Schlesinger seems the last person on earth to be unaware of the 
negotiation position of Hanoi and the NLF (stated, for exam¬ 
ple, by Premier Pham Van Dong; cf.New York Times, April 14, 
1965), that recognition of the famous four points as “a basis” 
for a political settlement will create “favorable conditions” for 
such a settlement and make it “possible to consider the recon¬ 
vening of an international conference along the pattern of the 
1954 Geneva Conference on Vietnam.” Neither then nor since 
has withdrawal of American troops been demanded as a pre¬ 
condition for negotiations.Thus Schlesinger’s “middle course” appears to differ from the 
approach of the Joint Chiefs and the State Department only in 
tactical emphasis.
