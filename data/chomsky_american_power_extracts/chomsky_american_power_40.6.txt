All accept the assumption that dispatch of an 
American expeditionary force of half a million men to take over 
the conduct of the war is defense of the interests of the South

same attitude that permits Schlesinger (in his A Thousand 
Days) to express his horror at the discovery of Cuban arms 
cached in Venezuela, but to think nothing of the extensive 
American military aid that has been used to institute or support 
repressive regimes throughout the continent.
