Schlesinger’s “middle course” is one that, if successful, 
will leave the United States as dominant as it is in the Philip¬ 
pines, hardly an attractive prospect.If anything will lead this 
nation to “defile its oldest ideals and disgrace itself in the eyes 
of the world and its own posterity,” it is a willingness to tolerate 
any barbarism, so long as it can succeed, and to raise our twit¬ 
ters of protest only when total victory seems beyond our grasp.307 


SOME THOUGHTS ON 
INTELLECTUALS AND THE SCHOOLS 


In happier times, I would have liked to approach the topic of 
this symposium in a rather technical and professional way, ask¬ 
ing how students might best be exposed to the leading ideas 
and the most stimulating and penetrating thought in the fields 
that particularly interest me, how they might be helped to ex¬ 
perience the pleasures of discovery and of deepening insight 
and be given an opportunity to make their own individual con¬ 
tribution to contemporary culture.At this particular historical 
moment, however, there are other, more pressing matters.As I write, the radio is bringing the first reports of the bomb¬ 
ings of Hanoi and Haiphong.
