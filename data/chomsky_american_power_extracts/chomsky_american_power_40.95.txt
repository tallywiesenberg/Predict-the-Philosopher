When the bombings of North Vietnam began, Jean Lacouture 
commented aptly that these acts, and the documents produced 
to justify them, simply reveal that the American leaders regard 
themselves as having the right to strike where and when they 
wish.They reveal, in effect, that these leaders regard the world 
as an American preserve, to be governed and organized in ac¬ 
cordance with superior American wisdom and to be controlled, 
if necessary, by American power.At this moment of national 
disgrace, as American technology is running amuck in Southeast 
Asia, a discussion of American schools can hardly avoid noting 
the fact that these schools are the first training ground for the 
troops that will enforce the muted, unending terror of the status 
quo in the coming years of a projected American century; for 
the technicians "who will be developing the means for extension 
of American power; for the intellectuals who can be counted 
on, in significant measure, to provide the ideological justifica¬ 
tion for this particular form of barbarism and to decry the 
irresponsibility and lack of sophistication of those who will find 
all of this intolerable and revolting.Thirty years ago, Franz Borkenau concluded a brilliant study 
of the crushing of the popular revolution in Spain with this 
comment: “In this tremendous contrast with previous revolu¬ 
tions one fact is reflected.Before these latter years, counter¬ 
revolution usually depended upon the support of reactionary 
powers, which were technically and intellectually inferior to the 
forces of revolution.
