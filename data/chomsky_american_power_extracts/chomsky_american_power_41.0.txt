This has changed with the advent of fas¬

most modern, most efficient, most ruthless machinery yet in 
existence.It means that the age of revolutions free to evolve

Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools 


It would have taken a fair amount of foresight, at that time, 
to realize that the prediction would be proved accurate, with 
substitution of “liberal imperialism” for “fascism,” and that the 
United States would, in a generation, be employing the most 
efficient and most ruthless machinery in existence to ensure that 
revolutionary movements will not evolve according to their own 
laws, to guarantee that its own particular concept of civilization 
and justice and order will prevail.And it would have required 
considerable insight, in the late 1930s, to realize that before too 
long a reformist American administration with a “welfare state” 
domestic orientation would be doing its utmost to prove the 
correctness of Marx’s grim observation about this concept of 
civilization and justice and order: “The civilization and justice 
of bourgeois order comes out in its lurid light whenever the 
slaves and drudges of that order rise against their masters; then 
this civilization and justice stand forth as undisguised savagery 
and lawless revenge.” 

It is conceivable that American actions in Vietnam are simply 
a single outburst of criminal insanity, of no general or long- 
range significance except to the miserable inhabitants of that 
tortured land.
