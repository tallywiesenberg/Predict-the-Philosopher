It is difficult, however, to put much credence in 
this possibility.In half a dozen Latin American countries there 
are guerrilla movements that are approaching the early stages of 
the second Vietnamese war, and the American reaction is, appar¬

the Maoist terminology affected by the military; and American 
“advisers” guide and train the troops which, as Latin American 
liberals observe, are needed only to occupy their own country in 
the interests of domestic ruling classes and Northern capital.In 
these countries it has not yet become necessary, as in Vietnam,
