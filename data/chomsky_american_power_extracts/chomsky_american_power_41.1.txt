In Le Nouvel 
Observateur, the peasant organizer Francisco Juliao was re¬ 
cently quoted as certain of United States intervention when 
rebellion breaks out in the Brazilian Northeast Provinces.Others, less well known, have expressed themselves similarly.There is little basis, in history or logic, for supposing them to be 
wrong—little basis, that is, apart from the kind of sentimental¬ 
ity that sees the United States, alone among nations, as a selfless 
(if rather oafish) public benefactor, devoted only to projects of 
“international good will,” though frequently blundering in an 
excess of warmhearted generosity.One should no doubt take 
seriously the insistence of administration spokesmen that one 
purpose of the present violence is to prove that wars of national 
liberation cannot succeed; to demonstrate, that is, in the clear¬ 
est and most explicit terms, that any revolutionary movement 
that we—unilaterally, as in Vietnam—designate as illegitimate 
will face the most efficient and ruthless machinery that can be 
developed by modern technology.In minor ways, world opinion can serve as some kind of 
brake on full-scale utilization of the technology of terror and 
destruction.
