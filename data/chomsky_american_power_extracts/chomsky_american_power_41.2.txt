It is easy to be carried away by the sheer horror of what the 
daily press reveals and to lose sight of the fact that this is 
merely the brutal exterior of a deeper crime, of commitment to 
a social order that guarantees endless suffering and humiliation 
and denial of elementary human rights.It is tragic that the 
United States should have become, in Toynbee’s words, “the 
leader of a world-wide anti-revolutionary movement in defense 
of vested interests.” For American intellectuals and for the 
schools, there is no more vital issue than this indescribable 
tragedy.No one would seriously propose that the schools attempt to 
deal directly with such contemporary events as the American 
attack on the rural population of Vietnam or the backgrounds 
in recent history for the atrocities that are detailed in the mass 
media.No sane person would have expected the schools in 
France, for example, to explore the character of and justifica¬ 
tion for the Algerian war, or the schools in Russia to have dealt 
honestly with the crushing of the Hungarian revolution, or the 
schools in Italy to have analyzed the invasion of Ethiopia in an 
objective way, or the schools in England to have exposed the 
contemporary suppression of Irish nationalism.Rut it is perhaps 
not ridiculous to propose that the schools might direct them¬ 
selves to something more abstract, to an attempt to offer stu¬ 
dents some means for defending themselves from the onslaught 
of the massive government propaganda apparatus, from the 
natural bias of the mass media, and—to turn specifically to our 
present topic—from the equally natural tendency of significant
