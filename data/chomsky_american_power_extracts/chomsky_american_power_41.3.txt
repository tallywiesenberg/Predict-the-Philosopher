When the press reports 
that the electoral law commission in South Vietnam faces the

negotiations that they had been demanding; of the sincere 
American desire to permit the South Vietnamese people to elect 
freely the government of their choice (now that the domestic

candidates excluded); of the “great complexity” of international 
affairs (which, strangely, did not seem to justify Russian domi¬ 
nation of East Europe or the Japanese attempt to impose a new 
order in Asia); of the judicious restraint of the administration, 
presumably, in refraining from genocide at a single stroke; and 
so on.Or what is worse, we read of the “bedrock vital interest 
of the United States” in demonstrating that its military power, 
once committed for whatever reason, cannot be forced to with¬ 
draw—a viewpoint which, had it been accepted by the world’s 
second superpower as well, would have brought the history of 
Western civilization to a close in 1962, and which, if consist¬ 
ently pursued, must lead either to a Pax Americana or to a 
devastating world conflict.
