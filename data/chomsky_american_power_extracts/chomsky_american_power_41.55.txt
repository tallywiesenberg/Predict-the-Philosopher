In general, the history of imperialism and of imperialist 
apologia, particularly as seen from the point of view of those at 
the wrong end of the guns, should be a central part of any 
civilized curriculum.But there are other aspects to a program of 
intellectual self-defense that should not be overlooked.In an 
age of science and technology, it is inevitable that their prestige 
will be employed as an ideological instrument—specifically,, 
that the social and behavioral sciences will in various ways be 
made to serve in defense of national policy or as a mask for 
special interest.It is not merely that intellectuals are strongly 
tempted, in a society that offers them prestige and affluence, to 
take what is now called a “pragmatic attitude” (in a perverse 
sense of “pragmatism” which is, sad to say, not without some 
historical justification, as shown in the Dewey-Bourne inter¬ 
change during the First World War—see Introduction, pages 
5-7), that is, an attitude that one must “accept,” not criti¬ 
cally analyze or struggle to change, the existing distribution of 
power, domestic or international, and the political realities that 
flow from it, and must work only for “slow measures of im¬ 
provement” in a technological, piecemeal manner.It is not 
merely that having taken this position (conceivably with some 
justification, at a particular historical moment), one is strongly 
tempted to provide it with an ideological justification of a very 
general sort.
