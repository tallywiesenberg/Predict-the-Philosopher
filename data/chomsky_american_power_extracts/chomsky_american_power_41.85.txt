This essay was written in June 1966; it now goes to press again in 
May 1968.On the use of gas in Vietnam, see Seymour Hersh, “Poison 
Gas in Vietnam,” New York Review of Books , May 9, 1968.On 
current plans for chemical warfare, Science , May 24, 1968, contains 
the following note (p. 863): 

Expanded Chemical Warfare: The Air Force has told Congress that 
it will spend $70.8 million on 10 million gallons of chemicals used for 
Vietnam defoliation and crop-killing in the fiscal year beginning 1 July, 
a $24.9 million increase over this year’s figure.Next year’s expanded 
efforts are in line with the continuing increase in the U.S. chemical 
warfare program in Vietnam.In the first 9 months of 1967, 843,606 
acres in Vietnam were drenched with defoliants and 121,400 acres with 
crop-killing chemicals, a figure which slightly exceeded the totals for 
the whole of 1966.
