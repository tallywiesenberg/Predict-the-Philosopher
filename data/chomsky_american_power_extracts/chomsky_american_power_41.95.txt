There can be no doubt that the 
DOD is, in the short run, going beyond mere genocide to biocide.It 
commandeered the entire U.S. production of 2,4,5-T for 1967 and 1968 
[some 13 to 14 million pounds (6.36 million kilos) according to U.S.Tariff Commission reports].If one combines this with the other 
chemicals the DOD concedes it is using, there is a sufficient amount 
to kill 97 percent of the aboveground vegetation on over 10 million 
acres of land (about 4 million hectares)â€”an area so big that it would 
require over 60 years for a man to walk on each acre.The long-term effects of spraying such an area may be imponderable, 
but the short-term effects of using these chemicals are certain: a lot 
of leaves, trees, rice plants, and other vegetation are dead or dying; 
and a lot of insects, birds, animals, and a few humans have either 
migrated or died of starvation.
