THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
INTELLECTUALS 


Twenty years ago, Dwight Macdonald published a series of 
articles in Politics on the responsibilities of peoples, and specifi¬ 
cally, the responsibility of intellectuals.I read them as an un¬ 
dergraduate, in the years just after the war, and had occasion to 
read them again a few months ago.They seem to me to have 
lost none of their power or persuasiveness.Macdonald is con¬ 
cerned with the question of war guilt.
