To an undergraduate in 1945-1946—to any¬ 
one whose political and moral consciousness had been formed 
by the horrors of the 1930s, by the war in Ethiopia, the Russian 
purge, the “China incident,” the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi 
atrocities, the Western reaction to these events and, in part, 
complicity in them—these questions had particular significance 
and poignancy.With respect to the responsibility of intellectuals, there are 
still other, equally disturbing questions.Intellectuals are in a 
position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions 
according to their causes and motives and often hidden inten¬ 
tions.In the Western world at least, they have the power that 
comes from political liberty, from access to information and 
freedom of expression.For a privileged minority, Western 
democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training 
to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and 
misrepresentation, ideology, and class interest through which 
the events of current history are presented to us.
