The responsi¬ 
bilities of intellectuals, then, are much deeper than what Mac¬ 
donald calls the “responsibility of peoples,” given the unique 
privileges that intellectuals enjoy.The issues that Macdonald raised are as pertinent today as 
they were twenty years ago.We can hardly avoid asking our¬ 
selves to what extent the American people bear responsibility 
for the savage American assault on a largely helpless rural pop¬ 
ulation in Vietnam, still another atrocity in what Asians see as 
the “Vasco da Gama era” of world history.As for those of us 
who stood by in silence and apathy as this catastrophe slowly 
took shape over the past dozen years, on what page of history 
do we find our proper place?Only the most insensible can 
escape these questions.
