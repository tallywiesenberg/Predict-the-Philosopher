Similarly, the Communist planners probed the “free world spec¬ 
trum of defense 55 in Northern Azerbaijan and Greece (where 
Stalin “supported substantial guerrilla warfare 55 — ibid., pp.36 and 148), operating from plans carefully laid in 1945.And 
in Central Europe, the Soviet Union was not “prepared to 
accept a solution which would remove the dangerous tensions 
from Central Europe at the risk of even slowly staged corro¬ 
sion of communism in East Germany 55 {ibid., p. 156).It is interesting to compare these observations with studies by 
scholars actually concerned with historical events.The remark 
about Stalin's initiating the first Vietnamese war in 1946 does 
not even merit refutation.
