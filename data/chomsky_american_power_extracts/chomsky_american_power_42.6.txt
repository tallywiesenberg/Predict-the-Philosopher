He does not see fit to mention, for example, the Russian notes 
of March-April 1952, which proposed unification of Germany 
under internationally supervised elections, with withdrawal of 
all troops within a year, if there was a guarantee that a reuni¬ 
fied Germany would not be permitted to join a Western mili¬ 
tary alliance.12 And he has also momentarily forgotten his own 
characterization of the strategy of the Truman and Eisenhower 
administrations: “to avoid any serious negotiation with the So¬ 
viet Union until the West could confront Moscow with German 
rearmament within an organized European framework, as a fait 
accompli ” 13 —to be sure, in defiance of the Potsdam agree¬ 
ments.But most interesting of all is Rostow’s reference to Iran.The 
facts are that there was a Russian attempt to impose by force a 
pro-Soviet government in Northern Azerbaijan that would 
grant the Soviet Union access to Iranian oil.This was rebuffed 
by superior Anglo-American force in 1946, at which point the 
more powerful imperialism obtained full rights to Iranian oil for 
itself, with the installation of a pro-Western government.
