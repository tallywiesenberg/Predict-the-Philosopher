Some Thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools 


1950s, the only Iranian government with something of a popu¬ 
lar base experimented with the curious idea that Iranian oil 
should belong to the Iranians.What is interesting, however, is 
the description of Northern Azerbaijan as part of “the free 
world spectrum of defense.” It is pointless, by now, to comment 
on the debasement of the phrase “free world.” But by what law 
of nature does Iran, with its resources, fall within Western do¬ 
minion?The bland assumption that it does is most revealing of 
deep-seated attitudes towards the conduct of foreign affairs.In addition to this growing lack of concern for truth, we find, 
in recent statements, a real or feigned naivete with regard to 
American actions that reaches startling proportions.For exam¬ 
ple, Arthur Schlesinger has recently characterized our Vietna¬ 
mese policies of 1954 as “part of our general program of inter¬ 
national goodwill.” 14 Unless intended as irony, this remark 
shows either a colossal cynicism or an inability, on a scale that 
defies comment, to comprehend elementary phenomena of con¬ 
temporary history.
