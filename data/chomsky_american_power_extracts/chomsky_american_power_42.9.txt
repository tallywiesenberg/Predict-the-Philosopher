55 Such a reaction would be the merest sentimentality, un¬ 
thinkable to a tough-minded realist.The difficulty, rather, was 
that it seemed unlikely that the deception could succeed.The 
operation, in his view, was ill-conceived but not otherwise ob¬ 
jectionable.17 In a similar vein, Schlesinger quotes with ap¬ 
proval Kennedy’s “realistic 55 assessment of the situation resulting 
from Trujillo’s assassination: “There are three possibilities in 
descending order of preference: a decent democratic regime, a 
continuation of the Trujillo regime or a Castro regime.We 
ought to aim at the first, but we really can’t renounce the sec¬ 
ond until we are sure that we can avoid the third.” ls The 
reason why the third possibility is so intolerable is explained a 
few pages later: “Communist success in Latin America would

deal a much harder blow to the power and influence of the 
United States.” Of course, we can never really be sure of avoid¬ 
ing the third possibility; therefore, in practice, we will always 
settle for the second, as we are now doing in Brazil and Argen¬ 
tina, for example .
