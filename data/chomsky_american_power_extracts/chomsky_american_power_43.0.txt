Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


In short, the workers of Barcelona were not merely giving 
way to “feelings of resentment and of somehow having been 
cheated” when they learned of “the unsuspected complexity of 
modern society.” Rather, they had good reason to believe that 
they were being cheated, by the old dog with the new collar. 
George Orwell's observations are also highly relevant: 

Everyone who has made two visits, at intervals of months, to 
Barcelona during the war has remarked upon the extraordinary 
changes that took place in it. And curiously enough, whether 
they went there first in August and again in January, or, like 
myself, first in December and again in April, the thing they said 
was always the same: that the revolutionary atmosphere had 
vanished. No doubt to anyone who had been there in August, 
when the blood was scarcely dry in the streets and militia were 
quartered in the small hotels, Barcelona in December would have 
seemed bourgeois; to me, fresh from England, it was liker to a 
workers’ city than anything I had conceived possible. Now [in 
April] the tide had rolled back. Once again it was an ordinary 
city, a little pinched and chipped by war, but with no outward 
sign of working-class predominance. . . . Fat prosperous men, 
elegant w r omen, and sleek cars were everywhere. . . . The officers 
of the new Popular Army, a type that had scarcely existed when I 
left Barcelona, swarmed in surprising numbers . . . [wearing] an 
elegant khaki uniform with a tight waist, like a British Army 
officer’s uniform, only a little more so. I do not suppose that 
more than one in twenty of them had yet been to the front, but 
all of them had automatic pistols strapped to their belts; we, at 
the front, could not get pistols for love or money. . . .* A deep 
change had come over the town. There were two facts that were 
the keynote of all else. One was that the people—the civil popula¬ 
tion—had lost much of their interest in the war; the other was 
that the normal division of society into rich and poor, upper class 
and lower class, was reasserting itself . 90 

* Orwell had just returned from the Aragon front, where he had been 
serving with the POUM militia in an area heavily dominated by left- 
wing (POUM and anarchist) troops.
