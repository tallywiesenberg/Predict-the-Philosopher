interests in Europe and Asia.” So much for our heritage.As to 
our interests, the matter is equally simple.Fundamental is our 
“profound interest that societies abroad develop and strengthen 
those elements in their respective cultures that elevate and 
protect the dignity of the individual against the state.” At the 
same time, we must counter the “ideological threat,” namely

the Asian mind “so much more difficult to grasp” than Marxist 
dogma, and are so “disturbing to some Asians” because of “their 
very lack of dogmatism.” 

Such intellectual contributions as these suggest the need for a 
correction to De Gaulle’s remark, in his memoirs, about the 
American “will to power, cloaking itself in idealism.” By now, 
this will to power is not so much cloaked in idealism as it is 
drowned in fatuity.And academic intellectuals have made their 
unique contribution to this sorry picture.
