Let us, however, return to the war in Vietnam and the re¬ 
sponse that it has aroused among American intellectuals.A strik¬ 
ing feature of the recent debate on Southeast Asian policy has 
been the distinction that is commonly drawn between “respon¬ 
sible criticism,” on the one hand, and “sentimental” or “emo¬ 
tional” or “hysterical” criticism, on the other.There is much to 
be learned from a careful study of the terms in which this 
distinction is drawn.The “hysterical critics” are to be identified, 
apparently, by their irrational refusal to accept one fundamen¬ 
tal political axiom, namely, that the United States has the right 
to extend its power and control without limit, insofar as is 
feasible.Responsible criticism does not challenge this assump¬ 
tion, but argues, rather, that we probably can’t “get away with 
it” at this particular time and place.
