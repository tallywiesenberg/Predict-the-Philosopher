A distinction of this sort seems to be what Irving Kristol has 
in mind, for example, in his analysis of the protest over Vietnam 
policy, in Encounter, August 1965.He contrasts the responsible

critics, such as Walter Lippmann, the New York Times , and 
Senator Fulbright, with the “teach-in movement/’ “Unlike the 
university protesters,” he maintains, “Mr.Lippmann engages in 
no presumptuous suppositions as to ‘what the Vietnamese peo¬ 
ple really want’—he obviously doesn’t much care—or in legalis¬ 
tic exegesis as to whether, or to what extent, there is ‘aggres¬ 
sion’ or ‘revolution’ in South Vietnam.His is a realpolitik point 
of view; and he will apparently even contemplate the possibility 
of a nuclear war against China in extreme circumstances.” This 
is commendable, and contrasts favorably, for Kristol, with the 
talk of the “unreasonable, ideological types” in the teach-in 
movement, who often seem to be motivated by such absurdities 
as “simple, virtuous ‘anti-imperialism.’ ” who deliver “harangues 
on ‘the power structure,’ ” and who even sometimes stoop so 
low as to read “articles and reports from the foreign press on 
the American presence in Vietnam.” Furthermore, these nasty 
types are often psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, or 
philosophers (just as, incidentally, those most vocal in protest in 
the Soviet Union are generally physicists, literary intellectuals, 
and others remote from the exercise of power), rather than 
people with Washington contacts, who of course realize that 
“had they a new, good idea about Vietnam, they would get a 
prompt and respectful hearing” in Washington.I am not interested here in whether Kristol’s characterization 
of protest and dissent is accurate, but rather in the assumptions 
that it expresses with respect to such questions as these: Is the 
purity of American motives a matter that is beyond discussion, 
or that is irrelevant to discussion?
