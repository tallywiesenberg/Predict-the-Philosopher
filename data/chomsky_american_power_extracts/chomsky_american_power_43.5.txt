healthy “realpolitik point of view” that Irving Kristol so much 
admires.But, one may ask, why restrict ourselves to such indirect

ern Studies, Seton Hall University, who explains that like all 
people who have lived under Communism, the North Vietna¬ 
mese “would be perfectly happy to be bombed to be free” (p. 
345).
