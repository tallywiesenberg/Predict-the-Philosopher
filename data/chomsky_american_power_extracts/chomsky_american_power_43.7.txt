More accurately, these possi¬ 
bilities are inexpressible; the categories in which they are 
formulated (honesty, indignation) simply do not exist for the 
tough-minded social scientist.In this implicit disparagement of traditional intellectual val¬ 
ues, Kristol reflects attitudes that are fairly widespread in aca¬ 
demic circles.I do not doubt that these attitudes are in part a 
consequence of the desperate attempt of the social and behav¬ 
ioral sciences to imitate the surface features of sciences that 
really have significant intellectual content.But they have other 
sources as well.Anyone can be a moral individual, concerned 
with human rights and problems; but only a college professor, a 
trained expert, can solve technical problems by “sophisticated” 
methods.
