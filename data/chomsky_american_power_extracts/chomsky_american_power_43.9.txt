He sim¬ 
ply suggests a terminology and provides a fagade of rationality.When particular policy conclusions are drawn, they are sup¬ 
ported only by ex cathedra remarks for which no support is 
even suggested (e.g., “The civil defense line probably should be 
drawn somewhere below $5 billion annually” to keep from pro¬ 
voking the Russians—why not $50 billion, or $5?).What is 
more, Kahn is quite aware of this vacuity; in his more judicious 
moments he claims only that “there is no reason to believe that 
relatively sophisticated models are more likely to be misleading 
than the simpler models and analogies frequently used as an aid 
to judgment.” For those whose humor tends towards the maca¬ 
bre, it is easy to play the game of “strategic thinking” a la Kahn, 
and to prove what one wishes.For example, one of Kahn’s basic 
assumptions is that “an all-out surprise attack in which all re¬ 
sources are devoted to counter-value targets would be so irra¬ 
tional that, barring an incredible lack of sophistication or actual

insanity among Soviet decision makers, such an attack is highly 
unlikely.” A simple argument proves the opposite.Premise 1: 
American decision makers think along the lines outlined by 
Herman Kahn.
