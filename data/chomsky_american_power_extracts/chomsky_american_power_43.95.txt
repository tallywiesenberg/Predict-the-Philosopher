everyone to be red than for everyone to be dead.Premise 3: If 
the Americans were to respond to an all-out counter-value at¬

will not respond to an all-out counter-value attack, and therefore 
it should be launched without delay.Of course, one can carry 
the argument a step further.Fact: The Russians have not car¬ 
ried out an all-out counter-value attack.
