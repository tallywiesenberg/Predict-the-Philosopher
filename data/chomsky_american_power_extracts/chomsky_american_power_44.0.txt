tion again reflects Jackson’s antipathy towards the revolution 
and its goals. I will return to this question directly, with refer¬ 
ence to areas where agricultural collectivization was much more 
extensive than in Catalonia. 

The complexities of modern society that baffled and con¬ 
founded the unsuspecting anarchist workers of Barcelona, as 
Jackson enumerates them, were the following: the accumulat¬ 
ing food and supply problems and the administration of frontier 
posts, villages, and public utilities. As just noted, the food and 
supply problems seem to have accumulated most rapidly under 
the brilliant leadership of Juan Comorera. So far as the frontier 
posts are concerned, the situation, as Jackson elsewhere de¬ 
scribes it (p. 368), was basically as follows: “In Catalonia the 
anarchists had, ever since July 18, controlled the customs 
stations at the French border. On April 17, 1937, the reorganized 
carabineros, acting on orders of the Finance Minister, Juan 
Negrin, began to reoccupy the frontier. At least eight an¬ 
archists were killed in clashes with the carabineros.” Apart 
from this difficulty, admittedly serious, there seems little 
reason to suppose that the problem of manning frontier 
posts contributed to the ebbing of the revolutionary tide. 
The available records do not indicate that the problems 
of administering villages or public utilities were either 
“unsuspected” or too complex for the Catalonian work¬ 
ers—a remarkable and unsuspected development, but one 
which nevertheless appears to be borne out by the evidence 
available to us. I want to emphasize again that Jackson presents 
no evidence to support his conclusions about the ebbing of the

revolutionary tide and the reasons for the disaffection of the 
Catalonian workers. Once again, I think it fair to attribute his 
conclusions to the elitist bias of the liberal intellectual rather 
than to the historical record. 

Consider next Jackson’s comment that the anarchists “ex¬ 
plained the loss of Malaga as due in large measure to the low 
morale and the disorientation of the Andalusian proletariat, 
which saw the Valencia government evolving steadily toward 
the right.” Again, it seems that Jackson regards this as just 
another indication of the naivete and unreasonableness of the 
Spanish anarchists. However, here again there is more to the 
story. One of the primary sources that Jackson cites is Bor- 
kenau, quite naturally, since Borkenau spent several days in the
