What is remarkable is that serious people actually pay attention 
to these absurdities, no doubt because of the facade of tough¬ 
mindedness and pseudoscience.It is a curious and depressing fact that the “antiwar move¬ 
ment” falls prey all too often to similar confusions.In the fall of 
1965, for example, there was an International Conference on 
Alternative Perspectives on Vietnam, which circulated a pam¬ 
phlet to potential participants stating its assumptions.The plan 
was to set up study groups in which three “types of intellectual 
tradition” will be represented: (1) area specialists; (2) “social 
theory, with special emphasis on theories of the international 
system, of social change and development, of conflict and con¬ 
flict resolution, or of revolution”; (3) “the analysis of public 
policy in terms of basic human values, rooted in various theo¬ 
logical, philosophical and humanist traditions.” The second in¬ 
tellectual tradition will provide “general propositions, derived

from social theory and tested against historical, comparative, or 
experimental data”; the third “will provide the framework out 
of which fundamental value questions can be raised and in 
terms of which the moral implications of societal actions can be 
analyzed.” The hope was that “by approaching the questions 
[of Vietnam policy] from the moral perspectives of all great 
religions and philosophical systems, we may find solutions that 
are more consistent with fundamental human values than cur¬ 
rent American policy in Vietnam has turned out to be.” 

In short, the experts on values (i.e., spokesmen for the great 
religions and philosophical systems) will provide fundamental 
insights on moral perspectives, and the experts on social theory 
will provide general empirically validated propositions and 
“general models of conflict.” From this interplay, new policies 
will emerge, presumably from application of the canons of sci¬ 
entific method.The only debatable issue, it seems to me, is 
whether it is more ridiculous to turn to experts in social theory 
for general well-confirmed propositions, or to the specialists in 
the great religions and philosophical systems for insights into 
fundamental human values.
