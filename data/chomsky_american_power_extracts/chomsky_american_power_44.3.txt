He does not relate his observation 
that, by and large, intellectuals have lost interest in “transform¬ 
ing the whole way of life” to the fact that they play an increas¬ 
ingly prominent role in running the welfare state; he does not 
relate their general satisfaction with the welfare state to the fact 
that, as he observes elsewhere, “America has become an affluent 
society, offering place ...and prestige ... to the onetime 
radicals.” Secondly, he offers no serious argument to show that 
intellectuals are somehow “right” or “objectively justified” in 
reaching the consensus to which he alludes, with its rejection of 
the notion that society should be transformed.Indeed, although 
Bell is fairly sharp about the empty rhetoric of the “New Left,” 
he seems to have a quite utopian faith that technical experts 
will be able to come to grips with the few problems that still 
remain; for example, the fact that labor is treated as a commod¬ 
ity, and the problems of “alienation.” 

It seems fairly obvious that the classical problems are very 
much with us; one might plausibly argue that they have even 
been enhanced in severity and scale.
