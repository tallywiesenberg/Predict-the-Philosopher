The Responsibility of Intellectuals 


conceive, at least in principle, of a solution within national 
boundaries, a sensible idea as to how to transform international 
society in such a way as to cope with the vast and perhaps 
increasing human misery is hardly likely to develop within the 
framework of the intellectual consensus that Bell describes.Thus it would seem natural to describe the consensus of Bell’s 
intellectuals in somewhat different terms than his.Using the 
terminology of the first part of his essay, we might say that the 
welfare state technician finds justification for his special and 
prominent social status in his “science,” specifically, in the claim 
that social science can support a technology of social tinkering 
on a domestic or international scale.He then takes a further 
step, proceeding, in a familiar way, to claim universal validity 
for what is in fact a class interest: he argues that the special 
conditions on which his claims to power and authority are 
based are, in fact, the general conditions through which alone 
modern society can be saved; that social tinkering within a 
welfare state framework must replace the commitment to the 
“total ideologies” of the past, ideologies which were concerned 
with a transformation of society.
