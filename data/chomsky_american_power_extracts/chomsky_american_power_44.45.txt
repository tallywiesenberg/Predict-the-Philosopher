Within the same framework of general utopianism, Bell goes 
on to pose the issue between welfare state scholar-experts and 
Third World ideologists in a rather curious way.He points out, 
quite correctly, that there is no issue of Communism, the content 
of that doctrine having been “long forgotten by friends and 
foes alike.” Rather, he says, “the question is an older one: 
whether new societies can grow by building democratic institu¬ 
tions and allowing people to make choices—and sacrifices— 
voluntarily, or whether the new elites, heady with power, will 
impose totalitarian means to transform their countries.” The 
question is an interesting one; it is odd, however, to see it 
referred to as “an older one.” Surely he cannot be suggesting 
that the West chose the democratic way—for example, that in 
England during the industrial revolution, the farmers voluntar¬ 
ily made the choice of leaving the land, giving up cottage 
industry, becoming an industrial proletariat, and voluntarily de¬ 
cided, within the framework of the existing democratic institu¬ 
tions, to make the sacrifices that are graphically described in the 
classic literature on nineteenth-century industrial society.One 
may debate the question whether authoritarian control is neces¬ 
sary to permit capital accumulation in the underdeveloped 
w r orld, but the Western model of development is hardly one 
that we can point to with any pride.It is perhaps not surprising 
to find a Walt Rostow referring to “the more humane processes 
[of industrialization] that Western values would suggest.” 27 
Those who have a serious concern for the problems that face 
backward countries and for the role that advanced industrial 
societies might, in principle, play in development and moderni-

The Responsibility of Intellectuals 


zation must use somewhat more care in interpreting the signifi¬ 
cance of the Western experience.Returning to the quite appropriate question, whether “new 
societies can grow by building democratic institutions” or only 
by totalitarian means, I think that honesty requires us to recog¬ 
nize that this question must be directed more to American intel¬ 
lectuals than to Third World ideologists.
