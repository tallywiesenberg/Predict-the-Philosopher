The backward coun¬ 
tries have incredible, perhaps insurmountable problems, and 
few available options; the United States has a wide range of 
options, and has the economic and technological resources, 
though evidently neither the intellectual nor the moral re¬ 
sources, to confront at least some of these problems.It is easy 
for an American intellectual to deliver homilies on the virtues of 
freedom and liberty, but if he is really concerned about, say, 
Chinese totalitarianism or the burdens imposed on the Chinese 
peasantry in forced industrialization, then he should face a task 
that is infinitely more significant and challenging—the task of 
creating, in the United States, the intellectual and moral cli¬ 
mate, as well as the social and economic conditions, that would 
permit this country to participate in modernization and devel¬ 
opment in a way commensurate with its material wealth and 
technical capacity.Massive capital gifts to Cuba and China 
might not succeed in alleviating the authoritarianism and terror 
that tend to accompany early stages of capital accumulation, 
but they are far more likely to have this effect than lectures on 
democratic values.It is possible that even without “capitalist 
encirclement” in its varying manifestations, the truly democratic 
elements in revolutionary movements—in some instances so¬ 
viets and collectives, for example—might be undermined by an 
“elite” of bureaucrats and technical intelligentsia; but it is a 
near certainty that the fact of capitalist encirclement, which all

revolutionary movements now have to face, will guarantee this 
result.The lesson, for those who are concerned to strengthen 
the democratic, spontaneous, and popular elements in develop¬ 
ing societies, is quite clear.
