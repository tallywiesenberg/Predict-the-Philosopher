But I would hope 
that what we do in Southeast Asia would help to develop within 
the Chinese body politic more of a realism and willingness to live 
with this fear than to indulge it by support for liberation move¬ 
ments, which admittedly depend on a great deal more than ex¬ 
ternal support ...the operational question for American foreign 
policy is not whether that fear can be eliminated or substantially 
alleviated, but whether China can be faced with a structure of 
incentives, of penalties and rewards, of inducements that will 
make it willing to live with this fear .31 

The point is further clarified by Thomas Schelling: “There is 
growing experience which the Chinese can profit from, that 
although the United States may be interested in encircling 
them, may be interested in defending nearby areas from them, 
it is, nevertheless, prepared to behave peaceably if they are.
