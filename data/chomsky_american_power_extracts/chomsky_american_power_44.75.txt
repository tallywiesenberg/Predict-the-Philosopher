offended by the undignified noises from the servants’ quarters.If, let us say, a peasant-based revolutionary movement tries to 
achieve independence from foreign domination or to overthrow 
semifeudal structures supported by foreign powers, or if the 
Chinese irrationally refuse to respond properly to the schedule 
of reinforcement that we have prepared for them, if they object 
to being encircled by the benign and peace-loving “rich men” 
who control the territories on their borders as a natural right, 
then, evidently, we must respond to this belligerence with ap¬ 
propriate force.It is this mentality that explains the frankness with which the 
United States government and its academic apologists defend 
the American refusal to permit a political settlement in Vietnam 
at a local level, a settlement based on the actual distribution of 
political forces.Even government experts freely admit that the 
National Liberation Front is the only “truly mass-based political 
party in South Vietnam”; 33 that the NLF had “made a con¬ 
scious and massive effort to extend political participation, even 
if it was manipulated, on the local level so as to involve the peo¬ 
ple in a self-contained, self-supporting revolution” (p. 374); 
and that this effort had been so successful that no political 
groups, “with the possible exception of the Buddhists, thought 
themselves equal in size and power to risk entering into a coali¬ 
tion, fearing that if they did the w T hale would swallow the min¬ 
now” (p. 362).
