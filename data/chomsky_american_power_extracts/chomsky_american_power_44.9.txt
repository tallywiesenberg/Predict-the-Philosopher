The non-Communist nationalists are not—we do not have any 
large, well-organized political parties and we do not yet have 
unity.We cannot leave the Vietcong in existence.” Officials in 
Washington understand the situation very well.Thus Secretary 
Rusk has pointed out that “if the Vietcong come to the confer¬ 
ence table as full partners they will, in a sense, have been 
victorious in the very aims that South Vietnam and the United 
States are pledged to prevent” (January 28, 1966).Similarly, 
Max Frankel reported from Washington: “Compromise has had 
no appeal here because the Administration concluded long ago

that the non-Communist forces of South Vietnam could not 
long survive in a Saigon coalition with Communists.It is for that 
reason—and not because of an excessively rigid sense of proto¬ 
col—that Washington has steadfastly refused to deal with the 
Vietcong or recognize them as an independent political force .” 36 

In short, we will—magnanimously—permit Vietcong repre¬ 
sentatives to attend negotiations, but only if they will agree to 
identify themselves as agents of a foreign power and thus forfeit 
the right to participate in a coalition government, a right which 
they have now been demanding for a half-dozen years.
