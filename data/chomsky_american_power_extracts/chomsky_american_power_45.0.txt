The Responsibility of Intellectuals 


truth, it is also his duty to see events in their historical perspec¬ 
tive.Thus one must applaud the insistence of the Secretary of 
State on the importance of historical analogies, the Munich 
analogy, for example.As Munich showed, a powerful and ag¬ 
gressive nation with a fanatic belief in its manifest destiny will 
regard each victory, each extension of its power and authority, 
as a prelude to the next step.The matter was very well put by 
Adlai Stevenson, when he spoke of “the old, old route whereby 
expansive powers push at more and more doors, believing they 
will open, until, at the ultimate door, resistance is unavoidable 
and major war breaks out.” Herein lies the danger of appease¬ 
ment, as the Chinese tirelessly point out to the Soviet Union, 
which they claim is playing Chamberlain to our Hitler in Viet¬ 
nam.Of course, the aggressiveness of liberal imperialism is not 
that of Nazi Germany, though the distinction may seem rather 
academic to a Vietnamese peasant who is being gassed or in¬ 
cinerated.
