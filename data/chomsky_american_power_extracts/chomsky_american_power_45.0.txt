torians often reveal a strong distaste for “the forces of a popular 
movement” and “the spirit of the militia.” And an argument can 
be given that they correspondingly fail to comprehend the “po¬ 
litical factor.” 

In the May Days of 1937, the revolution in Catalonia re¬ 
ceived the final blow. On May 3, the councilor for public order, 
PSUC member Rodriguez Salas, appeared at the central tele¬ 
phone building with a detachment of police, without prior 
warning or consultation with the anarchist ministers in the 
government, to take over the telephone exchange. The ex-

change, formerly the property of IT&T, had been captured by 
Barcelona workers in July and had since functioned under the 
control of a UGT-CNT committee, with a governmental dele¬ 
gate, quite in accord with the collectivization decree of October 
24, 1936. According to the London Daily Worker (May 11, 
1937), “Salas sent the armed republican police to disarm the 
employees there, most of them members of the CNT unions.” 
The motive, according to Juan Comorera, was “to put a stop to 
an abnormal situation,” namely, that no one could speak over 
the telephone “without the indiscreet ear of the controller 
knowing it.” 93 Armed resistance in the telephone building pre¬ 
vented its occupation. Local defense committees erected barri¬ 
cades throughout Barcelona. Companys and the anarchist leaders 
pleaded with the workers to disarm. An uneasy truce con¬ 
tinued until May 6, when the first detachments of Assault 
Guards arrived, violating the promises of the government that 
the truce would be observed and military forces withdrawn. 
The troops were under the command of General Pozas, for¬ 
merly commander of the hated Civil Guard and now a member 
of the "Communist party. In the fighting that followed, there 
were some five hundred killed and over a thousand wounded. 
“The May Days in reality sounded the death-knell of the revo¬ 
lution, announcing political defeat for all and death for certain 
of the revolutionary leaders.” 94 

These events—of enormous significance in the history of the 
Spanish revolution—Jackson sketches in bare outline as a mar¬ 
ginal incident. Obviously the historian's account must be selec¬ 
tive ; from the left-liberal point of view that Jackson shares with 
Hugh Thomas and many others, the liquidation of the revolu¬ 
tion in Catalonia was a minor event, as the revolution itself was
