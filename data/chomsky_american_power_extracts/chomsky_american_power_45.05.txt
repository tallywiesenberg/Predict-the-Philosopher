what form of government a country has as long as it remains an 
“open society,” in our peculiar sense of this term—a society, 
that is, which remains open to American economic penetration 
or political control.If it is necessary to approach genocide in 
Vietnam to achieve this objective, then this is the price we must 
pay in defense of freedom and the rights of man.It is, no doubt, superfluous to discuss at length the ways in 
which we assist other countries to progress towards open socie¬ 
ties “to which our access is free and comfortable.” One enlight¬

know-how rather than foreign corporations.
