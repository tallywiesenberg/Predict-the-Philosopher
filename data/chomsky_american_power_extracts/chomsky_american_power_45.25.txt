.Much of what is happening now is a result of steady pressure 
from the United States and the International Bank for Recon¬ 
struction and Development, which for the last year have been 
urging a substantial freeing of the Indian economy and a greater 
scope for private enterprise.The United States pressure, in par¬ 
ticular, has been highly effective here because the United States 
provides by far the largest part of the foreign exchange needed to 
finance India’s development and keep the wheels of industry turn¬ 
ing.Call them “strings,” call them “conditions” or whatever one 
likes, India has little choice now but to agree to many of the 
terms that the United States, through the World Bank, is putting 
on its aid.For India simply has nowhere else to turn.
