open society, one which, in Walt Rostow’s words, has a proper 
understanding of “the core of the American ideology,” namely, 
“the sanctity of the individual in relation to the state.” And in 
this way, too, w T e refute the simpleminded view of those Asians 
w T ho, to continue with Rostow’s phrasing, “believe or half- 
believe that the West has been driven to create and then to 
cling to its imperial holdings by the inevitable workings of capi¬

In fact, a major postwar scandal is developing in India as the 
United States, cynically capitalizing on India’s current torture,

socialism to pragmatism.”

towards open societies, with no thought of territorial aggran¬ 
dizement, we are breaking no new ground.
