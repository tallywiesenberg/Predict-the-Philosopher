Even in 1937, the Japanese gov¬ 
ernment had “no territorial designs upon China.” In short, we 
follow a well-trodden path.It is useful to remember, incidentally, that the United States 
was apparently quite willing, as late as 1939, to negotiate a 
commercial treaty with Japan and arrive at a modus vivendi if 
Japan would “change her attitude and practice towards our 
rights and interests in China,” as Secretary Hull put it.The 
bombing of Chungking and the rape of Nanking were rather 
unpleasant, it is true, but what was really important was our 
rights and interests in China, as the responsible, unhysterical 
men of the day saw quite clearly.It was the closing of the Open 
Door by Japan that led inevitably to the Pacific war, just as it is 
the closing of the Open Door by “Communist” China itself that 
may very well lead to the next, and no doubt last, Pacific war.Quite often, the statements of sincere and devoted technical 
experts give surprising insight into the intellectual attitudes that 
lie in the background of the latest savagery.
