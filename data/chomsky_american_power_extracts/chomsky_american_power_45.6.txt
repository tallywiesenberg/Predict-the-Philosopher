See also Theodore Draper, “How Not To 
Negotiate,” New York Review of Books , May 4, 1967.There is fur¬ 
ther documentary evidence of NLF attempts to establish a coalition 
government and to neutralize the area, all rejected by the United 
States and its Saigon ally, in Douglas Pike, Viet Cong (Cambridge, 
Mass., The M.I.T.Press, 1966).In reading material of this latter sort 
one must be especially careful to distinguish between the evidence 
presented and the “conclusions” that are asserted, for reasons noted 
briefly below (see note 33).It is interesting to see the first, somewhat oblique published reac¬ 
tions to The Politics of Escalation by those who defend our right to 
conquer South Vietnam and institute a government of our choice.
