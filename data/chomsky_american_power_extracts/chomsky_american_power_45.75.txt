At other times, Schlesinger does indeed display admirable scholarly 
caution.For example, in his introduction to The Politics of Escalation 
he admits that there may have been “flickers of interest in negotia¬ 
tions” on the part of Hanoi.As to the administration’s lies about 
negotiations and its repeated actions undercutting tentative initiatives 
towards negotiations, he comments only that the authors may have 
underestimated military necessity and that future historians may prove 
them wrong.This caution and detachment must be compared with 
Schlesinger’s attitude towards renewed study of the origins of the Cold 
War: in a letter to the New York Review of Books, October 20, 1966, 
he remarks that it is time to “blow the whistle” on revisionist attempts 
to show that the Cold War may have been the consequence of some¬ 
thing more than mere Communist belligerence.We are to believe, 
then, that the relatively straightforward matter of the origins of the 
Cold War is settled beyond discussion, whereas the much more com¬ 
plex issue of why the United States shies away from a negotiated 
settlement in Vietnam must be left to future historians to ponder.
