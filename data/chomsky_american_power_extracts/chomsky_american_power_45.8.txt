It is useful to bear in mind that the United States government itself 
is on occasion much less diffident in explaining why it refuses to 
contemplate a meaningful negotiated settlement.As is freely admitted, 
this solution would leave it without power to control the situation.See, 
for example, note 37.6.Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in 
the White House (Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1965), p. 
421.
