Jean Lacouture, Vietmm: Between Two Truces (New York, 
Random House, 1966), p. 21.Diem’s analysis of the situation was 
shared by Western observers at the time.See, for example, the com¬ 
ments of William Henderson, Far Eastern specialist and executive, 
Council on Foreign Relations, in Richard W. Lindholm, ed., Vietnam: 
The First Five Years (East Lansing, Michigan State University Press, 
1959).He notes “the growing alienation of the intelligentsia,” “the 
renewal of armed dissidence in the South,” the fact that “security has 
noticeably deteriorated in the last two years,” all as a result of Diem’s 
“grim dictatorship,” and predicts “a steady worsening of the political 
climate in free Vietnam, culminating in unforeseen disasters.”
