(See pages 104-5 below.) 

The contrast reveals a good deal about the nature of the war, 
as it was understood by the Valencia government. Later, Orwell 
was to make this conclusion explicit: “A government which 
sends boys of fifteen to the front with rifles forty years old and 
keeps its biggest men and newest weapons in the rear is mani¬ 
festly more afraid of the revolution than of the fascists. Hence 
the feeble war policy of the past six months, and hence the 
compromise with which the war will almost certainly end.” 99 
Jackson’s account of these events, with its omissions and assump¬ 
tions, suggests that he perhaps shares the view that the greatest 
danger in Spain would have been a victory of the revolution. 

Jackson apparently discounts Orwell’s testimony, to some ex¬ 
tent, commenting that “the readers should bear in mind Or¬ 
well’s own honest statement that he knew very little about the 
political complexities of the struggle.” This is a strange com¬ 
ment. For one thing, Orwell’s analysis of the “political complex¬ 
ities of the struggle” bears up rather well after thirty years; if it 
is defective, it is probably in his tendency to give too much 
prominence to the POUM in comparison with the anarchists— 
not surprising, in view of the fact that he was with the POUM 
militia. His exposure of the fatuous nonsense that was appear¬ 
ing at the time in the Stalinist and liberal presses appears quite 
accurate, and later discoveries have given little reason to chal¬ 
lenge the basic facts that he reported or the interpretation that 
he proposed in the heat of the conflict. Orwell does, in fact, refer 
to his own “political ignorance.” Commenting on the final de¬ 
feat of the revolution in May, he states: “I realized—though 
owing to my political ignorance, not so clearly as I ought to have 
done—that when the Government felt more sure of itself there 
would be reprisals.” But this form of “political ignorance” has

Shortly after the May Days, the Caballero government fell 
and Juan Negrin became premier of Republican Spain. Negrin 
is described as follows, by Broue and Temime: “. . . he is an 
unconditional defender of capitalist property and resolute ad¬
