Some of George Kennan’s recent statements provide interest¬ 
ing commentary on this matter, for example, his comments on the 
falsity, from the outset, of the assumption that the USSR intended to

attack or intimidate by force the Western half of the continent and 
that it was deterred by American force, and his remarks on the ster¬ 
ility and general absurdity of the demand for unilateral Soviet with¬ 
drawal from East Germany together with “the inclusion of a united 
Germany as a major component in a Western defense system based 
primarily on nuclear weaponry” (Edward Reed, ed., Peace on Earth 
[New York, Pocket Books, 1965]).It is worth noting that historical fantasy of the sort illustrated in 
Rostow’s remarks has become a regular State Department specialty.Thus we have Thomas Mann justifying our Dominican intervention as 
a response to actions of the “Sino-Soviet military bloc.” Or, to take a 
more considered statement, we have William Bundy’s analysis of 
stages of development of Communist ideology in his Pomona College 
address, February 12, 1966, in which he characterizes the Soviet 
Union in the 1920s and early 1930s as “in a highly militant and 
aggressive phase.” What is frightening about fantasy, as distinct from 
outright falsification, is the possibility that it may be sincere and may 
actually serve as the basis for formation of policy.14.New York Times, February 6, 1966.
