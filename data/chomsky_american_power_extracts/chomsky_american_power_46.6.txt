369-75.I have no intention here of entering into 
the full range of issues that have been raised in the discussion of the 
“end of ideology” for the past dozen years.It is difficult to see how a 
rational person could quarrel with many of the theses that have been 
put forth, e.g., that at a certain historical moment the “politics of 
civility” is appropriate, and perhaps efficacious; that one who advo¬ 
cates action (or inaction—a matter less frequently noted) has a re¬ 
sponsibility to assess its social cost; that dogmatic fanaticism and 
“secular religions” should be combated (or if possible ignored); that 
technical solutions to problems should be implemented, where possi¬ 
ble; that “le dogmatisme ideologique devait disparaitre pour que les 
idees reprissent vie” (Aron); and so on.Since this is sometimes taken to 
be an expression of an “anti-Marxist” position, it is worth keeping in 
mind that such sentiments as these have no bearing on non-Bolshevik 
Marxism, as represented, for example, by such figures as Luxemburg, 
Pannekoek, Korsch, Arthur Rosenberg, and many others.27.
