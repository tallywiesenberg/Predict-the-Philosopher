Tibet was swallowed, India attacked, the Malays had to fight 12 
years to resist a ‘national liberation’ they could receive from the Brit¬ 
ish by a more peaceful route.Today, the apparatus of infiltration and 
aggression is already at work in North Thailand.” 

As to Malaya, Stevenson is probably confusing ethnic Chinese with 
the government of China.Those concerned with the actual events 
would agree with Harry Miller, in Communist Menace in Malaya 
(New York, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1954), p. 230, that “Com¬ 
munist China continues to show little interest in the Malayan affair 
beyond its usual fulminations via Peking Radio.” There are various 
harsh things that one might say about Chinese behavior in w T hat the 
Sino-Indian Treaty of 1954 refers to as “the Tibet region of China,” 
but it is no more proof of a tendency towards expansionism than is the 
behavior of the Indian government with regard to the Naga and Mizo 
tribesmen.As to North Thailand, “the apparatus of infiltration” may 
well be at work, though there is little reason to suppose it to be 
Chinese—and it is surely not unrelated to the American use of 
Thailand as a base for its attack on Vietnam.This reference is the 
sheerest hypocrisy.
