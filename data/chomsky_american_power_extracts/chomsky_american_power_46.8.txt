The “attack on India” grew out of a border dispute that began 
several years after the Chinese had completed a road from Tibet to 
Sinkiang in an area so remote from Indian control that the Indians 
learned about this operation only from the Chinese press.According 
to American Air Force maps, the disputed area is in Chinese territory.Cf.Alastair Lamb, China Quarterly, No.23 (July-September 1965), pp.
