About these events, Jackson has the following comments: 

On August 11 the government announced the dissolution of the 
Consejo de Aragon , the anarchist-dominated administration which 
had been recognized by Largo Caballero in December, 1936. The 
peasants were known to hate the Consejo, the anarchists had de¬ 
serted the front during the Barcelona fighting, and the very exist¬ 
ence of the Consejo was a standing challenge to the authority of 
the central government. For all these reasons Negrin did not 
hesitate to send in troops, and to arrest the anarchist officials. 
Once their authority had been broken, however, they were re¬ 
leased. 101 

These remarks are most interesting. Consider first the charge 
that the anarchists had deserted the front during the May Days. 
It is true that elements of certain anarchist and POUM divisions 
were prepared to march on Barcelona, but after the “fragile 
truce” was established on May 5, they did not do so; no anar¬ 
chist forces even approached Barcelona to defend the Barcelona 
proletariat and its institutions from attack. However, a motor¬ 
ized column of 5,000 Assault Guards was sent from the front by 
the government to break the “fragile truce.” 102 Hence the only 
forces to “desert the front” during the Barcelona fighting were

those dispatched by the government to complete the job of 
dismantling the revolution, by force. Recall Orwell’s observa¬ 
tions quoted above, pages 101-2. 

What about Jackson’s statement that “the peasants were 
known to hate the Consejo”? As in the other cases I have cited, 
Jackson gives no indication of any evidence on which such 
a judgment might be based. The most detailed investigation 
of the collectives is from anarchist sources, and they indicate 
that Aragon was one of the areas where collectivization was 
most widespread and successful. 103 Both the CNT and the 
UGT Land Workers’ Federation were vigorous in their support 
for collectivization, and there is no doubt that both were mass 
organizations. A number of nonanarchists, observing collecti¬ 
vization in Aragon firsthand, gave very favorable reports and 
stressed the voluntary character of collectivization. 104 Accord¬ 
ing to Gaston Leval, an anarchist observer who carried out 
detailed investigation of rural collectivization, “in Aragon 75
