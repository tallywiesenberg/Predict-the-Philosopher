.around the world because they reflect 
inadequate living standards or oppressive and corrupt governments,” 
and the backers of “revolutionary guerrilla warfare,” which “opposes 
the aspirations of people while apparently furthering them, manipu¬ 
lates the individual by persuading him to manipulate himself.” Revo¬ 
lutionary guerrilla warfare is “an imported product, revolution from 
the outside” (other examples besides the Vietcong are “Stalin’s ex¬ 
portation of armed revolution,” the Haganah in Palestine, and the 
Irish Republican Army—see pp.32-33).The Vietcong could not be an 
indigenous movement since it has “a social construction program of 
such scope and ambition that of necessity it must have been created in 
Hanoi” (p. 76—but on pp.77-79 we read that “organizational activity 
had gone on intensively and systematically for several years” before 
the Lao Dong party in Hanoi had made its decision “to begin building 
an organization”).
