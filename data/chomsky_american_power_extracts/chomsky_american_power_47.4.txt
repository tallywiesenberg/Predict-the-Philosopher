The demonstrations referred to took 
place at the Justice Department and the Pentagon, on the weekend of October 
19-21, 1967.The draft card turn-in at the Justice Department was one of the 
events that led to the sentencing of Dr. Benjamin Spock, Rev.William Sloane 
Coffin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber to two-year prison sentences for 
“conspiracy.” For details, see Noam Chomsky, Paul Lauter, and Florence 
Howe, “Reflections on a Political Trial,” New York Review of Books, August 
22, 1968, pp.23-30.The Pentagon demonstration, which by some estimates in¬ 
volved several hundred thousand people, was a remarkable, unforgettable 
manifestation of opposition to the war.
