*— AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

For many of the participants, the Washington demonstrations 
symbolized the transition “from dissent to resistance.” I will 
return to this slogan and its meaning, but I want to make clear 
at the outset that I do feel it to be not only accurate with 
respect to the mood of the demonstrations but, properly inter¬ 
preted, appropriate to the present state of protest against the 
war.There is an irresistible dynamics to such protest.One may 
begin by writing articles and giving speeches about the war, by 
helping in many ways to create an atmosphere of concern and 
outrage.A courageous few will turn to direct action, refusing to 
take their place alongside the “good Germans” we have all 
learned to despise.
