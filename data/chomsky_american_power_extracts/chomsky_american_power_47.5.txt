Some will be forced to this decision when 
they are called up for military service.The dissenting senators, 
writers, and professors will watch as young men refuse to serve 
in the armed forces, in a war that they detest.What then ?Can 
those who write and speak against the war take refuge in the 
fact that they have not urged or encouraged draft resistance, 
but have merely helped to develop a climate of opinion in 
which any decent person will want to refuse to take part in a 
miserable war ?It is a very thin line.
