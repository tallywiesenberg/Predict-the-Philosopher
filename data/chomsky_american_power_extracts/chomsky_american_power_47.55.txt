Nor is it very easy to watch 
from a position of safety while others are forced to take a grim 
and painful step.The fact is that most of the one thousand draft 
cards and other documents turned in to the Justice Department 
on October 20 came from men who can escape military service 
but who insisted on sharing the fate of those who are less priviÂ¬ 
leged.In such ways the circle of resistance widens.Quite apart 
from this, no one can fail to see that to the extent that he restricts 
his protest, to the extent that he rejects actions that are open to 
him, he accepts complicity in what the government does.Some 
will act on this realization, posing sharply a moral issue that no 
person of conscience can evade.
