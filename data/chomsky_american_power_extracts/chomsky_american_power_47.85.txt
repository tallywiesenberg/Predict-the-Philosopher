Perhaps this is merely a personal reaction, but 
when I look at what is happening to our country, what I find 
most terrifying is not Curtis LeMay, with his cheerful sugges¬ 
tion that we bomb our “enemies” back into the Stone Age, but 
rather the calm disquisitions of the political scientists on just 
how much force will be necessary to achieve our ends, or just 
what form of government will be acceptable to us in Vietnam.What I find terrifying is the detachment and equanimity with 
which we view and discuss an unbearable tragedy.We all know 
that if Russia or China were guilty of what we have done in 
Vietnam, we would be exploding with moral indignation at 
these monstrous crimes.There was, I think, a serious miscalculation in the planning of 
the Washington demonstrations.It was expected that the march 
to the Pentagon would be followed by a number of speeches, 
and that those who were committed to civil disobedience would 
then separate themselves from the crowd and go to the Penta¬ 
gon, a few hundred yards away across an open field.
