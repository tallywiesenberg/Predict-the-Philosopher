A few thousand people 
gathered for the speeches, but the mass of marchers went 
straight on to the Pentagon, some because they were committed 
to direct action, many because they were simply swept along.From the speakers’ platform where I stood it was difficult to 
determine just what was taking place at the Pentagon.All we 
could see was the surging of the crowd.From secondhand re¬ 
ports, I understand that the marchers passed through and 
around the front line of troops and took up a position, which 
they maintained, on the steps of the Pentagon.It soon became 
obvious that it was wrong for the few organizers of the march 
and the mostly middle-aged group that had gathered near them 
to remain at the speakers’ platform while the demonstrators 
themselves, most of them quite young, were at the Pentagon.
