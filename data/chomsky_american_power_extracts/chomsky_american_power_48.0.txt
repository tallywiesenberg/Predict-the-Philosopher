(I 
recall seeing near the platform Robert Lowell, Dwight Mac¬ 
donald, Monsignor Rice, Sidney Lens, Benjamin Spock and his 
wife, Dagmar Wilson, Donald Kalish.)Dave Dellinger sug¬ 
gested that we try to approach the Pentagon.We found a place 
not yet blocked by the demonstrators, and walked up to the line 
of troops standing a few feet from the building.Dellinger sug¬ 
gested that those of us who had not yet spoken at the rally talk 
directly to the soldiers through a small portable sound system.From this point on, my impressions are rather fragmentary.
