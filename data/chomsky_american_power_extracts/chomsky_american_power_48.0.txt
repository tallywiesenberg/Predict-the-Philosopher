Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


1937 sheds considerable light on the question of peasant atti¬ 
tudes towards collectivization in Aragon: 

It was inevitable that the attacks on the collectives should have 
had an unfavorable effect upon rural economy and upon morale, 
for while it is true that in some areas collectivization was 
anathema to the majority of peasants, it is no less true that in 
others collective farms were organized spontaneously by the bulk 
of the peasant population. In Toledo province, for example, 
where even before the war rural collectives existed, 83 per cent of 
the peasants, according to a source friendly to the Communists, 
decided in favour of the collective cultivation of the soil. As the 
campaign against the collective farms reached its height just be¬ 
fore the summer harvest [1937] . . . a pall of dismay and ap¬ 
prehension descended upon the agricultural labourers. Work in 
the fields "was abandoned in many places or only carried on 
apathetically, and there was danger that a substantial portion of 
the harvest, vital for the war effort, would be left to rot. [P. 196] 

It was under these circumstances, he points out, that the 
Communists were forced to change their policy and—tempo¬ 
rarily—to tolerate the collectives. A decree was passed legaliz¬ 
ing collectives “during the current agricultural year” (his ital¬ 
ics) and offering them some aid. This “produced a sense of 
relief in the countryside during the vital period of the harvest.” 
Immediately after the crops had been gathered, the policy 
changed again to one of harsh repression. Bolloten cites Com¬ 
munist sources to the effect that “a short though fierce cam¬ 
paign at the beginning of August” prepared the way for the 
dissolution of the Council of Aragon. Following the dissolution 
decree, “the newly appointed Governor General, Jose Ignacio 
Mantecon, a member of the Left Republican Party, but a secret 
Communist sympathizer [who joined the party in exile, after 
the war], . . . ordered the break-up of the collective farms.” The 
means: Lister’s division, which restored the old order by force
