Those of us who had 
been left behind the line of soldiers regrouped, and Dr. Spock 
began to speak.Almost at once, another line of soldiers 
emerged from somewhere, this time in a tightly massed forma¬ 
tion, rifles in hand, and moved slowly forward.We sat down.As I mentioned earlier, I had no intention of taking part in any 
act of civil disobedience, until that moment.But when that 
grotesque organism began slowly advancing—more grotesque 
because its cells were recognizable human beings—it became 
obvious that one could not permit that thing to dictate what 
one was going to do.
