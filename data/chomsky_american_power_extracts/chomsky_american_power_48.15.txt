I was arrested at that point by a federal 
marshal, presumably for obstructing the soldiers (the technical 
term for this behavior is “disorderly conduct”) I should add 
that the soldiers, so far as I could see (which was not very far), 
seemed rather unhappy about the whole matter, and were 
being about as gentle as one can be when ordered (I presume 
this was the order) to kick and club passive, quiet people who 
refuse to move.The federal marshals, predictably, were very 
different.They reminded me of the police officers I had seen in 
a Jackson, Mississippi, jail several summers ago, who had 
laughed when an old man showed us a bloody homemade ban¬ 
dage on his leg and tried to describe to us how he had been 
beaten by the police.In Washington, the ones who got the 
worst of it at the hands of the marshals were the young boys 
and girls, particularly boys with long hair.Nothing seemed to 
bring out the marshals’ sadism more than the sight of a boy 
with long hair.
