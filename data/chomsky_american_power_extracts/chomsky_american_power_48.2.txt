by the marshals, their behavior largely seemed to range from 
indifference to petty nastiness.For example, we were kept in a 
police van for an hour or two with the doors closed and only a 
few air holes for ventilation—one can’t be too careful with such 
ferocious criminal types.In the prison dormitory and after my release I heard many 
stories, which I feel sure are authentic, of the courage of the 
young people, many of whom were quite frightened by the 
terrorism that began late at night after the TV cameramen and 
most of the press had left.They sat quietly hour after hour 
through the cold night; many were kicked and beaten and 
dragged across police lines (more “disorderly conduct”).I also 
heard stories, distressing ones, of provocation of the troops by the 
demonstrators—usually, it seems, those who were not in the front 
rows.
