Surely this was indefensible.Soldiers are unwitting instru¬ 
ments of terror; one does not blame or attack the club that is 
used to bludgeon someone to death.They are also human beings, 
with sensibilities to which one can perhaps appeal.There is in 
fact strong evidence that one soldier, perhaps three or four, re¬ 
fused to obey orders and was placed under arrest.The soldiers, 
after all, are in much the same position as the draft resisters.
