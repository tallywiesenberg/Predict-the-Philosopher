Perhaps a program of 
principled, nonviolent resistance can do the same for many 
others, in the particular circumstances that we face today.It is 
not impossible that this may save the country from a terrible 
future, from yet another generation of men who think it clever 
to discuss the bombing of North Vietnam as a question of tac¬ 
tics and cost-effectiveness, or who support our attempt to con¬ 
quer South Vietnam, with the human cost that they well know, 
blandly asserting that “our primary motivation is self-interest— 
the self-interest of our own country in this shrinking world” 
(Citizens Committee for Peace with Freedom, New York 
Times , October 26, 1967).Returning to the demonstrations, I must admit that I was 
relieved to find people whom I had respected for years in the 
prison dormitory—Norman Mailer, Jim Peck, Dave Dellinger, 
and a number of others.I think it was reassuring to many of the 
kids who were there to be able to feel that they were not totally 
disconnected from a world that they knew and from people 
whom they admired.It was moving to see that defenseless 
young people who had a great deal to lose w r ere willing to be 
jailed for what they believed—young instructors from state uni¬ 
versities, college kids who have a very bright future if they are 
willing to toe the line, many others whom I could not identify.
