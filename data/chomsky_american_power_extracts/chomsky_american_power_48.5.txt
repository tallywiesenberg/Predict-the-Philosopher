In my experi¬ 
ence, it has often been those committed to resistance who have 
been most deeply involved in such attempts at persuasion.Put¬ 
ting aside the matter of resistance for a moment, I think it 
should be emphasized that the days of “patiently explain” are 
far from over.As the coffins come home and the taxes go up, 
many people who were previously willing to accept government 
propaganda will become increasingly concerned to try to think 
for themselves.The reasons for their change are unfortunate; 
the opportunities for educational activity are nevertheless very 
good.Furthermore, the recent shift in the government’s propa¬ 
ganda line offers important opportunities for critical analysis of 
the war.
