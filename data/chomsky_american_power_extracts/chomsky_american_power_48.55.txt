There is a note of shrill desperation in the recent 
defense of the American war in Vietnam.We hear less about 
“bringing freedom and democracy” to the South Vietnamese 
and more about the “national interest.” Secretary Rusk broods 
about the dangers posed to us by a billion Chinese; the Vice- 
President tells us that we are fighting “militant Asian Commu¬ 
nism” with “its headquarters in Peking” and adds that a Viet- 
cong victory would directly threaten the United States; Eugene 
Rostow argues that “it is no good building model cities if they 
are to be bombed in twenty years time,” and so on (all of this 
“a frivolous insult to the United States Navy,” as Walter Lipp- 
mann rightly commented).376 



On Resistance 


This shift in propaganda makes it much easier for critical 
analysis to attack the problem of Vietnam at its core, which is in 
Washington and Boston, not in Saigon and Hanoi.There is 
something ludicrous, after all, in the close attention that oppo¬ 
nents of the war give to the political and social problems of 
Vietnam.Those who were opposed to the Japanese conquest of 
Manchuria a generation ago did not place emphasis on the 
political and social and economic problems of Manchuria, but 
on those of Japan.
