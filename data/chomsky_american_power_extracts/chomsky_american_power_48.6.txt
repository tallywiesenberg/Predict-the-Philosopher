They did not engage in farcical debate over 
the exact degree of support for the puppet emperor, but looked 
to the sources of Japanese imperialism.Now opponents of the 
war can much more easily shift attention to the source of the 
aggression, to our own country, its ideology and institutions.We can ask whose “interest” is served by 100,000 casualties and 
100 billion dollars expended in the attempt to subjugate a small 
country halfway around the world.We can point to the absur¬ 
dity of the idea that we are “containing China” by destroying 
popular and independent forces on its borders, and to the cyni¬ 
cism of the claim that we are in Vietnam because “to Ameri¬ 
cans, peace and freedom are inseparable” and because “sup¬ 
pression of freedom” must not “go unchallenged” (the Citizens 
Committee again).We can ask why it is that those who make 
this claim do not suggest that an American expeditionary force 
be sent to Taiwan, to Rhodesia, to Greece, or to Mississippi, but 
only to Vietnam, where, they want us to believe, the master 
aggressor Mao Tse-tung is following a Hitlerian course in his 
cunning way, committing aggression without troops and an¬ 
nouncing world conquest by insisting, through the medium of 
Lin Piao, that indigenous wars of national liberation can expect 
little from China beyond applause.
