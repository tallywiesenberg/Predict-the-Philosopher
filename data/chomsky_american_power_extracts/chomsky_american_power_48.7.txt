We can ask what factors in American ideology 
make it so easy for intelligent and well-informed men to say that 
we “insist upon nothing for South Vietnam except that it be free 
to chart its own future” (Citizens Committee) although they 
know quite well that the regime we imposed excluded all those 
who took part in the struggle against French colonialism, “and 
properly so” (Secretary Rusk, 1963) ; that we have since been 
attempting to suppress a “civil insurrection” (General Stillwell) 
led by the only “truly mass-based political party in South Viet¬ 
nam” (Douglas Pike); that we supervised the destruction of the 
Buddhist opposition; that we offered the peasants a “free 
choice” between the Saigon government and the National Lib¬ 
eration Front by herding them into strategic hamlets from 
which NLF cadres and sympathizers were eliminated by the 
police (Roger Hilsman); and so on.The story is familiar.And 
we can emphasize what must be obvious to a person with a 
grain of political intelligence: that the present world problem is 
not “containing China” but containing the United States.More important, we can ask the really fundamental question.Suppose that it were in the American “national interest” to 
pound into rubble a small nation that refuses to submit to our 
will.
