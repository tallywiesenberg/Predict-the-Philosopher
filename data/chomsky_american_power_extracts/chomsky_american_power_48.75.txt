Would it then be legitimate and proper for us to act “in 
this national interest”?The Rusks and the Humphreys and the 
Citizens Committee say yes.Nothing could show more clearly 
how we are taking the road of the fascist aggressors of a gen¬ 
eration ago.We are, of course, in a domestic political environment very 
different from that of the citizens of Germany or Japan.Here, it 
takes no heroism to protest.
