On Resistance 


to drive home the lesson that there is not one law for the United 
States and one for the rest of mankind, that no one has ap¬ 
pointed us judge and executioner for Vietnam or anywhere else.Many avenues of political education, on and off the campus, 
have been explored in the past two years.There can be no ques¬ 
tion that this effort should continue and grow to whatever limit 
the degree of commitment permits.Some seem to feel that resistance will “blacken” the peace 
movement and make it difficult to reach potential sympathizers 
through more familiar channels.I don’t agree with this objec¬ 
tion, but I feel that it should not be lightly disregarded.
