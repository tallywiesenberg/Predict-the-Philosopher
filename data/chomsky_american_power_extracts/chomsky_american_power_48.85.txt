Resis¬ 
ters who hope to save the people of Vietnam from destruction 
must select the issues they confront and the means they employ 
in such a way as to attract as much popular support as possible 
for their efforts.There is no lack of clear issues and honorable 
means, surely, hence no reason why one should be impelled to 
ugly actions on ambiguous issues.In particular, it seems to me 
that draft resistance, properly conducted (as it has been so 
far), is not only a highly principled and courageous act, but one 
that might receive broad support and become politically effec¬ 
tive.It might, furthermore, succeed in raising the issues of pas¬ 
sive complicity in the war which are now much too easily 
evaded.Those who face these issues may even go on to free 
themselves from the mind-destroying ideological pressures of 
American life, and to ask some serious questions about Amer- 
ca’s role in the world, and the sources, in American society, for 
this criminal behavior.
