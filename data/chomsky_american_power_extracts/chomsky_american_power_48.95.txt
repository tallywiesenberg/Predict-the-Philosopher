This is the question of the 
forms resistance should take.We all take part in the war to a 
greater or lesser extent, if only by paying taxes and permitting 
domestic society to function smoothly.A person has to choose 
for himself the point at which he will simply refuse to take part 
any longer.Reaching that point, he will be drawn into resist¬ 
ance.I believe that the reasons for resistance I have already 
mentioned are cogent ones: they have an irreducible moral ele¬ 
ment that admits of little discussion.
