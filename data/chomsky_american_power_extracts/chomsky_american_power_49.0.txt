rather for the failure of objectivity when he deals with the 
revolution and the ensuing repression. 

Among historians of the Spanish Civil War, the dominant 
view is that the Communist policy was in essentials the correct 
one—that in order to consolidate domestic and international 
support for the Republic it was necessary to block and then 
reverse the social revolution. Jackson, for example, states that 
Caballero “realized that it was absolutely necessary to rebuild 
the authority of the Republican state and to work in close co¬ 
operation with the middle-class liberals.” The anarchist leaders 
who entered the government shared this view, putting their 
trust in the good faith of liberals such as Companys and believ¬ 
ing—naively, as events were to show—that the Western democ¬ 
racies would come to their aid. 

A policy diametrically opposed to this was advocated by 
Camillo Berneri. In his open letter to the anarchist minister 
Federica Montseny 109 he summarizes his views in the follow¬ 
ing way: “The dilemma, war or revolution, no longer has mean¬ 
ing. The only dilemma is this: either victory over Franco 
through revolutionary war , or defeat” (his italics). He argued 
that Morocco should be granted independence and that an at¬ 
tempt should be made to stir up rebellion throughout North 
Africa. Thus a revolutionary struggle should be undertaken 
against Western capitalism in North Africa and, simultaneously, 
against the bourgeois regime in Spain, which was gradually 
dismantling the accomplishments of the July revolution. The 
primary front should be political. Franco relied heavily on 
Moorish contingents, including a substantial number from 
French Morocco. The Republic might exploit this fact, de¬ 
moralizing the Nationalist forces and perhaps even winning 
them to the revolutionary cause by political agitation based on

the concrete alternative of pan-Islamic—specifically, Moroc¬ 
can—revolution. Writing in April 1937, Berneri urged that the 
army of the Republic be reorganized for the defense of the 
revolution, so that it might recover the spirit of popular partici¬ 
pation of the early days of the revolution. He quotes the words 
of his compatriot Louis Bertoni, writing from the Huesca front: 

The Spanish war, deprived of all new faith, of any idea of a social 
transformation, of all revolutionary grandeur, of any universal
