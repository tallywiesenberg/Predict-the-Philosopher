The issue is posed in its 
starkest form for the boy who faces induction, and in a form 
that is somewhat more complex for the boy who must decide 
whether to participate in a system of selective service that may 
pass the burden from him to others less fortunate and less privi¬ 
leged.It is difficult for me to see how anyone can refuse to 
engage himself, in some way, in the plight of these young men.There are many ways to do so: legal aid and financial support; 
participation in support demonstrations; draft counseling, or¬ 
ganization of draft-resistance unions or community-based re¬ 
sistance organizations; assisting those who wish to escape the 
country; the steps proposed by the clergymen who recently 
announced that they are ready to share the fate of those who 
will be sent to prison.About this aspect of the program of 
resistance I have nothing to say that will not be obvious to 
anyone who is willing to think the matter through.Considered as a political tactic, resistance requires careful 
thought, and I do not pretend to have very clear ideas about it.
