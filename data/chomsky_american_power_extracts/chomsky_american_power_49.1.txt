The first is American withdrawal, in whatever 
terms it would be couched.It might be disguised as a retreat to 
“enclaves/’ from which the troops could then be removed.It 
might be arranged by an international conference, or by per¬ 
mitting a government in Saigon that would seek peace among 
contending South Vietnamese and then ask us to leave.This 
policy might be politically feasible; the same public relations 
firm that invented terms like “revolutionary development” can 
depict withdrawal as victory.Whether there is anyone in the 
executive branch with the courage or imagination to urge this 
course, I do not know.
