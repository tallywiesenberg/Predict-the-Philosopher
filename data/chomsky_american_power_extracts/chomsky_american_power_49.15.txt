A number of senators are proposing, in 
essence, that this is the course we should pursue, as are such 
critics of the war as Walter Lippmann and Hans Morgenthau, 
if I understand them correctly.A detailed and quite sensible 
plan for arranging withdrawal along with new, more meaning¬ 
ful elections in the South is outlined by Philippe Devillers in Le 
Monde hebdomadaire of October 26, 1967.Variants can easily 
be imagined.What is central is the decision to accept the prin¬ 
ciple of Geneva that the problems of Vietnam be settled by the 
Vietnamese.A second possibility would be annihilation.
