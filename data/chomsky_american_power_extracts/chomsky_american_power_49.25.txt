This 
would saddle us with two unwinnable guerrilla wars instead of 
one, but if the timing is right, it might be used as a device to 
rally the citizenry around the flag.A fourth possibility is an attack on China.We could then 
abandon Vietnam and turn to a winnable war directed against 
Chinese industrial capacity.Such a move should win the 
election.No doubt this prospect also appeals to that insane 
rationality called “strategic thinking/’ If we intend to keep 
armies of occupation or even strong military bases on the Asian 
mainland, we would do well to make sure that the Chinese do 
not have the means to threaten them.
