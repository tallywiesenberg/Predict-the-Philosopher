Of course, there is the 
danger of a nuclear holocaust, but it is difficult to see why this 
should trouble those whom John McDermott calls the “crisis 
managers,” the same men who were willing, in 1962, to accept a 
high probability of nuclear war to establish the principle that 
we, and we alone, have the right to keep missiles on the borders 
of a potential enemy.There are many who regard “negotiations” as a realistic alter¬ 
native, but I do not understand the logic or even the content of 
this proposal.If we stop bombing North Vietnam we might 
well enter into negotiations with Hanoi, but there would then 
be very little to discuss.As to South Vietnam, the only negotia¬ 
ble issue is the withdrawal of foreign troops; other matters can 
only be settled among whatever Vietnamese groups have sur¬ 
vived the American onslaught.The call for “negotiations” 
seems to me not only empty, but actually a trap for those who 
oppose the war.
