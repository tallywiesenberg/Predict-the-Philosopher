There is 
no basis for supposing that those who will make the major 
policy decisions are open to reason on the fundamental issues, 
in particular the issue of whether we, alone among the nations 
of the world, have the authority and the competence to deter¬ 
mine the social and political institutions of Vietnam.What is 
more, there is little likelihood that the electoral process will 
bear on the major decisions.As I have pointed out, the issue may 
be settled before the next election.Even if it is not, it is hardly 
likely that a serious choice will be offered at the polls.And if by 
a miracle such a choice is offered, how seriously can we take 
the campaign promises of a “peace candidate” after the experi¬ 
ence of 1964?
