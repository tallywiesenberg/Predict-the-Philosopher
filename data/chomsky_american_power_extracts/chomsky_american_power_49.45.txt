Given the enormous dangers of escalation and its 
hateful character, it makes sense, in such a situation, to search 
for ways to raise the domestic cost of American aggression, to 
raise it to a point where it cannot be overlooked by those who 
have to calculate such costs.One must then consider in what 
ways it is possible to pose a serious threat.Many possibilities 
come to mind: a general strike, university strikes, attempts to 
hamper war production and supply, and so on.Personally, I feel that disruptive acts of this sort would be 
justified were they likely to be effective in averting an imminent 
tragedy.I am skeptical, however, about their possible effectiveÂ¬ 
ness.
