At the moment, I cannot imagine a broad base for such

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


My guess is that such actions would, furthermore, primarily 
involve students and younger faculty from the humanities and 
the theological schools, with a scattering of scientists.The proÂ¬

manipulation and control (much of the social sciences), would 
probably remain relatively uninvolved.Therefore the long- 
range threat, such as it is, would be to American humanistic and 
scientific culture.
