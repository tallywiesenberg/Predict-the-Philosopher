I doubt that this would seem important to 
those in decision-making positions.Rusk and Rostow and their 
accomplices in the academic world seem unaware of the serious 
threat that their policies already pose in these spheres.I doubt 
that they appreciate the extent, or the importance, of the dissiÂ¬ 
pation of creative energies and the growing disaffection among 
young people who are sickened by the violence and deceit that 
they see in the exercise of American power.Further disruption 
in these areas might, then, seem to them a negligible cost.Resistance is in part a moral responsibility, in part a tactic to 
affect government policy.
