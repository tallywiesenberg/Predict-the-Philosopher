In particular, with respect to support 
for draft resistance, I feel that it is a moral responsibility that 
cannot be shirked.On the other hand, as a tactic, it seems to me 
of doubtful effectiveness, as matters now stand.I say this with 
diffidence and considerable uncertainty.Whatever happens in Vietnam, there are bound to be signifiÂ¬ 
cant domestic repercussions.It is axiomatic that no army ever 
loses a war; its brave soldiers and all-knowing generals are 
stabbed in the back by treacherous civilians.
