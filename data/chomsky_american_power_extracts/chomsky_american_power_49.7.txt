.the problem after a war is with the victor.He 
thinks he has just proved that war and violence pay.Who will 
now teach him a lesson?” For the most powerful and most 
aggressive nation in the world, this is indeed a danger.If we 
can rid ourselves of the naive belief that we are somehow 
different and more pure—a belief held by the British, the 
French, the Japanese, in their moments of imperial glory—then 
we will be able honestly to face the truth in this observation.
