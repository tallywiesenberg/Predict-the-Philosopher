One can only hope that we will face this truth before too many 
innocents, on all sides, suffer and die.Finally, there are certain principles that I think must be 
stressed as we try to build effective opposition to this and future 
wars.We must not, I believe, thoughtlessly urge others to comÂ¬ 
mit civil disobedience, and we must be careful not to construct 
situations in which young people will find themselves induced, 
perhaps in violation of their basic convictions, to commit civil 
disobedience.Resistance must be freely undertaken.I also 
hope, more sincerely than I know how to say, that it will create 
bonds of friendship and mutual trust that will support and 
strengthen those who are sure to suffer.
