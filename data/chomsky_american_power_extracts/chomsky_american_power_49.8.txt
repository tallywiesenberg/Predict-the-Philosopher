Following the publication of “On Resistance” in the New York 
Review of Books, a number of very interesting letters were 
received dealing with several of the questions raised in it.Two 
appeared, with accompanying comments of mine, in the issue 
of February 1, 1968.The first, from a college professor whom I 
will identify here simply as Mr. Y, noted “an undramatic but 
steady shift of opinion” among middle-class people, many con¬ 
servative or apolitical, who “are deciding that the war simply 
isn't worth what it costs.” Mr. Y counsels that these people can 
be convinced, not that the war is wrong, but that it is “damned 
foolishness,” and he suggests that “the patient effort to win over 
those millions who view the war in pragmatic rather than moral 
terms may be more significant” than the various forms of resist¬ 
ance which, while perhaps revealing a “pure conscience,” may 
nevertheless “not actually help put an end to war.” The second 
letter is from a former member of “The Resistance,” now under¬ 
ground and obviously unidentified, who signs simply: William

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS

X.As he analyzes the situation, “the war will end when the 
American middle class wants it to” and “what will cause the 
middle class to want an end to the war will be the conjunction 
of Vietnamese resistance plus the high cost to the middle class 
in effort and money to deal with taxes, inflation, disruption, and 
obstruction at home.” It follows, then, “that the most effective 
antiwar activities are those which are the most disruptive, the 
most costly, those which most undermine the authority of the 
government domestically and in its war policy”—ghetto rebel¬ 
lions (“those elements of the white middle class opposed to the 
war must work to protect participants”), demonstrations such 
as the ones at the Pentagon and at the New York and Oakland 
induction centers, and others that will cause the government’s 
authority to be questioned and that will “escalate the cost” to 
the government.He therefore opposes the individual act of 
“confrontation” and describes the “notion of the alternatives— 
the military, prison, or exile” sketched in my article as “too 
limited, constrained by lack of experience and by lack of a full 
comprehension of what is to be done.” “We have work to do, or 
simply lives to live, and don’t intend to make their job easier or 
our lives more miserable.” His advice is “to make them pay the 
piper, who called the tune.
