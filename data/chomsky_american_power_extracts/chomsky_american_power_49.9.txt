No one can 
evaluate the effectiveness of various tactics with any precision.Furthermore, no course of action open to us offers much hope 
of preventing the Vietnam tragedy from assuming still more 
awesome proportions.We are, unfortunately, discussing tactics 
of limited effectiveness and partially unpredictable conse¬ 
quences.I suspect that Mr. Y and Mr. X exaggerate the political signifi¬ 
cance of middle-class opinion.Even if 65 percent or 99 percent 
of the American people were convinced “that the war is 
damned foolishness,” there would remain the problem of trans¬ 
lating this conviction into politically effective action.
