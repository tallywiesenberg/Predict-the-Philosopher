It is 
doubtful that the political system provides this opportunity in a 
realistic way.Those who feel that an American “victory” in 
Vietnam would be a political and moral tragedy therefore face 
two kinds of tactical problem: first, how to bring “pragmatic 
middle-class opinion” to oppose the war; second, how to give 
effective political expression to such opposition as exists.I am 
not convinced that either correspondent is entirely realistic in 
assessing these matters.Consider first the matter of dissent.There is no need to try to 
persuade someone that his taxes are going up, that his neigh¬ 
bor’s son was killed, and that he doesn’t like it.
