passionate involvement of students in the civil rights move¬ 
ment, in the movement to end the war, in resistance, in com¬ 
munity organizing, already has changed the intellectual and 
moral climate of the universities at least. These stirrings of con¬ 
cern and commitment give some reason to hope that we will not 
repeat the crimes of the recent past. One thing is certain: we 
must never forget these crimes. 

It is just half a century since Randolph Bourne, in his re¬ 
markably perceptive essays, warned that “the old philosophy, 
the old radicalism . . . has found a perfectly definite level, and 
there is no reason to think it will not remain there. Its flowering 
appears in the technical organization of the war by an earnest 
group of young liberals, who direct their course by an opportu-

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS

wrote of the enthusiasm with which liberal intellectuals ac¬ 
cepted the war, once America had joined in, of the “high mood 
of confidence and self-righteousness,” the “keen sense of control 
over events.” 

The war has revealed a younger intelligentsia, trained up in the 
pragmatic dispensation, immensely ready for the executive order¬ 
ing of events, pitifully unprepared for the intellectual interpreta¬ 
tion or the idealistic focusing of ends. . . . They have absorbed 
the secret of scientific method as applied to political administra¬ 
tion. They are liberal, enlightened, aware. They are touched with 
creative intelligence toward the solution of political and industrial 
problems. They are a wholly new force in American life, the 
product of the swing in the colleges from a training that empha¬ 
sized classical studies to one that emphasized political and eco¬ 
nomic values. Practically all this element, one would say, is lined 
up in service of the w r ar technique. There seems to have been a 
peculiar congeniality between the war and these men. It is as if 
the war and they had been waiting for each other. . . . What is
