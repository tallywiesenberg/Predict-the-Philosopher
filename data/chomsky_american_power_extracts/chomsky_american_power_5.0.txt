means of legitimating the power they already had, using the 
governmental machinery to underwrite themselves.” Putting 
aside the remarkable naivete regarding the forthcoming elec¬ 
tions, what is striking is the implicit assumption that we have a 
right to continue our efforts to restructure the South Vietnamese

Kwantung Army sought to support “genuine Manchurian na¬ 
tionalism,” thirty-five years ago.To understand more fully what is implied by the judgment 
that we must defend the “nationalists” against the “Commu¬ 
nists,” we can turn again to Pike’s interesting study.The nation¬ 
alist groups mentioned by Sacks are the VNQDD and the Dai 
Viet.
