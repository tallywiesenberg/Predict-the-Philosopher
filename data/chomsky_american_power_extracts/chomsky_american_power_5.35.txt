Throughout history, however, colo¬ 
nial administrators have had their difficulties in comprehending 
or coming to grips with this phenomenon.In the course of his analysis of our dilemma in Vietnam, Pool 
explains some of the aspects of our culture that make it difficult 
for us to understand such matters clearly.We live in “a guilt 
culture in which there is a tradition of belief in equality.” For 
such reasons, we find it hard to understand the true nature of 
Vietcong land redistribution, which is primarily “a patronage 
operation” in which “dissatisfied peasants band together in a 
gang to despoil their neighbors” and “then reward the deserving 
members of the cabal.”

“streak of moral indifference” in the history of Russian revolu¬

individual bourgeois.” 28 Our side, in contrast, adheres to the 
“tradition of belief in equality” when we implement land re¬

reports a recent conference of experts studying the “Taiwan 
success in land reform,” one of the real success stories of Ameri¬ 
can intervention.“The Government reimbursed the former 
landlords in part (30 per cent) with shares of four large public 
enterprises taken over from the Japanese.
