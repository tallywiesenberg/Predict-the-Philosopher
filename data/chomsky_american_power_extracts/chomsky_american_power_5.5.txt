As he notes, “in a number of historical cases 
it has been the better-to-do peasant who has revolted, 
while his poorer brothers actively supported or passively ac¬ 
cepted the existing order.” The “behavioral explanation” lies “in 
the relative docility of poorer peasants and the firm authority of 
landlords in the more ‘feudal’ areas ...the landlord can exer¬ 
cise considerable influence over his tenant’s behavior and read¬ 
ily discourage conduct inconsistent with his own interests.” 

In an interview with the New York Times (October 15, 1967), 
Mitchell adds an additional explanation for the fact that the 
most secure areas are those that remain “essentially feudal in 
social structure”: when the feudal structure is eliminated,

Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


“there’s a vacuum and that is ideal for the Vietcong because 
they’ve got an organization to fill the vacuum.” This observation 
points to a difficulty that has always plagued the American 
effort.As Joseph Buttinger points out, the Diem regime too was 
unable to experiment with “freely constituted organizations” 
because these “would have been captured by the Vietminh .” 29 

Mitchell’s informative study supports an approach to counter¬ 
insurgency that has been expressed by Roger Hilsman, who 
explains that in his view, modernization “cannot help much in a 
counterguerrilla program,” because it “inevitably uproots estab¬ 
lished social systems [and] produces political and economic 
dislocation and tension.” He therefore feels that popularity of 
governments, reform, and modernization may be “important 
ingredients,” but that their role in counterinsurgency “must be 
measured more in terms of their contributions to physical se¬ 
curity .” 30 

Before leaving this symposium on social science and Vietnam, 
we should take note of the scholarly detachment that permits 
one not to make certain comments or draw certain conclusions.
