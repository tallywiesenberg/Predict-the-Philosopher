It would, for example, be absurd to try to 
control the behavior of a rat by winning its loyalty rather than 
by the proper scheduling of reinforcement.An added advantage of this new, more scientific approach is 
that it will “modify the attitudes with wdiich counterinsurgency 
efforts are viewed in the United States” 34 (when we turn to the 
United States, of course, we are concerned with people whose 
attitudes must be taken into account, not merely their behav¬ 
ior).It will help us overcome one of the main defects in the 
American character, the “emotional reaction” that leads us to 
side with “crusaders for the common man” and against a “ruth¬ 
less, exploitative tyrant” (“that there may be reality as well as 
appearance in this role-casting is not the point”).This senti¬ 
mentality “frequently interferes with a realistic assessment of 
alternatives, and inclines us instead toward a carping right¬ 
eousness in our relations with the beleaguered government we 
are ostensibly supporting”; it may be overcome by concentra¬ 
tion on control of behavior rather than modification of attitudes 
or the winning of hearts and minds.Hence the new approach to 
counterinsurgency should not only be effective in extending the 
control of American-approved governments, but it may also 
have a beneficial effect on us.
