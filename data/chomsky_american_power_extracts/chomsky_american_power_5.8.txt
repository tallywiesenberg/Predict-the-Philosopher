The possibilities are awe-inspir¬

a rational understanding of insurgency, for “insurgency is prob¬ 
ably the most likely type of politico-military threat in the third 
world, and surely one of the most complex and challenging 
problems facing United States policies and programs.” The 
primary objective of American foreign policy in the Third 
World must be “the denial of communist control,” specifically, 
the support of countries that are defending their “independence 
from external and internal communist domination.” The latter 
problem, defending independence from internal Communist 
domination, is the crucial problem, particularly in Latin Amer¬ 
ica.We must counter the threat by a policy of promoting eco¬ 
nomic growth and modernization (making sure, however, to avoid 
the risks inherent in these processes—cf.Mitchell), combined 
with “a responsible use of force.” No question is raised about the 
appropriateness of our use of force in a country threatened by 
insurgency.The justification, were the question raised, is in¬ 
herent in the assumption that we live “in a world in which loss 
of national independence is often synonymous with communist 
control, and communism is implicitly considered to be irrever¬ 
sible.” Thus, by Orwellian logic, we are actually defending na¬ 
tional independence when we intervene with military force to 
protect a ruling elite from internal insurgency.
