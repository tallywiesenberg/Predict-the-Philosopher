Concern for loyalties and attitudes is emotional and un¬ 
scientific.As rational men, believers in the scientific ethic, 
we should be concerned with manipulating behavior in a desir¬ 
able direction, and not be deluded by mystical notions of 
freedom, individual needs, or popular will.Let me make it clear that I am not criticizing the behavioral 
sciences because they lend themselves to such perversion.On 
other grounds, the “behavioral persuasion” seems to me to lack 
merit; it seriously mistakes the method of science and imposes 
pointless methodological strictures on the study of man and 
society, but this is another matter entirely.It is, however, fair to 
inquire to what extent the popularity of this approach is based 
on its demonstrated achievements, and to what extent its appeal 
is based on the ease with which it can be refashioned as a new 
coercive ideology with a faintly scientific tone.
