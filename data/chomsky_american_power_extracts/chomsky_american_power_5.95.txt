(In passing, I 
think it is worth mention that the same questions can be raised 
outside of politics, specifically, in connection with education 
and therapy.)The assumption that the colonial power is benevolent and has 
the interests of the natives at heart is as old as imperialism 
itself.Thus the liberal Herman Merivale, lecturing at Oxford in 
1840, lauded the “British policy of colonial enlightenment” 
which “stands in contrast to that of our ancestors,” who cared

from “the new mandarins” whose claim to power is based on 
knowledge and technique.Going a step beyond, notice how perverse is the entire dis¬ 
cussion of the “conceptual framework” for counterinsurgency.
