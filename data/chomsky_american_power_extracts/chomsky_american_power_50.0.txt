end the war through annihilation, and Mr. Y overlooks the fact 
that those who feel that the war is “damned foolishness” may 
perfectly well accept this way of bringing it to an end.Suppose, 
for example, that the military were to decide that the use of 
tactical nuclear weapons would provide the cheapest means for 
uprooting the NLF political and administrative structure in the 
Mekong Delta (with the inevitable solemn statement from 
Freedom House applauding this exercise of limited means to 
show that violence doesn’t pay).The purpose of dissent is to 
mobilize opinion against the use of American force to impose a 
political solution in Vietnam—to the hideous extent it is used 
today, to the still more barbaric extent of tomorrow, or in fact, 
to any extent at all—whatever the costs may be.This is the 
crucial problem that dissent must face with respect to Vietnam 
as well as all of the other countries where American force is 
being used directly, or where American arms and military train¬ 
ing are contributing to internal repression.
