late, but it seems to me that many commentators have seriously 
underestimated the significance of the political factor, the po¬ 
tential strength of a popular struggle to defend the achieve¬ 
ments of the revolution. It is perhaps relevant that Asturias, the 
one area of Spain where the system of CNT-UGT committees 
was not eliminated in favor of central control, is also the one 
area where guerrilla warfare continued well after Franco’s vic¬ 
tory. Broue and Temime observe 111 that the resistance of the 
partisans of Asturias “demonstrates the depth of the revolution¬ 
ary elan, which had not been shattered by the reinstitution of 
state authority, conducted here with greater prudence.” There 
can be no doubt that the revolution was both widespread and 
deeply rooted in the Spanish masses. It seems quite possible 
that a revolutionary war of the sort advocated by Berneri would

fascist armies. The idea that men can overcome machines no 
longer seems as romantic or naive as it may have a few years 
ago. 

Furthermore, the trust placed in the bourgeois government 
by the anarchist leaders was not honored, as the history of the 
counterrevolution clearly shows. In retrospect, it seems that 
Berneri was correct in arguing that they should not have taken 
part in the bourgeois government, but should rather have 
sought to replace this government with the institutions created 
by the revolution . 112 The anarchist minister Garcia Oliver 
stated that “we had confidence in the word and in the person of 
a Catalan democrat and retained and supported Companys as 
President of the Generalitat ,” 113 at a time when in Catalonia, 
at least, the workers’ organizations could easily have replaced 
the state apparatus and dispensed with the former political 
parties, as they had replaced the old economy with an entirely 
new structure. Companys recognized fully that there were lim¬ 
its beyond which he could not cooperate with the anarchists. In 
an interview with H. E. Kaminski, he refused to specify these 
limits, but merely expressed his hope that “the anarchist masses 
will not oppose the good sense of their leaders,” who have 
“accepted the responsibilities incumbent upon them”; he saw 
his task as “directing these responsibilities in the proper path,”
