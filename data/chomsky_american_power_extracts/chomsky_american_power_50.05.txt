Contrary to Mr. Y, 
then, I feel that dissent should aim to convince the American 
people that the war is wrong, and to explain why this or any 
similar use of force is wrong.Consider next the assumption that opposition to the war will 
mount as its costs visibly increase.It follows that we should 
attempt to increase these costs.Resistance, properly conducted, 
can serve to increase the domestic cost of American aggression 
and can therefore help shape the attitudes of the “pragmatic 
middle classes” of whom Mr. Y speaks, as it can help shape the 
decisions of those who must calculate these costs in setting the 
course of American foreign policy.Mr. Y is surely wrong in 
supposing that those who undertake resistance do so to preserve 
their moral purity.
