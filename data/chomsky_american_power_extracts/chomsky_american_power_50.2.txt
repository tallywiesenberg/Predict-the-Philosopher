The government will soon have to decide whether to 
draft graduate students.If the resistance continues to grow, the 
decision will be a costly one, no matter how it is made.It is 
politically difficult to give students a blanket exemption, for 
obvious reasons.On the other hand, an attempt to draft stuÂ¬ 
dents will, if resistance develops, put the government in the 
position of tolerating an open violation of the law or of carrying 
out serious punitive acts against the children of the social and 
economic elite.One of the costs of the war is the contempt for 
the government, for its violence and mendacity, felt by many 
young people.
