Another, 
very different approach is to try to modify the objective condi¬ 
tions that any elected official must consider when he selects a 
course of action.I do not want to go into the general question 
of the legitimacy of these alternatives, but rather to make two 
points.First, those who are committed to the first method will 
naturally regard political action of the latter sort—draft resist¬ 
ance, for example—as a danger, whose cost they must seek to 
reduce.Secondly, to be realistic, the parliamentary system at 
the moment offers almost no opportunity for meaningful action 
on such issues as Vietnam.One cannot be certain, of course.
