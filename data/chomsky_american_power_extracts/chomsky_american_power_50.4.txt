To summarize, draft resistance can make use of the inegali¬ 
tarian nature of American society as a technique for increasing 
the cost of American aggression, and it threatens values that are 
important to those in a decision-making position.(One who 
shares these values must then ask how they benefit our victims, 
and what price our victims must pay to secure these values from 
any risk.)It is difficult to judge how heavily such costs will 
weigh in the balance, but I think that Mr. Y is not justified in 
contending that the goal of resistance can only be to safeguard 
one’s purity of conscience.Of course, resistance might backfire; it might lead the “prag¬ 
matic opposition” to demand a harsh and brutal victory.How¬ 
ever, the danger seems to me slight.
