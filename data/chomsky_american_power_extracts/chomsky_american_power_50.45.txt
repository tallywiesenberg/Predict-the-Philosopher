There is no reason why a 
principled and obviously courageous and highly moral act 
should have this consequence.Rather, I think it is likely to 
cause others to consider their own complicity, in their work, in 
their payment of war taxes, in their preservation of the domestic 
peace that permits the warmakers to operate freely.Further¬ 
more, it is important to bear in mind that any political act 
carries with it a potential danger of this sort.For example, it is 
not unlikely that President Johnson would react to a threat at 
the polls with a sharp escalation, on the theory (probably cor¬ 
rect) that this would gain him at least short-term support.I see 
no reason to believe that nonviolent resistance is more likely to 
have this consequence than electoral politics.
