not further specified in the interview, but shown by the events 
leading up to the May Days . 114 Probably, Companys’ attitude 
towards this willingness of the anarchist leaders to cooperate 
was expressed accurately in his reaction to the suggestion of a 
correspondent of the New Statesman and Nation , who pre¬ 
dicted that the assassination of the anarchist mayor of Puig- 
cerda would lead to a revolt: “[Companys] laughed scornfully 
and said the anarchists would capitulate as they always had

Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


before/’ 115 As has already been pointed out in some detail, the 
liberal-Communist Party coalition had no intention of letting 
the war against Franco take precedence over the crushing of 
the revolution. A spokesman for Comorera put the matter 
clearly: “This slogan has been attributed to the P.S.U.C.: 'Be¬ 
fore taking Saragossa, it is necessary to take Barcelona.’ This 
reflects the situation exactly. . . .” 116 Comorera himself had, 
from the beginning, pressed Companys to resist the CNT. 117 
The first task of the antifascist coalition, he maintained, was 
to dissolve the revolutionary committees. 118 I have already 
cited a good deal of evidence indicating that the repression 
conducted by the Popular Front seriously weakened popular 
commitment and involvement in the antifascist war. What was 
evident to George Orwell was also clear to the Barcelona work¬ 
ers and the peasants in the collectivized villages of Aragon: the 
liberal-Communist coalition would not tolerate a revolutionary 
transformation of Spanish society; it would commit itself fully 
to the anti-Franco struggle only after the old order was firmly 
re-established, by force, if necessary. 119 

There is little doubt that farm workers in the collectives un¬ 
derstood quite well the social content of the drive towards con¬ 
solidation and central control. We learn this not only from an¬ 
archist sources but also from the socialist press in the spring of 
1937. On May 1, the Socialist party newspaper Adelante had 
the following to say: 

At the outbreak of the Fascist revolt the labor organizations and 
the democratic elements in the country were in agreement that 
the so-called Nationalist Revolution, which threatened to plunge 
our people into an abyss of deepest misery, could be halted only 
by a Social Revolution. The Communist Party, however, opposed 
this view with all its might. It had apparently completely forgot¬
