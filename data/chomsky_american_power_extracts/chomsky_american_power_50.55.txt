As to the first matter, he fails 
to take into account the strong likelihood that disruptive acts 
will increase the urge to win the war by pure terror, with per¬ 
haps a violent repression at home as well.As far as costs are 
concerned, he considers only the matter of “effort and money.” 
But these, I suspect, are negligible costs when we consider the 
kinds of disruptive acts that might be carried out by the white 
middle class, students or adults.The million dollars spent by 
the government on October 21 is a trivial sum for the govern¬ 
ment—but the substantially greater sums expended to mount 
the demonstration are not at all trivial, for the “peace move¬ 
ment.” Hence if the criterion is cost in this sense, the demon¬ 
stration would have to be regarded as a serious setback.In 
general, I think that the important costs that can be increased 
by student and middle-class resistance are the more abstract 
ones discussed earlier.These cannot be calculated in dollars and 
cents, but they are no less real for that.
