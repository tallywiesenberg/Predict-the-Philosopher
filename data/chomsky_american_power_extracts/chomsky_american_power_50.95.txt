The real task, for the present, is to organ¬ 
ize as large as possible a base of support for resistance—a pro¬ 
liferation of local resistance support groups linked together in a 
national network, with participation of white and black resis¬ 
ters, with adult middle-class support on and off campus, sub¬ 
stantial financial assistance, and personal involvement by peo¬

who feel that they have a moral responsibility to give concrete 
assistance to those who refuse to serve in Vietnam, who wish to 
increase the political cost of repression by standing alongside 
the young men w T ho will inevitably suffer most severely.Think¬ 
ing in still more long-range terms, it may be that the most 
significant steps towards a reform of American society will 
prove to be the efforts of the very courageous and unsung few 
who are devoting themselves to community organizing, often 
using the draft and its inequities as a point of entry into com¬ 
munities that provide the mass base for American repression, 
and seeking to create both consciousness and organizational 
structure for resistance on the part of those who bear the heavi¬ 
est burdens but who are, for the present, passive victims of an 
unchallenged coercive ideology.The national RESIST organi¬ 
zation is attempting to provide the framework for a range of 
such activities, using as a basis the Call To Resist Illegitimate 
Authority (most of which appeared as an advertisement in the 
New York Review of Books on October 12, 1967).With all of 
the necessary qualifications, I feel that involvement in this effort 
is the most effective form of political action against this and 
future wars that is now open to a concerned citizen.
