“dictatorship of the proletariat.” From its constant repetition of

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


its new slogan of the parliamentary democratic republic it is clear 
that it has lost all sense of reality. When the Catholic and con¬ 
servative sections of the Spanish bourgeoisie saw their old system 
smashed and could find no way out, the Communist Party in¬ 
stilled new hope into them. It assured them that the democratic

one opinion, which the representative of the Valencia organiza¬

It is not difficult to imagine how the recognition of this “mis¬ 
fortune” must have affected the willingness of the land workers 
to take part in the antifascist war, with all the sacrifices that this 
entailed. 

The attitude of the central government to the revolution was 
brutally revealed by its acts and is attested as well in its propa¬ 
ganda. A former minister describes the situation as follows:
