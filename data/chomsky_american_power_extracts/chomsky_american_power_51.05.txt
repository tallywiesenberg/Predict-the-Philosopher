But the goal must be to design and construct 
alternatives to the present ideology and social institutions that 
are more compelling on intellectual and moral grounds, and that 
can draw to them masses of Americans who find that these al¬ 
ternatives satisfy their human needs—including the human need 
to show compassion, to encourage and to assist those who seek to 
raise themselves from the misery and degradation that our so¬ 
ciety has helped to impose and now seeks to perpetuate.It would be criminal folly to fail to act when there are oppor¬ 
tunities to move towards these goals, or to act in such a way as 
to make them still more distant than they are today.It is not 
easy to find a way to steer between these dangers.There is no 
doubt that in the recent past, the error has consistently been on 
the side of caution and restraint, fear and moral blindness.But 
one must bear in mind, as tensions mount, that the opposite error 
is no less serious.
