It may be successful or unsuccessful in achiev¬ 
ing an end that can be described in political terms.But it is use¬ 
ful to remember that the same tactics that one man may propose 
with high conscience and deep commitment to radical social 
change may also be pressed by a well-placed police spy, bent on 
destroying such a movement and increasing popular support for 
the forces of repression.Consider the Reichstag fire, to return to 
a day that is less remote than one would wish.Or consider the act 
of a seventeen-year-old Jewish refugee from Poland just thirty 
years ago—of Herschel Grynszpan, who assassinated a German 
official in Paris in November 1938.It is difficult to condemn this 
desperate act, which set off violent pogroms throughout Germany 
and helped entrench more deeply the Nazi regime of terror; but 
the victims of Nazi terror would offer no thanks to Herschel 
Grynszpan.
