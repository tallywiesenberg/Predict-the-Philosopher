We must not abandon the victims of American power, 
or play games with their fate.We must not consent to have the 
same repression imposed on still further helpless victims or the 
same blind fury unleashed against them.Acts that seem perfectly 
justified in themselves when regarded in a narrow sense may be 
very wrong when considered in the light of their probable conseÂ¬ 
quences.And a failure to approach those who can be reached, a 
failure to act with strength and determination when one can do 
so in a constructive way, is no less thoughtless and indefensible.These are very general remarks, and not very helpful, perhaps, 
when we face the concrete question of w T hat we can do right now.
