At the 
same time, we enjoy a high degree of internal freedom.We can 
speak and write and organize.Resisters may be punished se¬ 
verely, but they will not be sent to slave-labor camps or gas 
chambers.Given these facts, resistance is feasible even for those 
who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, 
for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of 
the attempt to impose American hegemony.Resistance cannot 
now significantly deplete the manpower pool that makes possi¬ 
ble the use of American power for global repression, nor can it, 
at the moment, significantly impede the research, production, 
and supply on which this exercise of power rests.
