But it can 
contribute significantly towards raising the domestic costs of 
this attempt and eliminating the apathy and passivity that may 
permit it to succeed.It therefore has a potential significance 
that extends far beyond Vietnam.It may help to save other 
small countries from the fate of Vietnam, and indeed, to save 
the world from indescribable catastrophe.400 



EPILOGUE 


As the great peasant revolutions raged in China more than a 
century ago, Karl Marx wrote in the New York Tribune about 

the effect the Chinese revolution seems likely to exercise on the 
civilized world.It may seem a strange and a very paradoxical 
assertion that the next uprising of the people of Europe, and their 
next movement for republican freedom and economy of govern¬ 
ment, may depend more on what is now passing in the Celestial 
Empire—the very opposite of Europe—than on any other politi¬ 
cal cause that now exists.
