Furthermore, what Marx had in mind was the possibility that 
an economic crisis might be caused in the West by a successful 
revolution in China, endangering the China trade, the impor¬ 
tance of which, in the fashion of most writers on this matter 
until fairly recently, he tended to exaggerate.Still, it is well to 
consider today the remarkable spectacle of the disorder created in 
the Western world as the attempt to convey order to Asian 
countries—the very opposite of the West—is proving to be be¬ 
yond the power of Western imperialism.In part, the disorder is 
rooted in revulsion, and to this extent is a tribute to a strain of 
decency in Western culture, difficult as it is to pronounce these 
words amidst the barbarism of the Vietnam war.The disorder 
spreading through the Western world is not solely or even pri¬ 
marily a reaction to the frustration of Western power in Asia, 
but there is no doubt that the massive convulsions in Asia, and 
the heroic Vietnamese resistance to American power, have 
served as a catalytic agent, releasing forces that might have 
remained latent.In itself, this disorder is neither good nor bad, 
a cause neither for hope nor for despair.
