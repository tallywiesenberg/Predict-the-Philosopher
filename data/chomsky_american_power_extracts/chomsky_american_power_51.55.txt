It is difficult to fault this evalua¬ 
tion of the social and economic policies of the 1930s: “The New 
Deal failed to solve the problem of depression, it failed to raise 
the impoverished, it failed to redistribute income, it failed to 
extend equality and generally countenanced racial discrimination 
and segregation.It failed generally to make business more re¬ 
sponsible to the social welfare or to threaten business’ pre¬ 
eminent political power” (Barton J. Bernstein, “The New Deal: 
The Conservative Achievements of Liberal Reform,” in B. J. 
Bernstein, ed., Towards a New Past [New York, Pantheon 
Books, 1968]).Since the national mobilization of World War II, 
we have spent over a trillion dollars on “defense.” It hardly is 
necessary to resort to the “new economics” to show that such 
measures can reduce unemployment and keep the economy func¬ 
tioning, as it requires little political insight to see why the govern¬ 
ment is likely to expend the resources it commands on research 
and development that yield no immediate profit, on missiles and 
“fast-deployment logistic ships” rather than on a mass transpor¬ 
tation system that will conflict with the needs of the oil com¬ 
panies and automotive industry, on nerve gas and manned 
orbital laboratories rather than on farming the oceans (while 
wealthy farmers and farm industries are subsidized to cut back 
agricultural production).It is reasonably clear that unless the 
commercial and industrial system comes under some sort of 
popular democratic control, political democracy will be a sham 
and state power will continue to serve inhuman ends.It is 
easy to say that new thinking and social experimentation are 
needed to free us from the paralysis and fears that narrow our 
vision and direct national energies to destruction and waste, 
that it is necessary to develop social and political consciousness 
through participation and popular control in decision making.
