French bankers, who were generally pro-Franco, blocked the 
release of Spanish gold to the loyalist government, thus hinder¬ 
ing the purchase of arms and, incidentally, increasing the reli¬ 
ance of the Republic on the Soviet Union. 125 The policy of 
“nonintervention,” which effectively blocked Western aid for 
the loyalist government while Hitler and Mussolini in effect 
won the war for Franco, was also technically initiated by the 
French government—though apparently under heavy British 
pressure. 126 

As far as Great Britain is concerned, the hope that it would 
come to the aid of the Republic was always unrealistic. A few 
days after the Franco coup, the foreign editor of Paris-Soir 
wrote: “At least four countries are already taking active interest 
in the battle—France, which is supporting the Madrid Gov¬ 
ernment, and Britain, Germany and Italy, each of which is 
giving discreet but nevertheless effective assistance to one 
group or another among the insurgents.” 127 In fact, British 
support for Franco took a fairly concrete form at the very earli¬ 
est stages of the insurrection. The Spanish navy remained loyal 
to the Republic,* and made some attempt to prevent Franco 
from ferrying troops from Morocco to Spain. Italian and Ger¬ 
man involvement in overcoming these efforts is well docu¬ 
mented; 128 the British role has received less attention, but can 
be determined from contemporary reports. On August 11, 1936, 
the New York Times carried a front-page report on British 
naval actions in the Straits of Gibraltar, commenting that “this 
action helps the Rebels by preventing attacks on Algeciras, 
where troops from Morocco land.” (A few days earlier, loyalist 
warships had bombarded Algeciras, damaging the British con-

the situation as it appeared from there: 

Angered by the Spanish factions’ endangering of shipping and 
neutral Gibraltar territory in their fighting, Great Britain virtually 
blockaded Gibraltar Harbor last night with the huge battleship 
Queen Elizabeth in the center of the entrance, constantly playing
