The warning, issued in the official Gibraltar Gazette, was 
signed by the British Colonial Secretary here. 

The warning was issued after reports of possible Communist 
troubles here had reached official ears and after strong complaints 
that Spanish Rebels were in Gibraltar. It was said Rebels were 
making headquarters here and entering La Linea to fight. [Italics

I have quoted this dispatch in full because it conveys rather 
accurately the character of British “neutrality” in the early 
stages of the war and thenceforth. In May 1938, the British 
ambassador to Spain, Sir Henry Chilton, “expressed the convic¬ 
tion that a Franco victory was necessary for peace in Spain; 
that there was not the slightest chance that Italy and/or Ger¬ 
many would dominate Spain; and that even if it were possible 
for the Spanish Government to win (which he did not believe) 
he was convinced that a victory for Franco would be better for

pleased him was the forceful repression of the anarchists and 
the militarization of the Republic (necessary when “the entire 
structure of civilization and social life is destroyed,” as it had 
been by the revolution, now happily subdued). 130 However, 
his good feelings towards the Republic remained qualified. In 
an interview of August 14, 1938, he expressed himself as follows: 
“Franco has all the right on his side because he loves his coun¬ 
try. Also Franco is defending Europe against the Communist

glish, and I prefer the triumph of the wrong cause. I prefer that 
the other side wins, because Franco could be an upset or a 
threat to British interests, and the others no.” 131 

The Germans were quite aware of British sentiments, natu¬ 
rally, and therefore were much concerned that the supervisory 
committee for the nonintervention agreement be located in 
London rather than Paris. The German Foreign Ministry official 
responsible for this matter expressed his view on August 29, 
1936, as follows: “Naturally, we have to count on complaints of 
all kinds being brought up in London regarding failure to ob¬ 
serve the obligation not to intervene, but we cannot avoid such
