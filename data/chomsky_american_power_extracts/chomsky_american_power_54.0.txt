ments in this country will be looking to Germany as the bul¬ 
wark against Communism in Europe. ... Do not let us be in a 
hurry to condemn Germany. We shall be welcoming Germany 
as our friend.” 136 In September 1938, the Munich agreement 
was concluded; shortly after, both France and Britain did wel¬ 
come Germany as “our friend.” As noted earlier (see note 99), 
even Churchill’s role at this time is subject to some question. Of 
course, the Munich agreement w r as the death knell for the Span¬ 
ish Republic, exactly as the necessity to rely on the Soviet 
Union signaled the end of the Spanish revolution in 1937. 

The United States, like France, exhibited less initiative in 
these events than Great Britain, which had far more substantial 
economic interests in Spain and was more of an independent

force in European affairs. Nevertheless, the American record is 
hardly one to inspire pride. Technically, the United States 
adhered to a position of strict neutrality. However, a careful 
look raises some doubts. According to information obtained by 
Jackson, “the American colonel who headed the Telephone 
Company had placed private lines at the disposal of the Madrid 
plotters for their conversations with Generals Mola and 
Franco,” 137 just prior to the insurrection on July 17. In August,, 
the American government urged the Martin Aircraft Company 
not to honor an agreement made prior to the insurrection to 
supply aircraft to the Republic, and it also pressured the Mexi¬ 
can government not to reship to Spain war materials purchased 
in the United States. 138 An American arms exporter, Robert 
Cuse, insisted on his legal right to ship airplanes and aircraft 
engines to the Republic in December 1936, and the State De¬ 
partment was forced to grant authorization. Cuse was de¬ 
nounced by Roosevelt as unpatriotic, though Roosevelt was 
forced to admit that the request was quite legal. Roosevelt con¬ 
trasted the attitude of other businessmen to Cuse as follows: 

Well, these companies went along with the request of the Gov¬ 
ernment. There is the 90 percent of business that is honest, I 
mean ethically honest. There is the 90 percent we are always 
pointing at with pride. And then one man does what amounts to 
a perfectly legal but thoroughly unpatriotic act. He represents the 
10 percent of business that does not live up to the best standards. 
Excuse the homily, but I feel quite deeply about it. 139
