Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


The study of collectivization published by the CNT in 
193 7 146 concludes with a description of the village of Mem- 
brilla. “In its miserable huts live the poor inhabitants of a poor 
province; eight thousand people, but the streets are not paved, 
the town has no newspaper, no cinema, neither a cafe nor a 
library. On the other hand, it has many churches that have been 
burned.” Immediately after the Franco insurrection, the land 
was expropriated and village life collectivized. “Food, clothing, 
and tools were distributed equitably to the whole population. 
Money was abolished, work collectivized, all goods passed to- 
the community, consumption was socialized. It was, however, 
not a socialization of wealth but of poverty.” Work continued as 
before. An elected council appointed committees to organize 
the life of the commune and its relations to the outside world. 
The necessities of life were distributed freely, insofar as they 
were available. A large number of refugees were accom¬ 
modated. A small library was established, and a small school of 
design. 

The document closes with these words: 

The whole population lived as in a large family; functionaries, 
delegates, the secretary of the syndicates, the members of the 
municipal council, all elected, acted as heads of a family. But 
they were controlled, because special privilege or corruption 
would not be tolerated. Membrilla is perhaps the poorest village 
of Spain, but it is the most just. 

An account such as this, with its concern for human relations 
and the ideal of a just society, must appear very strange to the 
consciousness of the sophisticated intellectual, and it is there¬ 
fore treated with scorn, or taken to be naive or primitive or 
otherwise irrational. Only when such prejudice is abandoned 
will it be possible for historians to undertake a serious study of
