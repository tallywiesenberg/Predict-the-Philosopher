we can expect the same. The technique of “limited warfare” 
translates neatly into a system of domestic repression—far more 
humane, as will quickly be explained, than massacring those 
who are unwilling to wait for the inevitable victory of the war 
on poverty. 

Why should a liberal intellectual be so persuaded of the vir¬ 
tues of a political system of four-year dictatorship ? The answer 
seems all too plain.
