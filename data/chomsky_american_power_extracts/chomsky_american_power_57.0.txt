17, 1968, pp. 127-34. He observes that “the most profound objection 
to this kind of strategic theory is not its limited usefulness but its 
danger, for it can lead us to believe we have an understanding of 
events and a control over their flow which we do not have.” A still 
more profound objection, I think, is that the pretended objectivity of 
“strategic theory” can be used to justify the attempt to control the flow 
of events.

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


11. “The Necessity and Difficulty of Planning the Future Society,” 
address given at the American Institute of Planners Conference, Wash¬ 
ington, D.C., October 3, 1967. Citing this, Senator Fulbright {op. cit .) 
comments aptly that “poverty, which is a tragedy in a poor country, 
blights our affluent society with something more than tragedy; being 
unnecessary, it is deeply immoral as well.” He also compares “the 
$904 billion we have spent on military power since World War II” 
with “the $96 billion we have spent, out of our regular national 
budget, on education, health, welfare housing, and community devel¬ 
opment.” In his Challenge to Affluence (New York, Pantheon Books, 
1963), Myrdal concludes that “In society at large there is more equal¬ 
ity of opportunity today than there ever was. But for the bottom layer 
there is less or none” (p. 38). He questions the assumption that 
“America is still the free and open society of its cherished image and 
well-established ideals” and remarks that “as less and less work is 
required of the type that people in the urban and rural slums can offer, 
they will be increasingly isolated and exposed to unemployment and 
plain exploitation. There is an ugly smell rising from the basement of 
the stately American mansion” (p. 49).

13. In 1965, 20 companies out of 420,000 made 38% of profits after 
taxes, and earnings on foreign investments were well over three times 
what they were 15 years earlier. The sales of GM exceeded the GNP 
of all but nine foreign countries. The 10 largest companies reported 
profits equal to the next 490. One thousand companies disappeared 
through merger.
