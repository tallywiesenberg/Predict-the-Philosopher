the misuse of domestic resources through inefficient budgeting, re¬ 
duced local savings or inflation.” Commenting on this, Robert Smith 
notes that “the latter standard included increased tax revenues, reduc¬ 
tion of budget deficit, elimination of ‘distorting subsidies to public 
activities,’ and the adoption of ‘state incentives to private sector invest¬ 
ment and growth.’” ( New Politics, Vol. 6 [Spring 1967], pp. 49-57.

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


18. New York Times , December 20, 1967. The Times refers to 
what is printed as “excerpts, 5 ' but it is not materially different from the 
full document. I understand that it has since been signed by many 
other scholars. 

19. See the reviews by Coral Bell and B. R. O'G. Anderson in the 
China Quarterly, No. 28 (October-December 1966), pp. 140-43. It 
should be noted that opposition to social change, and support for the 
counterrevolutionary violence that is used to suppress it, are long¬ 
standing features of American cultural history. Thus according to 
American historian Louis Hartz, “there is no doubt that the appear¬ 
ance of even a mild socialism in 1848, of Ledru Rollin and the 
national workshops, was enough to produce general American dismay. 
There was no outcry in America against the suppression of the June 
revolt of the workers in Paris, as there was none over the suppression 
of the Communards in 1871. Here was violence, and plenty of it, but 
it was being used for order and law, as one editorial writer put it [in 
the New York Journal of Commerce ].” {The Nature of Revolution, 
Testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Feb¬ 
ruary 26, 1968 [Washington, Government Printing Office, 1968].)

22. Recent confirmatory evidence is given by George M. Kahin, in a 
memorandum of April 13, 1967, in the Congressional Record. He 
cites the Marine Corps estimate that in this province, the principal 
area of marine strength, IS out of 549 hamlets had been “secured. 55

menting, in 1893, on America’s failure to acquire colonies. Cited in 
Ernest R. May, Imperial Democracy (New York, Harcourt, Brace & 
World, Inc., 1961), p. 23. 

24. Quoted by Robert Guillain in Le Monde, May 25, 1966; re¬ 
printed, in English translation, as Vietnam, the Dirty War (London, 
Housmans, 1966). 

25. According to Jonathan Randal {New York Times, June 11, 
1967), “only one officer above the rank of lieutenant colonel did not 
serve in the French army against the Vietminh in the French Indo¬ 
china war.”

29. Op. cit., Vol. 2, p. 856. As Buttinger explains, “Local elections 
would have given the Vietminh control of most of the rural communi¬ 
ties. The Vietminh was not only popular and in effective political 
control of large regions, but it alone had people with the requisite 
organizational skills to exploit whatever opportunities for democratic 
self-expression the regime opened up.” He adds that “the NLF was 
truly the Vietminh reborn,” and speaks of “the similarity, or better, 
near identity, of the Vietminh and the NLF.”
