the misuse of domestic resources through inefficient budgeting, re¬ 
duced local savings or inflation.” Commenting on this, Robert Smith 
notes that “the latter standard included increased tax revenues, reduc¬ 
tion of budget deficit, elimination of ‘distorting subsidies to public 
activities,’ and the adoption of ‘state incentives to private sector invest¬ 
ment and growth.’” ( New Politics, Vol. 6 [Spring 1967], pp. 49-57.

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


18. New York Times , December 20, 1967. The Times refers to 
what is printed as “excerpts, 5 ' but it is not materially different from the

There was no outcry in America against the suppression of the June 
revolt of the workers in Paris, as there was none over the suppression 
of the Communards in 1871. Here was violence, and plenty of it, but 
it was being used for order and law, as one editorial writer put it [in 
the New York Journal of Commerce ].” {The Nature of Revolution, 
Testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Feb¬
