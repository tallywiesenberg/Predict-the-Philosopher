control of large regions, but it alone had people with the requisite 
organizational skills to exploit whatever opportunities for democratic 
self-expression the regime opened up.” He adds that “the NLF was 
truly the Vietminh reborn,” and speaks of “the similarity, or better, 
near identity, of the Vietminh and the NLF.”
