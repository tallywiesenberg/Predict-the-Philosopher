On the reasons for the remarkable success of pacification in Binh 
Dinh Province, see Bernard Fall, Last Reflections on a War (Garden 
City, N.Y., Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1967), p. 159. This was one 
of “the areas where American-Korean multidivision operations have 
literally smothered the opposition” with “vast search-and-destroy op¬ 
erations” and continuing “tight military control”—or so it seemed, 
until late 1967, and finally February 1968, when the lid blew off. A 
report on Binh Dinh Province, the “showcase” province for pacifica¬ 
tion, in the New York Times , February 20, tells the story. “The enemy 
moves in December—which several military men called a ‘softening 
up’ for the offensive—resulted in a wave of allied air strikes on vil¬ 
lages. Hundreds of homes were destroyed”—the standard American 
response. An American official reports: “What the Vietcong did was 
occupy the hamlets we pacified just for the purpose of having the allies 
move in and bomb them out. By their presence, the hamlets were 
destroyed.” No doubt our psychological warfare specialists are now 
explaining to the Vietnamese, who seem to have some difficulty under-

standing these subtleties, that the destruction of the villages is the fault 
of the Vietcong. In any event, the report continues, “the entire 1968 
program for the province has now been shelved” and “the program is 
now set back anywhere from 14 to 18 months”—that is, back to the 
time of the initial saturation with American and Korean troops. “It 
has all gone down the drain,” said one gloomy American official.

35. There is little point in a lengthy discussion of Wolf’s concept of 
international affairs or his empirical studies. To take a few examples, 
he assumes without question that North Vietnam’s willingness to “dis¬ 
rupt the regime” in the South was motivated in part by “the marked 
economic and social improvements accomplished by the Diem regime 
from 1955 to 1960—dramatic by comparison with the economic stag¬ 
nation in North Vietnam” (for fact rather than fancy on relative 
development, see Buttinger, op. cit., Vol. 2, pp. 928, 966 f.); and also 
that India’s “moderately successful growth” was part of the motivation 
behind “China’s aggressive actions in October 1962.” See also note 36.
