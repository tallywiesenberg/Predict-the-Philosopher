As to the solidity of Wolf’s empirical studies, it is perhaps enough to 
note that his most significant result, the correlation between higher 
GNP and higher level of political democracy in Latin America, arises 
principally from the conclusion (based on data from 1950 to 1960) 
that Brazil and Argentina (along with Mexico and Chile) rank high 
on the scale of political democracy (cf. p. 124). The general level of 
sophistication is illustrated, for example, by a solemn reference to a 
consultant for having explained that in determining the “total military 
value” of a set of alternatives, it is not enough to sum up the separate 
values; one must also weight responses by probability of occurrence. 

36. “But in all cases, the primary consideration should be whether 
the proposed measure is likely to increase the cost and difficulties of 
insurgent operations and help to disrupt the insurgent organization, 
rather than whether it wins popular loyalty and support, or whether it 
contributes to a more productive, efficient, or equitable use of re¬ 
sources” (Wolf, op. cit., p. 69). We must understand that “successful

counterinsurgency programs can be conducted among a rural popu¬ 
lace that is passive or even hostile, rather than loyal, to the govern¬ 
ment.” As evidence, Wolf cites his belief that “The growth of the Viet 
Cong and of the Pathet Lao probably occurred despite the opposition 
of a large majority of the people in both Vietnam and Laos” {ibid., p. 
48). If they can do it, so can we. 

In contrast, Robert Scigliano (of the Michigan State University 
Vietnam Advisory Group) reported that “using the estimate of Amer¬ 
ican officials in Saigon at the end of 1962, about one-half of the South 
Vietnamese support the NLF” {South Vietnam: Nation Under Stress 
[Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963], p. 145). Arthur Dom- 
men reports {Conflict in Laos: The Politics of Neutralization [New 
York, Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., 1964]) that “the Pathet Lao needed no 
propaganda to turn the rural population against the townspeople” (p. 
107). The American Mission took care of this, with its lavish aid {]/ 2 
of 1 percent of which was spent on agriculture, the livelihood of 96 per¬ 
cent of the population) leading to immense corruption, the proliferation 
of luxurious villas and large automobiles alongside of grinding poverty; 
and with its constant subversion in support, first of the “pro-Western 
neutralist” Phoui Sananikone, and then of the military dictator Phoumi 
Nosavan. As Roger Hilsman puts it, the real Pathet Lao “threat” was 
“expansion of political control based on winning peasant support in the 
villages” {To Move a Nation , [Garden City, N.Y., Doubleday & Com¬ 
pany, Inc., 1967], p. 112). The lack of support for the Pathet Lao was 
amply demonstrated in the 1958 elections, in which 9 of their 13
