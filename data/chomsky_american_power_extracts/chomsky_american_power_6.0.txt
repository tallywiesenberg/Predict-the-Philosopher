to replace “the allure of the martial in war” and “the allure of 
the technical” by “the allure of fresh and true ideas, of free 
speculation, of artistic vigor, of cultural styles, of intelligence 
suffused by feeling, and feeling given fibre and outline by intel¬ 
ligence.” These words of Bourne’s are no program for action, 
but an injunction to seek such a program and create for our¬ 
selves, for others, the understanding that can give it life. There

- AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

has been little advance in this direction since he wrote. Given 
the present realities of American power, the challenge becomes 
an urgent, desperate necessity. 

The essays collected here are, for the most part, highly criti¬ 
cal of the role that American intellectuals have played in de¬ 
signing and implementing policy, interpreting historical events, 
and formulating an ideology of social change that in part falsi¬ 
fies, in part restricts and subverts it. Because of this critical 
tone, I want to make it clear at the outset that if any note of self- 
righteousness creeps in, it is unintended and, more important, 
unjustified. No one who involved himself in antiwar activities as 
late as 1965, as I did, has any reason for pride or satisfaction. 
This opposition was ten or fifteen years too late. This is one 
lesson we should have learned from the tragedy of Vietnam. 

For the most part, these essays are elaborated versions of 
lectures given over the past few years. During these years, I 
have taken part in more conferences, debates, forums, teach-ins, 
meetings on Vietnam and American imperialism than I care to 
remember. Perhaps I should mention that, increasingly, I have 
had a certain feeling of falseness in these lectures and discus¬ 
sions. This feeling does not have to do with the intellectual 
issues. The basic facts are clear enough; the assessment of the 
situation is as accurate as I can make it. But the entire perfor¬ 
mance is emotionally and morally false in a disturbing way. It is 
a feeling that I have occasionally been struck by before. For ex¬ 
ample, I remember reading an excellent study of Hitler’s East 
European policies a number of years ago in a mood of grim 
fascination. The author was trying hard to be cool and scholarly 
and objective, to stifle the only human response to a plan to 
enslave and destroy millions of subhuman organisms so that the 
inheritors of the spiritual values of Western civilization would
