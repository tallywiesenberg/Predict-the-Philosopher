Appar¬ 
ently, the hardheaded and pragmatic liberals were never di¬ 
vided on the issue of our right to violate international frontiers 
in reacting to such “internal war.” As a prime example of the 
“kind of critical, searching analysis” that the new, liberal, re¬ 
vitalized State Department was trying to encourage, Hilsman 
cites a study directed to showing how the United States might 
have acted more effectively to overthrow the Mossadegh gov¬ 
ernment in Iran.Allen Dulles was “fundamentally right,” ac¬ 
cording to Hilsman, in judging that Mossadegh in Iran (like 
Arbenz in Guatemala) had come to power (to be sure,

“through the usual processes of government”) with “the inten¬ 
tion of creating a Communist state”—a most amazing statement 
on the part of the State Department chief of intelligence; and 
Dulles was fundamentally right in urging support from the 
United States “to loyal anti-Communist elements” in Iran and 
Guatemala to meet the danger, even though “no invitation was 
extended by the government in power,” obviously.Hilsman ex¬ 
presses the liberal view succinctly in the distinction he draws 
between the Iranian subversion and the blundering attempt at 
the Bay of Pigs: “It is one thing ... to help the Shah’s support¬ 
ers in Iran in their struggle against Mossadegh and his Com¬ 
munist allies, but it is something else again to sponsor a thou¬ 
sand-man invasion against Castro’s Cuba, where there was no 
effective internal opposition.” The former effort was admirable; 
the latter, bound to fail, “is something else again” from the 
point of view of pragmatic liberalism.In Vietnam liberal interventionism was not properly con¬ 
ducted, and the situation got out of hand.We learn more about 
the character of this approach to international affairs by study¬ 
ing a more successful instance.
