The American reaction to the liberal gov¬ 
ernments had been ambiguous and “temporizing.” In contrast, 
Phibun was immediately recognized by the United States.Why?“Within this increasingly turbulent region Thailand was 
the only nation that did not have a Communist insurrection 
within its borders and it was the only country that remained 
relatively stable and calm.As the United States considered 
measures to deter Communist aggression in Southeast Asia, a 
conservative and anti-Communist regime in Thailand became 
increasingly attractive regardless of its internal policies or 
methods of achieving power.” Phibun got the point.In August 
1949, “he stated that foreign pressure had become ‘alarming’ 
and that internal Communist activity had ‘vigorously in¬ 
creased.’ ” In 1950, Truman approved a $10 million grant for 
military aid.
