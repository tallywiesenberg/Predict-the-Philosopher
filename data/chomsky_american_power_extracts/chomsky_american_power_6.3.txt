The liberals 
were extremely weak in any event, in particular because of the 
domination of the economy by Western and Chinese enterprises 
linked with the corrupt governmental bureaucracy.The Coup 
Group that had overthrown the government “was composed 
almost entirely of commoners, many of whom had come from 
the peasantry or low-ranking military and civil service families,” 
and who now wanted their share in corruption and authori¬ 
tarian control.The opposition “Democrats” were, for the most

part, “members of the royal family or conservative landowners 
who wanted to preserve their role in the government and their 
personal wealth.” Whatever opportunities might have existed 
for the development of some more equitable society disap¬ 
peared once the American presence became dominant, how¬ 
ever.Surely any Thai liberal reformer must have been aware of 
this by 1950, in the wake of the coups, the farcical rigged elec¬ 
tions, the murder and torture of leaders of the Free Thai anti- 
Japanese underground, the takeover by the military of the polit¬ 
ical and much of the commercial system—particularly when he 
listened to the words of American Ambassador Stanton as he 
signed a new aid agreement: “The American people fully sup¬ 
port this program of aid to Thailand because of their deep 
interest in the Thai people whose devotion to the ideals of 
freedom and liberty and wholehearted support of the UN have 
won the admiration of the American people.” 

“A notable trend throughout this period was the growing 
intimacy between the Thai military leaders and the top-level 
military officials from the United States,” who helped them ob¬ 
tain “large-scale foreign aid which in turn bolstered their polit¬ 
ical power.” The head of the American military mission, Colo¬ 
nel Charles Sheldon, stated that Thailand was “threatened by 
armed aggression by people who do not believe in democracy, 
who do not believe in freedom or the dignity of the individual 
man as do the people of Thailand and my country.” Adlai Ste¬ 
venson, in 1953, warned the Thai leaders “that their country 
was the real target of the Vietminh,” and expressed his hope that 
they “fully appreciate the threat.” Meanwhile, United States 
assistance had built a powerful army and supplied the police 
with tanks, artillery, armored cars, an air force, naval patrol 
vessels, and a training school for paratroopers.The police 
achieved one of the highest ratios of policemen to citizens in the
