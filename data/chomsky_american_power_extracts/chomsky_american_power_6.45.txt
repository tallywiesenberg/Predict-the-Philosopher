Thus 
when Sarit took power in the 1957 coup, “the Americans had no 
assurance that he would not orient a new regime towards radi¬ 
cal economic and social programs as Castro, for example, has 
done in Cuba.... At stake was an investment of about $300 
million in military equipment and a gradually expanding eco¬ 
nomic base which could have been used against American in¬ 
terests in Southeast Asia had it fallen into unfriendly hands.” 
Fortunately, these dire consequences did not ensue, and in 
place of radical economic and social programs there was merely 
a continuation of the same old terror and corruption.The dan¬ 
ger was real, however.What conclusions does Darling draw from this record?As he 
sees it, 42 there are four major alternatives for American foreign 
policy.
