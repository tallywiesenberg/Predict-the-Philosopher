Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


cussing represent the moderate liberal wing of scholarship on 
international affairs.It may be useful to sample some of the 
other views that appear in American scholarship.Consider, for 
example, the proposals of Thomas R. Adam, professor of polit¬ 
ical science at New York University .44 

Adam begins by outlining an “ideal solution” to American 
problems in the Pacific, towards which we should bend our 
efforts.The ideal solution would have the United States recog¬ 
nized as “the responsible military protagonist of all Western 
interests in the area” with a predominant voice in a unified 
Western policy.
