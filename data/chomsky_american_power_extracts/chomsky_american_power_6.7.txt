United States sovereignty over some territorial 
base in the area would give us “ideal conditions for extending 
power over adjoining regions.” Such a base would permit the 
formation of a regional organization, under our dominance, that 
would make possible “direct intervention in Korea, Vietnam,.Laos and Cambodia” without the onus of unilateral interven¬ 
tion (“in the face of brazen communist aggression, it is not the 
fact of intervention as such that constitutes the issue but rather 
its unilateral character”).We must understand that for the preservation of Western 
interests, there is no reasonable alternative to the construction 
of such a base of power in territories over which we possess 
direct sovereignty.We cannot maintain the “historic connec¬ 
tion” between Asia and the West unless we participate in Asian 
affairs “through the exercise of power and influence.” We must 
accept “the fact that we are engaged in a serious struggle for 
cultural survival that involves that continuous presence of 
Western-oriented communities” in Asia.It is an illusion to be¬ 
lieve that we can retreat from Asia and leave it to its own 
devices, for our own Western culture must be understood as “a 
minority movement of recent date in the evolution of civiliza¬ 
tion.” and it cannot be taken for granted that Asia will remain
