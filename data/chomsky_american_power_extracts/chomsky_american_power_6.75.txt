If we 
fail to establish “our industrial enterprise system” universally, 
we will have to “defend our privileges and gains by means of 
the continuing, brutalizing, and costly exercise of superior force 
in every corner of the globe.” 

Why are we justified in forceful intervention in the affairs of 
Asia?“One obvious justification for United States intervention 
in Asian affairs lies in our leadership of the world struggle 
against communism.Communist political and economic infiltra¬ 
tion among a majority of the world’s peoples appears to Ameri¬ 
can political leadership to be fatal to our safety and progress; 
this attitude is supported almost unanimously by public opin¬ 
ion.” Pursuing this logic a few steps further, we will soon have 
the same “obvious justification” for taking out China with nu¬ 
clear weapons—and perhaps France as well, for good meas¬ 
ure.Further justification is that the defense of our western sea¬ 
board “requires that the North Pacific be controlled as a virtual 
American lake,” a fact which “provides one basis for United 
States intervention in power struggles throughout the region,” 
to preserve the security of this mare nostrum .Our “victory over 
Japan left a power vacuum in Southeast Asia and the Far East 
that was tempting to communist aggression; therefore, we had 
to step in and use our military power.” “Island possessions, such 
as Guam, those of the strategic trust territories, and probably 
Okinawa, remain indispensable, if not to the narrow defense of 
our shores, certainly to the military posture essential to our total 
security and world aims .” 45 Apart from the magnificent scope 
of this vision, rarely equaled by our forerunners, the termi¬ 
nology is not unfamiliar.
