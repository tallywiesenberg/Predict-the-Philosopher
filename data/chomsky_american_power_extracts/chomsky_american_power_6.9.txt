that ideology will in general serve as a mask for self-interest, 
then it is a natural presumption that intellectuals, in interpret¬

position, condemning popular movements and mass participa¬

for supervision by those who possess the knowledge and under¬ 
standing that is required (so they claim) to manage society and 
control social change.
