of this view is given by Anton Pannekoek, the Dutch scientist and 
spokesman for libertarian communism, in his Workers Councils (Mel¬ 
bourne, 1950), pp. 36-37: 

It is not for the first time that a ruling class tries to explain, and 
so to perpetuate, its rule as the consequences of an inborn difference 
between two kinds of people, one destined by nature to ride, the 
other to be ridden. The landowning aristocracy of former centuries 
defended their privileged position by boasting their extraction from a 
nobler race of conquerors that had subdued the lower race of common 
people. Big capitalists explain their dominating place by the assertion 
that they have brains and other people have none. In the same way 
now especially the intellectuals, considering themselves the rightful 
rulers of to-morrow, claim their spiritual superiority. They form the 
rapidly increasing class of university-trained officials and free pro¬ 
fessions, specialized in mental work, in study of books and of science,

and they consider themselves as the people most gifted with intellect. 
Hence they are destined to be leaders of the production, whereas the 
ungifted mass shall execute the manual work, for which no brains are 
needed. They are no defenders of capitalism; not capital, but intellect 
should direct labor. The more so, since now society is such a compli¬ 
cated structure, based on abstract and difficult science, that only the 
highest intellectual acumen is capable of embracing, grasping and 
handling it. Should the working masses, from lack of insight, fail to 
acknowledge this need of superior intellectual lead, should they stupidly 
try to take the direction into their own hands, chaos and ruin will be 
the inevitable consequence.

similarities between the emergence of a scientific elite in the Soviet 
Union and the United States, in their growing role in decision making, 
citing Bell’s thesis in support. See the New York Times , March 27, 
1966, reporting on the Midwest Slavic Conference.
