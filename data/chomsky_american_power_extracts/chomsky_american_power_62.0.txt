are so fragmentary that it would no doubt be foolhardy to attempt a 
general evaluation. Still, all the reports I have been able to study 
suggest that insofar as real successes were achieved in the several 
stages of land reform, mutual aid, collectivization, and formation of 
communes, they were traceable in large part to the complex interac¬ 
tion of the Communist party cadres and the gradually evolving peas¬ 
ant associations, a relation which seems to stray far from the Leninist 
model of organization. This is particularly evident in William Hinton’s 
magnificent study Fanshen (New York, Monthly Review Press, 
1966), which is unparalleled, to my knowledge, as an analysis of a 
moment of profound revolutionary change. What seems to me particu¬ 
larly striking in his account of the early stages of revolution in one 
Chinese village is not only the extent to which party cadres submitted 
themselves to popular control, but also, and more significant, the ways 
in which exercise of control over steps of the revolutionary process 
was a factor in developing the consciousness and insight of those who 
took part in the revolution, not only from a political and social point 
of view, but also with respect to the human relationships that were 
created. It is interesting, in this connection, to note the strong populist 
element in early Chinese Marxism. For some very illuminating ob¬ 
servations about this general matter, see Maurice Meisner, Li Ta-chao 
and the Origins of Chinese Marxism (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard 
University Press, 1967). 

I am not suggesting that the anarchist revolution in Spain—with its

background of more than thirty years of education and struggle—is 
being relived in Asia, but rather that the spontaneous and voluntary 
elements in popular mass movements have probably been seriously 
misunderstood because of the instinctive antipathy towards such 
phenomena among intellectuals, and more recently, because of the 
insistence on interpreting them in terms of Cold War mythology.

Los anarquistas en la crisis politka espanola (Buenos Aires, Editorial 
Alfa-Argentina, 1964). This highly informative book should certainly 
be made available to an English-speaking audience.
