59. An exception to the rather general failure to deal with the an¬ 
archist revolution is Hugh Thomas' “Anarchist Agrarian Collectives 
in the Spanish Civil War,” in Martin Gilbert, ed., A Century of Con¬ 
flict, 1850-1950: Essays for A. J. P. Taylor (New York, Atheneum 
Publishers, 1967), pp. 245-63. See note 106 below for some discus¬ 
sion. There is also much useful information in what to my mind is the 
best general history of the Civil War, La Revolution et la guerre 
d'Espagne, by Pierre Broue and Emile Temime (Paris, Les Editions de 
Minuit, 1961). A concise and informative recent account is contained 
in Daniel Guerin, UAnarchisme (Paris, Gallimard, 1965). In his ex¬ 
tensive study, The Spa?iish Civil War (New York, Harper & Row, 
Publishers, 1961; paperback ed. 1963), Hugh Thomas barely refers to 
the popular revolution, and some of the major events are not men¬ 
tioned at all—see, for example, note 97 below. 

60. Collectivisations: Voeuvre constructive de la Revolution espag- 
nole, 2nd ed. (Toulouse, Editions C.N.T., 1965). The first edition was 
published in Barcelona (Editions C.N.T.-F.A.I., 1937). There is an 
excellent and sympathetic summary by the Marxist scholar Karl 
Korsch, “Collectivization in Spain,” in Living Marxism , Vol. 4 (April 
1939), pp. 179-82. In the same issue (pp. 170-71), the liberal-Com- 
munist reaction to the Spanish Civil War is summarized succinctly, 
and I believe accurately, as follows: “With their empty chatter as to 
the wonders of Bolshevik discipline, the geniality of Caballero, and the 
passions of the Pasionaria, the ‘modern liberals' merely covered up 
their real desire for the destruction of all revolutionary possibilities in

the Civil War, and their preparation for the possible war over the 
Spanish issue in the interest of their diverse fatherlands . . . what was 
truly revolutionary in the Spanish Civil War resulted from the direct 
actions of the workers and pauperized peasants, and not because of a 
specific form of labor organization nor an especially gifted leader¬ 
ship.” I think that the record bears out this analysis, and I also think 
that it is this fact that accounts for the distaste for the revolutionary 
phase of the Civil War and its neglect in historical scholarship. 

61. An illuminating eyewitness account of this period is that of Franz 
Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit (1938; reprinted Ann Arbor, Univer¬ 
sity of Michigan Press, 1963).
