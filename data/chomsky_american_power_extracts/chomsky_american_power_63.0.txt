63. A useful account of this period is given by Felix Morrow, Revo¬ 
lution and Counter-Revolution in Spain (1938; reprinted London, 
New Park Publications, 1963). 

64. Cited by Camillo Berneri in his “Lettre ouverte a la camarade 
Frederica [sic] Montseny,” Guerre de classes en Espagne (Paris, 
1946), a collection of items translated from his journal Guerra di 
Classe. Berneri was the oustanding anarchist intellectual in Spain. He 
opposed the policy of joining the government and argued for an al¬ 
ternative, more typically anarchist strategy to which I will return 
below. His own view towards joining the government was stated suc¬ 
cinctly by a Catalan worker whom he quotes, with reference to the 
Republic of 1931: “It is always the old dog with a new collar.” Events 
were to prove the accuracy of this analysis. 

Berneri had been a leading spokesman of Italian anarchism. He left 
Italy after Mussolini’s rise to power, and came to Barcelona on July 
19, 1936. He formed the first Italian units for the antifascist war, 
according to anarchist historian Rudolf Rocker ( The Tragedy of Spain 
[New York, Freie Arbeiter Stimme, 1937], p. 44). He was murdered, 
along with his older comrade Barbieri, during the May Days of 1937. 
(Arrested on May 5 by the Communist-controlled police, he was shot 
during the following night.) Hugh Thomas, in The Spanish Civil War , 
p. 428, suggests that “the assassins may have been Italian Commu¬ 
nists” rather than the police. Thomas’ book, which is largely devoted 
to military history, mentions Berneri’s murder but makes no other 
reference to his ideas or role. 

Berneri’s name does not appear in Jackson’s history.

spiracy in the Spanish Civil War (New York, Frederick A. Praeger, 
Inc., 1961), p. 86. This book, by a UP correspondent in Spain during 
the Civil War, contains a great deal of important documentary evi¬ 
dence bearing on the questions considered here. The attitude of the 
wealthy farmers of this area, most of them former supporters of the 
right-wing organizations that had now disappeared, is well described 
by the general secretary of the Peasant Federation, Julio Mateu: 
“Such is the sympathy for us [that is, the Communist party] in the 
Valencia countryside that hundreds and thousands of farmers would 
join our party if we were to let them. These farmers . . . love our party 
like a sacred thing . . . they [say] The Communist Party is our party.’ 
Comrades, what emotion the peasants display when they utter these 
words” (cited in Bolloten, p. 86). There is some interesting specula¬
