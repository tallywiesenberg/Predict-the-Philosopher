tion about the backgrounds for the writing of this very important book 
in H. R. Southworth, Le mythe de la croisade de Franco (Ruedo 
Iberico, Paris, 1964; Spanish edition, same publisher, 1963). 

The Communist headquarters in Valencia had on the wall two 
posters: “Respect the property of the small peasant” and “Respect the 
property of the small industrialist” (Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit, 
p. 117). Actually, it was the rich farmer as well who sought protection 
from the Communists, whom Borkenau describes as constituting the 
extreme right wing of the Republican forces. By early 1937, according 
to Borkenau, the Communist party was “to a large extent ... the party 
of the military and administrative personnel, in the second place the 
party of the petty bourgeoisie and certain well-to-do peasant groups, in 
the third place the party of the employees, and only in the fourth place 
the party of the industrial workers” (p. 192). The party also attracted 
many police and army officers. The police chief in Madrid and the 
chief of intelligence, for example, were party members. In general, the 
party, which had been insignificant before the revolution, “gave the 
urban and rural middle classes a powerful access of life and vigour” as 
it defended them from the revolutionary forces (Bolloten, op. cit., p. 
86). Gerald Brenan describes the situation as follows, in The Spanish 
Labyrinth (1943; reprinted Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 
1960), p. 325: 

Unable to draw to themselves the manual workers, who remained 
firmly fixed in their unions, the Communists found themselves the 
refuge for all those who had suffered from the excesses of the Revolu-

tion or who feared where it might lead them. Well-to-do Catholic 
orange-growers in Valencia, peasants in Catalonia, small shopkeepers 
and business men, Army officers and Government officials enrolled in 
their ranks. . . . Thus [in Catalonia] one had a strange and novel 
situation: on the one side stood the huge compact proletariat of 
Barcelona with its long revolutionary tradition, and on the other the 
white-collar workers and petite bourgeoisie of the city, organized 
and armed by the Communist party against it. 

Actually, the situation that Brenan describes is not as strange a one 
as he suggests. It is, rather, a natural consequence of Bolshevik elitism 
that the “Red bureaucracy” should act as a counterrevolutionary force 
except under the conditions where its present or future representatives 
are attempting to seize power for themselves, in the name of the 
masses whom they pretend to represent.
