66. Bolloten, op . cit., p. 189. The legalization of revolutionary actions 
already undertaken and completed recalls the behavior of the “revolu¬ 
tionary vanguard” in the Soviet Union in 1918. Cf. Arthur Rosenberg, 
A History of Bolshevism (1932; republished in translation from the 
original German, New York, Russell and Russell, Publishers, 1965), 
Ch. 6. He describes how the expropriations, “accomplished as the 
result of spontaneous action on the part of workers and against the 
will of the Bolsheviks,” were reluctantly legalized by Lenin months 
later and then placed under central party control. On the relation of 
the Bolsheviks to the anarchists in postrevolutionary Russia, inter¬ 
preted from a pro-anarchist point of view, see Guerin, UAnarchisme, 
pp. 96-125. See also Avrich, op. cit., Part II, pp. 123-254.

Catalonia (1938; reprinted New York, Harcourt, Brace & World, 
1952, and Boston, Beacon Press, 1955; quotations in this book from 
Beacon Press edition). This brilliant book received little notice at the 
time of its first publication, no doubt because the picture Orwell drew 
was in sharp conflict with established liberal dogma. The attention that 
it has received as a cold-war document since its republication in 1952 
would, I suspect, have been of little comfort to the author.

these interests were, to a large extent, protected by Franco.

essential accuracy of Borkenau’s account that I think Hobsbawm {op. 
cit.) is quite mistaken in believing that the Communist policy “was 
undoubtedly the only one which could have won the Civil War.” In 
fact, the Communist policy was bound to fail, because it was predi¬
