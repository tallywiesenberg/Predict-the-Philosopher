As a Social Democrat I speak here with inner joy and sincere 
admiration of my experience in Catalonia. The anti-capitalist trans¬ 
formation took place here without their having to resort to a dictator¬ 
ship. The members of the syndicates are their own masters, and carry 
on production and the distribution of the products of labor under their 
own management with the advice of technical experts in whom they 
have confidence. The enthusiasm of the workers is so great that they 
scorn any personal advantage and are concerned only for the welfare 
of all. 

Even Borkenau concludes, rather grudgingly, that industry was func¬ 
tioning fairly well, as far as he could see. The matter deserves a 
serious study.

83. Ibid. Richards suggests that the refusal of the central government 
to support the Aragon front may have been motivated in part by the 
general policy of counterrevolution. ‘‘This front, largely manned by 
members of the C.N.T.-F.A.I., was considered of great strategic im¬ 
portance by the anarchists, having as its ultimate objective the linking 
of Catalonia with the Basque country and Asturias, i.e., a linking of 
the industrial region [of Catalonia] w r ith an important source of raw 
materials.” Again, it would be interesting to undertake a detailed in¬ 
vestigation of this topic. 

That the Communists withheld arms from the Aragon front seems 
established beyond question, and it can hardly be doubted that the 
motivation was political. See, for example, D. T. Cattell, Communism 
and the Spanish Civil War (1955; reprinted New York, Russell and 
Russell, Publishers, 1965), p. 110. Cattell, who in general bends over 
backwards to try to justify the behavior of the central government, 
concludes that in this case there is little doubt that the refusal of aid 
was politically motivated. Brenan takes the same view, claiming that 
the Communists “kept the Aragon front without arms to spite the 
Anarchists.” The Communists resorted to some of the most grotesque

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


slanders to explain the lack of arms on the Aragon front; for example, 
the Daily Worker attributed the arms shortage to the fact that “the 
Trotskyist General Kopp had been carting enormous supplies of arms 
and ammunition across no-man’s land to the fascists” (cited by Mor¬ 
row, op. cit., p. 145). As Morrow points out, George Kopp is a 
particularly bad choice as a target for such accusations. His record is
