December (pp. 4-5), when he arrived for the first time, deserves more 
extensive quotation: 

It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the 
working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any 
size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or 
with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was 
scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the 
revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its 
images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically 
demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and cafe had an 
inscription saying that it had been collectivized; even the bootblacks 
had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters 
and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal. 
Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily dis¬ 
appeared. Nobody said “Senor” or “Don” or even “Usted”; everyone 
called everyone else “Comrade” and “Thou,” and said “Salud!” instead 
of “Buenos dias.” Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time 
of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a 
lecture from an hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There 
were no private motor cars, they had all been commandeered, and all 
the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted 
red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere, flaming 
from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining 
advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the Ramblas, the wide 
central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed con¬ 
stantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were bellowing revolutionary 
songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the 
crowds that was the queerest thing of all. In outward appearance it 
was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to 
exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were 
no “well-dressed” people at all. Practically everyone wore rough 
working-class clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of the militia 
uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in it that 
I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I 
recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for. Also 
I believed that things were as they appeared, that this was really 
a workers’ State and that the entire bourgeoisie had either fled, been

killed, or voluntarily come over to the workers’ side; I did not realize 
that great numbers of well-to-do bourgeois were simply lying low and
