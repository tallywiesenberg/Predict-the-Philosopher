peasants without enthusiasm, who would sabotage it until it failed. Vol¬ 
untary collectivization may seem the longer course, but the example of 
the small, well-managed collective will attract the entire peasantry, 
who are profoundly realistic and practical, whereas forced collectiviza¬ 
tion would end by discrediting socialized agriculture” (cited by Bolloten 
op. cit., p. 59). However, there seems no doubt that the precepts of 
the anarchist and left-socialist spokesmen were often violated in prac¬ 
tice. 

92. Borkenau, The Spanish Cockpit, pp. 219-20. Of this officer, Jack- 
son says only that he was “a dependable professional officer.” After 
the fall of Malaga, Lieutenant Colonel Villalba was tried for treason, 
for having deserted the headquarters and abandoned his troops. Broue 
and Temime remark that it is difficult to determine what justice there 
was in the charge.

tory: The Policy of the Communist Party of Spam Explained (Lon¬ 
don, Communist Party of Great Britain, n.d.), cited by Richards, op. 
cit., pp. 99-100. There was no accusation that the phone service was 
restricted, but only that the revolutionary workers could maintain “a 
close check on the conversations that took place between the politi¬ 
cians.” As Richards further observes, “It is, of course, a quite different 
matter when the ‘indiscreet ear’ is that of the O.G.P.U.”

95. Jackson, op. cit., p. 370. Thomas suggests that Sese was probably 
killed accidentally ( The Spanish Civil War, p. 428). 

96. The anarchist mayor of the border town of Puigcerda had been 
assassinated in April, after Negrin’s carabineros had taken over the 
border posts. That same day a prominent UGT member, Roldan Cor- 
tada, was murdered in Barcelona, it is presumed by CNT militants. 
This presumption is disputed by Peirats ( Los Anarquistas: see note 
58), who argues, with some evidence, that the murder may have been 
a Stalinist provocation. In reprisal, a CNT man was killed. Orwell, 
whose eyewitness account of the May Days is unforgettable, points 
out that “One can gauge the attitude of the foreign capitalist Press 
towards the Communist-Anarchist feud by the fact that Roldan's 
murder was given wide publicity, while the answering murder was 
carefully unmentioned” (op. cit., p. 119). Similarly, one can gauge 
Jackson’s attitude towards this struggle by his citation of Sese’s murder 
as a critical event, while the murder of Berneri goes unmentioned (cf.
