siderable social success” and must have had strong popular support, but he 
is more doubtful about their economic viability. His suggestion that 
“Communist pressure on the collectives may have given them the nec¬ 
essary urge to survive” seems quite unwarranted, as does his sugges¬ 
tion that “the very existence of the war . . . may have been responsible 
for some of the success the collectives had.” On the contrary, their

success and spontaneous creation throughout Republican Spain sug¬ 
gest that they answered to deeply felt popular sentiments, and both the 
war and Communist pressure appear to have been highly disruptive 
factors—ultimately, of course, destructive factors. 

Other dubious conclusions are that “in respect of redistribution of 
wealth, anarchist collectives were hardly much improvement over 
capitalism” since “no effective way of limiting consumption in richer 
collectives was devised to help poorer ones,” and that there was no 
possibility of developing large-scale planning. On the contrary, Bol- 
loten {op. cit.y pp. 176-79) points out that “In order to remedy the 
defects of collectivization, as well as to iron out discrepancies in the 
living standards of the workers in flourishing and impoverished enter¬ 
prises, the Anarchosyndicalists, although rootedly opposed to nation¬ 
alization, advocated the centralization—or, socialization, as they 
called it—under trade union control, of entire branches of produc¬ 
tion.” He mentions a number of examples of partial socialization that 
had some success, citing as the major difficulty that prevented still 
greater progress the insistence of the Communist party and the UGT 
leadership—though apparently not all of the rank-and-file members of 
the UGT—on government ownership and control. According to Rich¬ 
ards {op. cit ., p. 82): “In June, 1937 ... a National Plenum of 
Regional Federations of Peasants was held in Valencia to discuss the 
formation of a National Federation of Peasants for the co-ordination 
and extension of the collectivist movement and also to ensure an 
equitable distribution of the produce of the land, not only between the 
collectives but for the whole country. Again in Castille in October 
1937, a merging of the 100,000 members of the Regional Federation 
of Peasants and the 13,000 members in the food distributive trades 
took place. It represented a logical step in ensuring better co-ordina¬ 
tion, and was accepted for the whole of Spain at the National Con¬ 
gress of Collectives held in Valencia in November 1937.” Still other 
plans were under consideration for regional and national coordination 
—see, for example, D. A. de Santillan, After the Revolution (New 
York, Greenberg Publisher, Inc., 1937), for some ideas.
