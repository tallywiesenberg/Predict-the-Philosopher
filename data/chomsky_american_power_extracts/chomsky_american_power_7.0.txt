,?48 Pursuing the parallel for a moment, it might be asked 
whether the left-wing critique of Leninist elitism can be ap¬ 
plied, under very different conditions, to the liberal ideology of 
the intellectual elite that aspires to a dominant role in managing 
the welfare state.Rosa Luxemburg, in 1918, argued that Bolshevik elitism 
would lead to a state of society in which the bureaucracy alone 
would remain an active element in social life—though now it 
would be the “red bureaucracy” of that State Socialism that 
Bakunin had long before described as “the most vile and terri¬ 
ble lie that our century has created.” 49 A true social revolution 
requires a “spiritual transformation in the masses degraded by 
centuries of bourgeois class rule”; 50 “it is only by extirpating 
the habits of obedience and servility to the last root that the 
working class can acquire the understanding of a new form of 
discipline, self-discipline arising from free consent.” 51 Writing 
in 1904, she predicted that Lenin’s organizational concepts 
would “enslave a young labor movement to an intellectual elite 
hungry for power ...and turn it into an automaton manipu¬ 
lated by a Central Committee.” 52 In the Bolshevik elitist doc¬ 
trine of 1918 she saw a disparagement of the creative, spon¬ 
taneous, self-correcting force of mass action, which alone, she

tion and produce the spiritual transformation that is the essence 
of a true social revolution.
