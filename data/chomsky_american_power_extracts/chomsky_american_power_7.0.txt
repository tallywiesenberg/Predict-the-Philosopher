Vietnamese rangers move through their hamlet. Children had been 
rescued from a bunker under their house, burnt down when U.S. 
helicopters fired on Vietcong. The scene is the Mekong Delta, south¬ 
west of Saigon. 

I cannot describe the pathos of this scene, or the expression on 
the face of the wounded child. How many hundreds of such 
pictures must we see before we begin to care and to act? 

I suppose this is the first time in history that a nation has so 
openly and publicly exhibited its own war crimes. Perhaps this 
shows how well our free institutions function. Or does it simply 
show how immune we have become to suffering? Probably the 
latter. So at least it would seem, when we observe how opposi¬ 
tion to the war has grown in recent months. There is no doubt 
that the primary cause for this opposition is that the cost of the 
war to us is too great, unacceptable. It is deplorable, but none¬ 
theless true, that what has changed American public opinion 
and the domestic political picture is not the efforts of the “peace 
movement”—still less the declarations of any political spokes¬ 
men—but rather the Vietnamese resistance, which simply will 
not yield to American force. What is more, the “responsible” 
attitude is that opposition to the war on grounds of cost is not, 
as I have said, deplorable, but rather admirable, in keeping 
with the genius of American politics. American politics is a 
politics of accommodation that successfully excludes moral 
considerations. Therefore it is quite proper—a further demon¬ 
stration of our superior acuity—that only pragmatic considera¬ 
tions of cost and utility guide our actions. When Martin Luther

Introduction 


King was assassinated, Kenneth Clark said that “you have to 
weep for this country.” Are we to weep, or to laugh, when we 
read in the editorial columns of our great newspapers, and in 
much of the left-liberal press, that the health of our democratic 
system has been confirmed by Johnson's speech of March 31? 
With the collapse of his Vietnam policies, a serious international 
economic crisis, and domestic turmoil threatening to make the 
country impossible to govern, the President made a “noble” and 
“magnanimous” gesture—“the ultimate sacrifice for peace,” in 
the words of one senator: he announced that he would not seek 
renomination. This proves the viability of American democracy. 
By these standards a still more viable democracy was that of 
fascist Japan in the late 1930s, where more than a dozen cabi¬
