As Bolshevik practice hardened into 
dogma, the fear of popular initiative and spontaneous mass 
action, not under the direction and control of the properly des¬ 
ignated vanguard, became a dominant element of so-called 
“Communist” ideology.Antagonism to mass movements and to social change that 
escapes the control of privileged elites is also a prominent fea¬ 
ture of contemporary liberal ideology.53 Expressed as foreign 
policy, it takes the form described earlier.To conclude this 
discussion of counterrevolutionary subordination, I would like 
to investigate how, in one rather crucial case, this particular 
bias in American liberal ideology can be detected even in the 
interpretation of events of the past in which American involve¬ 
ment was rather slight, and in historical work of very high 
caliber.In 1966, the American Historical Association gave its biennial 
award for the most outstanding work on European history to 
Gabriel Jackson, for his study of Spain in the 1930s.
