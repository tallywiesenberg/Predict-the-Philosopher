My reason for wanting to 
investigate an outstanding liberal analysis of the Spanish Civil 
War is therefore twofold: first, because of the intrinsic interest 
of these events; and second, because of the insight that this 
analysis may provide with respect to the underlying elitist bias 
which I believe to be at the root of the phenomenon of counter¬ 
revolutionary subordination.In his study of the Spanish Republic, Jackson makes no at¬ 
tempt to hide his own commitment in favor of liberal democ¬ 
racy, as represented by such figures as Azana, Casares Quiroga, 
Martinez Barrio, 55 and the other “responsible national leaders.” 
In taking this position, he speaks for much of liberal scholar¬ 
ship ; it is fair to say that figures similar to those just mentioned 
would be supported by American liberals, were this possible, in 
Latin America, Asia, or Africa.Furthermore, Jackson makes 
little attempt to disguise his antipathy towards the forces of 
popular revolution in Spain, or their goals.It is no criticism of Jackson’s study that his point of view and 
sympathies are expressed with such clarity.On the contrary, the 
value of this work as an interpretation of historical events is 
enhanced by the fact that the author’s commitments are made 
so clear and explicit.
