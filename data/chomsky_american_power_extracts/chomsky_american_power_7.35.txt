The drama and pathos of 
the Spanish Civil War have by no means faded; witness the 
impact a few years ago of the film To Die in Madrid.Yet in this 
film (as Daniel Guerin points out) one finds no reference to the 
popular revolution that had transformed much of Spanish society.I will be concerned here with the events of 1936—1937, 61 and 
with one particular aspect of the complex struggle involving 
Franco Nationalists, Republicans (including the Communist 
party), anarchists, and socialist workers’ groups.The Franco 
insurrection in July 1936 came against a background of several 
months of strikes, expropriations, and battles between peasants 
and Civil Guards.The left-wing Socialist leader Largo Cabal¬ 
lero had demanded in June that the workers be armed, but was 
refused by Azana.
