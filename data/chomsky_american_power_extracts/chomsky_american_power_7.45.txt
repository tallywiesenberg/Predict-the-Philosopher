The revolution was “apoliti¬ 
cal,” in the sense that its organs of power and administration 
remained separate from the central Republican government 
and, even after several anarchist leaders entered the government 
in the autumn of 1936, continued to function fairly independ¬ 
ently until the revolution was finally crushed between the 
fascist and Communist-led Republican forces.The success of 
collectivization of industry and commerce in Barcelona im¬ 
pressed even highly unsympathetic observers such as Borkenau.The scale of rural collectivization is indicated by these data 
from anarchist sources: in Aragon, 450 collectives with half a 
million members; in the Levant, 900 collectives accounting for 
about half the agricultural production and 70 percent of mar¬ 
keting in this, the richest agricultural region of Spain; in Castile, 
300 collectives with about 100,000 members.62 In Catalonia, 
the bourgeois government headed by Companys retained 
nominal authority, but real power was in the hands of the 
anarchist-dominated committees.The period of July through September may be characterized
