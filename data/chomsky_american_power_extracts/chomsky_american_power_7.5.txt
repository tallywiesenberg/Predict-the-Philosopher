63 A number of anarchist leaders joined the govern¬ 
ment ; the reason, as stated by Federica Montseny on January 3, 
1937, was this: ..the anarchists have entered the government 
to prevent the Revolution from deviating and in order to carry 
it further beyond the war, and also to oppose any dictatorial 
tendency, from wherever it might come.’ 764 The central gov¬ 
ernment fell increasingly under Communist control—in Cata¬ 
lonia, under the control of the Communist-dominated PSUC— 
largely as a result of the valuable Russian military assistance.Communist success was greatest in the rich farming areas of the 
Levant (the government moved to Valencia, capital of one of 
the provinces), where prosperous farm owners flocked to the 
Peasant Federation that the party had organized to protect the 
wealthy farmers; this federation “served as a powerful instru¬ 
ment in checking the rural collectivization promoted by the 
agricultural workers of the province.” 65 Elsewhere as well, 
counterrevolutionary successes reflected increasing Communist 
dominance of the Republic.The first phase of the counterrevolution was the legalization 
and regulation of those accomplishments of the revolution that 
appeared irreversible.
