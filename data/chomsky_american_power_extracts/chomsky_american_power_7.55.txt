A decree of October 7 by the Commu¬ 
nist Minister of Agriculture, Vicente Uribe, legalized certain 
expropriations—namely, of lands belonging to participants in 
the Franco revolt.Of course, these expropriations had already 
taken place, a fact that did not prevent the Communist press 
from describing the decree as “the most profoundly revolution¬ 
ary measure that has been taken since the military uprising.” 66 
In fact, by exempting the estates of landowners who had not 
directly participated in the Franco rebellion, the decree repre¬ 
sented a step backward, from the standpoint of the revolu¬ 
tionaries, and it was criticized not only by the CNT but also by

the Socialist Federation of Land Workers, affiliated with the 
UGT.The demand for a much broader decree was unaccepta¬ 
ble to the Communist-led ministry, since the Communist party 
was “seeking support among the propertied classes in the anti- 
Franco coup” and hence “could not afford to repel the small 
and medium proprietors who had been hostile to the working 
class movement before the civil war.” 67 These “small proprie¬ 
tors,” in fact, seem to have included owners of substantial 
estates.The decree compelled tenants to continue paying rent 
unless the landowners had supported Franco, and by guaran¬ 
teeing former landholdings, it prevented distribution of land to 
the village poor.Ricardo Zabalza, general secretary of the Fed¬ 
eration of Land Workers, described the resulting situation as 
one of “galling injustice”; “the sycophants of the former political 
bosses still enjoy a privileged position at the expense of those 
persons who were unable to rent even the smallest parcel of 
land, because they were revolutionaries.” 63 

To complete the stage of legalization and restriction of what 
had already been achieved, a decree of October 24, 1936, 
promulgated by a CNT member who had become Councilor for 
Economy in the Catalonian Generalitat, gave legal sanction to 
the collectivization of industry in Catalonia.
