Despite this 
the Spanish revolutionaries have not grasped at the disastrous 
expedient of dictatorship, but have respected all honest convic¬ 
tions.Everyone who visited Barcelona after the July battles, 
whether friend or foe of the C.N.T., was surprised at the freedom 
of public life and the absence of any arrangements for suppress¬ 
ing the free expression of opinion.For two decades the supporters of Bolshevism have been 
hammering it into the masses that dictatorship is a vital necessity 
for the defense of the so-called proletarian interests against the 
assaults of the counter-revolution and for paving the way for 
Socialism.They have not advanced the cause of Socialism by this 
propaganda, but have merely smoothed the way for Fascism in 
Italy, Germany and Austria by causing millions of people to 
forget that dictatorship, the most extreme form of tyranny, can 
never lead to social liberation.In Russia, the so-called dictator¬ 
ship of the proletariat has not led to Socialism, but to the domi¬ 
nation of a new bureaucracy over the proletariat and the whole 
people.
