However, I do not think that one can comprehend the events in 
Spain without attaining this perspective.With this brief sketch—partisan, but I think accurate—for 
background, I would like to turn to Jackson’s account of this 
aspect of the Spanish Civil War (see note 54).Jackson presumes (p. 259) that Soviet support for the Repub¬ 
lican cause in Spain was guided by two factors: first, concern 
for Soviet security; second, the hope that a Republican victory 
would advance “the cause of worldwide people’s revolution’ 
with which Soviet leaders hoped to identify themselves.” They 
did not press their revolutionary aims, he feels, because “for the 
moment it was essential not to frighten the middle classes or the 
Western governments.” 

As to the concern for Soviet security, Jackson is no doubt 
correct.It is clear that Soviet support of the Republic was one 
aspect of the attempt to make common cause with the Western 
democracies against the fascist threat.However, Jackson’s con¬ 
ception of the Soviet Union as a revolutionary power—hopeful 
that a Republican victory would advance “the interrupted 
movement toward world revolution” and seeking to identify it¬ 
self with “the cause of the world-wide ‘people’s revolution’ ” 
—seems to me entirely mistaken.
