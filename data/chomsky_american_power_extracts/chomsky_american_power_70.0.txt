“More than 600 organizers of collectives have been arrested. The 
government has appointed management committees that seized the 
warehouses and distributed their contents at random. Land, draught 
animals, and tools were given to individual families or to the fascists 
who had been spared by the revolution. The harvest was distributed in 
the same way. The animals raised by the collectives suffered the same

fate. A great number of collectivized pig farms, stables, and dairies 
were destroyed. In certain communes, such as Bordon and Calaceite, 
even seed was confiscated and the peasants are now unable to work 
the land.” 

The estimate that 30% of the collectives were destroyed is consistent 
with figures reported by Peirats ( Los anarquistas en la crisis politica 
espahola, p. 300). He points out that only 200 delegates attended the 
congress of collectives of Aragon in September 1937 (“held under the 
shadow of the bayonets of the Eleventh Division” of Lister) as com¬ 
pared with 500 delegates at the congress of the preceding February. 
Peirats states that an army division of Catalan separatists and another 
division of the PSUC also occupied parts of Aragon during this opera¬ 
tion, while three anarchist divisions remained at the front, under or¬ 
ders from the CNT-FAI leadership. Compare Jackson’s explanation of 
the occupation of Aragon: “The peasants were known to hate the 
Consejo, the anarchists had deserted the front during the Barcelona 
fighting, and the very existence of the Consejo was a standing chal¬ 
lenge to the authority of the central government” (italics mine). 

10S. Regarding Bolloten’s work, Jackson has this to say: “Throughout 
the present chapter, I have drawn heavily on this carefully docu¬ 
mented study of the Communist Party in 1936-37. It is unrivaled in its 
coverage of the wartime press, of which Bolloten, himself a UP cor¬ 
respondent in Spain, made a large collection” (p. 363 n.).

given by Broue and Temime. Morrow also presents several passages 
from his journal, Guerra di Classe. A collection of his works would be 
a very useful contribution to our understanding of the Spanish Civil 
War and to the problems of revolutionary war in general.

Brenan, and Bolloten cited earlier. Neither Cattell nor Borkenau re¬ 
gards this decline of fighting spirit as a major factor, however.
