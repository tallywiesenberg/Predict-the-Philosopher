119. The fact was not lost on foreign journalists. Morrow {op. cit., p. 
68) quotes James Minifie in the New York Herald Tribune, April 28, 
1937: “A reliable police force is being built up quietly but surely. The 
Valencia government discovered an ideal instrument for this purpose 
in the Carabineros. These were formerly customs officers and guards, 
and always had a good reputation for loyalty. It is reported on good 
authority that 40,000 have been recruited for this force, and that 
20,000 have already been armed and equipped. . . . The anarchists 
have already noticed and complained about the increased strength of 
this force at a time when we all know there’s little enough traffic 
coming over the frontiers, land or sea. They realize that it will be used 
against them.” Consider what these soldiers, as well as Lister’s division 
or the asaltos described by Orwell, might have accomplished on the 
Aragon front, for example. Consider also the effect on the militiamen, 
deprived of arms by the central government, of the knowledge that 
these well-armed, highly trained troops were liquidating the accom¬ 
plishments of their revolution.
