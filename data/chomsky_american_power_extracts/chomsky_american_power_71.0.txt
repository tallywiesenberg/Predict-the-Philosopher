cialist Review, Vol. 6 (September 1937), pp. 7-9, 26. This reference 
was brought to my attention by William B. Watson. A striking example 
of the distortion introduced by the propaganda efforts of the 1930s is 
the strange story of the influential film The Spanish Earth, filmed in 
1937 by Joris Ivens with a text (written afterwards) by Hemingway— 
a project that was apparently initiated by Dos Passos. A very revealing 
account of this matter, and of the perception of the Civil War by 
Hemingway and Dos Passos, is given in W. B. Watson and Barton 
Whaley, “The Spanish Earth of Dos Passos and Hemingway,” un¬ 
published, 1967. The film dealt with the collectivized village of Fuen- 
tiduena in Valencia (a village collectivized by the UGT, incidentally). 
For the libertarian Dos Passos, the revolution was the dominant

theme; it was the antifascist war, however, that was to preoccupy 
Hemingway. The role of Dos Passos was quickly forgotten, because of 
the fact (as Watson and Whaley point out) that “Dos Passos had 
become anathema to the Left for his criticisms of communist policies 
in Spain.” 

124. As far as the East is concerned, Rocker ( The Tragedy of Spain, 
p. 25) claims that “the Russian press, for reasons that are easily 
understood, never uttered one least little word about the efforts of the 
Spanish workers and peasants at social reconstruction.” I cannot 
check the accuracy of this claim, but it would hardly be surprising if it 
were correct.

tional Repercussions of the Spanish Civil War ( 1935-1939 ) (The 
Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1951), p. 47, and Brenan, op . cit., p. 329, n. 
1. The conservative character of the Basque government was also, 
apparently, largely a result of French pressure. See Broue and Te- 
mime, op. cit., p. 172, no. 8.

(New York, Columbia University Press, 1962), pp. 86 f. This book 
gives a detailed and very insightful analysis of the international back¬ 
ground of the Civil War.
