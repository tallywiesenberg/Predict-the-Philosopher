government w r ere put under heavy pressure to withhold supplies from 
the Republic, although this too w*as quite legal. As noted, the Texaco 
Company was never even branded “unethical” or “unpatriotic,” these 
epithets of Roosevelt’s being reserved for those who tried to assist the 
Republic. The cynic might ask just w ? hy oil w ? as excluded from the 
Neutrality Act of January 1937, noting that wffiile Germany and Italy 
w r ere capable of supplying arms to Franco, they could not meet his 
demands for oil. 

The Texaco Oil Company continued to act upon the pro-Nazi sym¬ 
pathies of its head, Captain Thorkild Rieber, until August 1940, when 
the publicity began to be a threat to business. See Feis, op. cit., for 
further details. For more on these matters, see Richard P. Traina, 
American Diplomacy and the Spariish Civil War (Bloomington, Indiana 
University Press, 1968), pp. 166 f.

which Socialists, Communists, and anarchists sat w T as not without 
menace to American business interests both in Spain and Latin Amer¬ 
ica” (p. 165). Hull, incidentally, was in error about the acts of the 
Spanish government. The irresponsible left-wing elements had not 
been given arms but had seized them, thus preventing an immediate 
Franco victory.

was always proloyalist, and opposed both to Franco and to the revolu¬ 
tion. The attitude towards the latter is indicated with accuracy by this 
comparison, noted by Guttmann, p. 165: “300 people met in Union

Square to hear Liston Oak [see note 123] expose the Stalinists’ role in 
Spain; 20,000 met in Madison Square Garden to help Earl Browder 
and Norman Thomas celebrate the preservation of bourgeois democ¬

it should be noted that the Vatican recognized the Franco govern¬ 
ment de facto in August 1937 and de jure in May 1938. Immedi¬ 
ately upon Franco’s final victory, Pope Pius XII made the following 
statement: “Peace and victory have been willed by God to Spain . . . 
which has now given to proselytes of the materialistic atheism of our
