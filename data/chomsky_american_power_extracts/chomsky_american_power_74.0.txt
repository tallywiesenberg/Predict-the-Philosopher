priate as today. 

The task of the revolutionary pacifist is spelled out more fully 
in the final paragraph of the essay. 

Those who can bring themselves to renounce wealth, position and 
power accruing from a social system based on violence and put¬ 
ting a premium on acquisitiveness, and to identify themselves in 
some real fashion with the struggle of the masses toward the 
light, may help in a measure—more, doubtless, by life than by 
words—to devise a more excellent way, a technique of social 
progress less crude, brutal, costly and slow than mankind has yet 
evolved. 

It is a remarkable tribute to A. J. Muste that his life’s work 
can be measured by such standards as these. His essays are 
invariably thoughtful and provocative; his life, however, is an 
inspiration with hardly a parallel in twentieth-century America. 
Muste believed, with Gandhi, that “unjust laws and practices 
survive because men obey them and conform to them. This they 
do out of fear. There are things they dread more than the 
continuance of the evil.” He enriched half a century of Ameri¬ 
can history with a personal commitment to these simple truths. 
His efforts began in a time when “men believed that a better 
human order, a classless and warless world, a socialist society, if 
you please, could be achieved,” a time when the labor move-

ment could be described as “that remarkable combination of 
mass power, prophetic idealism and utopian hope.” They con¬ 
tinued through the general disillusionment of war and depres¬ 
sion and antiradical hysteria, to the days when American soci¬ 
ologists could proclaim that “the realization that escapes no one 
is that the egalitarian and socially mobile society which the 'free- 
floating intellectuals’ associated with the Marxist tradition have 
been calling for during the last hundred years has finally 
emerged in the form of our cumbersome, bureaucratic mass 
society, and has in turn engulfed the heretics.” 2 And finally, still 
not “engulfed,” he persisted in his refusal to be one of the 
obedient, docile men who are the terror of our time, to the 
moment when our “egalitarian and socially mobile society” is 
facing a virtual rebellion from the lower depths, when young 
men are being faced every day with the questions posed at 
Nuremberg as their country devotes itself to enforcing the “sta¬ 
bility” of the graveyard and the bulldozed village, and when 
the realization that escapes no one is that something is drasti¬
