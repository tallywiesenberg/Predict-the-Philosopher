spondingly, almost any policy is more rational than one that 
accepts repeated risk of nuclear war, hence a near guarantee of 
nuclear war in the long run—a “long run” that is unlikely to be 
very long, given the risks that policy makers are willing to 
accept. Thus in the Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy was willing 
(according to Sorensen’s memoirs) to accept a probability of

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


Vz to y 2 of nuclear war, in order to establish that the United 
States alone has the right to maintain missiles on the borders of 
a potential enemy. 6 And who knows what “probabilities” the 
CIA is now providing to the Rostows and the Wheelers who are 
trying to save something from their Vietnam fiasco by bombing 
at the Chinese border? Furthermore, it does not require an 
unusual political intelligence to urge world-wide de-escalation 
on the great power that by any objective standard is the most 
aggressive in the world—as measured by the number of gov¬ 
ernments maintained by force or subverted by intrigue, by 
troops and bases on foreign soil, by willingness to use the most 
awesome “killing machine” in history to enforce its concept of 
world order. 

It would be more enlightening to consider the program of 
revolutionary pacifism in the context of a decade ago, when 
international gangsterism was more widely distributed, with the 
British engaged in murderous repression in Kenya, the French 
fighting the last of their dirty colonial wars, and the Soviet 
Union consolidating its Eastern European empire with brutality 
and deceit. But it is the international situation of December 
1941 that provides the most severe test for Muste’s doctrine. 
There is a great deal to be learned from a study of the events 
that led up to an armed attack, by a competing imperialism, on 
American possessions and the forces defending them, and even 
more from a consideration of the varying reactions to these 
events and their aftermath. If Muste’s revolutionary pacifism is 
defensible as a general political program, then it must be defen¬ 
sible in these extreme circumstances. By arguing that it was, 
Muste isolated himself not only from any mass base, but also 
from all but a marginal fringe of American intellectuals. 

Writing in 1941, Muste saw the war as
