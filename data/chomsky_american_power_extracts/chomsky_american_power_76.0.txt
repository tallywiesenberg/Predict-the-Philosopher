1941 such a recommendation seemed as senseless as the pro¬ 
posal, today, that we support popular revolution. And at that 
moment, events and policy were taking a very different direc¬ 
tion. 

Since nothing of the sort was ever attempted, one can only 
speculate as to the possible outcome of such a course. The 
accuracy of Muste’s forecast unfortunately requires little com¬ 
ment. Furthermore, a plausible case can be made for his analy¬ 
sis of the then existing situation, a matter of more than aca¬ 
demic interest in view of developments in Asia since that 
time. 

As I mentioned, the point of view that Muste expressed was a 
rather isolated one. To see how little the intellectual climate has 
changed, it is enough to consider the lengthy debate over the 
decision to drop the bomb. What has been at issue is the ques¬ 
tion whether this constituted the last act of World War II or the 
first phase of American postwar diplomacy; or whether it was 
justified as a means of bringing the war to a quick conclusion. 
Only rarely has the question been raised whether there was any 
justification for American victory in the Pacific war; and this 
issue, where faced at all, has been posed in the context of the 
Cold War—that is, was it wise to have removed a counter¬ 
weight to growing Chinese power, soon to become “Commu¬ 
nist” power ? 

A fairly typical American view is probably that expressed by 
historian Louis Morton: 

In the late summer and autumn of 1945 the American people had 
every reason to rejoice. Germany and Japan had been defeated, 
and American troops, victorious everywhere, would soon be re¬ 
turning home. Unprecedented evil had been overcome by the 
greatest display of force ever marshaled in the cause of human 
freedom. , . . 9

The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


It is remarkable that such an attitude should be so blandly 
expressed and easily accepted. Is it true that in August 1945 the 
American people “had every reason to rejoice”—at the sight of a
