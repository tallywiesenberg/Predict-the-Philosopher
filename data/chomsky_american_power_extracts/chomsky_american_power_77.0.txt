soulless murder?” Several “were offended by the way the camp 
[Dachau] had been fixed up, prettified.” (Does the “prettifka- 
tion” of Hiroshima—or, to take a closer analogue, the prettifica- 
tion of Los Alamos—provoke the same response?) To their 
credit, a few refer to Vietnam; but not once is a question raised 
—even to be dismissed—as to American conduct in the Second 
World War, or the “emotional and moral burden” carried by 
those whose “parent generation” stood by while two atom 
bombs were used against a beaten and virtually defenseless 
enemy. 

To free ourselves from the conformism and moral blindness 
that have become a national scandal, it is a good idea occasion¬ 
ally to read the measured reactions of conservative Asians to 
some of our own exploits. Consider, for example, the words of 
the Indian justice Radhabinod Pal, the leading Asian voice at 
the Tokyo Tribunal that assessed the war guilt of the Japanese. 
In his carefully argued (and largely ignored) dissenting opin¬ 
ion to the decision of the tribunal, he has the following remarks 
to make: 

The Kaiser Wilhelm II was credited with a letter to the Austrian 

Kaiser Franz Joseph in the early days of that war, w'herein he 

stated as follows: “My soul is torn, but everything must be put to 

fire and sword; men, women and children and old men must be

methods of terrorism, which are alone capable of affecting a 
people as degenerate as the French, the war will be over in two 
months, whereas if I admit considerations of humanity it will be 
prolonged for years. In spite of my repugnance I have therefore 
been obliged to choose the former system.” 

This showed his ruthless policy, and this policy of indiscriminate 
murder to shorten the war was considered to be a crime. In the 
Pacific war under our consideration, if there was anything approach¬ 
ing what is indicated in the above letter of the German Emperor, it 
is the decision coming from the allied powers to use the atom bomb. 
Future generations will judge this dire decision. History will say 
whether any outburst of popular sentiment against usage of such 
a weapon is irrational and only sentimental and whether it has
