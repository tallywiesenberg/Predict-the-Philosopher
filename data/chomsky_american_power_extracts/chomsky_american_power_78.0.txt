dom,” and to appreciate the substance of Muste’s radical paci¬ 
fist alternative, it is necessary to look with some care into the 
backgrounds of Japanese imperialism. 

Japan had been opened to Western influence by a threat of 
force in the mid-nineteenth century, and had then undertaken a 
remarkably successful effort at modernization. A new plutoc¬ 
racy replaced the old feudal structure, adopting the forms of 
parliamentary government. Mass participation in the develop¬ 
ing political structure was minimal; it is doubtful that the living 
standards of the peasantry and urban workers rose during the 
period of transition from a medieval to a modern capitalist 
society. Japan joined the other imperialist powers in the exploit

tation of East Asia and took over Formosa, Korea, and parts of 
southern Manchuria. In short, by the late 1920s, Japan was 
what in modern political parlance is called a “democracy” and 
was attempting to play the normal role of a great power. 

A portent of danger lay in the virtual independence of the 
armed forces from the civilian government. The “dual diplo¬ 
macy” to which this gave rise was shortly to have disastrous 
consequences. 

The great European war of 1914-1918 gave Japan an oppor¬ 
tunity to extend its “rights and interests” in China and provided 
new markets for expanding Japanese industry. The revival of 
European competition came as a severe blow, and postwar 
diplomacy attempted vainly to construct a new and stable in¬ 
ternational system that would integrate Japan with the other 
imperialist powers. In good faith, Japan accepted the subordi¬ 
nate role assigned it and consented, throughout the twenties, to 
be a well-behaved member of the imperialist club. The Wash¬ 
ington Conference of 1921-1922 established the naval forces of 
America, England, and Japan in the ratio of 5:5:3, accepting 
the American position of “equality of security” rather than the 
Japanese goal of “equality of armaments.” As Schroeder com¬ 
ments, “the American argument was that Japan, a state sur¬ 
rounded on all sides by historic enemies and powerful rivals, 
had a superior natural situation for defense, while the United 
States, in the midst of two oceans without a powerful enemy on 
two continents, had defensively an inferior natural endow¬
