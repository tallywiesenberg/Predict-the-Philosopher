...communist policy 
in Spain was mainly dictated not by the necessities of the Span¬ 
ish fight but by the interests of the intervening foreign power, 
Russia,” a country “with a revolutionary past, not a revolution¬ 
ary present.” The Communists acted “not with the aim of trans¬ 
forming chaotic enthusiasm into disciplined enthusiasm [which 
Borkenau feels to have been necessary], but with the aim of 
substituting disciplined military and administrative action for 
the action of the masses and getting rid of the latter entirely.” 
This policy, he points out, went “directly against the interests 
and claims of the masses” and thus weakened popular support.The now apathetic masses would not commit themselves to the 
defense of a Communist-run dictatorship, which restored former 
authority and even “showed a definite preference for the police 
forces of the old regime, so hated by the masses.” It seems to 
me that the record strongly supports this interpretation of 
Communist policy and its effects, though Borkenau’s assump¬ 
tion that Communist “efficiency” was necessary to win the anti- 
Franco struggle is much more dubious—a question to which I 
return below.
