are trying to do is “eliminate their source of life (the land and 
the people),” and then goes on cheerily and dutifully to do her 
job, helping to restore what has been destroyed. More to the 
point, several hundred thousand citizens of Greater Boston—the 
cultural capital of the United States, they would like to believe 
—may have read that letter and gone on to do their jobs. Why 
not? It is no more harrowing than dozens of other things they 
have seen and read. In fact, it is doubtful whether there is 
anything we could do to the people of Vietnam (the Com¬ 
munists, that is) that would cause more than a momentary 
shudder. 

A few weeks earlier the citizens of Boston read an article in 
the same place on the Globe editorial page by the chairman of

the department of government at Harvard University, in which 
he described the process of urbanization in South Vietnam, an 
interesting sociological phenomenon which opens up a whole 
range of new possibilities for nation building. 5 He spares us the 
details of how “the United States is urbanizing the people of 
Vietnam/’ but others have described the process—for example, 
the IVS worker just quoted. Urbanization, of course, is that 
“funny thing” that we’re doing to the people of Vietnam. It is 
the process described in the following terms by Don Luce, who 
resigned as director of IVS in late 1967 in protest against 
United States policy, after nine years in the field: 

Less “fortunate” villagers [than those in “pacified” villages] have 
been uprooted from their traditional homes and placed in refugee 
camps that crowd around the cities. These bleak camps are made 
up almost completely of women and children who deeply resent 
having been tom away from their farmlands and way of life, 
away from their ancestral burial grounds, and even away from 
their husbands—who are usually with the Vietcong. Their old 
village usually becomes part of a free strike zone. This means that 
planes can drop bombs anywhere in that area and that anyone 
caught there will be considered a Vietcong and shot. Unfortu¬ 
nately, many of the refugees go back to harvest their rice or 
wander into these areas to gather wood or thatch. In Tuy Hoa, 
one of the IVS members was asked to give blood at the provincial 
hospital where he was working on a part-time basis. He asked an 
old man waiting in the hospital what had happened. The old man
