In fact, “the revolutionary tide began to ebb in Catalonia” 
under a middle-class attack led by the Communist party, not 
because of a recognition of the “complexity of modern society.” 
And it was, moreover, quite true that the Communist-domi¬ 
nated central government attempted, with much success, to 
hamper collectivized industry and agriculture and to disrupt the 
collectivization of commerce.I have already referred to the 
early stages of counterrevolution.Further investigation of the 
sources to which Jackson refers and others shows that the an¬ 
archist charges were not baseless, as Jackson implies.Bolloten 
cites a good deal of evidence in support of his conclusion that 

In the countryside the Communists undertook a spirited defence
