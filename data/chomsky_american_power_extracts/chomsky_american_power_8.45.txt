On September 24, 1936, Juan Fabregas, the CNT 
delegate to the Economic Council of Catalonia who was in part 
responsible for the collectivization decree cited earlier, reported 
that the financial difficulties of Catalonia were created by the 
refusal of the central government to “give any assistance in 
economic and financial questions, presumably because it has 
little sympathy with the work of a practical order which is 
being carried out in Catalonia” 82 —that is, collectivization.He 
“went on to recount that a Commission which went to Madrid 
to ask for credits to purchase war materials and raw materials, 
offering 1,000 million pesetas in securities lodged in the Bank of 
Spain, met with a blank refusal.It was sufficient that the new 
war industry in Catalonia was controlled by the workers of the 
C.N.T.for the Madrid Government to refuse any unconditional 
aid.Only in exchange for government control would they give 
financial assistance.” 83 

Broue and Temime take a rather similar position.
