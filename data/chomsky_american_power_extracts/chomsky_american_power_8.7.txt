The New 
York Times, in February 1938, observed: “The principle of

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


State intervention and control of business and industry, as 
against workers’ control of them in the guise of collectivization, 
is gradually being established in loyalist Spain by a series of 
decrees now appearing.Coincidentally there is to be estab¬ 
lished the principle of private ownership and the rights of cor¬ 
porations and companies to what is lawfully theirs under the 
Constitution.” 84 

Morrow cites (pp.64-65) a series of acts by the Catalonian 
government restricting collectivization, once power had shifted 
away from the new institutions set up by the workers’ revolu¬ 
tion of July 1936.On February 3, the collectivization of the 
dairy trade was declared illegal.85 In April, “the Generalidad 
annulled workers’ control over the customs by refusing to cer¬ 
tify workers’ ownership of material that had been exported and 
was being tied up in foreign courts by suits of former owners; 
henceforth the factories and agricultural collectives exporting 
goods were at the mercy of the government.” In May, as has 
already been noted, the collectivization decree of October 24 
was rescinded, with the argument that the decree “was dictated 
without competency by the Generalidad,” because “there was 
not, nor is there yet, legislation of the [Spanish] state to apply” 
and “article 44 of the Constitution declares expropriation and 
socialization are functions of the State.” A decree of August 28 
“gave the government the right to intervene in or take over any 
mining or metallurgical plant.” The anarchist newspaper Soli - 
daridad Obrera reported in October a decision of the department 
of purchases of the Ministry of Defense that it would make 
contracts for purchases only with enterprises functioning “on 
the basis of their old owners” or “under the corresponding in¬ 
tervention controlled by the Ministry of Finance and Econ¬ 
omy.” 86 

Returning to Jackson’s statement that “In Catalonia, the CNT

factory committees dragged their heels on war production, 
claiming that the government deprived them of raw materials 
and was favoring the bourgeoisie” I believe one must conclude 
that this statement is more an expression of Jackson’s bias in 
favor of capitalist democracy than a description of the historical 
facts.
