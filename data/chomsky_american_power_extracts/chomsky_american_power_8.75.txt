At the very least, we can say this much: Jackson presents 
no evidence to support his conclusion; there is a factual basis 
for questioning it.I have cited a number of sources that the 
liberal historian would regard, quite correctly, as biased in 
favor of the revolution.My point is that the failure of objec¬ 
tivity, the deep-seated bias of liberal historians, is a matter 
much less normally taken for granted, and that there are good 
grounds for supposing that this failure of objectivity has seri¬ 
ously distorted the judgments that are rather brashly handed 
down about the nature of the Spanish revolution.Continuing with the analysis of Jackson’s judgments, unsup¬ 
ported by any cited evidence, consider his remark, quoted 
above, that in Barcelona “the naive optimism of the revolu¬ 
tionary conquests of the previous August had given way to 
feelings of resentment and of somehow having been cheated.” It 
is a fact that by January 1937 there was great disaffection in Bar¬ 
celona.But was this simply a consequence of “the unsuspected 
complexity of modern society”?
