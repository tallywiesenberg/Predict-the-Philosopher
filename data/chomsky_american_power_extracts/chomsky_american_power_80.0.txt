mintang, but Chinese Nationalist pressures for unification were 
increasing. At the same time, the Soviet Union had significantly 
expanded its military power on the Manchurian border, a fact 
that could not fail to concern the Japanese military. Japan had a 
substantial investment in the South Manchurian Railway and, 
rightly or wrongly, regarded Manchuria as an extremely impor¬ 
tant potential source of desperately needed raw materials. 
Large numbers of Japanese 19 as well as thousands of Korean 
farmers encouraged by Japan had settled in Manchuria, inflam¬ 
ing Chinese nationalism and, simultaneously, deepening the 
commitment of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria to “preserve 
order.” The future of the South Manchurian Railway—and with 
it, the associated investments as well as the welfare of the Japa¬ 
nese and Korean immigrants and residents—was very much in 
doubt, as Chinese pressures mounted both inside Manchuria 
and in Nationalist China. “Technically, under a 1905 protocol, 
China was barred from building any railway lines parallel to 
the South Manchurian Railway or from constructing any lines 
which might endanger the commercial traffic along it/’ 20 but 
China was quite naturally disinclined to honor this provision, 
and Japanese attempts to conduct discussions on railroad con¬ 
struction were frustrated, as the Kuomintang pursued its course 
of attempting to incorporate Manchuria within China and to 
eliminate Japanese influence, no doubt with the support of the 
majority of the Manchurian population. A number of fairly 
serious incidents of violence occurred involving Korean settlers 
and the Japanese military. A Japanese officer was murdered in 
the summer of 1931. In Shanghai, a boycott of Japanese goods 
was initiated. 

Under these conditions, debate intensified within Japan as to 
whether its future lay in “the political leadership of an East Asia

abide by “the new rules of diplomacy established by Occidental 
and satiated powers.” 21 The issue was resolved in September 
1931, when Kwantung Army officers provoked a clash with 
Chinese forces (the “Mukden incident”) and proceeded to take 
full control of Manchuria. China, not unexpectedly, refused the 
Japanese offers to negotiate, insisting that “evacuation is a pre¬ 
condition of direct negotiation.” 22 Exercising the right of “self- 
defense” against Chinese “bandits,” the Kwantung Army
