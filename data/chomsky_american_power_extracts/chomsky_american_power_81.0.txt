leadership had overruled the military leaders and in effect 
capitulated to the West at the London Naval Conference, “was 
a great stimulus to the fascist movement” (p. 81). In 1932 a 
series of assassinations of important political figures (including 
Prime Minister Inukai) contributed further to the decline of 
civilian power and the strengthening of the hand of the mili¬ 
tary. 

The international reaction to these events was ambiguous. 
The League of Nations sent a commission of inquiry, the 
Lytton Commission, to investigate the Manchurian situation. Its 
report rejected the Japanese position that Manchukuo should 
be established as an independent state, and insisted on a loose 
form of Chinese sovereignty, at which point Japan withdrew 
from the League of Nations. The United States also found itself

nese position taken by Secretary of State Stimson received little 
support from the other Western powers. 

In a careful review of the point of view of the Lytton Com¬ 
mission, the Inukai government, and the central army authori¬ 
ties, Sadako Ogata demonstrates a considerable area of agree¬ 
ment : 

. . . the central army authorities . . . insisted upon the creation of 
a new local regime with authority to negotiate settlement of 
Manchurian problems, but under the formal sovereignty of the 
Chinese National Government, a traditional arrangement. This 
was the arrangement that the world at large was willing to accept. 
The Lytton Commission proposed the constitution of a special 
regime for the administration of Manchuria possessed of a large 
measure of autonomy but under Chinese jurisdiction. Finally, 
when the State of Manchukuo declared its independence, the 
Government of Japan withheld formal recognition and thereby 
attempted to avoid a head-on collision with the powers, which by 
then had lined up behind the doctrine of non-recognition of 
changes caused by Japanese military action in Manchuria. The 
complete political reconstruction of Manchuria was achieved, 
then, at the hands of the Kwantung Army in defiance of the 
opposition of government and central military leaders. 28 

The Lytton Commission report took cognizance of some of the
