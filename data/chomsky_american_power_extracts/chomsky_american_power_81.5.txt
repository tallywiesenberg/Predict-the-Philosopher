complexities in the situation. The report drew the following 
conclusion: 

This is not a case in which one country has declared war on 
another country without previously exhausting the opportunities 
for conciliation provided in the Covenant of the League of Na¬ 
tions. Neither is it a simple case of the violation of the frontier of 
one country by the armed forces of a neighboring country, be¬ 
cause in Manchuria there are many features without an exact 
parallel in other parts of the world.

The report went on to point out that the dispute arose in a 
territory in which both China and Japan “claim to have rights 
and interests, only some of which are clearly defined by inter¬ 
national law; a territory which, although legally an integral part 
of China, had a sufficiently autonomous character to carry out 
direct negotiations with Japan on the matters which lay at the

It is an open question whether a more conciliatory American 
diplomacy that took into account some of the real problems 
faced by Japan might have helped the civilian government 
(backed by the central army authorities) to prevail over the 
independent initiative of the Kwantung Army, which ultimately 
succeeded in bringing the Japanese government to recognize 
the fait accompli of a Manchukuo that was more a puppet of 
the Kwantung Army than of Japan proper. 

In any event, the success of the Kwantung Army in enforcing 
its conception of the status of Manchuria set Japan and the 
United States on a collision course. Japan turned to an “inde¬ 
pendent diplomacy” and reliance on force to achieve its objec¬

follows by Royama. Japan’s aim is 

not to conquer China, or to take any territory from her, but 
instead to create jointly with China and Manchukuo a new order 
comprising the three independent states. In accordance with this 
programme, East Asia is to become a vast self-sustaining region 
where Japan will acquire economic security and immunity from 
such trade boycotts as she has been experiencing at the hands of
