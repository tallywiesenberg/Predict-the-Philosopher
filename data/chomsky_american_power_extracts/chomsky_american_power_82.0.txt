the long-term insistence of the United States on the Open Door

AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


From 1928 there had been an increasing divergence between 
the policies of the civilian Japanese governments, which at¬ 
tempted to play the game of international politics in accordance 
with the rules set by the dominant imperialist powers, and the 
Kwantung Army, which regarded these rules as unfair to Japan 
and was also dissatisfied with the injustice of domestic Japanese 
society. The independent initiative of the Kwantung Army was 
largely that of the young officers of petit-bourgeois origin who 
felt that they represented as well the interests of the soldiers, 
predominantly of peasant stock. “The Manchurian affair consti¬ 
tutes an external expression of the radical reform movement 
that was originally inspired by Kita and Okawa,” 31 who had 
developed the view that Japan represented an “international 
proletariat,” with an emancipating mission for the Asian masses, 
and who opposed the obvious inequities of modern capitalism. 
The fundamental law proposed for Manchukuo, in 1932, pro¬ 
tected the people from “usury, excessive profit, and all other 
unjust economic pressure.” As Ogata notes, 32 the fundamental 
law “showed the attempt to forestall the modern forms of eco¬ 
nomic injustice caused by capitalism.” In Japan itself, this pro¬ 
gram appealed to the Social Democrats, who blamed “Chinese 
warlords and selfish Japanese capitalists for the difficulties in 
[Manchuria]” and who demanded “the creation of a socialistic 
system in Manchuria, one that would benefit ‘both Chinese and 
Japanese living in Manchuria/ ” 33 

Ogata cites a great deal of evidence to support the conclusion 
that the Kwantung Army never expected to establish Japanese 
supremacy, but rather proposed to leave “wide discretion to the 
local self-governing Chinese bodies, and intended neither the 
disruption of the daily lives of the Manchurian people nor their 
assimilation into Japanese culture” (p. 182). The program for 
autonomy was apparently influenced by and attempted to in-
