parent.” 35 With many Japanese civilians, it felt that “Under the 
leadership of Chiang Kai-shek and with the support of the 
Western democratic powers which wanted to keep China in a 
semi-colonial state safe from the continental advance of the 
Japanese, China was rapidly becoming a military-fascist coun¬ 
try” 36 and had no right to dominate Manchuria. To use the 
kind of terminology favored by Secretary Rusk, it was unwilling 
to sacrifice the Manchurian people to their more powerful or 
better organized neighbors, and it engaged in serious efforts to 
win the hearts and minds of the people and to encourage the 
responsible Chinese leadership that had itself been working for 
Manchurian independence. 37 

In fact, a case can be made that “had it not been for Western 
intervention, which strengthened China, the Tibetans and 
Mongols would have simply resumed their own national sov¬ 
ereignty after the fall of the Manchu empire” in 1911, as would 
the Manchurians. With considerable Western prodding, the Na¬ 
tionalist government had abandoned the original demand for 
union with equality of Chinese, Manchus, Mongols, Moslems, 
and Tibetans and taken the position that China should rule the 
outer dominions. The West assumed that China would be under 
Western guidance and influence; “by confirming a maximum 
area for China it increased the sphere of future Western in¬ 
vestment and exploitation” 38 (a fact which adds a touch of 
irony to current Western complaints about “Chinese expansion¬ 
ism”). From this point of view, the independence of Man- 
chukuo could easily be rationalized as a step towards the 
emancipation of the peoples of East Asia from Western domi¬ 
nance. 

To be sure, the establishment of Japanese hegemony over 
Manchuria—and later, northern China as well—was motivated 
by the desire to secure Japanese rights and interests. A liberal

professor of American history, Yasaka Takagi, observes that the 
general support for the Japanese military in 1931 was similar to 
the Manifest Destiny psychology underlying American expan¬ 
sion into Florida, Texas, California, Cuba, and Hawaii. 39 He 
describes the bandit-infested, warlord-controlled Manchurian 
region, then subject to the clash of expansionist Chinese Na¬ 
tionalism and Japanese imperialism, as similar to the Caribbean 
when the United States justified its Caribbean policy. He asks
