In this respect, the analogy to current American behavior in 
Asia fails; more than one American in a hundred understands 
that we have actually violated our commitments, not only at 
Geneva but, more importantly, to the United Nations Charter. 
However, the general observation remains quite valid in the 
changed circumstances of today. It is very difficult to deal with 
the mentality that reinterprets obligations to suit self-interest, 
and may very well be perfectly honest—in some curious sense 
of the word—in so doing. 

Alongside of those who justified the Manchurian intervention 
on the pragmatic grounds of self-interest, those who spoke of a 
new Monroe Doctrine “to maintain the peace of East Asia,” and 
those who fantasied about an “earthly paradise,” 41 there were 
also dissident voices that questioned Japanese policy in a more 
fundamental way. As the military extended its power, dissidents 
were attacked—both verbally and physically—for their betrayal

to steal the supreme command in the March Incident; and they 
united with disloyal professors in rebellious places. These are but 
a few of the most notable instances of their villainies. . . , 42 

It is difficult to imagine such a development in the United 
States today. Difficult, but not impossible. Consider, for ex¬ 
ample, the column by William H. Stringer on the editorial page 
of the Christian Science Monitor on February 7, 1968, calling 
for an end to “that violent, discouraged, and anarchic thinking 
which disrupts government and adds to Washington’s already 
grievous burdens.” The final paragraph explains why the “carp¬ 
ing and caterwauling from the pseudointellectual establish¬
