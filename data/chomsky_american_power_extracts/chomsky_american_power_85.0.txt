that “territorial propinquity creates special relations between 
countries, and consequently, the Government of the United 
States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, par¬ 
ticularly in the part to which her possessions are contiguous.” 46 
In fact, the United States for several years regarded the 
Kuomintang as in revolt against the legitimate government of 
China, and even after Chiang’s massacre of Communists in 
1927, showed little pro-Nationalist sympathy. As late as 1930, 
the American minister to China saw no difference between the 
Kuomintang and the warlord rebels in Peking, and wrote that

he could not “see any hope in any of the self-appointed leaders 
that are drifting over the land at the head of odd bands of 
troops.” 46 

At the same time, the United States insisted on preserving its 
special rights, including the right of extraterritoriality, which 
exempted American citizens from Chinese law. In 1928, there 
were more than 5,200 American marines in China protecting 
these rights (the Japanese army in Manchuria at the time was 
about 10,000 troops). 47 The other imperialist powers were even 
more insistent on protecting their rights, and persisted in their 
anti-Nationalist attitudes right through the Manchurian inci¬ 
dent. 

In later years, when the Japanese had begun to use force to 
guarantee their position in China, they still retained the support 
of the American business community (as long as it did not itself 
feel threatened by these actions). In 1928, American consuls 
supported the dispatch of Japanese troops; one reported that 
their arrival “has brought a feeling of relief . . . even among 
Chinese, especially those of the substantial class.” 48 The busi¬ 
ness community remained relatively pro-Japanese even after 
Japanese actions in Manchuria and Shanghai in 1931-1932; “in 
general, it was felt that the Japanese were fighting the battle of 
all foreigners against the Chinese who wished to destroy foreign 
rights and privileges . . . that if the organizing abilities of the 
Japanese were turned loose in China, it might be a good thing 
for everybody.” 49 Ambassador Grew, on November 20, 1937, 
entered in his diary a note that the MacMurray Memorandum,, 
just circulated by one of the main American spokesmen on Far 
Eastern affairs, “would serve to relieve many of our fellow
