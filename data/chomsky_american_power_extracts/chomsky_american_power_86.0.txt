The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


so it appears, the situation would have been quite different. 

The depression of 1929 marked the final collapse of the at¬ 
tempt of Japanese civilians to live by the rules established by 
the Western powers. Just as the depression struck, the new 
Hamaguchi cabinet adopted the gold standard in an attempt to 
link the Japanese economy more closely with the West, fore¬ 
going the previous attempts at unilateral Sino-Japanese “co¬ 
prosperity.” An immediate consequence was a drastic decline in 
Japanese exports. In 1931, Japan was replaced by the United 
States as the major exporter to China. Japanese exports to the 
United States also declined severely, in part as a result of the 
Smoot-Hawley tariff of June 1930, in part because of the dra¬ 
matic fall in the price of silk. 55 For an industrialized country 
such as Japan, with almost no domestic supplies of raw mate¬ 
rials, the decline in world trade was an unmitigated disaster. 
The Japanese diplomat Mamoru Shigemitsu describes the crisis 
succinctly: 

The Japanese were completely shut out from the European colo¬ 
nies. In the Philippines, Indo-China, Borneo, Indonesia, Malaya, 
Burma, not only were Japanese activities forbidden, but even 
entry. Ordinary trade was hampered by unnatural discriminatory 
treatment. ... In a sense the Manchurian outbreak was the result 
of the international closed economies that followed on the first 
World War. There was a feeling at the back of it that it provided 
the only escape from economic strangulation . 56 

The infamous Yosuke Matsuoka stated in 1931 that “we feel 
suffocated as we observe internal and external situations. What 
we are seeking is that which is minimal for living beings. In 
other words, we are seeking to live. We are seeking room that 
will let us breathe.” 57 Ten years later he was to describe Japan 
as “in the grip of a need to work out means of self-supply and 
self-sufficiency in Greater East Asia.” He asks: “Is it for the

United States, which rules over the Western Hemisphere and is 
expanding over the Atlantic and the Pacific, to say that these 
ideals, these ambitions of Japan are wrong?” 58
