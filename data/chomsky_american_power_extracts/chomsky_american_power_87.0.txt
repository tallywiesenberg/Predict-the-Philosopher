The 1936 IPR conference continues the story. Writing on 
“trade and trade rivalry between the United States and Japan,” 
William W. Lockwood observes that American preponderance 
in Philippine trade “is attributable in large degree to the Closed 
Door policy of the United States, which has established Ameri¬ 
can products in a preferential position. Were Japanese business 
men able to compete on equal terms, there is no doubt but that 
Japan’s share of the trade would advance rapidly.” 62 At the 
same time, American tariffs on many Japanese items exceeded 
100 percent. 

Japan did not have the resiliency to absorb such a serious 
shock to its economy. The textile industry, which was hit most 
severely by the discriminatory policies of the major imperialist 
powers, produced nearly half of the total value of manufac¬ 
tured goods and about two thirds of the value of Japanese 
exports, and employed about half of the factory workers. 
Though industrialized by Asian standards, Japan had only 
about one seventh the energy capacity per capita of Germany; 
from 1927 to 1932, its pig-iron production was 44 percent that 
of Luxemburg and its steel production about 95 percent. 63 It 
was in no position to tolerate a situation in which India, Malaya, 
Indochina, and the Philippines erected tariff barriers favoring

the mother country, and could not survive the deterioration in 
its very substantial trade with the United States and the sharp 
decline in the China trade. It w T as, in fact, being suffocated by 
the American and British and other Western imperial systems, 
which quickly abandoned their lofty liberal rhetoric as soon as 
the shoe began to pinch. 

The situation as of 1936 is summarized as follows by Neu¬ 
mann: 

When an effort to set a quota on imports of bleached and colored 
cotton cloths failed, President Roosevelt finally took direct action. 

In May of 1936 he invoked the flexible provision of the tariff law 
and ordered an average increase of 42 percent in the duty on 
these categories of imports. By this date Japan’s cotton goods had 
begun to suffer from restrictive measures taken by more than half 
of their other markets. Japanese xenophobia was further stimu¬ 
lated as tariff barriers [rose] against Japanese goods, like earlier
