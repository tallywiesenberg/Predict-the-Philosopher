one, surely, could accuse Japan of seeking mere economic gain. 
In fact, she was spending more on the war in China than she 
could possibly gain in return. Japan was “paying the price that 
leadership of Asia demands,” they said, attempting “to prevent 
Asia from becoming another Africa and to preserve China from 
Communism.” 69 The latter was a particularly critical matter. 
“The Japanese felt that the United Front and the Sino-Soviet 
pact of 1937 were steps toward the destruction of Nationalist 
China and the Bolshevization of East Asia.” 70 The Japanese 
were, furthermore, quite willing to withdraw their troops once

the “illegal acts” by Communists and other lawless elements 
were terminated, 71 and the safety and rights of Japanese and 
Korean residents in China guaranteed. 

Such terminology was drawn directly from the lexicon of 
Western diplomacy. For example, Secretary of State Kellogg 
had stated United States government policy as: “to require 
China to perform the obligations of a sovereign state in the 
protection of foreign citizens and their property” (September 2, 
1925). The Washington Treaty powers were “prepared to con¬ 
sider the Chinese government's proposal for the modification of 
existing treaties in measure as the Chinese authorities demon¬ 
strated their willingness and ability to fulfill their obligations 
and to assume the protection of foreign rights and interests now 
safeguarded by the exceptional provisions of those treaties,” 
and admonished China of “the necessity of giving concrete evi¬ 
dence of its ability and willingness to enforce respect for the 
safety of foreign lives and property and to suppress disorders 
and anti-foreign agitations” as a precondition for the carrying 
on of negotiations over the unequal treaties (notes of Septem¬ 
ber 4, 1925). 72 Because of this “inability and unwillingness,” 
“none of the Treaty of Washington signatories gave effect to the 
treaty with respect to extra-territorial rights, intervening in in¬ 
ternal Chinese affairs, tariffs, courts, etc., on grounds that their 
interests were prejudiced by lawlessness and the ineffectiveness 
of the government of China.” 73 

In 1940, Japan established a puppet government in Nanking 
under the leadership of Wang Ching-wei, who had been a 
leading disciple of Sun Yat-sen and, through the 1930s, a major 
figure in the Kuomintang. Its attempt to establish order in 
China was vain, however, as the United Front continued to 
resist—in the Japanese view, solely because of outside assist¬
