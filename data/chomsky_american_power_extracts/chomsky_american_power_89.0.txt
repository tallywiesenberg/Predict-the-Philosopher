AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


the insurgents who menaced the people and obstructed the at¬ 
tainment of wangtao [the perfect w r ay of the ancient kings, or the 
kingly way] had at one point reached 300.000. but the earnest 
and brave efforts of various subjugating agencies headed by the 
Japanese army brought about great results. Thus the number of 
insurgents declined from 120,000 in 1933, to 50.000 in 1934; 
40,000 in 1935; 30,000 in 1936; and 20.000 in 1937. As of 
September, 1938, the number of insurgents is estimated at 10.000. 78 

The success was achieved in part by contingents of Japanese 
troops, in part by the national army of Manchukuo, and in part 
by the police. “Because of the success of these activities [which 
led to the winning of the support of the masses], the insurgent 
groups are now in an extremely precarious condition and the 
attainment of peace seems to be in sight.” The “native bandits” 
and “rebellious troops from the local armies” had been ab¬ 
sorbed by the Chinese Communist party during this period, and 
were, by 1938, “under the Communist hegemony operating 
with the slogan of ‘Oppose Manchukuo and Resist Japan,’ ” 
with political leadership supplied from China. The goal of the 
insurgents was “to destroy the government’s pacification efforts” 
and to win public confidence and disturb public opinion “by 
opposing Manchukuo and Japan and espousing Communism. 
Their efforts lead the masses astray on various matters and 
significantly hamper the development of natural resources and 
the improvement of the people’s livelihood.” Through a combi¬ 
nation of pacification and propaganda activities, their efforts 
were being countered and, the report continues, the “nation’s 
economy and culture” preserved. 

The report emphasizes the strong distaste of the authorities 
for forceful means: 

The use of military force against the insurgents is the principal 
means of attaining peace and order, in that it will directly reduce 
the number of insurgents. But this method is to be used only as a
