their government to enter into negotiations. Furthermore, the 
effect of terror bombing is slight in a nonindustrialized country. 
Therefore, he suggests, we should not “go after the spectacular 
targets which cause militarily dubious pain to people in North 
Vietnam,” but rather “after the unspectacular targets which can

bring some military relief to the infantrymen in the battle on 
the ground/’ even though this is a shame for the pilots, who are 
missing out on the feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction 
that comes from flooding villages, drowning people, and de¬ 
stroying crops. 

By coincidence, the same newspaper published an eyewitness 
report of the bombing of dikes in North Vietnam, just a few 
days later. 8 The correspondent reports: 

Dikes in the fertile Red River delta—North Vietnam’s rice basket 
—have come under increasing air attack lately. The American 
bombing appears intended not only to demoralize and harass the 
population in the most densely populated region of the country, 
but also to destroy the rice crops in the vast alluvial plains with 
their vulnerable open spaces . . . here in the delta region, whose 
paddy fields provide the bulk of the rice supply of 17 million 
North Vietnamese, there have been almost daily attacks on dikes 
along the numerous small confluences of the Red River. . . . The 
pattern of the bombing in the delta seems evident—to interdict 
agricultural production. No military targets are visible in the 
dikes. The heaviest artillery pieces we saw were antiquated rifles 
of the peasant militia. 

As a historical reference point, recall that German High Com¬ 
missioner Seyss-Inquart was condemned to death at Nuremberg 
for opening the dikes in Holland at the time of the Allied inva¬ 
sion. 9 Since the editors of the Christian Science Monitor did not 
feel that this disclosure required editorial comment, I do not 
know whether they regarded Harsch’s sensible argument for the 
bombing of trucks rather than dams as now counterbalanced by 
other considerations. 

As a final illustration of the callousness of the American re¬ 
sponse to what the mass media reveal, consider a small item in 
the New York Times of March 18, 1968, headed, “Army Exhibit 
Bars Simulated Shooting at Vietnamese Hut.” The item reports
