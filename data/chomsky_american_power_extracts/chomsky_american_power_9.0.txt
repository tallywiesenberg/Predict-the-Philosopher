Objectivity and Liberal Scholarship 


In short, the workers of Barcelona were not merely giving 
way to “feelings of resentment and of somehow having been 
cheated” when they learned of “the unsuspected complexity of 
modern society.” Rather, they had good reason to believe that 
they were being cheated, by the old dog with the new collar.George Orwell's observations are also highly relevant: 

Everyone who has made two visits, at intervals of months, to 
Barcelona during the war has remarked upon the extraordinary 
changes that took place in it.And curiously enough, whether 
they went there first in August and again in January, or, like 
myself, first in December and again in April, the thing they said 
was always the same: that the revolutionary atmosphere had 
vanished.No doubt to anyone who had been there in August, 
when the blood was scarcely dry in the streets and militia were 
quartered in the small hotels, Barcelona in December would have 
seemed bourgeois; to me, fresh from England, it was liker to a 
workers’ city than anything I had conceived possible.Now [in 
April] the tide had rolled back.
