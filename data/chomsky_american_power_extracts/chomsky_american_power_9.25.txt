AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 


Whereas Jackson attributes the ebbing of the revolutionary 
tide to the discovery of the unsuspected complexity of modern 
society, Orwell’s firsthand observations, like those of Borkenau, 
suggest a far simpler explanation.What calls for explanation is 
not the disaffection of the workers of Barcelona but the curious 
constructions of the historian.Let me repeat, at this point, Jackson’s comments regarding 
Juan Comorera: Comorera “immediately took steps to end 
barter and requisitioning, and became a defender of the peas¬ 
ants against the revolution”; he “ended requisitions, restored 
money payments, and protected the Catalan peasants against 
further collectivization.” These comments imply that the peas¬ 
antry of Catalonia was, as a body, opposed to the revolution 
and that Comorera put a stop to the collectivization that they 
feared.Jackson nowdiere indicates any divisions among the 
peasantry on this issue and offers no support for the implied 
claim that collectivization w r as in process at the period of 
Comorera’s access to power.In fact, it is questionable that 
Comorera’s rise to power affected the course of collectivization 
in Catalonia.
