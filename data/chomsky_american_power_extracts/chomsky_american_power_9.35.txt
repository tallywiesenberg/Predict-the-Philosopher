I will return to this question directly, with refer¬ 
ence to areas where agricultural collectivization was much more 
extensive than in Catalonia.The complexities of modern society that baffled and con¬ 
founded the unsuspecting anarchist workers of Barcelona, as 
Jackson enumerates them, were the following: the accumulat¬ 
ing food and supply problems and the administration of frontier 
posts, villages, and public utilities.As just noted, the food and 
supply problems seem to have accumulated most rapidly under 
the brilliant leadership of Juan Comorera.So far as the frontier 
posts are concerned, the situation, as Jackson elsewhere de¬ 
scribes it (p. 368), was basically as follows: “In Catalonia the 
anarchists had, ever since July 18, controlled the customs 
stations at the French border.On April 17, 1937, the reorganized 
carabineros, acting on orders of the Finance Minister, Juan 
Negrin, began to reoccupy the frontier.
