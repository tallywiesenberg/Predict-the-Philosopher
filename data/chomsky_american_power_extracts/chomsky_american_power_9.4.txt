At least eight an¬ 
archists were killed in clashes with the carabineros.” Apart 
from this difficulty, admittedly serious, there seems little 
reason to suppose that the problem of manning frontier 
posts contributed to the ebbing of the revolutionary tide.The available records do not indicate that the problems 
of administering villages or public utilities were either 
“unsuspected” or too complex for the Catalonian work¬ 
ers—a remarkable and unsuspected development, but one 
which nevertheless appears to be borne out by the evidence 
available to us.I want to emphasize again that Jackson presents 
no evidence to support his conclusions about the ebbing of the

revolutionary tide and the reasons for the disaffection of the 
Catalonian workers.Once again, I think it fair to attribute his 
conclusions to the elitist bias of the liberal intellectual rather 
than to the historical record.Consider next Jackson’s comment that the anarchists “ex¬ 
plained the loss of Malaga as due in large measure to the low 
morale and the disorientation of the Andalusian proletariat, 
which saw the Valencia government evolving steadily toward 
the right.” Again, it seems that Jackson regards this as just 
another indication of the naivete and unreasonableness of the 
Spanish anarchists.
