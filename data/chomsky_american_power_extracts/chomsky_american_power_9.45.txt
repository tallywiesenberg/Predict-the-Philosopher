However, here again there is more to the 
story.One of the primary sources that Jackson cites is Bor- 
kenau, quite naturally, since Borkenau spent several days in the 
area just prior to the fall of Malaga on February 8, 1937.But 
Borkenau’s detailed observations tend to bear out the anarchist 
“explanation,” at least in part.He believed that Malaga might 
have been saved, but only by a “fight of despair” with mass 
involvement, of a sort that “the anarchists might have led.” But 
two factors prevented such a defense: first, the officer assigned 
to lead the defense, Lieutenant Colonel Villalba, “interpreted 
this task as a purely military one, whereas in reality he had no 
military means at his disposal but only the forces of a popular 
movement”; he was a professional officer, “who in the secrecy of 
his heart hated the spirit of the militia” and was incapable of 
comprehending the “political factor.” 92 A second factor was the 
significant decline, by February, of political consciousness and 
mass involvement.The anarchist committees were no longer 
functioning and the authority of the police and Civil Guards 
had been restored.
