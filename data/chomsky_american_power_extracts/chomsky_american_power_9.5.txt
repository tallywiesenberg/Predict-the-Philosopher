ft - AMERICAN POWER AND THE NEW MANDARINS 

an attempt by the “peace movement” to disrupt an exhibit in 
the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry: 

Beginning today, visitors can no longer enter a helicopter for 
simulated firing of a machine gun at targets in a diorama of the 
Vietnam Central Highlands. The targets were a hut, two bridges 
and an ammunition dump, and a light flashed when a hit was 
scored. 

Apparently, it was great fun for the kiddies until those damned 
peaceniks turned up and started one of their interminable dem¬ 
onstrations, even occupying the exhibit. According to the Times 
report, “demonstrators particularly objected to children being 
permitted to ‘fire’ at the hut, even though no people appear 
there or elsewhere in the diorama,” which just shows how un¬ 
reasonable peaceniks can be. Although it is small compensation 
for the closing of this entertaining exhibit, “visitors, however, 
may still test their skills elsewhere in the exhibit by simulated 
firing of an antitank weapon and several models of rifles.” 

What can one say about a country where a museum of sci¬ 
ence in a great city can feature an exhibit in which people fire 
machine guns from a helicopter at Vietnamese huts, with a light 
flashing when a hit is scored? What can one say about a country 
where such an idea can even be considered? You have to weep 
for this country. 

These and a thousand other examples testify to moral degen¬ 
eration on such a scale that talk about the “normal channels” of 
political action and protest becomes meaningless or hypocriti¬ 
cal. We have to ask ourselves whether what is needed in the 
United States is dissent—or denazification. The question is a 
debatable one. Reasonable people may differ. The fact that the 
question is even debatable is a terrifying thing. To me it seems 
that what is needed is a kind of denazification. What is more,
