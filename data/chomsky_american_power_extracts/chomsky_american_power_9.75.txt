What is interesting about this description is what is left un¬ 
said.For example, there is no comment on the fact that the 
dispatch of the asaltos violated the “fragile truce” that had been 
accepted by the Barcelona workers and the anarchist and the 
POUM troops nearby, and barely a mention of the bloody con¬ 
sequences or the political meaning of this unwillingness “to 
temporize further with the Catalan Left.” There is no mention 
of the fact that along with Sese, Berneri and other anarchist 
leaders were murdered, not only during the May Days but in 
the weeks preceding .90 Jackson does not refer to the fact that 
along with the Republican navy, British ships also “demon¬ 
strated” in the port .97 Nor does he refer to Orwell’s telling 
observations about the Assault Guards, as compared to the 
troops at the front, where he had spent the preceding months.The Assault Guards “were splendid troops, much the best I had 
seen in Spain.
