the feeble war policy of the past six months, and hence the 
compromise with which the war will almost certainly end.” 99 
Jackson’s account of these events, with its omissions and assump¬ 
tions, suggests that he perhaps shares the view that the greatest 
danger in Spain would have been a victory of the revolution.
