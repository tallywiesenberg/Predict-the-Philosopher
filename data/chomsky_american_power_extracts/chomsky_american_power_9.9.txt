Jackson apparently discounts Orwell’s testimony, to some ex¬ 
tent, commenting that “the readers should bear in mind Or¬ 
well’s own honest statement that he knew very little about the 
political complexities of the struggle.” This is a strange com¬ 
ment.For one thing, Orwell’s analysis of the “political complex¬ 
ities of the struggle” bears up rather well after thirty years; if it 
is defective, it is probably in his tendency to give too much 
prominence to the POUM in comparison with the anarchists— 
not surprising, in view of the fact that he was with the POUM 
militia.His exposure of the fatuous nonsense that was appear¬ 
ing at the time in the Stalinist and liberal presses appears quite 
accurate, and later discoveries have given little reason to chal¬ 
lenge the basic facts that he reported or the interpretation that 
he proposed in the heat of the conflict.Orwell does, in fact, refer 
to his own “political ignorance.” Commenting on the final de¬ 
feat of the revolution in May, he states: “I realized—though 
owing to my political ignorance, not so clearly as I ought to have 
done—that when the Government felt more sure of itself there 
would be reprisals.” But this form of “political ignorance” has
