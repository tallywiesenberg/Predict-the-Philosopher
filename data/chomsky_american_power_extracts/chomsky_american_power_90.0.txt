accommodating 5,500,000 people. The collective hamlets, Lee 
informs us, were set up with considerable ruthlessness. 

Families were ordered to move from their farm homes with little 
or no notice, even if the collective hamlets were not ready. Some 
farmers were forced to move just before the sowing season, mak¬ 
ing it impossible for them to plant any seeds that year, while 
others were ordered to move just before harvest. Many farm¬ 
houses seem to have been destroyed by troops engaged in mop-up 
operations before preparations had been made for the farmers’ 
relocation. The only concern of the military was to cut off the 
guerrillas’ sources of food supply and their contacts with the 
farmers. [Pp. 26 f.] 

There is no point in supplying further details, which will be 
familiar to anyone who has been reading the American press 
since 1962. 

The collective-hamlet program was fairly successful, though 
it was necessary to prevent insurgents from “assaulting the 
weakly protected collective hamlets and . . . plundering food 
and grain” and to prevent infiltration. According to a report in 
1939, many of the residents of the hamlets continued to “sym¬ 
pathize with Communism and secretly plan to join the insur¬ 
gents,” and the Communists continued to exploit the farmers’ 
grievances with skill (Lee, pp. 33 f.). Vice-Governor Itagaki 
formulated the problem succinctly: “We are not afraid of 
Communist propaganda; but we are worried because the mate¬ 
rial for propaganda can be found in the farmers’ lives. We are 
not afraid of the ignition of fire; rather we are afraid of the 
seeping oil” (p. 34).

The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


The Japanese undertook a number of what are now called 
population control methods,” including registration of resi¬ 
dents, issuance of residence certificates, unscheduled searches, 
and so on. 80 They also made use of the method of reward and 
punishment recommended by more recent theorists of pacifica¬ 
tion (see Lee, pp. 39-40). 81 The Japanese understood that “it was 
totally unrealistic to expect reforms or innovations to be ini¬ 
tiated by those who were already well off” and therefore re¬ 
placed the former “local gentry’ 5 by “young and capable ad¬ 
ministrative personnel” who were “trained to assist the local
