Farmers were fleeing from “insurgent-infested areas in a con¬ 
tinuous stream,” though some continued to “sympathize with 
Communism.” However, plans were being laid to “establish con¬ 
fidence” and destroy insurgent forces, to carry out “relief of 
afflicted people,” and, in general, to extend the work of nation 
building. 

I have no knowledge of the reaction in Japan to whatever 
information w T as transmitted to the public about these matters. 
No doubt, many Japanese deplored the excesses of the pacifica¬ 
tion program, though the more reasonable presumably con¬ 
tinued to discuss the situation in balanced and unemotional 
terms, taking note of the violence carried out on both sides. If 
there were vocal advocates of Japanese withdrawal from Man¬

houses, and [to see] little innocent babies wrapped in rags and 
smiling on carts that are carrying the household goods away. A 
few days ago, a girl of sixteen or seventeen made me weep by 
coming to my office at the prefectural government and kneeling 
down to beg me to spare her house. She said, “Do we really have 
to tear down our house, councilor?’’ She had walked a long way 
to town thinking, “If I asked the councilor, something could be 
done.” Watching the bony back of the little girl who was quietly

will go to hell.” The hardship of the Japanese police officers at the 
forefront who have to guide the coercive operation directly is be¬
