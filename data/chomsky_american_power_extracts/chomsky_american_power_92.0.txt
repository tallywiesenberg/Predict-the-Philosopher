efforts and a much smaller and weaker enemy, American politi¬ 
cal scientists were not unreasonable in looking forward to 
greater success. 

So events proceeded through the terrifying decade of the 
1930s. Seeking desperately for allies, Japan joined with Ger¬ 
many and Italy in the Tripartite Pact at a moment when Ger¬ 
many appeared invincible. With the termination of the Japa-

nese-American commercial treaty in January 1940, Japan turned 
to “other commercial channels/' that is, to plans for occupation 
of French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies, and for gain¬ 
ing “independence" for the Philippines. The expiration of the 
treaty was the turning point that led many moderates towards 
support for the Axis powers. 87 

In July 1940, the United States placed an embargo on avia¬ 
tion fuel, which Japan could obtain from no other source, 88 and 
in September, a total embargo on scrap iron. Meanwhile Amer¬ 
ican aid to China was increasing. In September, the Tripartite 
Pact was signed, and Japanese troops entered northern Indo¬ 
china. The goals were basically two: to block the flow of sup¬ 
plies to Chiang Kai-shek and to take steps towards acquisition 
of petroleum from the Dutch East Indies. On July 2, 1941, a 
decision was made to move troops to southern Indochina. The 
decision was known to the American government, since the 
Japanese diplomatic code had been broken. On July 24, Presi¬ 
dent Roosevelt informed the Japanese ambassador that if Japan 
would refrain from this step, he would use his influence to 
achieve the neutralization of Indochina. This message did not 
reach the Japanese Foreign Ministry until July 27. On July 26, 
Japan announced publicly its plans to move troops to southern 
Indochina and the United States government ordered all Japa¬ 
nese assets in the United States to be frozen. 89 On August 1, a 
total embargo of oil was announced by the United States. At 
this point, “Japan was denied access to all the vitally needed 
supplies outside her own control." 90 

What slender hope there now remained to avoid war lay in 
the Hull-Nomura talks, which had been under way since Feb¬ 
ruary. The nature of these talks has been a matter of some 
dispute. Pal points out that the American position hardened 
noticeably in the course of the discussions, with respect to all
