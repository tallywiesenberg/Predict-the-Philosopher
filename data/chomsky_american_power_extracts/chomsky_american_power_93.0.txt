ing the precedent established by Great Britain and the United 
States; it was establishing its own Monroe Doctrine and realiz¬ 
ing its Manifest Destiny. It is revealing to study the American 
response to this claim. Hull professed to be shocked. In his view 
of the matter, the Monroe Doctrine, “as we interpret and apply 
it uniformly since 1823 only contemplates steps for our physical 
safety/’ whereas Japan is bent on aggression. 94 He deplored the 
“simplicity of mind that made it difficult for . . . [Japanese 
generals] ... to see why the United States, on the one hand, 
should assert leadership in the Western Hemisphere with the 
Monroe Doctrine and, on the other, want to interfere with 
Japan’s assuming leadership in Asia/’ and he asked Nomura, 
“Why can’t the Japanese Government educate the generals” to a 
more correct understanding of this fundamental distinction? 95 

American scholars were equally offended by the analogy. W. 
W. Willoughby, in a detailed analysis, concludes that no com¬ 
parison can be made between the Monroe Doctrine and Japan’s 
plans 96 The United States, he asserts, has never resorted to the 
Monroe Doctrine to demand “that it be given special commer¬ 
cial or other economic privileges in the other American States.” 
Rather, “it has exercised its powers of military intervention or of 
financial administration for the benefit of the peoples of the 
countries concerned or of those who have had just pecuniary 
claims against them.” He cites with approval the discussion by 
G. H. Blakeslee in Foreign Affairs , 97 which characterizes the 
main difference between the American and Japanese position in 
this way: 

The United States is a vast territory with a great population vis-a- 
vis a dozen Caribbean republics, each with a relatively small area 
and population. Japan, on the other hand, is a country with a 
relatively small area and population vis-a-vis the vast territory 
and great population of China. An attitude which therefore ap-

States does not appear natural for Japan to take toward China. 

This contribution to the history of imperialist apologia at 
least has the merit of originality. To my knowledge, no one had
