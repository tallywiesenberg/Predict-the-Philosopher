previously argued that attempts by one nation to dominate an¬ 
other are proper to the extent that the victim is smaller and 
weaker than the power that is bent on subjugating it. However, 
this argument is perhaps surpassed in acuity by Blakeslee’s next 
explanation of the fundamental error in the Japanese analogy: 

The United States does not need to use military force to induce 
the Caribbean republics to permit American capital to find profit¬ 
able investment. The doors are voluntarily wide open. 

American willingness to submit to the people’s will in the 
Caribbean was, in fact, nicely illustrated in the fall of 1933, a 
few months after Blakeslee’s article appeared, when Ramon Grau 
San Martin came into pow r er in Cuba with a program that 
interrupted what Sumner Welles described as the attempt to 
secure “a practical monopoly of the Cuban market for American 
imports.” As Welles noted, this government was “highly prej¬ 
udicial to our interest . . . our own commercial and export 
interests cannot be revived under this government.” Conse¬ 
quently, Roosevelt refused to recognize the Grau government, 
and Welles commenced his intrigues (which he admitted were 
“anomalous”) with Batista, who was, in his judgment, “the only 
individual in Cuba today who represented authority. . . . This 
.. . had rallied to his support the very great majority of the com¬ 
mercial and financial interests in Cuba who are looking for 
protection” (Welles to Hull, October 4, 1933). The Grau gov¬ 
ernment soon fell, with the result that “the pre-1930 social and 
economic class structure was retained, and the important place 
in the Cuban economy held by foreign enterprises was not 
fundamentally disturbed.” 98

The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


But the basic inadequacy of the Japanese analogy, as Blakes- 
lee points out, is the difference in aims. The United States 

aims to help the backward Caribbean countries to establish and 
maintain conditions of stability and prosperity. The United States 
does not wish to seize territory, directly or indirectly, or to as¬ 
sume political or economic control. And when it has seemed 
necessary to intervene in some revolution-tossed land, it has 
effected the necessary reorganization and has then withdrawn. 

It is this benevolence of intent that the Japanese do not share. 
Consequently, their appeal to the precedent of American prac¬
