defined, the revolutionary pacifism of Muste seems to me both 
eminently realistic and highly moral. Furthermore, even if we 
were to grant the claim that the United States simply acted in 
legitimate self-defense, subsequent events in Asia have amply, 
hideously, confirmed Muste’s basic premise that “the means one 
uses inevitably incorporate themselves into his ends and, if evil, 
will defeat him.” Whether Muste’s w r as in fact the most realistic 
and moral position at the time may be debated, but I think 
there is no doubt that its remoteness from the American con¬ 
sciousness was a great tragedy. The lack of a radical critique of 
the sort that Muste, and a few others, sought to develop was 
one of the factors that contributed to the atrocity of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki, as the weakness and ineffectiveness of such radi¬ 
cal critique today will doubtless lead to new and unimaginable 
horrors.

6. The probabilities are meaningless with respect to the objective situ¬ 
ation, but not with respect to the mentalities of those who use them as 
a guide to action. If anything can be more frightening than the behav¬ 
ior of the self-styled “pragmatic” and “tough-minded” policy makers 
of the Kennedy administration in this crisis, it is the attitude that 
remains, long after the crisis has cooled, that this was Kennedy's 
“finest hour,” in which he demonstrated his skill at the game of 
“nuclear chicken” (cf. historian Thomas Bailey, New York Times 
Magazine, November 6, 1965).
