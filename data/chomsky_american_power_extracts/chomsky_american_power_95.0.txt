heim, ed., The Historian and the Diplomat (New York, Harper & 
Row, Publishers, 1967), pp. 123-69. Morton goes on to develop the 
conventional view that the Soviet Union is solely to blame for the 
dimming of “the bright hopes for the future,” by “the subtle challenge 
of political subversion and economic penetration” (unthinkable to the 
West, of course), and by support of revolution, as in Greece, “in 
violation of allied wartime agreements that had placed Greece in the 
western sphere of interest.” As to the latter, he does not discuss the 
considerable evidence that indicates, rather, that Stalin was opposed to 
the Greek rebellion and adhered to the Churchill-Stalin settlement that 
divided Europe into spheres of influence. He also makes no mention of 
Truman’s statement, immediately after Nagasaki, that Bulgaria and

Rumania, the two countries assigned predominantly to the Russian 
sphere in the Churchill-Stalin agreement, “are not to be spheres of 
influence of any one power.” Nor is there any reference to the Ameri¬

Science Quarterly, Vol. 82 (December 1967), Arthur Schlesinger de¬ 
scribes Morton's essay as “an always intelligent account of the role of

point those looking for a Studies on the Left expose of the corruptions 
allegedly wrought in the writing of American history by the decision 
to oppose Communist aggression after 1945.”

Arnold wanted as big a finale as possible, hoping that USASTAF 
could hit the Tokyo area in a 1,000-plane mission: the Twentieth Air 
Force had put up 853 B-29’s and 79 fighters on 1 August, and Arnold 
thought the number could be rounded out by calling on Doolittle's 
Eighth Air Force. Spaatz still wanted to drop the third atom bomb on 
Tokyo but thought that battered city a poor target for conventional 
bombing; instead, he proposed to divide his forces between seven targets.
