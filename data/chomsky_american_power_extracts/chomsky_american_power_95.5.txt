Arnold was apologetic about the unfortunate mixup on the 11th and, ac¬ 
cepting Spaatz’ amendment, assured him that his orders had been “co¬ 
ordinated with my superiors all the way to the top.” The teleconference 
ended with a fervid “Thank God” from Spaatz. . . . From the Marianas, 

449 B-29’s went out for a daylight strike on the 14th, and that night, 
with top officers standing by at Washington and Guam for a last- 
minute cancellation, 372 more were airborne. Seven planes dispatched 
on special bombing missions by the 509th Group brought the number 
of B-29’s to 828, and with 186 fighter escorts dispatched, USASTAF 
passed Arnold’s goal with a total of 1,014 aircraft. There were no 
losses, and before the last B-29 returned President Truman announced 
the unconditional surrender of Japan.

In the afternoon of August 14, 1945, thousands of people died during 
a protracted and intensive aerial bombardment of an arsenal in Osaka. 

I was a witness to the tragedy. I saw dozens of corpses—loyal subjects 
literally consumed by service to a government which had already

decided to accept the Potsdam Declaration’s demand for unconditional 
surrender. The only reason these people died was because they hap¬ 
pened to have been in the arsenal or environs at the time of the air 
raid. After what seemed an eternity of terror and anguish, we who 
were fortunate enough to survive emerged from our shelters. We found 
the corpses—and the leaflets which American bombers had dropped 
over the destruction. The leaflets proclaimed in Japanese, “Your 
Government has surrendered. The war is over!”
