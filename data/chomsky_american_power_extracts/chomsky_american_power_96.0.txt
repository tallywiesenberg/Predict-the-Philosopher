to argue that it was Japanese inexperience that led to passivity and 
acceptance of the American attempt, with British backing, to attain 
hegemony in the Pacific—an obvious consequence of “equality” among 
unequals.

(Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press, 1963), p. 188, “over 200,000 
Japanese were living along the South Manchuria Railway and in the 
Kwantung leased territory.” Japanese estimates for Manchuria as a 
whole are much higher. Yasaka Takagi estimated the number of Japa¬ 
nese in Manchuria as approximately one million (“World Peace 
Machinery and the Asia Monroe Doctrine,” Pacific Affairs, Vol. 5 [No¬ 
vember 1932], pp. 941-53; reprinted in Toward International Under¬ 
standing [Tokyo, Kenkyusha, 1954]).

reaction to the American destruction of cities of the Mekong Delta in 
early February 1968, for example, the destruction of Ben Tre with 
thousands of civilian casualties to protect 20 American soldiers (20 
had been killed, in a garrison of 40), after the city had been taken 
over, virtually without a fight, by the NLF forces. 

25. Japan and Her Destiny, ed. F. S. G. Piggott (New York, E. P. 
Dutton & Co., Inc., 1958). Shigemitsu describes the Manchurian inci¬ 
dent as, in effect, one aspect of an attempted coup, of which the 
domestic aspect failed. From his viewpoint, “Manchuria was an out¬ 
lying district belonging to and colonized by China,” a “sparsely popu¬ 
lated, backward country on the borders of China.” By 1930, the 
“revolutionary diplomacy” of China was attempting to reverse and 
overthrow the unequal treaties, including long-standing Japanese in¬ 
terests. At a time when the only solution to world problems was free 
trade, Europe was reverting to a closed autarchic economy and block¬ 
ing trade between Japan and the colonial possessions of the European 
powers, and the League of Nations was following the policy of keep¬ 
ing the world static, in the interests of established imperialism. The 
Kwantung Army acted unilaterally, to protect what they took to be 
the legitimate interests of Japan in Manchuria. Later steps to defend 
Manchukuo were determined in part by the threat of ultimate Com¬ 
munist encirclement (by Communist Chinese and the Soviet Union), 
and in part as an attempt to “counter the world movement to closed 
economies,” which required that the Japanese must attempt “to attain 
self-sufficiency.” This view of the situation, to which I return below, 
was not unrealistic. 

26. Shigemitsu, however, did not escape the Shanghai incident quite 
so lightly as did, say, American Ambassador to the Dominican Repub¬ 
lic W. Taplev Bennett or Presidential Envoy John Bartlow Martin 23 
years later, in not dissimilar circumstances. Shigemitsu was severely 
wounded by a terrorist (an advocate of Korean independence) and 
had a leg amputated.

Morris (New York, Oxford University Press, 1963), p. 30. Maruyama 
adds that “while there is no doubt that the Manchurian Incident acted 
as a definite stimulus to Japanese fascism, it must be emphasized that

the fascist movement was not something that suddenly arose after 
1931.”
