as “one of Japan’s foremost political scientists and a leading pre-war 
liberal.”

complex roots of fascism in Japan was a great concern for the suffer¬ 
ing of the poor farmers, particularly after the great depression struck.

comments.

37. Comparisons are difficult, but it seems that the Japanese were 
considerably more successful in establishing a functioning puppet gov¬ 
ernment in Manchuria than the United States has ever been in Viet¬ 
nam, just as the Germans were more successful in converting French 
nationalist forces to their ends in occupied and Vichy France than the 
United States has been in Vietnam. On the insurgency that developed 
in Manchuria, and the Japanese attempts to suppress it, see below, 
pages 195-201.

41. In addition, there were those who opposed any compromise or 
concession on the grounds that it would then be impossible “to face 
the myriad spirits of the war dead” (General Matsui, 1941, cited by 
Maruyama, op. cit., p. 113). It is painful to contemplate the question 
of how many have died, throughout history, so that others shall not 
have died in vain.

Another crucial factor, according to Maruyama (p. 124), was “the 
counsel of the Senior Retainers close to the Emperor, who had chosen 
war abroad in preference to class struggle at home, and who were then 
less afraid of losing that war than of risking revolution”—also a famil¬ 
iar pattern. See, for example, the discussion of the Spanish Civil War 
on pages 74-124 above.

arship generally agrees that these accords recognized the “special posi¬ 
tion” of the Japanese in the Manchuria-Mongolia region. See, for 
example, Robert A. Scalapino in Willard L. Thorp, ed., The United 
States and the Far East (New York, Columbia University Press,

col which in effect canceled this concession.

47. This is as large a force as the United States maintained in Viet¬ 
nam in 1962. In late 1937, the Japanese had 160,000 troops in China. 
One tends to forget, these days, what was the scale of fascist aggres¬ 
sion a generation ago.

52. Officers of the Japanese army in China expressed the same solici¬ 
tude. General Matsui, departing to take up his post as commander-in¬ 
chief of the Japanese expeditionary force in Shanghai in 1937, stated: 
“I am going to the front not to fight an enemy but in the state of mind 
of one who sets out to pacify his brother.” At the Tokyo Tribunal he 
defined his task in the following words: “The struggle between Japan 
and China was always a fight between brothers within the ‘Asian
