Another crucial factor, according to Maruyama (p. 124), was “the 
counsel of the Senior Retainers close to the Emperor, who had chosen 
war abroad in preference to class struggle at home, and who were then 
less afraid of losing that war than of risking revolution”—also a famil¬

nam in 1962. In late 1937, the Japanese had 160,000 troops in China. 
One tends to forget, these days, what was the scale of fascist aggres¬
