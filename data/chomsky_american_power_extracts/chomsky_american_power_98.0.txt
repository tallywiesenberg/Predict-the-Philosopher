The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


family/ ... It has been my belief all these years that we must regard 
this struggle as a method of making the Chinese undergo self-reflec¬ 
tion. We do not do this because we hate them, but on the contrary 
because we love them too much. It is just the same as in a family 
when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill- 
behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him 
behave properly.” Quoted by Maruyama, op. cit., p. 95.

(New York, Oxford University Press, 1954), p. 156, from The 
Memoirs of Cordell Hull (New York, The Macmillan Company, 
1948), Vol. 1, pp. 725-26.

events.

immigration law of 1924 had been a particularly bitter blow to the 
Japanese. In addition there were immigration barriers in Canada, Latin 
America, Australia, and New Zealand. It is worthy of mention that 
the Japanese effort to insert a racial-equality paragraph into the 
League of Nations resolutions endorsing the “principle of equality of 
Nations” and “just treatment of their nationals” had been blocked by 
Britain. Woodrow Wilson, then in the chair, ruled that it should not 
be instituted “in view of the serious objections of some of us” (Pal, op. 
cit., pp. 317 f.). Only Britain and the United States failed to vote for 
this resolution. See Neumann, op. cit., pp. 153-54.
