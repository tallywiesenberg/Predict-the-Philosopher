The Revolutionary Pacifism of A. J. Muste 


family/ ... It has been my belief all these years that we must regard 
this struggle as a method of making the Chinese undergo self-reflec¬ 
tion. We do not do this because we hate them, but on the contrary 
because we love them too much. It is just the same as in a family 
when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill- 
behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him 
behave properly.” Quoted by Maruyama, op. cit., p. 95.

immigration law of 1924 had been a particularly bitter blow to the 
Japanese. In addition there were immigration barriers in Canada, Latin 
America, Australia, and New Zealand. It is worthy of mention that 
the Japanese effort to insert a racial-equality paragraph into the 
League of Nations resolutions endorsing the “principle of equality of 
Nations” and “just treatment of their nationals” had been blocked by 
Britain. Woodrow Wilson, then in the chair, ruled that it should not 
be instituted “in view of the serious objections of some of us” (Pal, op. 
cit., pp. 317 f.). Only Britain and the United States failed to vote for 
this resolution. See Neumann, op. cit., pp. 153-54.

remark that American postwar Philippine policy served to perpetuate 
what United Nations representative Salvador Lopez calls the prewar 
“system rooted in injustice and greed” which “required the riveting of 
the Philippine economy to the American economy through free trade 
arrangements between the two countries,” and which, in “tacit al-

legiance with the Filipino economic elite” led to a “colonial economy 
of the classical type” (“The Colonial Relationship,” in Frank H. 
Golay, ed., The United States and the Philippines [Englewood Cliffs, 
N.J., Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1966], pp. 7-31). Furthermore, this “short¬ 
sighted policy of pressing for immediate commercial advantage” inter¬ 
rupted the Philippine revolution that was under way at the time of the 
American conquest. This “interruption” continued, for example, with 
the policies of Magsaysay, who “cleared away the ambivalence which 
had arisen in the persistent experimentation with public corporations 
of various kinds by a firm avowal that public policy would reflect faith 
in and dependence upon private enterprise” (Frank H. Golay, “Eco¬ 
nomic Collaboration: The Role of American Investment,” in ibid., p. 
109). One effect of this “improvement” in “the political and economic 
aspects of the investment climate” was that from 1957 to 1963 “earn¬ 
ings accruing to American foreign investors were in excess of twice 
the amount of direct foreign investment in the Philippines,” an inter¬ 
esting case of foreign aid. In fact, the preferential trade relations 
forced on the Philippines in 1946 virtually guaranteed American 
domination of the economy. Two Filipino economists, writing in the 
same volume, point out that “acceptance of the Trade Act by the 
Philippines was the price for war damage payments. In view of the 
prevailing economic circumstances, Filipinos had no alternative but to 
accept, after considerable controversy and with obvious reluctance” 
(p. 132). But the “compensating” rehabilitation act was itself some¬ 
thing of a fraud, since “the millions of dollars of war damage pay¬ 
ments ... in effect went back to the United States in the form of 
payments for imports, to the benefit of American industry and labor” 
(p. 125).
