obvious parallels between Japanese fascism and contemporary Ameri¬ 
can imperialism in Southeast Asia, we should also not overlook the 
fundamental differences; in particular, the fact that Japan really was

fighting for its survival as a great power, in the face of great-power 
“encirclement” that was no paranoid delusion. 

68. “Despite the vigor of the Japanese government’s efforts to convey 
the idea that they wanted American aid in achieving a quick settlement 
[in 1937], United States officials again failed to understand the situa¬ 
tion” (Borg, op. cit.y p. 466). Unfortunately for the Japanese apolo¬ 
gists, they were unable to use some of the devices available to their 
current American counterparts to explain the failure of the Chinese to 
accept their honorable offers. For example, the director of Harvard’s 
East Asian Research Center, John King Fairbank, thoughtfully ex¬ 
plains that “when we offer to negotiate we are making an honorable 
offer which, in our view, is a civilized and normal thing to do,” but the 
Asian mind does not share our belief “in the supremacy of law and the 
rights of the individual protected by law through due process” and is 
thus unable to perceive our honorable intent and obvious sincerity 
(Boston Globe y August 19, 1967). It is only those rather superficial 
critics who do not understand the Asian mind who insist on taking the 
North Vietnamese literally when they state that negotiations can fol¬ 
low a cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, or who point out 
the moral absurdity of the plea that both the victim and his assailant 
“cease their violence.”

regard, abandoning its control over Chinese tariffs in 1928. Germany 
and the Soviet Union had relinquished extraterritoriality in the 1920s 
(the United States did so in 1942). Japan relinquished these rights in 
the puppet state of Manchukuo.

understood by Asians. Thorp, formerly Assistant Secretary of State and 
member of the UN delegation, and at the time a professor of eco¬ 
nomics at Amherst, also draws the remarkable conclusion, in 1956, 
that one of the major international problems is the demonstrated will¬ 
ingness of the Soviet Union to support aggression in Indochina. The 
conference whose proceedings he was editing concluded finally with

and again be free” (p. 225), but did not specify when the people of 
China had previously possessed their liberties and lived in freedom.

bringing this study to my attention. As is very often the case with 
RAND Corporation studies, it is difficult to determine whether it was 
written seriously or with tongue in cheek. There is no reason to ques¬

the memorandum are particularly interesting.
