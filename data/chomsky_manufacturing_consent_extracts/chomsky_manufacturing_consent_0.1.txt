It is well recognized, and may even be said to constitute a part of an insti¬ 
tutional critique such as we present in this volume, that the various parts 
of media organizations have some limited autonomy, that individual and 
professional values influence media work, that policy is imperfectly en¬ 
forced, and that media policy itself may allow some measure of dissent 
and reporting that calls into question the accepted viewpoint* These con¬ 
siderations all work to assure some dissent and coverage of inconvenient 
facts.2 The beauty of the system, however, is that such dissent and incon¬ 
venient information are kept within bounds and at the margins, so that 
while their presence shows that the system is not monolithic, they are 
not large enough to interfere unduly with the domination of the official 
agenda.It should also be noted that we are talking about media structure and 
performance, not the effects of the media on the public.Certainly, the 
media's adherence to an official agenda with little dissent is likely to 
influence public opinion in the desired direction, but this is a matter of 
degree, and where the public’s interests diverge sharply from that of the 
elite, and where they have their own independent sources of information, 
the official line may be widely doubted.The point that we want to stress 
here, however, is that the propaganda model describes forces that shape 
what the media does; it does not imply that any propaganda emanating 
from the media is always effective.
