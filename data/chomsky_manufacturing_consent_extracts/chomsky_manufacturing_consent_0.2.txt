Thus, cen¬ 
tralization of the media in a shrinking number of very large firms has 
accelerated, virtually unopposed by Republican and Democratic admin¬ 
istrations and regulatory authority* Ben Bagdikian notes that when the 
first edition of his Media Monopoly was published in 1983 , fifty giant 
firms dominated almost every mass medium; but just seven years later, in 
1990 , only twenty-three firms occupied the same commanding position .4 

Since 1990 , a wave of massive deals and rapid globalization have 
left the media industries further centralized in nine transnational con¬ 
glomerates—Disney, AOLTime Warner, Viacom (owner of CBS), News 
Corporation, Bertelsmann, General Electric (owner of NBC), Sony, 
AT&T-Liberty Media, and Vivendi Universal.These giants own all the 
world's major film studios, TV networks, and music companies, and a 
sizable fraction of the most important cable channels, cable systems, 
magazines, major-market TV stations, and book publishers.The largest, 
the recently merged AOL Time Warner, has integrated the leading Inter¬ 
net portal into the traditional media system.Another fifteen firms round 
out the sysrem, meaning that two dozen firms contro] nearly the entirety 
of media experienced by most U*S. citizens.
