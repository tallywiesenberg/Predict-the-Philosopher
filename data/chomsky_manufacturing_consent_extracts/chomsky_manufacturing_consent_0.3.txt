Neoliberal 
ideology has provided the intellectual rationale for policies that have 
opened up the ownership of broadcasting stations and cable and satellite 
systems to private transnational investors.The culture and ideology fostered in this globalization process relate 
largely to “lifestyle” themes and goods and their acquisition; and they 
tend to weaken any sense of community helpful to civic life.Robert 
McChesney notes that “the hallmark of the global media system is its 
relentless* ubiquitous commercialism .” 7 Shopping channels* “infomer¬ 
cials , 55 and product placement are booming in the global media system.McChesney adds that “it should come as no surprise that account after 
account in the late 1990 s documents the fascination* even the obsession* 
of the world’s middle class youth with consumer brands and products .” 3 
The global media’s “news” attention in recent years, aside from reporting 
on crusades such as “Operation Allied Force” (the NATO war against 
Yugoslavia) and on national elections* has been inordinately directed to 
sensationalism, as in their obsessive focus on the O. J, Simpson trial, the 
Lewinsky scandal* and the deaths of two of the West’s supercelebrities* 
Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy* Jr.Globalization, along with deregulation and national budgetary pres- 
sures* has also helped reduce the importance of noncommercial media 
in country after country.
