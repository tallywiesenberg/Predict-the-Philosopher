The Internet is not an instrument of mass communication for those 
lacking brand names, an already existing large audience* and/or large re¬ 
sources.Only sizable commercial organizations have been able to make 
large numbers aware of the existence of their Internet offerings.The 
privatization of the Internet’s hardware* the rapid commercialization 
and concentration of Internet portals and servers and their integration 
into non-Internet conglomerates—the AOL-Time Warner merger was a 
giant step in that direction—and the private and concentrated control 
of the new broadband technology* together threaten to limit any future 
prospects of the Internet as a democratic media vehicle.The past few years have witnessed a rapid penetration of the Internet 
by the leading newspapers and media conglomerates, all fearful of being 
outflanked by small pioneer users of the new technology* and willing 
(and able) to accept losses for years while testing out these new waters.Anxious to reduce these losses* however* and with advertisers leery of the 
value of spending in a medium characterized by excessive audience con¬ 
trol and rapid surfing* the large media entrants into the Internet have 
gravitated to making familiar compromises—more attention to selling 
goods* cutting back on news, and providing features immediately attrac¬ 
tive to audiences and advertisers.
