When the Soviet 
economy stagnated in the 1980 s, it was attributed to the absence of mar¬ 
kets; when capitalist Russia disintegrated in the 1990 s, this was blamed 
not on the now ruling market but on politicians' and workers' failure to 
let markets work their magic .20 Journalism has internalized this ideology.Adding it to the residual power of anticommunism in a world in which 
the global power of market institutions makes nonmarket options seem 
utopian gives us an ideological package of immense strength.These changes, which have strengthened the applicability of the prop¬ 
aganda model, have seriously weakened the “public sphere,” which refers 
to the array of places and forums in which matters important to a demo¬ 
cratic community are debated and information relevant to intelligent cit¬ 
izen participation is provided.The steady advance, and cultural power, of 
marketing and advertising has caused “the displacement of a political 
public sphere by a depoliticized consumer culture And it has had 
the effect of creating a world of virtual communities built by advertisers 
and based on demographics and taste differences of consumers.
