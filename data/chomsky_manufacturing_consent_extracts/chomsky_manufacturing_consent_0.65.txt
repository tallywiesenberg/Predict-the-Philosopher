in a democratic order , 22 These virtual communities are organized to buy 
and sell goods, not to create or service a public sphere.Advertisers don't like the public sphere, where audiences are relatively 
small, upsetting controversy takes place, and the settings are not ideal

well exemplified in the history of broadcasting in the United States over 
the past seventy-five years , 23 But entertainment has the merit not only 
of being better suited to helping sell goods; it is an effective vehicle for 
hidden ideological messages , 24 Furthermore, in a system of high and 
growing inequality, entertainment is the contemporary equivalent of 
the Roman “games of the circus” that diverts the public from politics 
and generates a political apathy that is helpful to preservation of the sta¬

free choices of the public either as citizens or consumers.The citizenry

would never be buried in favor of the entertainment preferred by adver¬ 
tisers, was never fulfilled .
