26 The public is not sovereign over the mediaâ€” 
the owners and managers, seeking ads, decide what is to be offered, and 
the public must choose among these.People watch and read in good part 
on the basis of what is readily available and intensively promoted.Polls 
regularly show that the public would like more news, documentaries, and 
other information, and less sex, violence, and other entertainment, even 
as they do listen to and watch the latter.There is little reason to believe 
that they would not like to understand why they are working harder with 
stagnant or declining incomes, have inadequate medical care at high 
costs, and what is being done in their name all over the world.If they are 
not getting much information on these topics, the propaganda model can 
explain why: the sovereigns who control the media choose not to offer 
such material.
