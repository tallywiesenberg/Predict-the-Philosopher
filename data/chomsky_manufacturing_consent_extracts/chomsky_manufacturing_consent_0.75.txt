UPDATING THE CASE STUDIES 

In the case studies presented in chapters 2 through 6 , we examine the dif¬ 
ferences in treatment of situations broadly similar in character, except for 
the political and economic interests at stake.Our expectation is that news 
as well as editorial opinion will be strongly influenced by those interests 
and should display a predictable bias.We would anticipate, for example, 
that an election held by a client-state government favored by U.S. offi¬ 
cials would be treated differently by the media than an election held by a 
government that U.S. officials oppose.It will be seen in chapter 3 that in 
the important elections analyzed there this dichotomous treatment and 
bias was displayed to an extraordinary degree.Worthy and Unworthy Victims 

In chapter 2 , we compare the media's treatment of victims of enemy 
states and those of the United States and U.S. client states.
