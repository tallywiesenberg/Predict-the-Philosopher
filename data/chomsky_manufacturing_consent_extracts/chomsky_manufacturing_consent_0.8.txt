Our predic¬ 
tion is that the victims of enemy states will be found “worthy” and will 
be subject to more intense and indignant coverage than those victimized 



XX INTRODUCTION 


by the United States or its diems, who are implicitly “unworthy / 1 It is 
shown in chapter 2 that a 1984 victim of the Polish Communists, the 
priest Jerzy Popieluszko, not only received far more coverage than Arch¬ 
bishop Oscar Romero, murdered in the U.S. client-state El Salvador in 
1980 ; he was given more coverage than the aggregate of one hundred reli¬ 
gious victims killed in U.S. client states, although eight of those victims 
were US.citizens.This bias is politically advantageous to U.S, policy-makers, for focus¬ 
ing on victims of enemy states shows those states to be wicked and 
deserving of U.S. hostility; while ignoring US.and client-state victims 
allows ongoing U.S. policies to proceed more easily, unburdened by the 
interference of concern over the politically inconvenient victims.It is not 
a credible reply that difficulty in getting evidence on “unworthy 1 ’ victims 
can account for the application of such a gross double standard, as an 
alternative press with meager resources has been able to gather a great 
deal of material on their mistreatment from highly credible sources, such 
as major human rights organizations and church representatives .
