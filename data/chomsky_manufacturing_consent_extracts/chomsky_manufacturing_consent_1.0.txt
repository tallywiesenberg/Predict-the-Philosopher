Introduction 


This book centers in what we call a “propaganda 

models an analytical framework That attempts to explain the perform¬ 
ance of the U.S. media in terms of the basic institutional structures and 
relationships within which they operate. It is our view that, among their 
other functions* the media serve* and propagandize on behalf of, the 
powerful societal interests that control and finance them. The represen¬ 
tatives of these interests have important agendas and principles that they 
want to advance* and they are well positioned to shape and constrain 
media policy. This is normally not accomplished by crude intervention, 
but by the selection of right-thinking personnel and by the editors' and 
working journalists' internalization of priorities and definitions of news¬ 
worthiness that conform to the institution’s policy. 

Structural factors are those such as ownership and control, depend¬ 
ence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual 
interests and relationships between the media and those who make the 
news and have the power to define it and explain what it means. The 
propaganda model also incorporates other closely related factors such 
as the ability to complain about the media’s treatment of news (that is* 
produce “flak”), to provide “experts” to confirm the official slant on the 
news, and to fix the basic principles and ideologies that are taken for 
granted by media personnel and the elite* but are often resisted by the 
general population* 1 In our view* the same underlying power sources that 
own the media and fund them as advertisers* that serve as primary defin- 
ers of the news, and that produce flak and proper-thinking experts, also 
play a key role in fixing basic principles and the dominant ideologies. 
We believe that what journalists do* what they see as newsworthy, and 
what they take for granted as premises of their work are frequently well 
explained by the incentives* pressures, and constraints incorporated into 
such a structural analysis* 




Xll INTRODUCTION 


These structural factors that dominate media operations are not all¬ 
controlling and do not always produce simple and homogeneous results. 
It is well recognized, and may even be said to constitute a part of an insti¬
