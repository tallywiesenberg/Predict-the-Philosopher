Shortly there¬ 
after, under considerable international pressure, the United States in¬ 
vited Indonesia to leave the devastated country* 

We have shown elsewhere that in 1975 and later the U.S. media treated 
the East Timorese as unworthy victims, saving their attention and indig¬ 
nation for the almost simultaneous killings under Pol Pot in Cambodia* 
The victims of Pol Pot, a Communist leader, were worthy, although after 
he was ousted by the Vietnamese in 1978, Cambodians ceased to be wor¬ 
thy, as U.S. policy shifted toward support of Pol Pot in exile.32 The East 
Timorese remained unworthy in the 1990s, as the table suggests.As the leader of the faction insisting on harsh sanctions against Iraq 
following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the United States itself was respon¬ 
sible for a very large number of Iraqi civilians deaths in the 1990s.John 
and Karl Mueller assert that these “sanctions of mass destruction” have 
caused the deaths of “more people in Iraq than have been slain by all 
so-called weapons of mass destruction [nuclear and chemical] through¬ 
out all history*” 33 A large fraction of the million or more killed by sanc¬ 
tions were young children; UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy 
pointed out that “if the substantial reduction in child mortality through¬ 
out Iraq during the 1980s had continued through the 1990s, there would 
have been half a million fewer deaths of children under five in the country

as a whole during the eight year period 1991 to 1998.” 34 However* as 
these deaths resulted from U.S. policy, and Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright declared on national television that these 500,000 child deaths 
were “worth it we would expect the U.S. media to find these victims 
unworthy, to give them little attention and less indignation, and to find 
the word “genocide” inapplicable to this case.The table shows that this 
expectation was realized in media practice.
