The case for severe media bias suggested by the usage of genocide 
shown in the table is strengthened by the fact that, despite the great 
media attention to and indignation over the abuse of the Kosovo Albani¬ 
ans by the Serbs in 1998-1999, this mistreatment was almost certainly 
less severe than that meted out to the Kurds in Turkey in the 1990s and 
to the Hast Timorese by the Indonesian army and paramilitary forces in 
East Timor in 1999.Deaths in Kosovo on all sides in the year before the 
NATO bombing were estimated by U.S. and other Western sources to 
number no more than 2,000, and the Serb assault and expulsions that 
followed and accompanied the NATO bombing campaign also appear to 
have resulted in deaths in the low thousands (an intensive postwar search 
for graves had yielded some 3,000 bodies by August 2000, not all of them 
Albanian civilians or necessarily victims of the Serbs).36 Deaths in the 
Turkish war on the Kurds in the 1990s were estimated to be 30,000 or 
more, a large fraction Kurdish civilians, with refugee numbers running to 
2 to 3 million.In East Timor, where the Indonesian military organized 
and collaborated with a paramilitary opposition to a U.N.-sponsored in¬ 
dependence referendum held on August 30, 1999, an estimated 5,000 to 
6,000 East Timorese civilians were slaughtered even before the referen¬ 
dum vote that rejected Indonesian rule, which unleashed a furious In¬ 
donesian army-paramilitary assault on East Timorese.37 

The double standard reflected in the politicized use of “genocide” is 
applicable to the treatment of news events more broadly, with the media 
regularly focusing on the abuse of worthy victims and playing down or 
neglecting altogether the plight of unworthy victims.
