It was 
also neither a unique event nor was it connected to any warfare, as in 
Kosovo—it was a straightforward slaughter of civilians.But U.S. officials 
did not denounce this massacre—in fact, active U.S. support of the In¬ 
donesian military continued throughout this period and up to a week 
after the referendum, by which time 85 percent of the population had 
been driven from their homes and well over 6,000 civilians had been 
slaughtered.The US.mainstream media followed the official lead.For 
a twelve-month period following the date of each event, the mentions 
of Racak by the five media entities cited in the table exceeded mentions 
of Liquica by 4.1 to i, and mentions of “massacre” at the two sites was 
in a ratio of 6.7 to 1.
