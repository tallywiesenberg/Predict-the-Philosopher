This same bias is apparent in the press treatment of more recent eiec- 
tions in Cambodia, Yugoslavia, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and 
Uruguay.Cambodia and Yugoslavia were the only two of these seven 
ruled by a party strongly objectionable to U.S, policy-makers, and it is in 
these cases that the New York Times warned of serious problems: As re¬ 
gards Cambodia, it asserted that “flawed elections are worse than none,” 
and that “the international community must proceed cautiously, lest a 
rigged election give Mr. Hun Sen a veneer of legitimacy” 42 In reporting 
on the Yugoslavian election of September 2000, in which U.S. officials 
intervened openly to prevent the reelection of Slobodan Milosevic, the 
Times and media in general repeatedly warned of the possibility of fraud 
and a rigged election.43 In the case of Kenya, where U.S. policy toward 
the ruling government was ambivalent, here also the Times was skeptical 
of election quality, noting that “holding elections is not enough to assure 
democratic government” and stressing the need for “an independent 
electoral commission less bound to political parties” and “independent 
broadcast media, allowing opposition voices to be heard outside election 
periods.” 44 

But in the other four elections, organized and won by governments 
strongly favored by the U.S. State Department, there were no suggestions 
that “flawed elections are worse than none” and no featuring of the threat 
of fraud; the importance of an independent electoral commission and 
broadcast media was not pressed, and in each case the election was found 
to be a step toward democracy and hence legitimizing.In the case of Mexico, long subject to one party (PRI) rule, but sup¬ 
ported by the U.S. government over the past several decades, the Times 
has regularly found the Mexican elections encouraging, in contrast with 
past fraudulent ones which, at the time, the editors also contrasted favor¬ 
ably with those in the more distant past!It has featured expressions of 
benevolent intent and downplayed structural defects and abuses.
