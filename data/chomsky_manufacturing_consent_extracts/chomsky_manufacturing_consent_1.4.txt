Thus, 
in its first editorial on the 1988 election that brought Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari to power, the Times noted that prior elections were corrupt (the 
PRI “manipulated patronage, the news media and the ballot box”), but it 
stressed that PRI candidate Salinas “contends” that political reform is 
urgent and “calls for clean elections” 45 The editors questioned whether

“his party” will “heed his pleas,” a process of distancing the favored can¬ 
didate from responsibility for any abuses to come.In the editorials that 
followed, the Times did not suggest possible ongoing electoral fraud, 
“manipulated patronage " or media controls and bias, although this elec¬ 
tion was famous for a convenient “computer breakdown” in the election 
aftermath, which turned Carlos Salinas from an expected loser into a 
winner.Just three years later, however, at the time of the 1991 election, 
the editors stated that “as long as anyone can remember, Mexican elec¬ 
tions have been massively fraudulent” as it prepared readers for new 
promises of a cleanup.46 But all through this period and later, the Times 
(and its media rivals) did not focus on fraud or call these elections rigged; 
in both news stories and editorials they portrayed these deeply flawed 
elections as steps toward democracy and legitimizing.In the 1983 Turkish election, held under military rule, with harsh 
censorship and only three parties “led by politicians sympathetic to the 
military government” allowed to run, the Times found that “Turkey Ap¬ 
proaches Democracy.” 47 Similarly, in Uruguay’s 1984 election, under 
another military regime that jailed the leading opposition candidate and 
also refused to allow a second major candidate to run, but organized by a 
government approved by the US.
