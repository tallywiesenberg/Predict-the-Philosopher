Putin 
had built his popularity by conducting a brutal counterinsurgency war 
against Chechnya* and his electoral success rested heavily on the fact that 
the powerful state TV and radio stations campaigned furiously on his 
behalf and denigrated and gave no broadcasting time to his opponents.A September 2000 expose of the Putin election campaign by the expatri¬ 
ate Moscow Times , based on a six-month investigative effort* uncovered 
compelling evidence of election fraud* including ballot stuffing, ballot 
destruction* and the creation of 1.3 million “dead souls” inflating the 
election rolls.50 The US.mainstream media, however* never found any 
evidence of fraud at the time of the election, and they have been reluctant 
to report the findings of the Moscow Times study.51 Putin is another “re¬ 
former,” like Yeltsin* supported by the West, so that it follows once again 
that for the mainstream media a flawed election—hardly admitted to be 
flawed—remains better than none.
