The KGB-Bulgarian Plot to 
Assassinate the Pope 

During the Reagan era (1981-88)* there was a concerted effort to demo¬ 
nize the Soviet Union* in order to support a major arms buildup and a 
new* more aggressive policy in the Third World and globally.The Soviet 
Union was described as an “Evil Empire” and accused of sponsoring in¬ 
ternational terrorism as well as abusing its own and client-nation peo¬ 
ples.53 When the would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca shot Pope John 
Paul II in Rome in May 1981* this provided the basis for one of the most 
successful propaganda campaigns of the Cold War era.Although the pope's assailant was a Turkish fascist and member of a 
violently anti-left party in Turkey* after a seventeen-month stint in an 
Italian prison Agca “confessed” that he had been hired by the KGB and 
Bulgarians.This confession was convenient, fitting well the interests of 
the dominant Italian parties anxious to discredit the powerful Italian 
Communist party as well as the Reagan administration's “Evil Empire” 
campaign.
