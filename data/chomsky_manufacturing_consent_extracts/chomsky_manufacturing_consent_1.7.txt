One is that the Soviet and Bulgarian archives were opened up, and 
Allen Weinstein of the Center for Democracy gained permission from 
Bulgarian authorities in 1991 for members of his investigative commis¬ 
sion to look at the Bulgarian Interior Ministry's secret service files.After 
a stint in Bulgaria, Weinstein returned home having failed to locate any 
confirmatory evidence of Bulgarian or KGB involvement.The Los Ange¬ 
les TimeSy New York Times s Washington Post , Newsweek y and TimCy each of 
which had reported Weinstein's initiative and impending trip to Bulgaria 
in 1991, all failed to inform their readers of his negative findings.55 

Later in 1991, at Senate hearings on the confirmation of Robert Gates 
as head of the CIA, former CIA officers Melvin Goodman and Harold 
Ford testified that the CIA's analysis of the Bulgarian Connection had 
been seriously compromised and politicized in support of the Reagan era 
anti-Soviet propaganda campaign.Goodman testified that not only had 
the CIA found no evidence of Soviet or Bulgarian involvement in the 
shooting, but that based on the CIA’s “very good penetration of the Bul¬ 
garian secret services” its professionals had concluded that a Bulgarian 
Connection did not exist.
