The Times had 
long maintained that the CIA and the Reagan administration “recoiled 
from the devastating implication that Bulgaria’s agents were bound to 
have acted only on a signal from Moscow* 5 ’ 58 But Goodman’s and Ford’s 
testimony showed that this was the reverse of the truth, and that CIA 
heads William Casey and Robert Gates overrode the views of CIA pro¬ 
fessionals and falsified evidence to support a Soviet linkage.The Times 
was not aione in following a misleading party line, but it is notable that 
this paper of record has yet to acknowledge its exceptional gullibility and 
propaganda service* 


VIETNAM, LAOS, AND CAMBODIA 

Vietnam: Was the United States a 
Victim or an Aggressor?In chapters 5 through 7, we show that media coverage of the Indochina 
wars fits the propaganda model very well.The United States first in¬ 
tervened in Indochina immediately after World War II in support of 
French recolonization, after which it carried out a rwenty-one-year effort 
(1954-75) to impose a government in the southern half of Vietnam that 
U.S. officials and analysts consistently recognized as lacking any substan¬ 
tial indigenous support, and in opposition to local nationalist—though 
Communist—forces that were understood to have a mass base.U.S. 
leaders operated on the belief that their overwhelming military might 
would not only enable them, but entitled them, to force submission to a 
minority government of US.
