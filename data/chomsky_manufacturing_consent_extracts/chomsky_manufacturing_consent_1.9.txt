President George Bush stated in 1992 that “Hanoi knows today that 
we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past*” 59 
That is, the Vietnamese had done things to us that might justify retribu¬ 
tion on our part* but we only seek answers regarding our men missing 
in action.60 New York Times foreign affairs commentator Leslie Gelb justi¬ 
fied classifying Vietnam an “outlaw” on the grounds that “they had killed 
Americans* 5 ’ 61 This reflects the common establishment view, implicit in 
Bush’s comment, that nobody has a right of self-defense against this 
country, even if it intervenes across the ocean to impose by force a gov¬ 
ernment that the people of that country reject* 


U.S * Chemical Warfare in Indochina 

It is also of interest how the media have treated the massive use of chemi¬ 
cals during the Vietnam War and the horrifying aftermath for the vic¬ 
tim country* In 1961 and 1962 the Kennedy administration authorized 
the use of chemicals to destroy rice crops in South Vietnam—in violation 
of a U.S. tradition as well as international law (Admiral William Leahy* 
in response to a proposal to destroy Japanese rice crops in 1944* stated 
that This would “violate every Christian ethic I have ever heard of and

all known laws of war”)* 62 Between 1961 and 1971* however* the U*S* 
Air Force sprayed 20 million gallons of concentrated arsenic-based and 
dioxin-laden herbicides (mainly Agent Orange) on 6 million acres of 
crops and trees* besides using large quantities of the "super tear gas” 
CS and vast amounts of napalm and phosphorus bombs.63 An estimated 
13 percent of South Vietnam's land was subjected to chemical attacks* 
This included 30 percent of its rubber plantations and 36 percent of 
its mangrove forests* along with other large forest areas* destroyed by 
toxic chemicals in programs that included multiple “large-scale inten¬ 
tional effort[s] combining defoliation with incendiaries to produce a 
forest fire in South Vietnam*” 64 A 1967 study prepared by the head of 
the Agronomy Section of the Japanese Science Council concluded that 
U*S* anti crop warfare had already ruined more than 3*8 million acres of 
arable land in South Vietnam* killing almost i*ooo peasants and over 
13*000 livestock* 65 This policy of attempting to force enemy capitula¬ 
tion by destroying its food supply was not only contrary to the rules of 
war* 66 it was notable in that it “first and overwhelmingly affected small 
children*” 67 

Laos was also subjected to chemical attacks in 1966 and 1969* directed 
at both crops, and vegetation along communication routes* And in Cam¬ 
bodia* some 173*000 acres of rubber plantations* crops and forests were 
heavily sprayed with Agent Orange in the spring of 1969.63 The Cambo¬ 
dian government complained bitterly at the violation of its neutrality by 
this inhumane and illegal action* but Cambodia was too small and weak 
for its voice to be heard or for it to be able to mobilize a legal or other 
defense* Although the U,N* General Assembly did strongly condemn the 
use of chemical agents as contrary to international law by an 83^0-3 vote 
in 1969* it was powerless to act against the United States, and there was 
no “international community” mobilization to halt its use of chemical 
warfare in Cambodia or elsewhere in Indochina* 

During the Vietnam war* the use of chemicals was reported and criti¬ 
cized in the U,S.
