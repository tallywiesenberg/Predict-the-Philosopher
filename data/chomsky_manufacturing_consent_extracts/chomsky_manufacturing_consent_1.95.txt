media when first disclosed in 1966* but the subject was 
quickly dropped.The illegality of chemical warfare and a policy of star¬ 
vation, and their effects on the victim population, were virtually unre¬ 
ported* There were exceptions, such as Orville Schell* Jr.'s 1971 Look 
magazine article “Silent Vietnam: How we invented ecocide and killed a 
country” but they were rare indeed.After the war, because of the effects 
of Agent Orange on U.S. soldiers, there was some coverage of this chem¬

of this warfare in South Vietnam remained close to invisible* Of 522 arti¬

service personnel; only nine articles acknowledged the targeting of food 
crops (thiry-nine mentioned forest cover alone as the target); only eleven 
discussed in any detail the impact on Vietnamese and the Vietnamese 
environment; only three characterized the use of Agent Orange as a 
“chemical weapon” or “chemical warfare;” and in only two articles was it 
suggested that its use might constitute a war crime.The Wall Street Journal did have a lead story on this topic in February 
1997* reporting that as many as 500*000 children may have been born 
with dioxin-related deformities and that birth defects in the South were 
four times those in the North.70 The article did acknowledge U.S. re¬ 
sponsibility for this disaster but contended that “the United States* emo¬ 
tionally spent after losing the war* paid no heed.” But the United States 
did pay heed to the flight of the “boat people” and was not too exhausted 
to enforce a vigorous boycott of the target of its aggression* even if it took 
no responsibility whatever for the condition of its victims.
