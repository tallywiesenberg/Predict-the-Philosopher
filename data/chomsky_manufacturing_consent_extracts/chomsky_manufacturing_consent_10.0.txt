The five filters narrow the range of news that passes through the gates, 
and even more sharply limit what can become “big news,” subject to 
sustained news campaigns.By definition, news from primary establish¬ 
ment sources meets one major filter requirement and is readily accom¬ 
modated by the mass media.Messages from and about dissidents and 
weak, unorganized individuals and groups, domestic and foreign, are at 
an initial disadvantage in sourcing costs and credibility, and they often 
do not comport with the ideology or interests of the gatekeepers and 
other powerful parties that influence the filtering process.117 

Thus, for example, the torture of political prisoners and the attack 
on trade unions in Turkey will be pressed on the media only by human- 
rights activists and groups that have little political leverage.The U.S. 
government supported the Turkish martial-law government from its 
inception in 1980, and the U-S, business community has been warm 
toward regimes that profess fervent anticommunism, encourage foreign 
investment, repress unions, and loyally support U.S. foreign policy (a 
set of virtues that are frequently closely linked).
