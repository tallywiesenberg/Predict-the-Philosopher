was evident in reporting on the March 2000 Russian election* won by 
Yeltsin's anointed heir and former KGB operative Vladimir Putin. Putin 
had built his popularity by conducting a brutal counterinsurgency war 
against Chechnya* and his electoral success rested heavily on the fact that 
the powerful state TV and radio stations campaigned furiously on his 
behalf and denigrated and gave no broadcasting time to his opponents. 
A September 2000 expose of the Putin election campaign by the expatri¬ 
ate Moscow Times , based on a six-month investigative effort* uncovered 
compelling evidence of election fraud* including ballot stuffing, ballot 
destruction* and the creation of 1.3 million “dead souls” inflating the 
election rolls. 50 The US. mainstream media, however* never found any 
evidence of fraud at the time of the election, and they have been reluctant 
to report the findings of the Moscow Times study. 51 Putin is another “re¬ 
former,” like Yeltsin* supported by the West, so that it follows once again 
that for the mainstream media a flawed election—hardly admitted to be

Union was described as an “Evil Empire” and accused of sponsoring in¬ 
ternational terrorism as well as abusing its own and client-nation peo¬ 
ples. 53 When the would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca shot Pope John 
Paul II in Rome in May 1981* this provided the basis for one of the most 
successful propaganda campaigns of the Cold War era. 

Although the pope's assailant was a Turkish fascist and member of a 
violently anti-left party in Turkey* after a seventeen-month stint in an 
Italian prison Agca “confessed” that he had been hired by the KGB and 
Bulgarians. This confession was convenient, fitting well the interests of 
the dominant Italian parties anxious to discredit the powerful Italian 
Communist party as well as the Reagan administration's “Evil Empire” 
campaign. It was extremely suspicious for other reasons* coming so belat¬ 
edly* and after numerous visits to Agca by Italian secret service represen¬ 
tatives* judges* and papal agents* all with a political ax to grind, and with 
the secret service notorious for ideological extremism and willingness to

But the mainstream media accepted this story with astonishing gulli-
