These victims would be generally acknowledged by the managers of the 
filters to be wonky .„ The mass media never explain why Andrei Sa¬ 
kharov is worthy and Jose Luis Massera* in Uruguay* is unworthy—the 
attention and general dichotomization occur “naturally” as a result of 
the working of the filters* but the result is the same as if a commissar 
had instructed the media: “Concentrate on the victims of enemy powers 
and forget about the victims of friends.” 119 

Reports of the abuses of worthy victims not only pass through the 
filters; they may also become the basis of sustained propaganda cam¬ 
paigns.If the government or corporate community and the media feel 
that a story is useful as well as dramatic* they focus on it intensively 
and use it to enlighten the public- This was true, for example* of the 
shooting down by the Soviets of the Korean airliner KAL 007 in early 
September 1983, which permitted an extended campaign of denigration 
of an official enemy and greatly advanced Reagan administration arms 
plans.As Bernard Gwertzman noted complacently in the New York 
Times of August 31* 1984* U.S. officials "assert that worldwide criticism 
of the Soviet handling of the crisis has strengthened the United States 
in its relations with Moscow,” In sharp contrast, the shooting down by 
Israel of a Libyan civilian airliner in February 1973 led to no outcry in 
the West* no denunciations for “cold-blooded murder*” 120 and no boy¬ 
cott.This difference in treatment was explained by the New York Times 
precisely on the grounds of utility: “No useful purpose is served by an 
acrimonious debate over the assignment of blame for the downing of 
a Libyan airliner in the Sinai peninsula last week.” 121 There was a very 
“useful purpose” served by focusing on the Soviet act* and a massive 
propaganda campaign ensued.122 

Propaganda campaigns in general have been closely attuned to elite 
interests.
