Thus, while the focus on Cambodia 
in the Pol Pot era (and thereafter) was exceedingly serviceable, as 
Cambodia had fallen to the Communists and useful lessons could be 
drawn by attention to their victims, the numerous victims of the U.S, 
bombing before the Communist takeover were scrupulously ignored by 
the U.S. elite press.After Pol Pot’s ouster by the Vietnamese, the 
United States quietly shifted support to this “worse than Hitler” villain, 
with little notice in the press, which adjusted once again to the national 
political agenda, 124 Attention to the Indonesian massacres of 1965-66, 
or the victims of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor from 1975 
onward, would also be distinctly unhelpful as bases of media cam¬ 
paigns, because Indonesia is a U.S. ally and client that maintains an 
open door to Western investment, and because, in the case of East 
Timor, the United States bears major responsibility for the slaughter.The same is true of the victims of stare terror in Chile and Guatemala, 
U.S. clients whose basic institutional structures, including the state 
terror system, were put in place and maintained by, or with crucial 
assistance from, U,S.power, and who remain U.S. client states.Propa¬ 
ganda campaigns on behalf of these victims would conflict with govern¬ 
ment-business-military interests and, in our model, would not be able 
to pass through the filtering system.
