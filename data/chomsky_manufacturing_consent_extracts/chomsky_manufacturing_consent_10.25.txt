Propaganda campaigns may be instituted either by the government 
or by one or more of the top media firms.The campaigns to discredit 
the government of Nicaragua, to support the Salvadoran elections as 
an exercise in legitimizing democracy, and to use the Soviet shooting 
down of the Korean airliner KAL 007 as a means of mobilizing public 
support for the arms buildup, were instituted and propelled by the 
government.The campaigns to publicize the crimes of Pol Pot and the 
alleged KGB plot to assassinate the pope were initiated by the Reader’s 
Digest, with strong follow-up support from NBC-TV, the New York 
Times, and other major media companies, 126 Some propaganda cam¬ 
paigns are jointly initiated by government and media; all of them re¬ 
quire the collaboration of the mass media.The secret of the 
unidirectionality of the politics of media propaganda campaigns is the 
multiple filter system discussed above: the mass media will allow any 
stories that are hurtful to large interests to peter out quickly, if they 
surface at all.127

For stories that are useful^ the process will get under way with a series 
of government leaks, press conferences, white papers, etc., or with one 
or more of the mass media starting the ball rolling with such articles 
as Barron and Paul’s “Murder of a Gentle Land” (Cambodia), or Claire 
Sterling’s “The Plot to Kill the Pope,” both in the Reader** Digest .
