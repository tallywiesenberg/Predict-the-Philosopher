If 
the other major media like the story, they will follow it up with their 
own versions, and the matter quickly becomes newsworthy by familiar¬ 
ity.If the articles are written in an assured and convincing style, are 
subject to no criticisms or alternative interpretations in the mass media, 
and command support by authority figures, the propaganda themes 
quickly become established as true even without real evidence.This 
tends to close out dissenting views even more comprehensively, as they 
would now conflict with an already established popular belief.This in 
turn opens up further opportunities for still more inflated claims, as 
these can be made without fear of serious repercussions.Similar wild 
assertions made in contradiction of official views would elicit powerful 
flak, so that such an inflation process would be controlled by the gov¬ 
ernment and the market.
