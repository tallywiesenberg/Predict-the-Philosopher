That is, we would expect official sources of the United States and its 
client regimes to be used heavily—and uncritically—in connection with 
one’s own abuses and those of friendly governments, while refugees and 
other dissident sources will be used in dealing with enemies, 129 We 
would anticipate the uncritical acceptance of certain premises in deal¬ 
ing with self and friends—such as that one’s own state and leaders seek 
peace and democracy, oppose terrorism, and tell the truth—premises 
which will not be applied in treating enemy states.We would expect 
different criteria of evaluation to be employed, so that what is villainy 
in enemy states will be presented as an incidental background fact in 
the case of oneself and friends.130 What is on the agenda in treating one 
case will be off the agenda in discussing the other.131 We would also

expect great investigatory zeal in the search for enemy villainy and the 
responsibility of high officials for abuses in enemy states, but dimin¬ 
ished enterprise in examining such matters in connection with one’s 
own and friendly states.The quality of coverage should also be displayed more directly and 
crudely in placement, headlining, word usage, and other modes of 
mobilizing interest and outrage* In the opinion columns, we would 
anticipate sharp restraints on the range of opinion allowed expression.
