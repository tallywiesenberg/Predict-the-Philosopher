Worthy and 
Unworthy Victims 


A PROPAGANDA SYSTEM WILL CONSISTENTLY PORTRAY PEOPLE 

abused in enemy states as worthy victims, whereas those treated with 
equal or greater severity by its own government or clients will be 
unworthy .The evidence of worth may be read from the extent and 
character of attention and indignation.We will show in this chapter that 
the U,S* mass media's practical definitions of worth are political in the 
extreme and fit well the expectations of a propaganda model.While this 
differential treatment occurs on a large scale, the media, intellectuals, 
and public are able to remain unconscious of the fact and maintain a 
high moral and self-righteous tone.This is evidence of an extremely 
effective propaganda system.
