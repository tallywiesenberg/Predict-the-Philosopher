Nothing comparable can be found for victims within 
the free world.2 It can be seen that the New York Times featured the 
Popieluszko case on its front page on ten different occasions* and the 
intensity of coverage assured that its readers would know who Popie¬ 
luszko was* that he had been murdered* and that this sordid violence 
had occurred in a Communist state.By contrast* the public would not 
have seen mention of the names of Father Augusto Ramirez Monast- 
erio* father superior of the Franciscan order in Guatemala, murdered 
in November 1983* or Father Miguel Angel Montufar* a Guatemalan 
priest who disappeared in the same month that Popieluszko was killed 
in Poland* or literally dozens of other religious murder victims in the 
Latin American provinces* who were sometimes given substantial cov¬ 
erage in the local press of the countries in which the murders took 
place* 

In fact* none of the extremely prominent victims of murder in Latin 






WORTHY AND UNWORTHY VICTIMS 39 


America* including Archbishop Romero and the four American church- 
women* received anywhere near the attention accorded Popieluszko.We will show below that the quality of treatment of the worthy and 
unworthy victims also differed sharply.While the coverage of the wor¬ 
thy victim was generous with gory details and quoted expressions of 
outrage and demands for justice* the coverage of the unworthy victims 
was low-keyed, designed to keep the lid on emotions and evoking 
regretful and philosophical generalities on the omnipresence of vio¬ 
lence and the inherent tragedy of human life* This qualitative difference 
is already apparent in placement and editorializing: ten front-page 
articles on Popieluszko is a statement about importance* as is the fact 
of three editorials denouncing the Poles, without a single editorial 
denunciation for the murderers of the unworthy victims.
