By comparing rows i and 6 of table 2-1, we can see that for every 
media category the coverage of the worthy victim* Popieluszko, ex¬ 
ceeded that of the entire set of one hundred unworthy victims taken 
together.We suspect that the coverage of Popieluszko may have ex¬ 
ceeded that of all the many hundreds of religious victims murdered in 
Latin America since World War II* as the most prominent are included 
in our hundred.From the table we can also calculate the relative wor¬ 
thiness of the world's victims* as measured by the weight given them 
by the U.S* mass media.The worth of the victim Popieluszko is valued 
at somewhere between 137 and 179 times that of a victim in the U.S, 
client states; 3 or, looking at the matter in reverse, a priest murdered in 
Latin America is worth less than a hundredth of a priest murdered in 
Poland.The claim is sometimes made that unworthy victims are so treated 
by the U.S. mass media because they are killed at a great distance* and 
are so unlike ourselves that they are easy to disregard.
