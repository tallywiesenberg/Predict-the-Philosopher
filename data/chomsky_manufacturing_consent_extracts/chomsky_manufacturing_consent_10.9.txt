The condition 
of the body was described at its recovery, at the trial when the medical 
evidence was presented, and during the testimony of the perpetrators 
of the crime* 6 At the trial, the emotional strain and guilt manifested by 
the police officers were described time and again, interspersed with the 
description of how Popieluszko pleaded for his life, and evidence of the 


worthy and unworthy victims 43 


brutality of the act* Numerous unflattering photos of the policemen on 
trial were presented, adding dramatic detail in support of the image of 
police viciousness.In the courtroom, the guilty police sit, one with "a 
nervous tic on the right side of his face [that] caused his dark mustache 
to twitch uncontrollably,” with “tear-filled testimony [that] gave the 
trial some of its most dramatic moments” (Time, Feb, r8, 1985), The 
police weep openly or bow their heads in the face of the grisly evidence.Popieluszko himself was humanized, with descriptions of his physical 
characteristics and personality that made him into something more than 
a distant victim.7 In sum, the act of violence and its effects on Popie¬ 
luszko were presented in such a way as to generate the maximum 
emotional impact on readers.The act was vicious and deserved the 
presentation it received- The acts against the unworthy victims were 
also vicious, but they were treated very differently*
