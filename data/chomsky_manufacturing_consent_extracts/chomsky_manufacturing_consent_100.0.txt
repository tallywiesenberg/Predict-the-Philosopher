deteriorated transportation system in Nicaragua is remarkable. Wag¬ 
ner also misses another distinction between Nicaragua and El Salva¬ 
dor; the former has an “unpopular draft,” whereas in the terror state 
of El Salvador there is no draft—instead there is press-ganging of 
young men into the army from the slums, refugee camps, and rural 
areas, while the young sons of the wealthy live the high life in San 
Salvador and Miami (much the same is true in Guatemala and Hon¬ 
duras). Wagneris double standard is also remarkable. In El Salvador 
in 1982 and 1984 there was far more severe censorship (including out¬ 
right murder), food shortages, a deteriorating transport system, and 
church opposition—and more pertinent, a complete exclusion of the 
“main opposition” and massive state terror—but these didn't make it 
apparent to CBS News that a free and open election was not in the 
cards in that U.S.-sponsored election. 107 

The Irish delegation and LASA, especially the latter, addressed these 
issues, gave evidence of having examined them seriously, and came up 
with conclusions sharply at odds with the U.S. government-media 
portrayals. LASA provided an extensive discussion of the Sandinista 
defense committees and the scope of the turba violence and interfer¬ 
ence with freedom of assembly, concluding that the total number of 
disruptive incidents reported was “quite small,” and that the most 
serious occurred before the official campaign began. “In spite of Daniel 
Ortega's unfortunate statement on these disruptions, there is no evi¬ 
dence that the FSLN had a coherent strategy of stimulating or orches¬ 
trating them” (p. 24). As regards the defense committees, LASA 
concluded that they did not seem to be functioning as a spying network 
and that there was no serious evidence that they were a force making 
for intimidation (p. 27). LASA makes two additional points ignored by 
the free press. One is that the electoral commission “placed paid adver¬ 
tisements in the press urging citizens to respect the rights of all political 
parties to hold rallies without interference” (p, 24). The second is that 
the Cruz rallies that were disrupted were held in violation of the elec¬ 
toral law, which requires permits for campaign rallies and promises 
police protection. “In other words, given their decision not to register, 
Cruz and the Coordinadora were deliberately campaigning outside of 
the legal framework of protections which had been created by the 
electoral law” (p. 25), LASA also compares the violence in the Nicarag¬ 
uan election with that elsewhere in the area and in the Nicaraguan 
context, concluding that “compared to other nations in the region and

in the face of a war against the contras, such abuses are on a very small 
scale" (p. 28). 

LASA also discussed freedom of the press, which it regards as one 
of the election’s most troublesome features. It considers the imposition
