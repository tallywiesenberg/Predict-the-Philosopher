3,7. QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE 
OF SYSTEMATIC MEDIA BIAS 

To demonstrate more rigorously the structural bias in media coverage 
of Third World elections* tables 3-1, 3-2* and 3-3 compare the topics 
mentioned in the New York Times in its articles on the Nicaraguan and 
Salvadoran elections of 1984. The tables are organized according to the 
U.S. government agenda described earlier. The elements in the upper 
part of the tables are the approved issues—rebel disruption* personali¬ 
ties, election mechanics, etc.—that the government wishes to stress in 
its sponsored elections. Below the line are the basic conditions and 
other negative elements that are off the agenda in sponsored elections. 
Our hypothesis is that the media will follow the agenda, stressing 
personalities and other elements above the line in sponsored elections 
and playing down basic conditions, whereas in elections like that in 
Nicaragua the agenda will be reversed—the stress will be placed on 
basic conditions.
