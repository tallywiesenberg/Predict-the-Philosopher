the whole frame of discourse to shift to the assumption that the Nica¬ 
raguans had done something (and something intolerable, to boot). 
Newsweek, in a retrospective article entitled “The MIGs That Weren’t 
There*” had a lead head; “To bring in high-performance craft indicates

that they are contemplating being a threat to their neighbors,” The fact 
that the MIGs weren't bronghr i n, as stated in the article’s very title— 
that this was a concoction of U.S. officials—doesn’t interfere with 
imputing an intention to the Nicaraguans based on a nonexistent fact. 
The assertion that they were contemplating being a threat, as opposed 
to defending themselves against a proxy invasion, is also a patriotic 
editorial judgment, Newsweek also says in the text that “All sides ap¬ 
peared to be playing a very clumsy and very dangerous game/’ This is 
an intriguing form of evenhandedness. A person who, admittedly, had 
been falsely accused of robbery by an assailant is alleged to be “playing 
a dangerous game,” along with the attacker who is also the bearer of 
false witness, 109 

In the middle of an article on the Nicaraguan election. Time inserts 
the government claim that a ship carrying crates of the type used to 
transport MIG-2IS was due at a Nicaraguan port. Time never questions 
a government propaganda ploy, no matter how blatant, and it offers a 
retrospective only when the government tacitly concedes it had deliber¬ 
ately deceived. Like Newsweek and the Times* Time allows the govern¬ 
ment to set the agenda with a public-relations statement: if the 
Nicaraguans did this, it would be a challenge to the United States. How 
then would we react, what are our policy options, etc. The truth of the 
claim and the likelihood that this is a manipulative ploy to help remove 
the unwanted elections from attention are not discussed; and, naturally, 
the fact that this is part of a policy of aggression against a tiny victim 
is never raised. 

The only credits in the media coverage of the MIG crisis go to CBS 
News, On November 6, Dan Rather gave the straight administration 
“news” that MIGs might be on their way and that a strategic option 
to destroy them was under consideration. On November 7 and 8, how¬ 
ever, perhaps out of a recognition that it had once again been “used,” 
CBS gave substantial coverage to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel 
D’Escoto’s rebuttal, which allowed him to point out the absurdity of 
the Nicaraguan “threat,” the tie-in of the MIG claims to the Nicarag¬ 
uan election, and the U.S. refusal to go along with the Contadora peace 
proposals. 

The MIG ploy was, nevertheless, entirely successful. A tone of crisis 
was manufactured, and “options” against the hypothetical Sandinista
