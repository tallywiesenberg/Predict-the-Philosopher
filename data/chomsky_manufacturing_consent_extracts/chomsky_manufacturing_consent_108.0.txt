MIG ploy. The media also allowed major lies to be institutionalized— 
for example, that coercion was greater and pluralistic choices less in the 
Nicaraguan than in the Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections, and that

the latter were legitimizing in a substantive sense, in contrast with 
Nicaragua, 

These propaganda lies could not have been perpetrated if such re¬ 
ports as those of the Irish delegation and LASA had been accorded 
proper weight, LASA actually contacted the major mass-media outlets 
and tried to interest them in doing a story on their report. LASA was 
turned down by eveiy major outlet. The LASA report is probably the 
best-documented and most closely reasoned observer report ever writ¬ 
ten. Its authors are far and away the most qualified group ever to write 
such a report, half with field experience in Nicaragua, and the docu¬ 
ment was an official report of the major scholarly organization that 
deals with Central America. The authors represent a variety of opin¬ 
ions, on balance liberal but revealing a strong critical capability (and 
in no sense biased, as are the official observer teams to whom the media 
accord much attention). Their report covers every issue of importance 
and openly confronts and weighs evidence. If one reads the LASA 
report, and then the accounts of the Nicaraguan election in Time, 
Newsweek, and the New York Times, it is not so much the difference in 
conclusions that is striking but the difference in depth, balance, and 
objectivity. LASA offers serious history and context, a full account of 
the organization of the election, and a full discussion of each relevant 
issue with comparisons to other elections. We believe that an important 
reason the mass media failed to use LASA as a source of information 
was that its report contradicts in every way the propaganda claims 
which the media were disseminating daily and uncritically. Thus its 
very credibility, objectivity, and quality were disturbing, and neces¬ 
sitated that it be bypassed by institutions serving a propaganda func¬ 
tion. 


3.10* CONCLUDING NOTE 

As we have seen, electoral conditions in Nicaragua in 1984 were far 
more favorable than in El Salvador and Guatemala, and the observer 
team of LASA found the election in Nicaragua to have been “a model 
of probity and fairness” by Latin American standards. 111 In El Salvador 
and Guatemala, none of the five basic preconditions of a free election 
was met. In both of these countries, state-sponsored terror, including 
the public exposure of mutilated bodies, had ravaged the civilian popu¬ 
lation up to the very day of the elections. In both, voting was required
