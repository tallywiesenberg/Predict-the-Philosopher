As we stressed earlier, the media’s adherence to the state propaganda 
line is extremely functional. Just as the government of Guatemala could 
kill scores of thousands without major repercussion because the media 
recognized that these were “unworthy” victims, so today aid to state 
terrorists in HI Salvador and Guatemala, and the funding of contra 
attacks on “soft targets” in Nicaragua, depend heavily on continued 
media recognition of “worth” and an appropriate legitimization and 
delegitimization. As their government sponsors terror in all three states 
(as well as in Honduras), we may fairly say that the U.S. mass media, 
despite their righteous self-image as opponents of something called 
terrorism, serve in fact as loyal agents of terrorism.

mainly that of channeling information and assuring that the govern¬ 
ment’s agenda was not seriously challenged. With the shooting of the 
pope* in May 1981, and the eventual charges of a KGB-Bulgarian plot* 
the mass media played a much larger role in originating the claims and 
in keeping the pot boiling from inception to conclusion of the case. 1 

In many ways* however* the process was similar. A dominant frame 
was eventually produced that interpreted the shooting of the pope in 
a manner especially helpful to then-current elite demands. A campaign 
quickly ensued in which the serviceable propaganda line was instilled 
in the public mind by repetition. Alternative frames were ignored, and 
sources inclined toward other ways of looking at the issue were ex¬
