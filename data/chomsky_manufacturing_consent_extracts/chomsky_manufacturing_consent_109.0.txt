allowed to monopolize mass-media space, complained bitterly that their 
voices could not be heard over the din of Soviet propaganda. When the 
legal proceeding brought against the Bulgarians in Italy was lost after 
a lengthy trial, this was rationalized by the media as far as could be 
done. No serious retrospectives were entertained, and, without resolv¬ 
ing the contradictions, the story was then dropped. 

What makes the Bulgarian Connection so apt an illustration of the 
value of a propaganda model is that there was no credible case for a 
Bulgarian Connection from the very beginning, and long before the 
Rome trial it had taken on a truly comic aspect. But the mass media 
played it straight to the bitter end- An analogous sequence carried out 
in Moscow, with the West as the target—with a half-crazed criminal, 
after seventeen months in a Soviet prison and some friendly sessions 
with the KGB and a prosecutor, implicating employees of the American 
embassy in a conspiracy to murder, and subsequently changing his 
testimony on a daily basis—would have been hooted off the stage in the 
West without anyone even bothering to look at alleged evidence. The 
Bulgarian Connection, however, although no less absurd, met the crite¬ 
rion of utility. 

The case began when Mehmet Ali Agca shot and seriously injured 
Pope John Paul II in St. Peteris Square on May 13, 1981. Agca was a 
Turkish rightist and assassin long associated with the Gray Wolves, an 
affiliate of the extreme right-wing Nationalist Action party. Initial 
Western news reports pointed out that Agca was a wanted criminal who 
had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979, and that his durable politi¬ 
cal affiliations had been with the Fascist right. His motives in shooting 
the pope were unclear, Agca J s friends were violently anti-Communist, 
so that, at first, pinning the crime on the East seemed unpromising. 

Two factors allowed a KGB-Bulgarian plot to be developed. The 
first was that in his travels through Europe in the Gray Wolves under¬ 
ground, which carried him through twelve different countries, Agca had 
stayed for a period in Bulgaria. Turkish drug dealers, who had connec¬ 
tions with the Gray Wolves, also participated in the drug trade in 
Bulgaria, There were, therefore, some “links” between Agca and Bul¬ 
garians, minimal facts that would eventually be put to good use. 

The second factor was Western elite needs and the closely associated 
flare-up of a carefully stoked anti-Communist fervor in the West. At
