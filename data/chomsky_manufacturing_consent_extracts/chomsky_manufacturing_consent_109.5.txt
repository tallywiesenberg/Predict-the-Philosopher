the first meeting of the Jonathan Institute, in Jerusalem, in July 1979, 
at which a large Western political and media contingent were present 
(including Claire Sterling, George Will, George Bush, and Robert 
Moss), 3 the main theme pressed by Israeli Prime Minister Menahem 
Begin in his opening address, and by many others at the conference, was 



THE KGB-BULGARIAN PLOT TO KILL THE POPE 145 


the importance and utility of pressing the terrorism issue and of tying 
terrorism to the Soviet Union, 4 Claire Sterling did this in her 1981 
volume The Terror Network, which became the bible of the Reagan 
administration and the international right wing, and elevated Sterling 
to the status of number one mass-media expert on that subject. Terror¬ 
ism and Soviet evil were the centerpieces of the Reagan administra¬ 
tion's propaganda campaign that began in 1981, designed to support its 
planned arms increase, placement of new missiles in Europe, and inter¬ 
ventionist policies in the Third World. Thus the shooting of the pope 
by Agca in May 1981 occurred at a time when important Western 
interests were looking for ways to tie the Soviet Union to “international 
terrorism.” 5 


4.1. THE STERLING-HENZE- 
KALB MODEL 

Although the initial media reaction to the shooting was that the roots 
of the act would seem to lie in Turkish right-wing ideology and politics, 
some rightists immediately seized the opportunity to locate the origins 
of the plot in the Soviet bloc. Only six days after the assassination 
attempt, the Italian secret-service organization SISMI issued a docu¬ 
ment which claimed that the attack had been announced by a Soviet 
official at a meeting of the Warsaw Pact powers in Bucharest, Romania, 
and that Agca had been trained in the Soviet Union. Subsequently, this 
“information” was shown to have been fabricated by SISMI or one of 
its intelligence sources, but it entered the stream of allegations about 
the plot in a book published in West Germany and via further citations 
and leaks. 6 

The Reader's Digest saw the propaganda opportunity presented by 
the assassination attempt quite early, and hired both Paul Henze, a 
longtime CIA officer and propaganda specialist, and Claire Sterling to 
investigate the topic. Sterling's September 1982 article in the Reader's 
Digest, “The Plot to Kill the Pope,” was the most important initiator 
of the Bulgarian Connection, and its ideas and those of Paul Henze 
formed the basis for the NBC-TV program “The Man Who Shot the 
Pope—A Study in Terrorism,” narrated by Marvin Kalb and first aired 
on September 21, 1982.
