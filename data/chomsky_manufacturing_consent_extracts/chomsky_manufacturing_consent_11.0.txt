they and their media colleagues had been agents of propaganda* 

The New York Times t which had been consistently supportive of the 
connection in both news and editorials, not only failed to report Wein¬ 
stein’s negative findings from the search of the Bulgarian files, it also 
excluded Goodman's statement on the CIA’s penetration of the Bulgar¬

leaders operated on the belief that their overwhelming military might 
would not only enable them, but entitled them, to force submission to a 
minority government of US. choice* 

By normal word usage this would make the U*S* effort in Vietnam a 
case of “aggression.” The mainstream media, however, rarely if ever 
found US. policy there to be other than highly moral and well inten- 
tioned, even if based on miscalculation of its costs—to us (see chapter 5). 
The media readily accepted that we were protecting “South Vietnam”—a
