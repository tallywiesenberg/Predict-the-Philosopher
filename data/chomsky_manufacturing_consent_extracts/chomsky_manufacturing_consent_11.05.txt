2 (d), Conclusions and follow-up.The New York Times had three 
editorials on the Popieluszko case.In each it focused on the responsi¬ 
bility of the higher authorities and the fact that “A police state is 
especially responsible for the actions of its police” (“Murderous Po¬ 
land/’ Oct. 30, 1984).It freely applied words like “thuggery/’ “shame¬ 
less/’ and “crude” to the Polish state.The fact that police officers were 
quickly identified, tried, and convicted it attributed to the agitation at 
home and abroad that put a limit on villainy.
