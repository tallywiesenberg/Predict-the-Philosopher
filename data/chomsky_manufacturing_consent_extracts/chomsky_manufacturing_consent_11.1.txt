This is a good point, and 
one that we stress throughout this book: villainy may be constrained by 
intense publicity.But we also stress the corresponding importance of 
a refusal to publicize and the leeway this gives murderous clients under 
the protection of the United States and its media, where the impact of 
publicity would be far greater.10 The Times also fails to note the con¬ 
trast between murderous Poland and murderous El Salvador—in the 
latter country, no murders of Salvadorans by the security forces or the 
death squads connected to them have ever resulted in a trial.The 
absence of such a comparison, as well as the failure of the Times to 
produce an editorial entitled “Murderous El Salvador/ 5 illustrates how 
a serviceable terrorism is protected in a propaganda mode.11 


2.2, RUTILIO GRANDE AND THE 
UNWORTHY SEVENTY-TWO 

As shown on table 2-1, the unworthy seventy-two on Penny Lernoux’s 
list of martyrs were subject to a grand total of eight articles in the New 
York Times, one in Newsweek, and none in Time, and they were never 
mentioned on CBS News in the years of index coverage (1975-78).
