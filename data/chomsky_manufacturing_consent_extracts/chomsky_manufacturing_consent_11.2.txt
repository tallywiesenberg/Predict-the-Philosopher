and Unworthy Victims, as Depicted 
in the New York Times 

WORTHY VICTIMS 

Jerzy Popieluszko, a Polish priest* murdered on October 19, 1994, 

(1) Account at finding of body: “The sources who saw the priest’s body on Tuesday, 
said it was badly bruised, indicating he had been beaten after he was kidnapped on a 
highway near the town of Torun.The autopsy also showed that Father Popieluszko 
had been gagged at the mouth and apparently tied with a rope from neck to feet so 
that if he struggled he would strangle himself, they said.The sources said they could 
not confirm reports quoting members of the slain priest’s family as saying he had 
suffered injuries to his jaw and skull’ 1 (Dec. 29, 1984).(2) Account at trial of murderers: “The film showed clearly that the priest's bent legs 
were tied to a noose around his neck in such a way that if he straightened them he would 
be strangled.The rope binding his hands had evidently come loose in the water.
