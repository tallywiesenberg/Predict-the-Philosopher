U.S* creation ruled by a dictator imported directly from the United 
States—'against somebody else’s aggression* vacillating in their identifica¬ 
tion of the aggressor between North Vietnam, the Soviet Union* China* 
or the resistance in South Vietnam engaging in “internal aggression”! It is 
compelling evidence of the propaganda service of the mainstream media 
that throughout the war they accepted this basic propaganda assumption 
of the war managers, and from that era up to today* we have never found 
a mainstream editorial or news report that characterized the U*S* war 
a gainst Vietnam, and then all of Indochina, as a case of aggression* 

After the United States terminated the military phase of the war in 
1975* it maintained and enforced an eighteen-year boycott of the coun¬ 
try that it had virtually destroyed* According to Vietnamese estimates* 
the war had cost them 3 million killed* 300*000 missing* 4*4 million 
wounded* and 2 million harmed by toxic chemicals; and its land was left 
ravaged by bombs and Rome plows as well as chemical weapons* With 
58,000 killed* the U.S. death toll from the war was under one-tenth of 1 
percent of its population; Vietnam’s death toll was 17 percent of its popu¬ 
lation* and only Vietnam’s people were attacked by chemical warfare and 
had their countryside devastated. 

Nevertheless, U.S. officials and the mainstream media continued to 
view the U.S. role in the war as creditable* the United States as the vic¬ 
tim. President George Bush stated in 1992 that “Hanoi knows today that 
we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past*” 59 
That is, the Vietnamese had done things to us that might justify retribu¬ 
tion on our part* but we only seek answers regarding our men missing 
in action. 60 New York Times foreign affairs commentator Leslie Gelb justi¬ 
fied classifying Vietnam an “outlaw” on the grounds that “they had killed 
Americans* 5 ’ 61 This reflects the common establishment view, implicit in 
Bush’s comment, that nobody has a right of self-defense against this 
country, even if it intervenes across the ocean to impose by force a gov¬ 
ernment that the people of that country reject* 


U. S * Chemical Warfare in Indochina 

It is also of interest how the media have treated the massive use of chemi¬ 
cals during the Vietnam War and the horrifying aftermath for the vic¬ 
tim country* In 1961 and 1962 the Kennedy administration authorized 
the use of chemicals to destroy rice crops in South Vietnam—in violation 
of a U.S. tradition as well as international law (Admiral William Leahy* 
in response to a proposal to destroy Japanese rice crops in 1944* stated 
that This would “violate every Christian ethic I have ever heard of and
