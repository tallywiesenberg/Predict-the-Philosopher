Romero’s biographer writes: 

Six weeks later, the lawyer chosen by Romero to follow the case 
reported “an embarrassing and clear indifference toward the in¬ 
vestigation on the part of state organizations.” A suspect ordered 
arrested by a judge was living unconcernedly in El Paisnal, and 
no one had ordered the bodies exhumed and examined.The bul¬ 
lets are still in the graves.14 

Rutilio Grande’s murder followed a series of forcible expulsions of 
foreign clergy by the Molina government and several earlier murders 
of church personnel.Romero and the clergy deliberated at great length 
on their course of action in response to this escalation of the violence 
against them.They tried to get out their messages of concern, but many 
were not heard because of newspaper censorship.
