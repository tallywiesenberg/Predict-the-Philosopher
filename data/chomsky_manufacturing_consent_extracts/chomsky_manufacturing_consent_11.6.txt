They finally decided 
to take dramatic action: temporary school closings, and implementation 
of the previously mentioned threat to refuse to support the government 
and other power groups on official occasions.This entire package of murder and church response was hardly 
lacking in drama and newsworthiness.Yet murder, the confrontation of 
the desperate church with a repressive state, and the dramatic acts 
carried out to try to mobilize support in its self-defense were subject 
to a virtual blackout in the ILS, mass media.The murder of Rutilio 
Grande was mentioned in Newsweek (“Priests in Peril,” Aug. 1,1977), 
but it never once reached the audiences of the New York Times, Time, 
or CBS News.This was important in allowing the terror to go on 
unimpeded.
