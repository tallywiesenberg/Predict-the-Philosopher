To paraphrase the New York Times editorial on “murder¬ 
ous Poland”: no publicity and agitation, no containment of terror.MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


2.3, ARCHBISHOP OSCAR 
ROMERO 

The murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero, the highest Catholic church 
official in El Salvador* was “big news*” and its political implications 
were enormous* At the time of his murder, Romero had become the 
foremost and most outspoken critic of the policy of repression by 
murder being carried out by the US .-supported military government.In his last sermon* he appealed to members of the army and security 
forces to refuse to kill their Salvadoran brethren, a call that enraged the 
officer corps trying to build a lower-class military that was willing to 
kill freely* Romero had been placed on right-wing death lists and 
received threats from the right wing* which from the beginning had 
been closely linked to the army and intelligence services* 15 Only a few 
weeks prior to his murder he had written a forceful letter to President 
Jimmy Carter opposing the imminent granting of U*S* aid to the junta 
as destructive of Salvadoran interests.The Carter administration had 
been so disturbed by Romero’s opposition to its policies that it had 
secretly lobbied the pope to curb the archbishop* 16 

Romero, in short, was not merely an “unworthy” victim, he was an 
important activist in opposition to the local alliance of army and oligar¬ 
chy and to US.policy in El Salvador* The US.
