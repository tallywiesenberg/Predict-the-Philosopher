media’s news coverage 
of the archbishop’s murder and its follow-up reflected well his threat¬ 
ening role* reaching new levels of dishonesty and propaganda service 
in their coverage of this and related events* 


2.3.1* Details of the murder and 
public response 

The details of the Romero murder provided by the U,S.mass media 
were concise (see table 2-2), While there were expressions of shock and 
distress* there were very few quotations and expressions of outrage by 
supporters of Romero.There were no statements or quotations suggest¬ 
ing that the murder was intolerable and that the guilty must be found 
and brought to justice.The New York Times had no editorial condemn¬ 
ing* or even mentioning* the murder.It was quickly placed in the larger 
framework of alleged killings by both the left and the right that were 
deeply regretted by Salvadoran and US.
