2.3.2.The propaganda line: a 
reformist junta trying to contain 
the violence of right and left 

The Salvadoran and U,S.governments contended at the time of 
Romero’s murder that the killing going on in El Salvador was being 
done by extremists of the right and the left, not by the Salvadoran 
armed forces and their agents; and that the government was trying its 
best to contain the killings and carry out reforms.John Bushnell, of the 
State Department* stated before a House appropriations committee 
that “there is some misperception by those who follow the press that 
the government is itself repressive in El Salvador*” when in fact the 
violence is “from the extreme right and the extreme left” and “the 
smallest part” of the killings come from the army and security forces* 17 
This statement was a knowing lie, 18 contradicted by all independent 
evidence coming out of El Salvador and refuted by Archbishop Romero 
on an almost daily basis.
