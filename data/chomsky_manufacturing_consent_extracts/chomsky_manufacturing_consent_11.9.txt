A guerrilla war was forced on the center and 
left by the policy of unconstrained violence of the Carter-supported 
government.The government was not centrist and reformist—it was a 
military regime of the right, closely linked to the terrorist force 
ORDEN and the death squads, and it used them regularly as proxies.The paramilitary groups were not uncontrollable—they were doing 
what the army wanted them to do.The paramilitary forces and death 
squads of El Salvador had extensive interlocking relationships with the 
official military and security forces and their U.S. counterparts.There 
was a revolving door of personnel, close cooperation in sharing infor¬ 
mation, funding of the paramilitary groups by the official forces, and 
a division of labor between them.
