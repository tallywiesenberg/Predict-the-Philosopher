The Sterling-Henze-Kalb (SHK) model, in which Agca was an agent 
of the Bulgarians (and, indirectly, of the Soviet Union), quickly became

the dominant frame of the mass media, through the great outreach of 
the Reader's Digest and the NBC-TV program (which was repeated in 
revised form in January 1983), and the ready* even eager, acceptance of 
this view by the other mainstream media. 7 The mass media in our 
sample— Newsweek, Time, the New York Times, and CBS News—all 
accepted and used the SHK model from the beginning, and retained 
that loyalty to the end of the Rome trial in March 1986. In the process 
they excluded alternative views and a great deal of inconvenient fact. 
With the Readers Digest, the Wall Street Journal, the Christian Science 
Monitor, and NBC-TV also firmly adhering to the SHK line* it quickly 
established a dominant position throughout the mainstream media. 

In the balance of this and the following two sections* we will describe 
the SHK model, discuss its weaknesses* and outline an alternative 
frame explaining Agca's confession implicating the Bulgarians, which 
the media ignored. We will then turn to a closer examination of the 
media's gullible reception of the SHK view and its fit to a propaganda 
model. 

The SHK model had the following essential elements: 

1 . Motive. In Sterling's Reader's Digest article, the preeminent motive 
in the assassination attempt was a Soviet desire to weaken NATO, to 
be accomplished by implicating a Turk in the assassination of the pope: 
“The Turk was there at St. Peter's to signal Christendom that Islamic 
Turkey was an alien and vaguely sinister country that did not belong 
in NATO." This motive was accompanied (and soon supplanted) by the 
contention that the shooting was to help quell the Solidarity movement 
in Poland by removing its most important supporter. At one point Paul 
Henze suggested that the intent of the KGB was perhaps merely to 
“wing" the pope, not kill him, as a warning, as in a James Bond movie. 
The costs and risks to the Soviet bloc of such a venture were never 
discussed by Sterling* Henze* or Kalb. 

2 . The proof of Soviet and Bulgarian involvement. Before Agca’s 
confession and his identification of Bulgarians in November 1982* the 
evidence on which SHK relied was confined to the fact that Agca had 
stayed in Bulgaria in the summer of 1980, and that Turkish drug traders 
with links to the Gray Wolves did business in Bulgaria. In November 
1982, Agca named three Bulgarians as his alleged accomplices and 
claimed to have been hired by the Bulgarians to do the job. He offered
