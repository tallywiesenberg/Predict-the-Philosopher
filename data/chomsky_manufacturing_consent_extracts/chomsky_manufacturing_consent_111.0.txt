SHK finally settled firmly on the idea that quelling the Polish Soli¬ 
darity movement was the real Soviet-Bulgarian motive. But this theory 
is as implausible as its predecessor when we take account of timing and 
elementary cost-benefit analysis. Agca was allegedly recruited in Tur¬ 
key long before Solidarity existed. In a variant Sterling version of the 
timing of his recruitment, Agca was hired by the Bulgarians in July 1980, 
which was still prior to the Gdansk shipyard strike, and thus before 
Solidarity appeared a credible threat to Soviet control. The risks and 
costs of an assassination attempt would seem heavy—and, in fact, the 
costs to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria were severe based merely on the 
widespread belief in their involvement, even in the absence of credible 
evidence. The supposed benefits from the act are also not plausible. 
The assassination of the pope, especially if blamed on the Soviet Union, 
would infuriate and unify the Poles and strengthen their opposition to 
a Soviet-dominated regime. And the further costs in damaged relations 
with Western Europe—which were extremely important to the Soviet 
Union in 1981, with the gas pipeline being negotiated and with the 
placement of new U.S. missiles in Western Europe a major Soviet 
concern—would seem to militate against taking foolish risks. 12 

A second problem with the SHK model is that Agca had threatened 
to kill the pope in 1979 at the time of a papal visit to Turkey—again, 
long before Solidarity existed. This suggests that Agca and the Turkish 
right had their own grievances against the pope and a rationale for 
assassinating him that was independent of any Soviet influence. It was 
partly for this reason that SHK argue that Agca was recruited by the 
Soviet Union in Turkey before the pope’s visit there, setting him up for 
the later attack. But not only is this pure speculation unsupported by 
a trace of evidence, it fails to explain why the entire Fascist press, not 
just Agca, assailed the pope’s visit in 1979. Was the entire Fascist right 
serving Soviet ends? The only time this issue was ever raised in the mass 
media, on the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour” of January 5, 1983, Paul 
Henze stated in no uncertain terms that “there was no [press] opposi¬ 
tion” to the pope’s visit in 1979. The Turkish journalist Ugur Mumcu, 
however, assembled a large collection of citations from the Turkish 
rightist press of the time to demonstrate that Henze’s statement was 
false. 13 

A third problem for the SHK model was that Agca was a committed 
rightist, and therefore not a likely candidate for service to the Commu¬ 
nist powers (although perhaps amenable to fingering them as co-con¬ 
spirators in a prison context). SHK strove mightily to make Agca out 
to be a rootless mercenary, but the best they could come up with was
