ground: the clever Bulgarians had Agca purchase a gun through a 
known Fascist to strengthen the case that Agca was a right-winger who 
could not possibly be connected to the Communist powers. 

A final set of problems for the SHK model lies in the extraordinary 
level of incompetence and gross violations of the principles of plausible 
deniability that it attributes to the Bulgarian and Soviet secret police— 
features that coexist uneasily with the superspy image invoked else¬ 
where in the model. At various points* SHK contended that the Soviets 
and Bulgarians were professionals who could afford to go after the pope 
because they would never be implicated themselves. But hiring Agca* 
a wanted criminal and a mentally unbalanced rightist* would appear 
extremely foolish* as the cover would quickly be blown in the likely 
event that he was caught. In Sterling’s initial tale* the KGB wanted him 
to be caught—or at least to have his body identified—to discredit 
Turkey. With the shift to weakening Solidarity as the motive* the threat 
of disclosure of Bulgarian-Soviet involvement would seem very serious* 
Yet the Bulgarians and KGB hired Agca and then failed to kill him* 
Another anomaly was bringing Agca to Sofia for instructions* If he had 
already been recruited in Turkey* wouldn’t bringing him to Sofia be a 
foolish compromising of his carefully prepared “cover 51 ? If so* doesn’t 
his visit to Sofia constitute an argument against Soviet and Bulgarian 
involvement? 

While Agca 5 s November 1982 confession that he had Bulgarian co¬ 
conspirators made the Bulgarian Connection instantly “true” for the 
Western media* it wreaked havoc with the SHK model and with the 
logic of “plausible deniability* 55 If* as Agca confessed* the Bulgarians 
connived with him in Rome* escorted him to St, Peter's Square to plan 
the attack* entertained him at their apartments* and participated in the 
attack itself* what happens to the logic of the “cover 5 *? 


4.3. AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL 

An alternative explanation of the Bulgarian Connection can be derived 
from the questions the U.S, press would surely have raised if an analo¬ 
gous scenario had occurred in Moscow* in which Agca* who had briefly 
visited the United States on his travels* and has been in a Soviet prison 
for seventeen months after having shot a high Soviet official* now 
confesses that three U.S. embassy members were his co-conspirators* 
In this case* the U*S* press would have paid close attention to the 
convenience of the confession to Soviet propaganda needs* to the sev-
