brought out in the investigation that Agca's “desire for personal public¬ 
ity seems unquenchable* * * * At one point in the Italian investigation, 
he abruptly dammed up when the magistrates refused his demand that 
journalists be present as he ‘confessed* 5 5516 Agca was interrogated about 
a possible Bulgarian connection long before his confession* and was 
surely aware that his interrogators would be quite pleased to have him 
produce one. And by the fall of 1982 one was being provided to him in 
the press and on the screen every day. 

We mentioned earlier that the Italian secret-service agency SISMI 
had actually distributed a piece of disinformation tying the Soviets to 
the assassination attempt within days of the attack. At the time of the 
shooting* SISMI was headed by General Giuseppe Santovito, a mem¬ 
ber of the extreme right-wing organization Propaganda Due (P-2)* and 
SISMI and the other intelligence agencies were heavily infiltrated with 
P-2 members. A P-2 scandal broke in Italy in March 1981* and by 
August Santovito had been forced to leave SISMI, but the rightist grip 
on this organization was by no means broken. 

An important feature of Italian politics in the period from 1966 
through 1981 was the protection given by the intelligence services to 
right-wing terror* under a program designated the “strategy of ten¬ 
sion. 5517 One aspect of this strategy was the carrying out of right-wing 
terrorist attacks* which were then attributed to the left* frequently with 
the help of forged documents and planted informers committing per¬ 
jury, The point of the strategy was to polarize society, discredit the left* 
and set the stage for a rightist coup. Many P-2 members in the armed 
forces and intelligence services took part in implementing this program, 
and many others were sympathetic to its aims. In July 1984, an Italian 
parliamentary commission published its final report on the P-2 conspir¬ 
acy* and it and its accompanying volumes of hearings pointed up the 
politicization of the intelligence services* their frequent use of tech¬ 
niques of disinformation* and their connivance with and protection of 
right-wing terror* In July 1985 a Bologna court issued a decision in 
which it named SISMI and its officers as having engaged in numerous 
forgeries, and also in having collaborated in covering up the Bologna 
terrorist bombing of 1980. 1S 

SISMI participated in a five-hour interrogation of Agca in December 
1981, exploring his link to “international terrorism* 55 Investigating Judge 
Martella acknowledges in his long investigative report that he had 
spoken to Agca about the possibility of a commuted sentence if he 
“cooperated* 55 and the Italian press quoted Agca’s lawyer's report of the 
terms of proposed deals that had been offered to Agca* 19 There were 
also a variety of reports in the European and dissident media of pres- 



THE KGB-BULG ARIAN PLOT TO KILL THE POPE I 53 


sures applied to Agca while in prison* A London Sunday Times team 
pointed out in May 1983 that the secret services “visited Agca and 
warned him that once his solitary confinement was over* ‘the authorities 
could no longer guarantee his safety/ ” 20 According to Orsen Oymen, 
a Turkish expert on the case* the Catholic chaplain in Agca’s prison* 
Father Mariano Santini* had frequent access to Agca and was one of 
those who pressed him to cooperate with the authorities* 21 There is 
some possible confirmation of Santini’s pressure tactics in a letter which 
Agca addressed to the Vatican* dated September 24* 1982* which com¬ 
plained bitterly of threats to his life emanating from a Vatican emissary* 
During the course of the Rome trial* Giovanni Pandico* the principal 
Italian state witness in the trial of Mafia leaders in Naples and an 
associate of Raphael Cutolo, a Mafia leader who had been in Ascoli 
Piceno prison with Agca* claimed in an interview (and subsequently 
before the court) that Agca had been coerced* persuaded and coached 
to implicate the Bulgarians by Cutolo* Santini, and others. Pandico 
claimed that Cutolo himself had been coerced into working on Agca by 
threats to himself* and that former SISMI officials Giuseppi Musumeci 
and Francesco Pazienza were key initiators of the plot. One of the 
important individuals accused by Pandico, Francesco Pazienza* while 
denying the charges, gave his own detailed account of who in SISMI 
had participated in persuading Agca to talk* 

From the inception of the case, there were points suggesting that 
Agca was coached while in prison. After his long (and unexplained) 
silence* Agca identified the Bulgarians in a photo album allegedly 
shown to him for the first time on November 9* 1982* But in a speech 
before the Italian parliament, the minister of defense* Lelio Lagorio, 
stated that Agca had identified the Bulgarians in September of 1982* 
This discrepancy has never been explained, but that Agca saw these 
photos for the first time on November 9 is not believable* 22 A key 
element in Agca’s testimony was his claim to have visited the apartment 
of Sergei Antonov* one of the Bulgarians arrested in the “plot*” and to 
have met his wife and daughter* which was supported by many fine 
details regarding Antonov’s hobbies and the characteristics of his apart¬ 
ment* The defense, however* was able to show that one feature of 
Antonov’s apartment mentioned by Agca was in error, although charac¬ 
teristic of the other apartments in Antonov’s building, which suggests 
that Agca had been supplied information based on observation of other 
apartments* More important, the defense was able to establish that at 
the time of Agca’s visit at which he met Mrs* Antonov, she was out of 
the country* Following newspaper publicity given these defense con¬ 
tentions, on June 28* 1983* Agca retracted his claims that he had visited
