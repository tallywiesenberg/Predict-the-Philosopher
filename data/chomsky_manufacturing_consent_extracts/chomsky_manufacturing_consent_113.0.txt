brought out in the investigation that Agca's “desire for personal public¬ 
ity seems unquenchable* * * * At one point in the Italian investigation, 
he abruptly dammed up when the magistrates refused his demand that 
journalists be present as he ‘confessed* 5 5516 Agca was interrogated about 
a possible Bulgarian connection long before his confession* and was 
surely aware that his interrogators would be quite pleased to have him 
produce one. And by the fall of 1982 one was being provided to him in 
the press and on the screen every day. 

We mentioned earlier that the Italian secret-service agency SISMI 
had actually distributed a piece of disinformation tying the Soviets to 
the assassination attempt within days of the attack. At the time of the 
shooting* SISMI was headed by General Giuseppe Santovito, a mem¬ 
ber of the extreme right-wing organization Propaganda Due (P-2)* and 
SISMI and the other intelligence agencies were heavily infiltrated with 
P-2 members. A P-2 scandal broke in Italy in March 1981* and by 
August Santovito had been forced to leave SISMI, but the rightist grip 
on this organization was by no means broken. 

An important feature of Italian politics in the period from 1966 
through 1981 was the protection given by the intelligence services to 
right-wing terror* under a program designated the “strategy of ten¬ 
sion. 5517 One aspect of this strategy was the carrying out of right-wing 
terrorist attacks* which were then attributed to the left* frequently with 
the help of forged documents and planted informers committing per¬ 
jury, The point of the strategy was to polarize society, discredit the left* 
and set the stage for a rightist coup. Many P-2 members in the armed 
forces and intelligence services took part in implementing this program, 
and many others were sympathetic to its aims. In July 1984, an Italian 
parliamentary commission published its final report on the P-2 conspir¬ 
acy* and it and its accompanying volumes of hearings pointed up the 
politicization of the intelligence services* their frequent use of tech¬ 
niques of disinformation* and their connivance with and protection of 
right-wing terror* In July 1985 a Bologna court issued a decision in 
which it named SISMI and its officers as having engaged in numerous 
forgeries, and also in having collaborated in covering up the Bologna 
terrorist bombing of 1980. 1S 

SISMI participated in a five-hour interrogation of Agca in December 
1981, exploring his link to “international terrorism* 55 Investigating Judge 
Martella acknowledges in his long investigative report that he had 
spoken to Agca about the possibility of a commuted sentence if he 
“cooperated* 55 and the Italian press quoted Agca’s lawyer's report of the 
terms of proposed deals that had been offered to Agca* 19 There were 
also a variety of reports in the European and dissident media of pres-
