the apartment and met Antonov’s family. The details he had given 
about apartment and family then became inexplicable* except on the 
supposition that Agca had been fed information while in prison. In a 
number of other instances Agca provided information that bore strong 
suspicion of having been provided by officials and agents of the court 
or the police. The London Sunday Times reporters* who interviewed 
one of the accused Bulgarians in Sofia* wrote that “When asked by 
Martelia in Bulgaria whether he had any salient physical features, 
Vassilev said that he had a mole on his left cheek. In a subsequent 
confession, as Vassilev points out, *Agca described my mole in the very 
same words which I used in describing it here. 5 ” 23 

During the course of the Rome trial in 1985-86, no trace was ever 
found of the money that Agca claimed he had received from the Bul¬ 
garians. The car that Agca indicated the Bulgarians had used to escort 
him around Rome was never located. No witness was ever found who 
saw him in his many supposed encounters with Bulgarians. His gun was 
transferred to him through the Turkish Gray Wolves network, and 
there was no shortage of evidence of his meetings with members of the 
Gray Wolves in Western Europe. The note that was found on Agca 5 s 
person on May 13, 1981* did not mention any collaborators, and sug¬ 
gested a loose timetable for the assassination attempt and a planned 
railroad trip to Naples, 

In sum, it is highly probable that Agca was offered a deal to talk, and 
that it was made dear to him that the people with power over his 
well-being wanted him to implicate the Bulgarians and the Soviet 
Union in the assassination attempt. He had access to the SHK model 
even before he confessed. His confession was therefore suspect from 
the start, and an “alternative model 55 of inducement-pressure coaching 
was plausible and relevant, from the Agca 5 s first implication of Bulgari¬ 
ans. This model became more cogent over time as Agca retracted 
strategic claims, and as no confirming evidence of a Bulgarian Connec¬ 
tion was produced. By the same token, the SHK model, implausible 
from the beginning, became even less tenable.
