by their extensive and uncritical use as experts by the elite press* news 
magazines* and television news and talk shows, 28 Sterling* in addition 
to her Reader** Digest article, had three substantial pieces in the Wall 
Street Journal and several articles in the New York Times* Her views 
were given repeated airing on CBS News, without rebuttal, Henze 
accounted for twelve of the fourteen articles on the Bulgarian Connec¬ 
tion case in the Christian Science Monitor between September 1982 and 
May 1985, and his articles were used widely elsewhere. The only opin¬ 
ion piece on the Bulgarian Connection that appeared in the 
Philadelphia Inquirer during that same period was by Michael Ledeen. 
Sterling* Henze* and Ledeen together accounted for 76 percent of the 
time in three shows on the subject on the “McNeil-Lehrer News 
Hour.” No tough questions were asked of them on these shows, and no 
dissident voices were heard* perhaps because Sterling and Henze 
refused to appear on television shows (or in college debates) with 
people who opposed their views* and Henze insisted on approving in 
advance any questions to be asked. Thus their initial dominance was 
further enhanced by coercive tactics. 28 

If we ask the deeper question of why these experts should predomi¬ 
nate in the first place* we believe the answer must be found in the power 
of their sponsors and the congeniality of their views to the corporate 
community and the mainstream media. Their messages passed quite 
easily through the filters of a propaganda system. Sterling was funded 
and published by Reader’s Digest^ which gave her enormous outreach 
and immediate brand-name recognition. The conservative network is 
fond of Sterling* so their large stable of columnists and think-tank 
affiliates, like the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International 
Studies (CSIS) and the American Enterprise Institute* pushes her 
views. The Reagan administration was also delighted with Sterling— 
despite her frequent denunciations of the CIA and the State Depart¬ 
ment for their cowardice in failing to pursue terrorism and the 
Bulgarian Connection with sufficient aggressiveness!—and so were the 
New York Times , Time, Newsweek, CBS News, and many others. Ster¬ 
ling was the outstanding popular expositor of the theme urged upon the 
conferees at the Jonathan Institute meeting of July 1979 and advocated 
by the Reagan administration team anxious to create a moral environ¬ 
ment for an arms race and global support of counterrevolutionary 
freedom fighters. 30 Henze* an old CIA hand and protege of Zbigniew 
Brzezinski* was also funded by the Reader’s Digest ; and Ledeen was 
affiliated with both the CSIS and the Reagan political team. If the 
media transmit literal lies by this Big Three—which they did fre¬ 
quently—the flak machines remain silent. As one network official told
