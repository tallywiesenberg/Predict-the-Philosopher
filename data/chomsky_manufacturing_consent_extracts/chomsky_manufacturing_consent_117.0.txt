head of state Bulent Ecevit even accused Henze of helping destabilize 
Turkey during his term of operations there. 37 Henze never refers in his 
“news” articles to his active participation in Turkish affairs as a CIA 
official. His writings are notable for their consistent apologetics for 
military rule in Turkey, for their dishonesty, 38 and for the fact that 
Henze openly disdains the use of rules of evidence in proving Soviet 
villainy. 39 

Michael Ledeen, as we saw in chapter i, contends that the mass 
media believe Qaddafi more readily than the U.S. government, and 
focus more heavily on the victims of state terror in U.S. client states 
(Indonesia in East Timor, and Guatemala?) than in enemy and radical 
states (Cambodia and Poland?). Again, such absurdities do not reduce 
Ledeen's access to the mass media as an expert on the Bulgarian Con¬ 
nection, or on anything else. 40 

The mass media not only allowed these disinformation sources to 
prevail, they protected them against disclosures that would reveal their 
dubious credentials. That Henze was a longtime CIA official was almost 
never mentioned in the press (never, to our knowledge, on television), 
and his consistent apologetics for the Turkish military regime and 
frequent lies were never disclosed. In Sterling's case, her numerous 
errors of fact, foolish arguments, and wilder political opinions were not 
disclosed to readers of the New York Times, Time, or Newsweek, or 
watchers of CBS News or the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour,” and even 
“newsworthy” matters bearing on her qualifications were ignored. For 
example. Sterling's numerous attacks on the murdered French activist- 
radical Henry Curiel resulted in suits for slander brought against her 
in Paris. The New York Times has never mentioned these slander suits, 
which would put Sterling in a bad light not only because she lost them 
in whole or part, but also because of the insight they provide concerning 
her sources and methods. Sterling had gotten much of her information 
from a French journalist, George Suffert, who was a conduit for French 
and South African intelligence, and who had obligingly placed the 
African National Congress at the top of his list of “terrorist” organiza¬ 
tions. In her Terror Network, Sterling strongly intimates that Curiel was 
a KGB agent, but the French court, on the basis of documents provided 
by French intelligence, found no support for this claim. Sterling re¬ 
treated to the defense that her insinuation of CuriePs KGB connection 
was merely a “hypothesis” rather than an assertion of fact. The case, 
in short, showed that she was a conduit of disinformation, quite pre-

right-wing disinformation sources.
