“they had got away with so much in Italy”). 44 As in the Third World 
election cases described in chapter 3, the media prefer to focus on 
superficial detail about the participants and opinions within a narrow 
range of establishment views (plus bluff denials by Bulgarian and Soviet 
officials), along with each development supporting the accepted case (a 
defector’s accusations, a further Agca confession, an investigator’s or 
prosecutor’s report, and leaks of alleged claims or expected new devel¬ 
opments), whatever its credibility, 

“Off the agenda” are arguments and facts that would call into ques¬ 
tion the validity of the basic SHK model, and those relating to the 
“alternative model” (which starts with the question of why Agca con¬ 
fessed so late and the likelihood that he was encouraged and pressed 
to talk). We will run through only a few of the important questions and 
points of evidence that the mass media put off the agenda. 

The basic SHK model rested its case on the Soviet motive, Agca’s 
stay in Sofia, and the high professionalism of the Soviet and Bulgarian 
secret police, which made it likely that they were manipulating Agca if 
he stopped off in Bulgaria. Only the ABC “20/20” program of May 12, 
1983, explored the Soviet motive in any depth, despite the constant 
mass-media reiteration of the SHK line. ABC went to the trouble of 
asking the Vatican about the validity of Marvin Kalb’s claim that the 
pope had written a note threatening to resign and to return to Poland 
to lead the resistance to any Soviet invasion. Cardinal John Krol, 
speaking for the Vatican, said that “Not only was there not such a letter, 
but such a letter directly from the Pope to Brezhnev would have been 
a total departure from all normal procedures. In no way could you 
conceive of the Holy Father saying, ‘I would resign. 1 ” ABC’s informa¬ 
tion from the Vatican too was that the pope’s spoken message to Brezh¬ 
nev was conciliatory. This spectacular repudiation of an important 
element in the SHK case was unreported in the rest of the media, and 
simply died with the ABC broadcast. And any balancing of supposed 
gains against the costs and risks to the Soviet Union in sponsoring Agca 
was simply not undertaken in the mass media. 

None of them stopped to evaluate Agca’s 1979 letter threatening to 
kill the pope on his earlier visit to Turkey. Sterling’s ludicrous claim 
that the KGB hired a Turk to kill the pope in order to damage Turkey’s

relation to NATO was never discussed* The question of the authentic¬ 
ity of Agca's letter to Turkes, which bears on Agca's political commit¬ 
ments (and thus another SHK premise), was never discussed in the U.S. 
mass media. During the trial, Abdullah Catli's statement that Bulgaria 
was a preferred Gray Wolves route to Europe because of the relative
