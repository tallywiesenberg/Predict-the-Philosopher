nal Court of Rome handed down a Judgment in the Matter of Francesco 
Pazienza et ah , which described repeated corrupt behavior by officials 
of the Italian secret-service agency SISMI, including the forgery and 
planting of documents. These officials were also charged with involve¬ 
ment in a cover-up of the agents carrying out the 1980 Bologna railway- 
station massacre, the kind of terrorist connection that attracts frenetic 
mass-media attention when attributable to suitable villains. As we noted 
earlier, SISMI officials had visited Agca in prison and SISMI had 
issued a forged document implicating the Soviet Union in the shooting 
of the pope on May 19, 1981, only six days after the assassination 
attempt. This forgery was never mentioned in the TimeSy Time, and 
Newsweek, or on CBS News, and the July 1985 court decision was barely 
mentioned in a back-page article of the Times. 

These blackouts are of materials that suggest a corrupt Italian pro¬ 
cess and the possibility that Agca was persuaded and coached to pin the 
plot on the East A propaganda system exploiting the alleged Bulgarian 
Connection will naturally avoid such documents. 

Agca’s extremely loose prison conditions and the numerous claims 
in the Italian and dissident U.S, press of visits by Italian intelligence 
personnel were also virtually unmentioned by the U.S. mass media 
throughout 1982 and 1983. In June 1983, Diana Johnstone, the foreign 
editor of the newspaper In These Times submitted on Op-Ed column 
to the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer that summarized 
the evidence and claims of intelligence-agency visits, the reported 
threats to Agca that his open and pleasant prison conditions might be 
terminated if he remained uncooperative, and Martella’s proposed deal 
with Agca, This Op-Ed offering was rejected, and no commentary or 
news along these lines was permitted to surface in the Times or the 
Philadelphia Inquirer —or elsewhere, to our knowledge. Several years 
later, in an article in the New York Times of June 17,1985, referring to 
Pandico’s detailed description of how Agca was coached in prison, John 
Tagliabue describes Agca’s prison as “notoriously porous,” But the 
Times had never mentioned this notorious fact before, or considered it 
in any way relevant to the case. 

When Agca identified the Bulgarians in November 1982, the integrity 
of the Italian investigative-judicial process in pursuing the case was 
already badly compromised for a wide variety of reasons, 46 but the U.S. 
mass media weren’t interested. Nor were they interested in the strange
