likeness watching the scene at St, Peter’s Square on May 13,1981, This 
photo, Martella eventually claimed, was not of Antonov but an Ameri¬ 
can tourist. But this tourist, who apparently looked exactly like An¬ 
tonov, has never been located, and the film from which this shot was 
taken has unaccountably disappeared, 47 Agca’s alterations in his claims 
about the Bulgarians, with Martella generously allowing him to change 
his recollections about the timing of events on May 13 whenever Bul¬ 
garian counter-evidence was too strong, failed to attract the media’s 
attention, 48 Agca’s June 28, 1983, retraction of his claim that he had 
visited Antonov’s apartment and met his family was not mentioned in 
the mass media until a full year after the event, and even then suggested 
to the press no very serious problems with the case or with Martella’s 
investigative work. 4 * How could Agca know details about Antonov’s 
apartment if he had never been there? An honest press would have 
pursued this relentlessly. The New York Times, with Sterling as its 
reporter, suppressed the issue. 50 The rest of the press simply wasn’t 
interested. 

The media also weren’t interested in Or sen Oy men’s finding that the 
Vatican had gone to some pains to try to implicate the Bulgarians, or 
the trial disclosure that the West German authorities had tried to bribe 
Gray Wolves member Oral Celik to come to West Germany and con¬ 
firm Agca’s claims, Pandico’s and Pazienza’s insider claims of Mafia and 
SISMI involvement in getting Agca to talk were also given only the 
slightest attention, and this accumulating mass of materials on the 
Italian process was never brought together for a reassessment. 

Perhaps the most blatant case of willful ignorance concerned the 
Italian fixer and former member of SISMI, Francesco Pazienza. 
Wanted for several crimes, Pazienza had fled Italy, and in 1985 he 
resided in exile in New York City, Eventually he was seized and held 
there by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Pazienza had 
been a partner of Michael Ledeen in the “Billygate” affair in Italy, and 
retained his connection after Ledeen became General Haig’s right- 
hand man in Italy in the early days of the Reagan presidency, Pazienza 
had also been a close associate of SISMI head Giuseppe Santovito. 
From 1983 onward it was alleged in the Italian press that Pazienza had 
been involved in getting Agca to talk, and he himself eventually made 
detailed accusations of coaching by elements of SISMI, Although Pa¬ 
zienza was readily available for interviews in a New York City jail, the 
New York Times ignored him. Our hypothesis is that they did this 
because if they had talked to him it would have been difficult to avoid

discussing his connections with Ledeen and Sterling (both Times 
sources and under Times protection). This would not have reflected 
well on the quality of the paper’s sourcing. Pazienza’s story would also
