all known laws of war”)* 62 Between 1961 and 1971* however* the U*S* 
Air Force sprayed 20 million gallons of concentrated arsenic-based and 
dioxin-laden herbicides (mainly Agent Orange) on 6 million acres of 
crops and trees* besides using large quantities of the "super tear gas” 
CS and vast amounts of napalm and phosphorus bombs. 63 An estimated 
13 percent of South Vietnam's land was subjected to chemical attacks* 
This included 30 percent of its rubber plantations and 36 percent of 
its mangrove forests* along with other large forest areas* destroyed by 
toxic chemicals in programs that included multiple “large-scale inten¬ 
tional effort[s] combining defoliation with incendiaries to produce a 
forest fire in South Vietnam*” 64 A 1967 study prepared by the head of 
the Agronomy Section of the Japanese Science Council concluded that 
U*S* anti crop warfare had already ruined more than 3*8 million acres of 
arable land in South Vietnam* killing almost i*ooo peasants and over 
13*000 livestock* 65 This policy of attempting to force enemy capitula¬ 
tion by destroying its food supply was not only contrary to the rules of 
war* 66 it was notable in that it “first and overwhelmingly affected small 
children*” 67 

Laos was also subjected to chemical attacks in 1966 and 1969* directed 
at both crops, and vegetation along communication routes* And in Cam¬ 
bodia* some 173*000 acres of rubber plantations* crops and forests were 
heavily sprayed with Agent Orange in the spring of 1969. 63 The Cambo¬ 
dian government complained bitterly at the violation of its neutrality by 
this inhumane and illegal action* but Cambodia was too small and weak 
for its voice to be heard or for it to be able to mobilize a legal or other 
defense* Although the U,N* General Assembly did strongly condemn the 
use of chemical agents as contrary to international law by an 83^0-3 vote 
in 1969* it was powerless to act against the United States, and there was 
no “international community” mobilization to halt its use of chemical 
warfare in Cambodia or elsewhere in Indochina* 

During the Vietnam war* the use of chemicals was reported and criti¬ 
cized in the U,S. media when first disclosed in 1966* but the subject was 
quickly dropped. The illegality of chemical warfare and a policy of star¬ 
vation, and their effects on the victim population, were virtually unre¬ 
ported* There were exceptions, such as Orville Schell* Jr.'s 1971 Look 
magazine article “Silent Vietnam: How we invented ecocide and killed a 
country” but they were rare indeed. After the war, because of the effects 
of Agent Orange on U.S. soldiers, there was some coverage of this chem¬ 
ical warfare campaign* but the vastly greater impact on the direct targets 
of this warfare in South Vietnam remained close to invisible* Of 522 arti¬ 
cles in the New York Times 3 the Washington Post * the Los Angeles Times, 
Newsweek, and Time during the 1990s that mentioned Agent Orange and
