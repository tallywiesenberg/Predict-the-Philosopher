In a follow-up article of April 7,1980, Treaster repeats that on March 
30 the junta ordered all military forces into their barracks, and that they 
obeyed “even though they knew leftists with weapons were pouring into 
the central plaza.” Treaster asserts this government claim as fact, and 
he continues to suppress sources and evidence that contradict this 
government allegation.He also fails to explain why the leftists would 
indiscriminately shoot their own people paying homage to the arch¬ 
bishop.32 

The title of Treaster’s article of April 7,1980, is “Slaying in Salvador 
Backfires on Rebels.” The article reads as follows: 

The murder of Archbishop Oscar Amulfo Romero two weeks ago 
and the killing of 30 at his funeral may have benefited, rather than 
hurt, the ruling civilian-military junta, in the view of many diplo¬ 
mats, businessmen and Government officials.The extreme right is being blamed for the killing of the Arch- 


WORTHY AND UNWORTHY VICTIMS 53 


bishop and the extreme left is being blamed for the shooting and 
bombing that turned the crowded central plaza into chaos as 
Archbishop Romero was being eulogized, 

“It’s not so much that the junta gained/* said Robert E* White* 
the United States Ambassador to El Salvador* “but that its oppo¬ 
nents on the extreme right and left have lost prestige.The net 
result is a boost in prestige for the junta/' 

We may note how the title of the article transforms the murder of the 
leader of the dissident forces (and then of his followers at the funeral) 
from a moral issue deserving outrage into a question of political advan¬ 
tage, and turns that against the rebels.
