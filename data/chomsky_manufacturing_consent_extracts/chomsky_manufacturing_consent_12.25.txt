It would be hard to imagine the 
New York Times publishing an article on Popieluszko headed “Slaying 
in Poland Backfires on Solidarity Movement,* 5 featuring perhaps the 
playing up by the official press of demonstrator aggressiveness or vio¬ 
lence.Note also how the question of identifying the killer of Romero, 
and the governments obligation to seek justice, has been pushed into 
the background.Finally, there is the statement that “the extreme left 
is being blamed 5 * for the deaths in the plaza* Use of the passive voice 
allows Treaster to avoid specification of just who is blaming the ex¬ 
treme left* He mentions as his sources for the article as a whole “many 
diplomats, businessmen and Government officials”~he doesn*t even 
pretend to have talked to ordinary Salvadorans or church representa¬ 
tives—but his only citation near the statement that “the extreme left 
is being blamed" is the then-U.S* ambassador, Robert White.By relying 
only on government handouts and carefully avoiding readily available 
conflicting evidence and alternative views, the Times once again found 
the means of applying the usual formula of a deadly right offsetting a 
deadly left, with the junta favored by the U.S. government once more 
placed in the middle—with enhanced prestige!2.3.3.
