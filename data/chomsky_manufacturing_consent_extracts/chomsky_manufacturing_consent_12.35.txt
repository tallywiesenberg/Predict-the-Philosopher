Archbishop Rivera y 
Damas, “the church has moved to a more centrist position in the civil 
war between the Government and the guerrillas.” 35 Of course, if the 
church now takes a centrist position, as opposed to its position under 
Romero, this constitutes an admission that the theme played by 
Treaster and the Times a year previously of an even-handed Romero 
was a lie (which it was).Is it possible that the Times always finds the 
church in the middle and is lying one year later as well?The question 
must remain open, as his successor has been much more circumspect 
than Romero.The willingness of the right wing and the army to murder 
people like Romero might have affected Archbishop Rivera y Damas’s 
ability to speak his mind freely and forced public caution.The point 
does not arise for Schumacher and the Times .
