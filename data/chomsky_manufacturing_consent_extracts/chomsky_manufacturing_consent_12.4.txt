responsibility at the top 

With Popieluszko, the media tried hard to establish that there was 
knowledge of and responsibility for the crime at higher levels of the 
Polish government.Soviet interest and possible involvement were also 
regularly invoked.With Romero, in contrast, no such questions were 
raised or pressed.The media did note that Romero opposed aid to the Salvadoran

junta (which Carter provided anyway), but they failed to convey the 
depth of his hostility to U,S, policy and the importance of his opposi¬ 
tional role (although it was far more threatening to U,S, policy than 
Popieluszko was to the Soviet Union)* The press never mentioned the 
special emissary sent by Carter to the pope in an attempt to bring 
Romero into line, or the fact that the head of the Jesuit order in Central 
America was called to Rome, probably in response to this U.S. pres¬ 
sure* 37 The media also suppressed Romero’s appeal to the military to 
refuse to kill, a fact that would have made much clearer how strongly 
opposed he was to the official policies, and how convenient his murder 
was to the rulers of El Salvador* 

Although Romero was far and away the most important establish¬ 
ment figure aligned with the popular movements, the media pretended 
at first that the affiliation of his killers was a complete mystery* The 
Washington Post supposed an equal likelihood of a left- or right-wing 
source, and the Miami Herald noted on March 27 that “Both stood to 
benefit from any chaos his death might have created*” (No American 
paper suggested that Popieluszko might have been murdered by Soli¬ 
darity sympathizers to discredit the Polish government*) This foolish¬ 
ness was the minority position—the bulk of the press suggested that the 
killer was probably a rightist, but of obscure connection* The reliable 
Duarte suggested that the killing was too professional to be indige¬ 
nous—it must have been a contract job from the outside.This view was 
dutifully repeated by the New York Times, Time, Newsweek, and CBS 
News.
