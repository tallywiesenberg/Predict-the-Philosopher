The press never dis¬ 
cussed this point either* The Times quotes Secretary of State Cyrus 
Vance on the murder: “Two weeks ago I wrote the Archbishop and said: 
l We share a repugnance for the violence provoked by both extremes 
that is taking the lives of innocent people* We deplore the efforts of 
those seeking to silence the voices of reason and moderation with 
explosives, intimidation and murder/ 5,40 The paper points out that the 
letter from Vance was in reply to Romero's appeal to cease supplying 
arms.The article failed to include the gist of Romero's argument, and 
it did not quote that part of Vance's letter that rejected the archbishop's 
appeal.The report also did not take note of Vance's serious misre¬ 
presentation of the archbishop's position when he says that “We share 
a repugnance [for] * ..both extremes"; Romero attributed the killings 
to the army and the right, not “both extremes."
