But in contrast with 
Popieluszko, the U.S. mass media seemed quite uninterested in who 
committed the act or in demanding just retribution.Subsequently, a great deal of evidence became available showing 
that Roberto D'Aubuisson was at the center of a conspiracy to murder 
Romero* On the basis of numerous interviews with Arena party activists 
and U.S. officials, and examination of State Department cables, investi¬ 
gative reporters Craig Pyes and Laurie Becklund claimed in 1983 that 
D'Aubuisson had planned the assassination with a group of active-duty 
military officers, who drew straws for the honor of carrying out the 
murder.41 Former ambassador Robert White, who had access to State 
Department cables and other inside information during his tenure in

office, also stated before a congressional committee in February 1984 
that “beyond any reasonable doubt” D’Aubuisson had “planned and 
ordered the assassination” of Archbishop Romero, and White gave 
details on the planning meeting and the subsequent execution of the 
trigger man to keep him quiet, 42 Further evidence of D’Aubuisson’s 
involvement in the murder came to light with the confession of Roberto 
Santivanez, a former high official in Salvadoran intelligence.According 
to Santivanez, the murder of Romero was planned and carried out by 
D’Aubuisson with the aid of former national guardsmen of Somoza, but 
“under the protection of General Garcia and Colonel Carranza.” 43 
Pyes’s and Becktund’s informants also indicated that D’Aubuisson was 
a subordinate and political ally of Carranza, who was the number two 
man in the Salvadoran military until his ouster under U.S. pressure in 
December 1980, Carranza then moved over to head the Treasury Police.D’Aubuisson also worked with the National Guard’s G-2 central intelli¬ 
gence office while the guard was headed by General Eugenio Vides 
Casanova, Pyes and Becklund write that “During the time Vides com¬ 
manded the Guard, active-duty military officers working with the G-2 
were linked in State Department cables to the March 1980 assassination 
of Archbishop Oscar Amulfo Romero... .’ >44 Note that Vides Casanova 
became minister of defense, the post he still holds, under the Duarte 
government.
