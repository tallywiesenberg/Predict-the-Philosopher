The U.S. mass media gave little notice to this important display and 
consolidation of the power of the extreme right* and the semi-official 
vindication of the murderers of Archbishop Romero, This was telling 
evidence about the nature of power in El Salvador and the fictional 
quality of the claim that the government was centrist or reformist.Unbiased media would have featured and explained the meaning of this 
information- But these facts contradicted the Carter-Reagan mythol- 
ogy* so the media predictably remained silent about these events and 
continued to perpetuate the myth.On November 29* 1980* following the 
massacre of the leaders of the opposition in San Salvador* the Times 
suggested that there is "a severe challenge to the credibility” of the gov¬ 
ernment, but there is no hint that the revolt of May 1980 had changed 
their view of April 28 that this was a "weak centrist government.” 

The media also adjusted nicely* then and later* to the rehabilitation 
of the probable murderer of Romero and his reintegration into the 
official power structure.As D’Aubuisson sought high office and eventu¬ 
ally became president of the Salvadoran legislature, the U.S. mass 
media did not focus on his record as the probable organizer of the 
murder of Archbishop Romero and as the acknowledged leader of the 
death squads and a mass murderer.Even the open anti-Semitism of this 
Fascist was kept under the rug.
