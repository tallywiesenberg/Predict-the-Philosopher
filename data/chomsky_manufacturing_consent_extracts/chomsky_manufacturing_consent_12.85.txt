Semite and professional assassin, who was suspected of having orga¬ 
nized the murder of Popieluszko in Poland, ran for office and became 
head of the Polish legislature, there might have been a raised eyebrow 
or two in the U.S. media.Throughout this period, media coverage adopted a central myth 
contrived by the government, and confined its reporting and interpreta¬ 
tion to its basic premises: the “moderate government” that we support 
is plagued by the terrorism of the extremists of the left and right, and 
is unable to bring it under control.The U.S. government and the media 
understood very well that the violence was overwhelmingly the respon¬ 
sibility of both the U.S.-backed security forces, which were, and re¬ 
main, the real power in the country, and the paramilitary network they 
created to terrorize the population.But this truth was inexpressible.To 
this day the media maintain the central myth of earlier years, long after 
having conceded quietly that it was a complete fabrication.
