Reporting 
on the prospects for peace in El Salvador, Lindsey Gruson comments 
that “Today, death squads of the right and left no longer terrorize the 
population into submission and silence,” thanks to the success of Presi¬ 
dent Duarte and his U.S. supporters in moving the country toward 
democracy—exactly as a propaganda model would predict.48 


2.4.COVERAGE OF THE 
SALVADORAN NATIONAL 
GUARDS’ MURDER OF THE 
FOUR U.S. 

CHURCHWOMEN AND 
ITS FOLLOW-UP 

On December 2, 1980, four U.S. churchwomen working in El Salva¬ 
dor—Maura Clarke, Jean Donovan, Ita Ford, and Dorothy Kazel— 
were seized, raped, and murdered by members of the Salvadoran 
National Guard.This crime was extremely inconvenient to the Carter 
administration, which was supporting the Salvadoran junta as an al¬ 
leged “reformist” government and trying to convince the public and 
Congress that that government was worthy of aid.While temporarily 
suspending military aid to El Salvador, the Carter administration 
sought a quick and low-keyed resolution of the case.
