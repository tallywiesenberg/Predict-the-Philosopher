government* A commission headed by William P. Rogers was quickly 
sent to El Salvador to inquire into the facts and offer U.S. aid in an 
investigation.The commission reported that it had “no evidence sug¬ 
gesting that any senior Salvadoran authorities were implicated in the 
murders themselves,” but there is no indication that it ascertained this 
by any route beyond asking the authorities whether they were involved* 
The commission acknowledged that justice was not thriving in El Sal¬ 
vador, 49 but it proposed no independent investigation, merely urging 
'the Salvadoran junta to pursue the case vigorously* It noted that the 
junta promised that the truth “would be pursued wherever it led any¬ 
where in the country at any level*” 50 Rogers was later to concede that 
perhaps he was a bit optimistic in expecting the Salvadoran junta to 
pursue the case seriously* 51 

With the arrival of the Reagan administration, the already badly 
compromised concern to find the culprits diminished further, and the 
dominance of the interest in protecting the client regime in El Salvador 
became still more overwhelming* It was quickly clear that the whole 
business could be forgotten—along with the thousands of Salvadorans 
already killed—except for the demands of public relations.The willing¬ 
ness to support any feasible cover-up was also quite evident.Secretary 
of State Alexander Haig stated before the House Committee on Foreign 
Affairs that the evidence “led one to believe” that the four women were 
killed trying to run a roadblock—a shameless lie that was soon acknowl¬ 
edged as such by the State Department, 52 The Reagan ambassador to 
the UN, Jeane Kirkpatrick, went Haig one better, suggesting that the 
four women were political activists for the “Frente”—as with Haig’s 
statement, an outright lie—hinting quite broadly that they were fair 
game* 53 

Although Kirkpatrick also asserted that the Salvadoran government 
“unequivocally” was “not responsible” for the murders, evidence was 
soon available that showed that members of the National Guard had 
killed the four women.The administration then moved to the position 
that it was clear that the local guardsmen had “acted alone,” This was 
asserted and reiterated despite the absence of any supportive investiga¬ 
tion, and important leads suggesting the contrary were ignored.
