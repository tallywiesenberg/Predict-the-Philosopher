have disturbed the propaganda line. 

The trial in Rome was awkward for the Western media, as Agca 
quickly declared himself to be Jesus and, more important, failed to 
produce any supportive evidence backing up his claims of Bulgarian 
involvement. The diligent and extensive court investigation found nu¬ 
merous Gray Wolves links to Agca in the period just up to his assassina¬ 
tion attempt, but no witness to his (allegedly) numerous meetings with 
Bulgarians in Rome, no money, no car, and, in the end, no conviction. 
As we have pointed out, in addition to the already available evidence 
of atrocious prison practice in dealing with Agca, and the 1981 meetings 
with intelligence officials and Martella’s offer, there was a steady ac¬ 
cumulation of claims and evidence of pressures on Agca to implicate 
the Bulgarians. But, despite this evidence and the failure to convict the 
Bulgarians after a lengthy investigation and trial, the mass media of the 
West never provided any serious reevaluations of the case. Almost 
uniformly they hid behind the fact that an Italian court dismissed the 
case for lack of evidence rather than demonstrated innocence. They 
never hinted at the possibility that an Italian court and jury might still 
be biased against the Eastern bloc and protective of the powerful 
Western interests that had supported the Bulgarian Connection so 
energetically. 

The mass media also never looked back at their own earlier claims 
and those of the disinformationists to see how they had stood up to the 
test of accumulated evidence. On January 3,1983, Newsweek had quoted 
an Italian official who said that “we have substantial evidence ... [that] 
Agca operated in close contact with the Bulgarians," and the New York 
Times editorialized on October 20,1984, that “Agca’s accounts of meet¬ 
ings with Bulgarian officials are verifiable in important details." If there 
was “substantial evidence” and “verifiable” details long before the trial, 
why was this evidence not produced in the courtroom? Why, after an 
enormous further investigative effort was there still not enough evi¬ 
dence to sustain a conviction? The U.S. mass media didn’t even try to 
answer these questions. This would mean asking serious questions 
about the validity of the SHK model and considering alternatives, 
which the media have never been prepared to do. For them, the alterna¬ 
tive model, plausible from the beginning and, by March 1986, based on 
a great deal of evidence, was still the “Bulgarian view.” The questions
