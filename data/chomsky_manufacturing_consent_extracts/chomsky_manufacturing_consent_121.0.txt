“For the first time in history,” Robert Elegant writes, “the outcome of 
a war was determined not in the battlefield, but on the primed page, 
and above all, on the television screen,” leading to the defeat of the 
United States in Vietnam. The belief that the media, particularly televi¬ 
sion, were responsible for U.S, government failures is widely expressed. 
It was endorsed by the right-wing media-monitoring organization Ac¬ 
curacy in Media in its hour-long “Vietnam Op/Ed” aired by public 
television in response to its own thirteen-part series on the war. 2 Ac¬ 
cording to a more “moderate” expression of this view, the media had 
become a “notable new source of national power” by 1970 as part of 
a general “excess of democracy,” contributing to “the reduction of 
governmental authority” at home and a resulting “decline in the influ¬ 
ence of democracy abroad.” “Broader interests of society and govern¬ 
ment” require that if journalists do not impose “standards of 
professionalism,” “the alternative could well be regulation by the gov¬ 
ernment” to the end of “restoring a balance between government and 
media.” 3 Freedom House Executive-Director Leonard Sussman, com¬ 
menting on Big Story , the study of media coverage of the Tet offensive 
sponsored by Freedom House, describes the “adversarial aspect” of the 
press-government relation as “normal,” presupposing without argu¬ 
ment that it has been demonstrated, but asks: “Must free institutions 
be overthrown because of the very freedom they sustain?” 4 John Roche 
proceeds further still, calling for congressional investigation of “the 
workings of these private governments” who distorted the record in 
pursuit of their “anti-Johnson mission,” although he fears Congress is 
too “terrified of the media” and their awesome power to take on this 
necessary task. 5

They are not “anti-American/ 5 despite their adversarial stance; rather* 
“they reflect a powerful element of the journalistic-titer ary-political 
culture/ 5 where “the left wins battles ... by default 35 because “its ideas

culture/ 5 and “television becomes an accomplice of the left when it

regularly does, 6 

Media spokespersons, meanwhile, defend their commitment to inde¬ 
pendence while conceding that they may err through excessive zeal in 
calling the government to account in vigorous pursuit of their role as 
watchdog. 

Within the mainstream, the debate is largely framed within the 
bounds illustrated by the PBS-AIM interchange broadcast on the pub¬
