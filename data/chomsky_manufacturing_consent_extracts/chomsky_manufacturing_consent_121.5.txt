lic television network, AIM 5 s “Vietnam Op/Ed” accused PBS of “de¬ 
liberate misrepresentation 55 and other sins, while the producers of the 
documentary defended its accuracy. A dozen commentators, ranging 
from extreme hawks to mild critics of the war such as General Douglas 
Kinnard, added their thoughts. 7 The program concluded with a studio 
wrap-up featuring three “intelligent citizens 55 ; Colonel Harry Summers 
of the Army War College, a hawkish critic of the tactics of the war; 
Peter Braestrup, one of the harshest critics of media war coverage; and 
Huynh Sanh Thong, speaking for what the moderator called “the South 
Vietnamese community, 55 meaning the exile community . 

The hypothesis advanced by the propaganda model, excluded from 
debate as unthinkable, is that in dealing with the American wars in 
Indochina, the media were indeed “unmindful/ 5 but highly “patriotic” 
in the special and misleading sense that they kept—and keep—closely 
to the perspective of official Washington and the closely related corpo¬ 
rate elite, in conformity to the general “journalistic-literary-political 
culture 55 from which “the left 55 (meaning dissident opinion that ques¬ 
tions jingoist assumptions) is virtually excluded. The propaganda 
model predicts that this should be generally true not only of the choice 
of topics covered and the way they are covered, but also, and far more 
crucially, of the general background of presuppositions within which 
the issues are framed and the news presented. Insofar as there is debate 
among dominant elites, it will be reflected within the media, which in 
this narrow sense may adopt an “adversarial stance 35 with regard to 
those holding office, reflecting elite dissatisfaction with current policy. 
Otherwise the media will depart from the elite consensus only rarely 
and in limited ways. Even when large parts of the general public break 
free of the premises of the doctrinal system, as finally happened during

the Indochina wars, real understanding based upon an alternative con¬ 
ception of the evolving history can be developed only with considerable 
effort by the most diligent and skeptical* And such understanding as can 
be reached through serious and often individual effort will be difficult 
to sustain or apply elsewhere, an extremely important matter for those 
who are truly concerned with democracy at home and “the influence 
of democracy abroad/ 1 in the real sense of these words* 

These conclusions concerning media conformism are accepted in 
part by mainstream critics of the media* Thus Leonard Sussman, of 
Freedom House, observes that “U.S, intervention in 1965 enjoyed near¬ 
total * * * editorial support.” 8 The “intervention” in 1965 included the 
deployment of U.S. combat forces in Vietnam, the regular bombing of 
North Vietnam, and the bombing of South Vietnam at triple the scale 
in a program of “unlimited aerial warfare inside the country at the price
