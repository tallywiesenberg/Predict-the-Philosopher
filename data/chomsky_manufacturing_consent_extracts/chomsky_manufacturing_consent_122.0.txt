of literally pounding the place to bits*” 9 It is a highly significant fact 
that neither then, nor before, was there any detectable questioning of 
the righteousness of the American cause in Vietnam, or of the necessity 
to proceed to full-scale “intervention*” By that time, of course, only 
questions of tactics and costs remained open, and further discussion in 
the mainstream media was largely limited to these narrow issues. While 
dissent and domestic controversy became a focus of media coverage 
from 1965, the actual views of dissidents and resisters were virtually 
excluded. These individuals were presented primarily as a threat to 
order, and while their tactics might be discussed, their views were not: 
“The antiwar movement stood at the bottom of the media’s hierarchy 
of legitimate political actors,” Daniel Hallin concludes from his survey 
of television coverage (the print media were hardly different), “and its 
access to the news and influence over it were still more l imi ted.” 10 All 
exactly as the propaganda model predicts* 

As the war progressed, elite opinion gradually shifted to the belief 
that the U.S. intervention was a “tragic mistake” that was proving too 
costly, thus enlarging the domain of debate to include a range of tactical 
questions hitherto excluded- Expressible opinion in the media broad¬ 
ened to accommodate these judgments, but the righteousness of the 
cause and nobility of intent were rarely subject to question- Rather, 
editorials explained that the “idealistic motives” of “the political and 
military commands” who “conceive[d] their role quite honestly as that 
of liberators and allies in the cause of freedom , , . had little chance to 
prevail against local leaders skilled in the an of manipulating their 
foreign protectors.” 11 “Our Vietnamese” were too corrupt and we were 
too weak and too naive to resist their manipulations, while “their Viet¬ 
namese” were too wily and vicious. How could American idealism cope

with such unfavorable conditions? At the war’s end, the liberal media 
could voice the lament that “the high hopes and wishful idealism with 
which the American nation had been born , . * had been chastened by 
the failure of America to work its will in Indochina.” 12 But no conflict 
can be perceived between “wishful idealism” and the commitment to 
“work our will” in foreign lands* a comment that holds of “the culture” 
more broadly. 

As for direct reporting, the major charge of the influential Freedom 
House study of the Tet offensive* echoed by others who condemn the 
media for their overly “adversarial” stance, is that reporting was too 
“pessimistic.” We return to the facts, but consideration of the logic of 
the charge shows that even if accurate, it would be quite consistent with 
a propaganda model. There was, no doubt, increased pessimism within 
the German general staff after Stalingrad. Similarly, Soviet elites 
openly expressed concern over the wisdom of “the defense of Afghanis¬
