pieties of state propaganda might be subject to some question* 15 
In its 1985 tenth-anniversary retrospective on the Vietnam war. For¬ 
eign Affairs presents both the hawk and the dove positions* Represent¬ 
ing the more dovish view, David Fromkin and James Chace assert 
without argument that “the American decision to intervene in Indo¬ 
china was predicated on the view that the United States has a duty to 
look beyond its purely national interests,” and that, pursuant to its 
“global responsibilities,” the United States must “serve the interests of 
mankind.” “As a moral matter we were right to choose the lesser of two 
evils” and to oppose “communist aggression” by the Vietnamese in 
Vietnam, but on the “practical side” it was “wrong” because “our side 
was likely to lose.” The moral imperatives of our service “to the inter¬ 
ests of mankind” do not, however, require that we intervene to over¬ 
throw governments that are slaughtering their own populations, such 
as the Indonesian government we supported in 1965, or our Guatemalan 
and Salvadoran clients of the 1980s. On the contrary, they observe, the 
success of our Indonesian allies in destroying the domestic political 
opposition by violence in 1965 was a respectable achievement that 
should have led us to reconsider our Vietnam policy* They cite Lyndon 
Johnson's national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, who feels in 
retrospect that “our effort” in Vietnam was “excessive” after 1965, 
when “a new anti-communist government took power in Indonesia and 
destroyed the communist party [the only mass-based political party] in 
that country . * incidentally slaughtering several hundred thousand 
people, mostly landless peasants, and thus “securing” Indonesia in

Fromkin and Chace define “opponents of the war”—meaning, pre¬ 
sumably, critics whose views merit serious consideration—as those who 
“did not believe that ‘whipping’ the enemy [North Vietnam] was 
enough, so long as the enemy refused to submit or surrender,” The 
media, they say, “brought home to the American people how little 
effective control over the population had been purchased by all of 
General Westmoreland’s victories,” thus strengthening the “opponents 
of the war,” dissatisfied by our inability to gain “effective control over 
the population,” “The media cannot be blamed for pointing out the 
problem, and if General Westmoreland knew the answer to it, perhaps 
he should have revealed it to the public,” 

Outside of those committed to “the cause,” although possibly skepti¬ 
cal about its feasibility or the means employed, there are only those
