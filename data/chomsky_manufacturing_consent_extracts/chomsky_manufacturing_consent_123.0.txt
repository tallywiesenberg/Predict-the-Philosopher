with allies.” Again, we find not the slightest recognition that the familiar 
pieties of state propaganda might be subject to some question* 15 
In its 1985 tenth-anniversary retrospective on the Vietnam war. For¬ 
eign Affairs presents both the hawk and the dove positions* Represent¬ 
ing the more dovish view, David Fromkin and James Chace assert 
without argument that “the American decision to intervene in Indo¬ 
china was predicated on the view that the United States has a duty to 
look beyond its purely national interests,” and that, pursuant to its 
“global responsibilities,” the United States must “serve the interests of 
mankind.” “As a moral matter we were right to choose the lesser of two 
evils” and to oppose “communist aggression” by the Vietnamese in 
Vietnam, but on the “practical side” it was “wrong” because “our side 
was likely to lose.” The moral imperatives of our service “to the inter¬ 
ests of mankind” do not, however, require that we intervene to over¬ 
throw governments that are slaughtering their own populations, such 
as the Indonesian government we supported in 1965, or our Guatemalan 
and Salvadoran clients of the 1980s. On the contrary, they observe, the 
success of our Indonesian allies in destroying the domestic political 
opposition by violence in 1965 was a respectable achievement that 
should have led us to reconsider our Vietnam policy* They cite Lyndon 
Johnson's national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, who feels in 
retrospect that “our effort” in Vietnam was “excessive” after 1965, 
when “a new anti-communist government took power in Indonesia and 
destroyed the communist party [the only mass-based political party] in 
that country . * incidentally slaughtering several hundred thousand 
people, mostly landless peasants, and thus “securing” Indonesia in

accord with our “global responsibilities” and “serving the interests of 
mankind,” 16 

Fromkin and Chace define “opponents of the war”—meaning, pre¬ 
sumably, critics whose views merit serious consideration—as those who 
“did not believe that ‘whipping’ the enemy [North Vietnam] was 
enough, so long as the enemy refused to submit or surrender,” The 
media, they say, “brought home to the American people how little 
effective control over the population had been purchased by all of 
General Westmoreland’s victories,” thus strengthening the “opponents 
of the war,” dissatisfied by our inability to gain “effective control over 
the population,” “The media cannot be blamed for pointing out the 
problem, and if General Westmoreland knew the answer to it, perhaps 
he should have revealed it to the public,” 

Outside of those committed to “the cause,” although possibly skepti¬ 
cal about its feasibility or the means employed, there are only those 
whom McGeorge Bundy once described as “wild men in the wings,” 
referring to people who dared to question the decisions of the “first 
team” that was determining U.S. policy in Vietnam, 17 

Quite generally, insofar as the debate over the war could reach the 
mainstream during the war or since, it was bounded on the one side by 
the “hawks,” who felt that with sufficient dedication the United States 
could succeed in “defending South Vietnam,” “controlling the popula¬ 
tion,” and thus establishing “American-style democracy” there, 10 and 
on the other side by the “doves,” who doubted that success could be 
achieved in these noble aims at reasonable cost 19 —later, there arrived 
the “owls,” who observed the proceedings judiciously without suc¬ 
cumbing to the illusions of either extreme of this wrenching contro¬ 
versy. Reporting and interpretation of the facts were framed in 
accordance with these principles. 


5.2. “THE WILD MEN IN THE 
WINGS“ 

As the elite consensus eroded in the late 1960s, criticism of the “noble 
cause” on grounds of its lack of success became more acceptable, and 
the category of “wild men in the wings” narrowed to those who opposed 
the war on grounds of principle—the same grounds on which they 
opposed the Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and, later, 
Afghanistan* Let us consider how superpower intervention would be

presented from a point of view that permits aggression to be understood 
as aggression. 

In the case of Soviet intervention, there is no serious controversy. 
True, the Soviet Union has security concerns in Eastern Europe, in¬ 
cluding states that collaborated with the Nazis in an attack on the 
Soviet Union that practically destroyed it a generation ago and now 
serve as a buffer to a rearmed West Germany that is part of a hostile 
and threatening military alliance. True, Afghanistan borders areas of 
the Soviet Union where the population could be inflamed by a radical 
Islamic fundamentalist revival, and the rebels, openly supported by 
bitter enemies of the Soviet Union, are undoubtedly terrorists commit¬ 
ted to harsh oppression and religious fanaticism who carry out violent 
acts inside the Soviet Union itself and have been attacking Afghanistan 
from Pakistani bases since 1973, six years before the Soviet invasion. 20 
But none of these complexities bear on the fact that the Soviet Union 
invaded Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Afghanistan, holds Poland in a 
firm grip, etc. True, the Russians were invited into Afghanistan in 1979,
