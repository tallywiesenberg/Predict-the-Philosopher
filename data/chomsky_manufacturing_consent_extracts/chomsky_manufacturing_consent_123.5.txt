whom McGeorge Bundy once described as “wild men in the wings,” 
referring to people who dared to question the decisions of the “first 
team” that was determining U.S. policy in Vietnam, 17 

Quite generally, insofar as the debate over the war could reach the 
mainstream during the war or since, it was bounded on the one side by 
the “hawks,” who felt that with sufficient dedication the United States 
could succeed in “defending South Vietnam,” “controlling the popula¬ 
tion,” and thus establishing “American-style democracy” there, 10 and 
on the other side by the “doves,” who doubted that success could be 
achieved in these noble aims at reasonable cost 19 —later, there arrived 
the “owls,” who observed the proceedings judiciously without suc¬ 
cumbing to the illusions of either extreme of this wrenching contro¬ 
versy. Reporting and interpretation of the facts were framed in 
accordance with these principles. 


5.2. “THE WILD MEN IN THE 
WINGS“ 

As the elite consensus eroded in the late 1960s, criticism of the “noble 
cause” on grounds of its lack of success became more acceptable, and 
the category of “wild men in the wings” narrowed to those who opposed 
the war on grounds of principle—the same grounds on which they 
opposed the Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and, later, 
Afghanistan* Let us consider how superpower intervention would be

In the case of Soviet intervention, there is no serious controversy. 
True, the Soviet Union has security concerns in Eastern Europe, in¬ 
cluding states that collaborated with the Nazis in an attack on the 
Soviet Union that practically destroyed it a generation ago and now 
serve as a buffer to a rearmed West Germany that is part of a hostile 
and threatening military alliance. True, Afghanistan borders areas of 
the Soviet Union where the population could be inflamed by a radical 
Islamic fundamentalist revival, and the rebels, openly supported by 
bitter enemies of the Soviet Union, are undoubtedly terrorists commit¬ 
ted to harsh oppression and religious fanaticism who carry out violent 
acts inside the Soviet Union itself and have been attacking Afghanistan 
from Pakistani bases since 1973, six years before the Soviet invasion. 20 
But none of these complexities bear on the fact that the Soviet Union 
invaded Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Afghanistan, holds Poland in a 
firm grip, etc. True, the Russians were invited into Afghanistan in 1979,
