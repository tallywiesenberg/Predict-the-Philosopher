but as the London Economist accurately observed, “an invader is an 
invader unless invited in by a government with some claim to legiti¬ 
macy,” 21 and the government that the Soviet Union installed to invite 
it in plainly lacked any such claim. 

None of these matters elicit serious controversy, nor should they. 
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, like earlier cases of Soviet inter¬ 
vention in the region occupied by the Red Army as it drove out the 
Nazis during World War II, are described as aggression, and the facts 
are reported in these terms. The United Nations has repeatedly con¬ 
demned the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan and regularly investigates 
and denounces the crimes they have committed. Western reporters 
cover the war from the standpoint of the rebels defending their country 
from foreign attack, entering Afghanistan with them from their Pakis¬ 
tani sanctuaries. Official Soviet pronouncements are treated not merely 
with skepticism but with disdain. 

In the case of the U.S, intervention in Indochina, no such interpreta¬ 
tion has ever been conceivable, apart from “the wild men in the wings,” 
although it is at least as well grounded as the standard, and obviously 
correct, interpretation of the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan. Further¬ 
more, the reporting practice of journalists and commentators is also 
radically different in the two cases. We put off for a moment the more 
significant issue of how the war is understood, focusing first on the 
narrower question of journalistic practice. 

In sharp contrast to the Soviet aggression, it was standard practice 
throughout the Indochina war for journalists to report Washington

pronouncements as fact* even in the extreme case when official state¬ 
ments were known to be false. Furthermore* this practice persisted 
through the period when the media had allegedly had become “a nota¬ 
ble new source of national power" threatening government authority. 
To mention only one typical case from the year in which* we are to 
understand* this status had been definitively attained (see p. 170)* in 
March 1970 the media reported a North Vietnamese invasion of Laos 
on the basis of a speech by President Nixon announcing that North 
Vietnamese forces in Laos had suddenly risen from 50*000 to 67*000. 
Nixon’s comment came immediately after the U.S. military attache in 
Vientiane had presented his standard briefing citing the lower figure—a 
source of much private amusement among the press corps in Vientiane* 
as one of us witnessed at first hand—but the presidential fabrication 
was reported as fact. The lower figure was also fraudulent, although this 
fact was never reported. 22 Throughout the Indochina wars, when offi¬ 
cial statements were questioned* it was generally on the basis of U.S. 
military sources in the field* so that reporting and analysis remained
