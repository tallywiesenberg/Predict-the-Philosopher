A popular political base for the Government of South Vietnam 
does not now exist. . . . The existing government is oriented 
toward the exploitation of the rural and lower class urban populaÂ¬ 
tions. It is* in fact, a continuation of the French colonial system 
of government with upper class Vietnamese replacing the French.
