although not all aid: U.S. aid to the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s appears 
to have run to many millions. 45 

Applying the principles that we rightly adopt in the case of Soviet 
aggression, the conclusion seems obvious. The United States attacked 
South Vietnam* arguably by 1962 and unquestionably by 1965* expand¬ 
ing its aggression to all of Indochina with lethal and long-term effects. 
Media coverage or other commentary on these events that does not 
begin by recognizing these essential facts is mere apologetics for terror¬ 
ism and murderous aggression. The United States was “defending 
South Vietnam” in the same sense in which the Soviet Union is “de¬ 
fending Afghanistan.” 

But from the point of view of the media* or “the culture,” there is 
no such event in history as the U.S, attack against South Vietnam and 
the rest of Indochina. One would be hard put to find even an single 
reference within the mainstream to any such event* or any recognition 
that history could possibly be viewed from this perspective—just as 
Pravda , presumably* records no such event as the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan* only the defense of Afghanistan against “bandits” sup¬ 
ported by the CIA. Even at the peak period of peace-movement activ¬ 
ism there was virtually no opposition to the war within the intellectual 
culture on the grounds that aggression is wrong 46 —the grounds univer¬ 
sally adopted in the case of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 
1968—for a very simple reason: the fact of U.S. aggression was unrecog¬ 
nized. There was much debate during the war over whether the North 
Vietnamese were guilty of aggression m Vietnam* and as we have seen* 
even the South Vietnamese were condemned for “internal aggression” 
(Adlai Stevenson); but there was no discussion of whether the United 
States was guilty of aggression in its direct attack against South Viet¬ 
nam* then all of Indochina. These intriguing facts reflect the over¬ 
whelming dominance of the state propaganda system and its ability to 
set the terms of thought and discussion* even for those who believe

themselves to be taking an "adversarial stance.” As for the media, 
departures from these doctrinal principles were negligible; indeed, they 
may well have been literally zero in the vast coverage and commentary 
on the war, while it was in progress or since. 

In a revealing article entitled "Lessons of Running Viets* War,” 
published in August 1987, Stanley Karnow, a veteran Asia correspond¬ 
ent and author of a highly regarded liberal history of the Vietnam War, 
argues that the United States erred in Vietnam because it allowed the 
Vietnamese people to depend too heavily on us. 47 Reciprocally, the
