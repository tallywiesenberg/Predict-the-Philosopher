CLOSER LOOK 

The “first Indochina war,” fought by the French and their client forces 
and largely supplied by the United States, came to an end with the 
Geneva Accords of 1954, which established a partition at the 17th 
parallel pending reunification through elections within two years* The 
United States pledged not to obstruct these arrangements* 

The Geneva settlement was quickly undermined by the United 
States and its client regime because it was taken for granted on all sides 
that elections would lead to a unified Vietnam under Viet Minh rule. 
“American intelligence sources were unanimous that Diem [the U.S.- 
imposed client] would lose any national election,” George Kahin con¬ 
cludes from a close inspection of the available record. The Viet Minh 
had agreed to the Geneva decision for regroupment of its forces well 
to the north of territories it controlled on the basis of “the assurance 
that the struggle for the control of Vietnam would be transferred from 
the military to the political level, a realm in which the Vietminh leaders 
knew their superiority over the French and their Vietnamese collabora¬ 
tors was even greater than it was militarily. * . . For the Vietminh, this 
was the heart of the Geneva Agreements.” 49 

The secret U.S. response to the perceived disaster of Geneva was a 
plan to resort to military action (including attacks on China if deemed 
necessary) in the event of “local Communist subversion or rebellion not 
constituting armed attack,” in explicit violation of the UN Charter, 
which limits the use of force to self-defense in the event of “armed 
attack” until the UN Security Council is able to respond. This crucial

for nationwide free elections in 1956. * 551
