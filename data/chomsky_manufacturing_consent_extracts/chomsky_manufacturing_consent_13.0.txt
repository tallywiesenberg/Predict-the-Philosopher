Rain was bee feces, not chemicals. 72 Nevertheless, this campaign re¬ 
ceived vastly more publicity than the real and large-scale chemical war¬ 
fare carried out by the United States in Indochina. The Wall Street 
Journal , which had heavily featured Yellow Rain and expressed the great¬ 
est indignation at this display of Communist evil, never mentioned the 
US. employment of chemicals in that area during its Yellow Rain cam¬ 
paign. The Journal s publisher Peter Kann, eventually wrote that the 
Vietnam war record had clarified "who were the good guys and who were 
the bad guys/’ definitively shown by “the poisoned fields of Laos' 7 (his 
euphemism for Yellow Rain). 73 In short, Kann places the massive real- 
world use of chemical warfare by the United States in Orwell's black hole 
and demonstrates Communist evil by putting forward the discredited 
claim of Yellow Rain that his paper has still not admitted to be fraudu¬ 
lent. 

But the more important facts are these: that with the help of the 
media, the Soviet Union was effectively linked to the use of this ugly 
weapon, based on false evidence; while by treating the real and large- 
scale use of chemical weapons in Indochina by the United States in very 
low key up to this very day, the media have helped convey the impression 
that this country is a moral force on this issue and opposes use of this ter¬ 
rible weaponry. U.S. leaders have opposed the use of chemical warfare— 
by enemy states—but it is a different matter when they choose to use 
such weaponry themselves, or when a client state does the same. 74 


Rewriting Vietnam War History 

There have been thousands of books written on the Vietnam War , 75 and 
that war has been a brooding omnipresence in the US. culture since its 
end in 1975* For the dominant elite the war represents an era in which 
resistance to national policy and the associated rise of formerly apathetic 
sectors of society caused a “crisis of democracy” Those unruly sectors 
and the dissidents are seen as having damaged the cultural and political 
framework and imposed unreasonable impediments to the use of force, 
the latter referred to as the “Vietnam syndrome ” Within the unruly sec¬ 
tors and among the dissidents, of course, the “Sixties” are viewed as an 
era of liberation, of cultural and moral advance, and a temporary surge of 
dem oc r atizati on. 

The propaganda model would lead us to expect mainstream media 
retrospectives on the war to reflect elite perspectives, portraying the 
1960s as a dark age and the U.S, role in the war as, at worst, a case of 
good intentions gone awry. Focusing here on their treatment of the war
