A 
propaganda model would expect that this preferred government expla¬ 
nation would be honored by the mass media, and that in contrast with 
the Popieluszko case, where useful points could be scored by searching 
for villainy at the top, the mass media would now be less eager to find 
that which their government was anxious to avoid.The difference between the murder of the four women and the 



worthy and unworthy victims 6i 


thousands of others uninvestigated and unresolved in El Salvador was 
that the families of these victims were Americans and pressed the case* 
eventually succeeding in getting Congress to focus on these particular 
murders as a test case and political symbol.This forced these killings 
onto the political agenda.A trial and convictions were ultimately re¬ 
quired as a condition for certification and aid to the military govern¬ 
ment of El Salvador.Both the Reagan administration and the 
Salvadoran military were thus obligated to “see justice done”—in this 
one instance.
