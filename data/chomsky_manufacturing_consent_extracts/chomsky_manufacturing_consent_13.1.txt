The finding of the bodies of the four women* by 
contrast, was a back-page item in the Times, and in all four of the media 
institutions in our sample the accounts of the violence done to the four 
murdered women were very succinct, omitted many details, and were 
not repeated after the initial disclosures.No attempt was made to 
reconstruct the scene with its agony and brutal violence* so that the 
drama conveyed in the accounts of Popieluszko’s murder was entirely

impersonal.The Time account, for example* after giving the names of the vic¬ 
tims* says, “Two of the women had been raped before being shot in the 
back of the head.” The New York Times account, shown in table 2-2, 
is also quite succinct.The Rogers Commission report pointed out that 
one of the victims had been shot through the back of the head with a 
weapon “that left exit wounds that destroyed her face.” The Rogers
