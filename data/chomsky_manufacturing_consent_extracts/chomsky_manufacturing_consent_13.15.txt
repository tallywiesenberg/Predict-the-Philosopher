The first hauled out of the hole was Jean Donovan, 
twenty-seven years old, a lay missionary from Cleveland.Her face 
had been blown away by a high calibre bullet that had been fired 
into the back of her head.Her pants were unzipped; her under- 
* wear twisted around her ankles.When area peasants found her, 
she was nude from the waist down.They had tried to replace the 
garments before burial.
