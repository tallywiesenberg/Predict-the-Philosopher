Then came Dorothy Kazel, a forty-year- 
old Ursuline nun also from Cleveland.At the bottom of the pit 
were Maryknoll nuns Ita Ford, forty, and Maura Clarke, forty- 
nine, both from New York, Ail the women had been executed at 
close range.The peasants who found the women said that one had 
her underpants stuffed in her mouth; another's had been tied over 
her eyes.All had been raped.We may note the failure of Time and the New York Times to mention 
the bruises {which both of these publications mentioned and repeated, 
as regards Popieluszko); the failure to mention the destruction of Jean 
Donovan's face; the suppression of the degrading and degraded use of 
the nuns' underwear; 54 the failure to give the account of the peasants 
who found the bodies.
