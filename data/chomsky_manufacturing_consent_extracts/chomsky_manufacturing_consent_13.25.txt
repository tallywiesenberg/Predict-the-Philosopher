These and other details given by Bonner and 
suppressed by Time and the New York Times (and also Newsweek and 
CBS News) add emotional force and poignancy to the scene.Such 
details are included for a Popieluszko, but not for four American 
women murdered by a U.S. client state.The Rogers report also pointed 
out that the forensic surgeons sent to the scene of the crime by the 
junta, at the urging of Ambassador Robert White, refused to perform 
an autopsy on the ground that no surgical masks were available.This 
touch, which would have cast the junta and its agents in a bad light, 
was also omitted from U.S. media accounts.In the Popieluszko case, both the finding of the body and the trial 
were occasions for an aggressive portrayal of the details of the act of 
murder and the condition of the body.
