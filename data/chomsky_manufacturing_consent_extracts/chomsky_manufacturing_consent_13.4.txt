Here the 
media found it extremely difficult to locate Salvadoran government 
involvement in the murders, even with evidence staring them in the 
face.Their investigatory zeal was modest* and they were happy to 
follow the leads of (“Trust me”) Duarte and U.S. officials as the case 
unfolded.They played dumb.The Salvadoran army and security forces 
had been killing Salvadorans, in the same way they had killed the four 
women* for months.What is more* the churches with which the women 
were connected had been recently threatened by the army.
