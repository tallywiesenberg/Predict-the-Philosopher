More direct 
evidence was that local peasants had been forced to bury the bodies by 
the local military.But the media did not use this information to help 
them find the locus of the murders.The initial line of the U.S. and Salvadoran governments was that 
there was no proof of military involvement* although the military's' 
concealment of the bodies was not proper.A statement issued by the 
junta on December 8 claimed that the murderers were “terrorists of the 
extreme right,” 55 and Duane reiterated this view to the press, which 
passed it along.In keeping with the government line* twenty days after 
the murders* the New York Times still spoke only of “unidentified 
assailants,” although the leads to the National Guard were already 
plentiful, and it repeated the Rogers report finding that the security 
forces may have tried to “conceal the deaths” after the bodies had been 
found.
