This was in keeping with 
the basic myth, also consistently followed by the media, that the Sal¬ 
vadoran government was reformist and centrist, trying to control kill¬ 
ings by extremists of the right and left, 57 This fabrication allowed a 
two-track system of massive killing by the army and its affiliates and 
simultaneous claims of regret by the reformers unable to control the 
extremists.This was reminiscent of the heyday of mass murder in 
Argentina, when the New York Times regularly portrayed the junta and 
people like the recently convicted General Videla as moderates “unable 
to control the right-wing extremists" who were killing people.58 

The most important goal of the immediate damage-containment 
process was to stifle any serious investigation of the responsibility of the 
officials of the Salvadoran government.The Salvadoran strategy was 
foot-dragging from beginning to end, as the idea of convicting soldiers 
for killing anybody was contrary to Salvadoran practice, and, moreover, 
there is little doubt that the responsibility for the crime went high.The 
U.S. official strategy, once it was clear that the National Guard was 
responsible for the killing, was to get the low-levei killers tried and 
convicted—necessary to vindicate the system of justice in El Salvador, 
at least to the extent of keeping the dollars flowing from Congress— 
while protecting the “reformers” at the top.
