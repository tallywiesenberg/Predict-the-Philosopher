On September 30, 1981, 
Ambassador Deane Hinton stated with assurance that the local national 
guardsmen “were acting on their own," although internal State Depart¬ 
ment documents of the time recognized that the Salvadoran investiga¬ 
tion had been a joke, and other evidence existed suggesting top-level 
involvement, 59 Nonetheless, the official position was clear.To go along 
with the official line, the mass media had to stop investigating high-level 
involvement and even to suppress evidence emerging from other 
sources.And so they proceeded to do this.After a two-month investigation of the murders, the reporter John 
Dinges filed a story through Pacific News Service that showed the 
murders to have been preplanned in some detail, 60 First, there were 
intercepted radio communications indicating military discussions of the 
arrival of the women at the airport, and other evidence of close surveil¬ 
lance of their flight plans, all suggesting a coordinated and extensive 
military operation.Second, a former deputy minister of planning de¬ 
scribed to Dinges a half-hour presentation by Salvadoran Defense 
Minister Guillermo Garcia in the national palace, denouncing the nuns 
and priests in the very area of the murders and stating that something 
must be done, only two weeks prior to the murders.
