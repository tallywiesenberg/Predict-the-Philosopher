66 MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


In a remarkable feat of self-censorship* most of the mass media 
completely ignored the Dinges findings.Dinges’s report appeared in the 
Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times , and some fifteen other papers* 
but not a word of it found its way into the New York Times, Time * 
Newsweek, or CBS News* and its leads were not pursued by any media.Instead* the media kept repeating the assurances of Duarte and U.S. 
officials that they were satisfied that the killings did not go beyond the 
local national guardsmen* and that the matter would be pursued dili¬ 
gently through proper legal channels.In March 1984* Colonel Roberto Santivanez* a high official in Sal¬ 
vadoran intelligence* agreed to “talk” about the death-squad network 
in El Salvador* and his claims found their way onto CBS News and the 
front page of the New York Times .61 Santivanez gave highly credible 
details about the murder of the four women* indicating that the act had 
been committed on the specific order of Colonel Oscar Edgardo Casa¬ 
nova* who was in charge of the zone in which the killings took place.
