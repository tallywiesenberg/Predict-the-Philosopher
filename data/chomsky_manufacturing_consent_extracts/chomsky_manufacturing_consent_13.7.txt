Colonel Casanova was transferred to another assignment two weeks 
after the murder as part of the official cover-up.His first cousin Eu¬ 
genio Vides Casanova* the minister of defense chosen by Duane and 
head of the National Guard in December 1980, knew about the murder 
order by his cousin* as did Duarte.Although this crushing evidence 
implicated a high officer in the murder and the current minister of 
defense and Duarte in the cover-up* there was no follow-up to this 
story* no connection back to the Dinges story of high-level discussions 
of the need to do something about the religious workers—no editorials, 
no indignation* and no pressure for action.In sum* the leads provided by Dinges* and the testimony of Santi¬ 
vanez, strongly suggest that the killing of the women was based on a 
high-level decision.The evidence is even clearer that middle-level 
officials of the government ordered the killing* and that the highest- 
level officials engaged in a continuing and systematic cover-up.
