court record] of former guardsman Cesar Valle Espinoza, dated 
August 9, 1982, which quotes Subsergeant Colindres Aleman as 
stating on December 2,1980, that there were “superior orders” to

the FBI in Los Angeles, California, which establishes the exis¬ 
tence of a cover-up of the crime as early as December 1980.64 

A second illustration of the process: two of three judges assigned to the
