This 
line of evidence has cumulative weight, but it was never treated as a 
whole by the press (and was barely mentioned as individual items of 
back-page news).A third illustration: according to former ambassador 
Robert White, two national guardsmen who might have been able to 
link higher-ranking officers to the murders of the women were killed 
by military death squads, then listed as missing in action.65 A final 
illustration: when the Salvadoran triggermen were finally assigned at¬ 
torneys, one of the three, Salvador Antonio Ibarra, was prepared to 
defend the men seriously.His colleagues pressed Ibarra to abide by the 
statement that “the possibility of a cover-up had been thoroughly 
investigated” and rejected.He refused to go along with this request, 
with the consequence that on October 30,1983, Ibarra was seized by the 
National Guard and tortured at its headquarters.
