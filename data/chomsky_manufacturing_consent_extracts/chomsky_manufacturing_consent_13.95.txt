The administration hoped that the case would “go away,” but until 
that happened, it wanted the publicity flow to be under its control.Part of the reason the administration wanted control was to allow it 
to claim reasonable progress in the pursuit of the case whenever the 
military government was due for more money.As with other right-wing 
satellites, “improvement” is always found at money-crunch time.In its 
July 1982 certification report, the State Department found that “sub¬ 
stantial progress” had been made in the case and predicted a trial in 
the fall of 1982.In early 1983, the certification report noted “significant 
developments” in the case.
