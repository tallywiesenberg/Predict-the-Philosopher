peared to mean throwing the internal political situation open and thus 
inviting Communist participation” in a democratic process, here—as 
always—intolerable to the United States unless the right outcome is 
first determined by establishing a proper distribution of force, 62 Ambas¬ 
sador Taylor feared as the worst outcome a government that would 
“continue to seek a broadened consensus” and would thus “become 
susceptible to an accommodation with the liberation front*” After the 
war ended, senior Pentagon legal adviser Paul Wamke observed criti¬ 
cally in retrospect that “For the United States to ‘compromise’ and 
permit the indigenous forces of Vietnam to work their own way would 
be to condone the demise of the anti-Communist regime we had sup¬ 
ported in Saigon for twenty years.” 

UN Secretary-General U Thant initiated a negotiation effort in the 
fall of 1964, with the support of Moscow and Hanoi and in accord with 
the consensus of Vietnamese as well as others, but it was rebuffed by 
Washington* As for the media, “It was not until after the die had been 
cast—not until March 9,1965, after the United States had mounted its 
sustained air war against the North and landed the first U.S. ground 
forces in Vietnam—that The New York Times reported U Thant’s 1964 
efforts,” 63 

The U.S* position throughout was that “after, but only after 3 we have 
established a clear pattern of pressure,” could peaceful means be con¬ 
sidered (William Bundy, Aug, II, 1964; his emphasis). First violence, 
then—perhaps—recourse to the peaceful means required by interna¬ 
tional law and the supreme law of the land. The elections provision of 
the Geneva Accords had been officially described in a 1961 State De¬ 
partment white paper as “a well-laid trap” that the United States had 
skillfully evaded, and planners were in no mood to fall into such a 
“trap” in 1964, until the use of violence had secured their objectives. 64 
Increasingly, U.S. planners turned to the policy of expanding the war 
to the North in the hope that this would compensate for their political 
weakness. 

No such conception of the evolving events, and their meaning, was 
ever made accessible through the mainstream media, which kept to the
