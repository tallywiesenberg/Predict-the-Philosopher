free world's fight to contain aggressive Communism” (Robert Trum¬ 
bull), defending South Vietnam "against the proxy armies of Soviet 
Russia—North and South Vietnamese guerrillas” (Hanson Baldwin), 
just as the French had fought “a seven-and-a-half-year struggle” 
against “foreign-inspired and supplied Communists” In early 1965, 
President Johnson decided "to step up resistance to Vietcong infiltra¬ 
tion in South Vietnam” (Tom Wicker); the Vietcong "infiltrate” in their 
own country , while we “resist” this aggression. Since the South Viet¬ 
namese guerrillas were "trying to subvert this country” (David Halber- 
stam), it was natural that the Times supported the strategic-hamlet 
program as necessary despite the coercion and brutality; it was “con¬ 
ducted as humanely as possible” to offer the peasants "better protection 
against the Communists” (Halberstam, Homer Bigart), The peasant 
support for the South Vietnamese "aggressors” and the reasons for it 
were ignored. H allin comments that in the entire New York Times 
coverage from 1961 through September 1963, he found two "extremely 
brief references to land tenure. 66 

While the print media did on occasion reflect the perceptions and 
opinions of American military officers in the field, arousing much irate 
condemnation thereby for their anti-Americanism and "negative re¬ 
porting,” television was more obedient. Thus “the head of the Penta¬ 
gon’s public-affairs office was able to assure Kennedy that the [NBC] 
network had been persuaded that it would be 'against the interest of the 
United States' to show its coverage of ‘rough treatment by South 
Vietnamese soldiers to Viet-Cong prisoners, with a U,S. Army captain 
appearing in this sequence/ NBC J s news director undertook to with¬ 
hold this film's scheduled appearance on the Huntley-Brinkley show, 
and to keep it on the shelf so far as any other programs were con- 
cemed/ ,6T 

Until the expansion of the war in 1965 began to provoke some con¬ 
cern, the NLF and DRV were "treated almost exclusively as an arm 
of international Communism,” Hallin found in his analysis of the 
Times's coverage. "The term civil war began to be used in 1965” and 
"the term aggression began to appear sometimes in quotation marks”— 
referring, of course, to Vietnamese aggression in Vietnam, the concept 
of American aggression being unimaginable, then or since. But concern 
over Vietnamese "aggression” never abated, as when James Reston 
discussed “the main point”: “How, then, is this aggression by subver-

American invaders and their clients. Similarly* on television, even more 
conformist than the print media, Peter Jennings* showing Pentagon
