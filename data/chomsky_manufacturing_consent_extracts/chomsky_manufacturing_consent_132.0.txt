to come for Communist aggression in Vietnam*” while NBCs Jack 
Perkins* reporting an air-force attack that wiped out a “village una¬ 
bashedly advertising itself with signs and flags as a Vietcong village*” 
justified the attack as necessary: “The whole village had turned on the 
Americans, so the whole village was being destroyed.” It is taken for 
granted that the Americans had every right to be marauding in a region 
of Vietnam where “Everything in this area for years was Vietcong,” A 
television report on Operation Attleboro described the fighting as rag¬ 
ing “once again to preserve democracy.” 68 

Summarizing* from the late 1940s* the United States supported the 
French war of conquest; overturned the political settlement arranged 
at Geneva in 1954; established a terrorist client regime in the southern 
section of the country divided by foreign (i,e,, U.S.) force; moved on 
to open aggression against South Vietnam by 1962 and worked desper¬ 
ately to prevent the political settlement sought by Vietnamese on all 
sides; and then invaded outright in 1965* initiating an air and ground 
war that devastated Indochina. Throughout this period* the media 
presented the U.S, intervention entirely within the framework pre¬ 
dicted by a propaganda model. 

There are* of course* those who demand still higher standards of 
loyalty to the state* and for them* the fact that critical perceptions of 
American military officers in the field sometimes reached public atten¬ 
tion is an intolerable “adversarial stance” reflecting the left-wing pro¬ 
clivities of “the culture.” Putting this interesting perspective to the side* 
as far as this period is concerned we may dismiss the conception that 
the media “lost the war,” although it would be quite accurate to con¬ 
clude that they encouraged the United States to enter and pursue a war 
of aggression* which they later were to regard as “a tragedy,” or “a 
blunder*” while never acknowledging their fundamental contribution to 
rallying public support for the policies that they were ultimately to 
deplore. Given the conformism and obedience of the media during this 
crucial period* when the basis for U.S. aggression was firmly and irrevo¬ 
cably laid, it is small wonder that public concern was so slight* and that 
opposition was so negligible as to be entirely without significance. Only 
the most ardent researcher could have developed a moderately clear 
understanding of what was taking place in Indochina,
