that the New York Times is describing are Vietnamese carrying out 
aggression against Americans in Vietnam, so no such scruples are in 
order, and none were expressed. 

Similarly, there was little reaction when B-52 raids in “the populous 
[Mekong] delta” were reported in 1965, with unknown numbers of 
civilian casualties and hordes of refugees fleeing to government-con¬ 
trolled areas “because they could no longer bear the continuous bomb¬ 
ings.” 72 The victims fell under the category of “the unfortunate 
accidental loss of life incurred by the efforts of American military forces 
to help the South Vietnamese repel the incursion of North Vietnam and 
its partisans,” as explained by Sidney Hook while condemning Bertrand 
Russell because he “plays up” these meritorious actions “as deliberate 
American atrocities,” 73 No doubt one can find similar remarks today in 
Pravda in commentary on Afghanistan by other commissars who are 
much admired as leading humanitarians because they courageously 
condemn the crimes of the United States and its allies in Soviet 
journals. 

Not only was there no reaction to these and subsequent atrocities, 
but there was also no attempt to place them in the context of what had 
immediately preceded—that is, to make them intelligible. Indeed, there 
was little awareness of the background, because the media were so 
closely wedded to U.S, government goals and perceptions that they 
never sought to learn the facts. As the war progressed, ample evidence 
became available from U.S. government sources to explain why the 
United States had been forced to resort to violence in “the populous 
delta,” as elsewhere, as we described in the preceding section. But such 
materials, inconsistent with the preferred image of the United States 
defending South Vietnam from Communist terror and aggression, had 
little impact on news reporting or commentary, except for occasional 
illustration of the difficulties faced by the United States in pursuing its 
noble cause. 

The reason for the U.S. resort to violence was overwhelmingly clear 
by the time of the outright U.S. invasion in 1965, and would have been 
no less clear before had any serious effort been made to determine the 
facts. As noted above, the United States was compelled by the political 
and social successes of the southern Viet Minh (NLF, “Viet Cong”) to

shift the struggle away from the political arena* where it was weak* to 
the arena of violence, where it was strong, a typical response to a classic 
dilemma. 

It is in this context that we can understand the resort to B-52 raids
