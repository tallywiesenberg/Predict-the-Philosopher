by such devices as B-52 raids targeted specifically on villages. 

An experienced U.S. official* cited by Buckley* compared My Lai to 
the exploits of the U.S. Ninth Infantry Division in a range of similar 
operations: 

The actions of the 9th Division in inflicting civilian casualties were 
worse. The sum total of what the 9th did was overwhelming. In 
sum* the horror was worse than My Lai. But with the 9th, the 
civilian casualties came in dribbles and were pieced out over a long 
time. And most of them were inflicted from the air and at night. 
Also* they were sanctioned by the command’s insistence on high 
body counts.... The result was an inevitable outcome of the unit’s 
command policy. 83 

In short* the My Lai massacre was ignored when it occurred* and the 
substantial attention given to it later is a more subtle form of cover-up 
of atrocities. An honest accounting* inconceivable in the media or “the 
culture” generally* would have placed the responsibility far higher than 
Lieutenant Galley* but it was more convenient to focus attention on the 
actions of semi-crazed GI’s in a gruesome combat situation with every 
Vietnamese civilian a threatening enemy. My Lai did not prompt the 
media generally—there were some individual exceptions—to take a 
deeper look at the nature of the war* or to display an interest in reports 
of similar events in nearby areas that suggested its unexceptional char¬ 
acter. This particular massacre was made exceptional by an arbitrary 
cutoff of attention and refusal to investigate beyond narrowly circum¬ 
scribed limits. The limited but dramatized attention to My Lai was even 
used to demonstrate the conscience of America* in the face of enemy 
provocations. Thus a 1973 New York Times report from My Lai de¬ 
scribes the “battered Batangan peninsula*” an area where the inhabi¬ 
tants were “generally supporters of the Vietcong,” now demolished by 
U.S. bombardment and ground operations: “big guns fire into the pe¬ 
ninsula as they have again and again over the eight years that American* 
South Korean and South Vietnamese forces have been trying to make 
it safe.” The report quotes villagers who accuse the Americans of 
having killed many people here: “They are in no position to appreciate 
what the name My Lai means to Americans,” the reporter adds thought¬ 
fully. 84 



THE INDOCHINA WARS (l): VIETNAM 199 


The standard critique of the media for having “lost the war” identi¬ 
fies television as the major culprit. Television analyst Edward Jay 
Epstein formulates the standard view as follows: 

Over the past 10 years, almost nightly* Americans have witnessed
