the war in Vietnam* on television* Never before in history has a 
nation allowed its citizens to view uncensored scenes of combat, 
destruction and atrocities in their living rooms, in living color* 
Since television has become the principal—and most believed— 
source of news for most Americans* it is generally assumed that 
the constant exposure of this war on television was instrumental 
in shaping public opinion* It has become almost a truism* and the 
standard rhetoric of television executives, to say that television* by 
showing the terrible truth of the war* caused the disillusionment 
of Americans with the war* * , , This has also been the dominant 
view of those governing the Nation during the war years* * , * 
Depending on whether the appraisal has come from hawk or dove, 
television has thus been either blamed or applauded for the disil¬ 
lusionment of the American public with the war* g5 

There have been several studies of the matter, suggesting a rather 
different picture* We will return to some of these issues in discussing 
the coverage of the Tet offensive, but we should observe that there are 
some rather serious questions about the standard formulations* Sup¬ 
pose that some Soviet investigators were to conduct an inquiry into 
coverage of the war in Afghanistan to determine whether Pravda 
should be blamed or applauded for the disillusionment of the Soviet 
public with the war? Would we consider such an inquiry to be mean¬ 
ingful without consideration of both the costs and the justice of the 
venture? 

Epstein notes an obvious “logical problem” with the standard view; 
for the first six years of television coverage* from 1962 and increasingly 
through 1967* “the American public did approve of the war in Vietnam” 
according to polls. Furthermore, in a 1967 Harris poll for Newsweek, “64 
per cent of the nation wide sample said that television’s coverage made 
them more supportive of the American effort, and only 26 per cent said 
that it had intensified their opposition,” leading the journal to conclude 
that “TV has encouraged a decisive majority of viewers to support the 
war*” 

Epstein's review of his and other surveys of television newscasts and 
commentary during this period explains why this should have been the 
case* “Up until 1965,” he writes, “the network anchor men seemed

unanimous in support of American objectives in Vietnam/ 1 and most 
described themselves as “hawks” until the end, while the most notable 
“dove,” Walter Cronkite, applauded “the courageous decision that 
Communism's advance must be stopped in Asia” in 1965 and later 
endorsed the initial U.S. commitment “to stop Communist aggression
