wherever it raises its head,” In fact, at no time during the war or since 
has there been any detectable departure from unqualified acceptance 
of the U-S. government propaganda framework; as in the print media, 
controversy was limited to tactical questions and the problem of costs, 
almost exclusively the cost to the United States, 

The network anchormen not only accepted the framework of inter¬ 
pretation formulated by the state authorities, but also were optimistic 
about the successes achieved in the U,S, war of defense against Viet¬ 
namese aggression in Vietnam, Epstein cites work by George Rally, who 
concludes: “The results in this study demonstrate the combat reports 
and the government statements generally gave the impression that the 
Americans were in control, on the offense and holding the initiative, at 
least until Tet of 1968,” a picture accepted by the network anchormen. 
Television “focused on [the] progress” of the American ground forces, 
supporting this picture with “film, supplied by the Pentagon, that 
showed the bombing of the North” and “suggesting that the Americans 
were also rebuilding South Vietnam”—while they were systematically 
destroying it, as could be deduced inferentially from scattered evidence 
for which no context or interpretation was provided, NBC's “Huntley- 
Brinkley Report” described “the American forces in Vietnam as 
‘builders' rather than destroyers,” a “central truth” that “needs under¬ 
scoring,” 

What made this especially deceptive and hypocritical was the fact, 
noted earlier, that the most advanced and cruel forms of devastation 
and killing—such as the free use of napalm, defoliants, and Rome 
plows—were used with few constraints in the South, because its popu¬ 
lation was voiceless, in contrast with the North, where international 
publicity and political complications threatened, so that at least visible 
areas around the major urban centers were spared, 86 

As for news coverage, “all three networks had definite policies about 
showing graphic film of wounded American soldiers or suffering Viet¬ 
namese civilians,” Epstein observes, “Producers of the NBC and ABC 
evening-news programs said that they ordered editors to delete exces¬ 
sively grisly or detailed shots,” and CBS had similar policies, which, 
according to former CBS News president Fred W. Friendly, “helped 
shield the audience from the true horror of the war,” “The relative 
bloodlessness of the war depicted on television helps to explain why

only a minority in the Lou Hams-Newsweek poll said that television 
increased their dissatisfaction with the war”; such coverage yielded an 
impression, Epstein adds, of “a clean, effective technological war,”
