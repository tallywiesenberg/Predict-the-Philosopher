wherever it raises its head,” In fact, at no time during the war or since 
has there been any detectable departure from unqualified acceptance 
of the U-S. government propaganda framework; as in the print media, 
controversy was limited to tactical questions and the problem of costs, 
almost exclusively the cost to the United States, 

The network anchormen not only accepted the framework of inter¬ 
pretation formulated by the state authorities, but also were optimistic 
about the successes achieved in the U,S, war of defense against Viet¬ 
namese aggression in Vietnam, Epstein cites work by George Rally, who 
concludes: “The results in this study demonstrate the combat reports 
and the government statements generally gave the impression that the 
Americans were in control, on the offense and holding the initiative, at 
least until Tet of 1968,” a picture accepted by the network anchormen. 
Television “focused on [the] progress” of the American ground forces, 
supporting this picture with “film, supplied by the Pentagon, that 
showed the bombing of the North” and “suggesting that the Americans 
were also rebuilding South Vietnam”—while they were systematically 
destroying it, as could be deduced inferentially from scattered evidence 
for which no context or interpretation was provided, NBC's “Huntley- 
Brinkley Report” described “the American forces in Vietnam as 
‘builders' rather than destroyers,” a “central truth” that “needs under¬ 
scoring,” 

What made this especially deceptive and hypocritical was the fact, 
noted earlier, that the most advanced and cruel forms of devastation 
and killing—such as the free use of napalm, defoliants, and Rome 
plows—were used with few constraints in the South, because its popu¬ 
lation was voiceless, in contrast with the North, where international 
publicity and political complications threatened, so that at least visible 
areas around the major urban centers were spared, 86 

As for news coverage, “all three networks had definite policies about 
showing graphic film of wounded American soldiers or suffering Viet¬ 
namese civilians,” Epstein observes, “Producers of the NBC and ABC 
evening-news programs said that they ordered editors to delete exces¬ 
sively grisly or detailed shots,” and CBS had similar policies, which, 
according to former CBS News president Fred W. Friendly, “helped 
shield the audience from the true horror of the war,” “The relative 
bloodlessness of the war depicted on television helps to explain why

only a minority in the Lou Hams-Newsweek poll said that television 
increased their dissatisfaction with the war”; such coverage yielded an 
impression, Epstein adds, of “a clean, effective technological war,” 
which was “rudely shaken at Tet in 1968.” As noted earlier, NBC 
withdrew television clips showing harsh treatment of Viet Cong prison¬ 
ers at the request of the Kennedy administration. 

Throughout this period, furthermore, “television coverage focused 
almost exclusively on the American effort.” There were few interviews 
with GVN military or civilian leaders, “and the Vietcong and North 
Vietnamese were almost nonexistent on American television news¬ 
casts.” 

There was one famous exception to the sanitizing of the war, an 
August 5, 1965, CBS report by Morley Safer showing U.S. Marines 
burning huts in the village of Cam Ne with cigarette lighters, which 
elicited “a semiofficial campaign” by the Pentagon “to discredit the 
television story and vilify the correspondent as 'unpatriotic. 5 55 But 
surveys of television newscasts by Epstein and Wisconsin Professor 
Lawrence Lichty show that “instances shown on TV of American 
brutality toward the South Vietnamese, such as Cam Ne, "could be 
counted on one hand 5 [Lichty],” “even though hundreds of South 
Vietnamese villages were destroyed during this period.” “The Cam Ne 
story is famous for being the exception to the rule.” 

Returning soldiers told a different story, and it became increasingly 
clear, although not through the medium of television, that the war was 
bloody and brutal, leading to “disillusionment”—and among a large 
sector of the general population, increasingly “out of control,” a much 
stronger and more appropriate reaction. 

But, Epstein continues, “the televised picture of gradual progress in 
the war was abruptly shattered by the Communist [Tet] offensive 55 in 
January-February 1968, when the military lost its “control over the 
movements of the press,” who could step outside their hotels and find 
“themselves willy-nilly in the midst of bloody fighting.” For this brief 
moment, correspondents sent on-the-spot reports that were aired in 
place of “the usual carefully edited view of an orderly, controlled war,” 
and the policy of “shielding] American viewers from the grisly close- 
ups of wounded Americans, body bags and death” briefly collapsed, 
though newscasts continued to be edited in home offices as “too 
strong, 55 in the words of NBC producer Robert Northshield. This cov¬ 
erage convinced Walter Cronkite that the war had become “a bloody 
stalemate,” in a controversial report to which we will return. 

The Tet offensive convinced U.S. elites that the war was becoming 
too costly to the United States, and the government shifted toward the
