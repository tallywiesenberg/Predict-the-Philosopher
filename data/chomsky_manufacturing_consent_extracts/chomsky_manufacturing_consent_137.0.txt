policy of “Vietnamization,” large-scale massacre operations to destroy 
the indigenous resistance and its civilian base, expansion of the war in 
Laos and Cambodia* and the commencement of negotiations with 
North Vietnam, “Accordingly* the networks again changed the focus of 
their coverage, this time from the battlefields in Vietnam to the negotia¬ 
tion tables in Paris, . . . The "story 5 was now the negotiations, not the 
fighting,” Northshield explained, adding that “combat stories seemed 
like a contradiction and would confuse the audience,” “ Similar deci¬ 
sions were made at the other networks,” Epstein adds, as all “altered 
their coverage in late 1969 from combat pieces to stories about the 
"Vietnamization J of the war” and the negotiations in Paris. The post- 
Tet accelerated pacification campaign* one of the most crucial and 
murderous operations in the U.S. war against South Vietnam, received 
little attention, 

Epstein believes that “there is a marked difference between the 
coverage of the formative years of the war {1962-1967) and the later 
years (when the antiwar movement was at its height).” “Up until 1968, 
television coverage was controlled to a large extent by the American 
military, and generally it reflected a controlled American initiative 
which seemed to be winning the countryside and decimating the Viet- 
cong. The searchlight rarely focused on related questions, such as the 
sufferings of Vietnamese civilians.” During the Tet offensive, the focus 
changed to Americans “shown on the defensive, endangered and help¬ 
lessly frustrated,” then to “the story of the American withdrawal” as 
""negotiations began at the end of 1968.” The differences, however, are 
misleading. Apart from the live coverage during the Tet offensive, there 
is very little departure from the principle that the war must be viewed 
from the standpoint determined by official Washington doctrine—a 
standpoint that broadened in scope after Tet, as tactical disagreements 
arose within elite circles. 

In his survey of network newscasts from 1965 through the January 
1973 peace treaty, Daniel Hallin reaches similar conclusions. Until the 
Tet offensive, television coverage was “lopsidedly favorable to Ameri¬ 
can policy in Vietnam,” well beyond even the ""remarkably docile” print 
media. Like Epstein, he notes the “dramatic” change after Tet, “part 
of a larger change, a response to as well as a cause of the unhappiness 
with the war that was developing at many levels, from the halls of the 
Pentagon, to Main Street, U.S.A. and the fire bases of Quang Tri 
province 55 —and, much more crucially, the unhappiness that had be¬ 
come quite significant by 1968 among business elites, leading to the 
changes in U.S. government policy already discussed. ‘"Before Tet,
