favor of administration policy; after Tet, two to one against/ 5 reflecting 
divisions in the “establishment itself,’’ He quotes New York Times 
editor Max Frankel, who said in an interview that “we’re an establish¬ 
ment institution, and whenever your natural constituency changes, then 
naturally you will too.” The same was true of television, and it is hardly 
surprising—and quite in accord with the propaganda model—that its 
fervent loyalty to the administration changed when “the establishment 
bastards have bailed out,” as Lyndon Johnson put it bitterly after the 
“Wise Men” advised him in March 1968 to abandon hope of military 
victory and to de-escalate the conflict, in the wake of the Tet offen¬ 
sive, 87 

Television typically presented events in terms of “a kind of morality 
play,.., a dramatic contrast between good, represented by the Ameri¬ 
can peace offensive [in 1966], and evil, represented by Hanoi,” Report¬ 
ing was relatively bloodless, focusing on the successes of “the 'good 
guys’: American boys in action,” regularly depicted as “brave men,” 
“the greatest men in the world,” “heroes,” exuding competence, hu¬ 
manity, and high morale as they fight against “Communist aggression” 
in the “battle for democracy,” and “win hearts and minds” by caring 
for sick and injured civilians after a village “was burned and blasted to 
death”—properly, because ammunition had been found there, which 
“was enough proof of its being used by the Vietcong” (Greg Harris, 
NBC-TV, Oct, 27, 1967), The issue of racism “was apparently too 
sensitive to touch,” Hallin adds, noting that he found no “comment on 
the hostility that many American soldiers felt towards all Vietnamese, 
, . . a prominent theme in veterans’ recollections of the war.” 

The focus of coverage was the Americans: soldiers bravely defending 
Vietnam, medics caring for the wounded, pacification officials rebuild¬ 
ing after the damage for which Communist terror bore responsibility. 
“Our South Vietnamese” were virtually ignored, with virtually nothing 
on political, economic, or social affairs, and “the peasant figured in the 
news mainly as a victim and prize of the conflict.” The political opposi¬ 
tion in Vietnam was portrayed with considerable hostility, “like the 
antiwar movement at home,” They were “forces of anarchy , , , on the 
march” (Walter Cronkite, CBS-TV, Mar, 31,1966), The utterly fraudu¬ 
lent elections were portrayed as a triumph as democracy, courageously 
carried out in defiance of the disruptive attacks of “Vietcong terror¬ 
ists.” 83 

Civilian casualties were downplayed, or regarded as unavoidable side 
consequences of “a job that had to be done,” raising no moral question.
