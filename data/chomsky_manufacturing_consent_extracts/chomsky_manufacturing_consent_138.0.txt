Perkins commented: “There was no discriminating one house from 
another. There couldn’t be, and there did not need to be. The whole 
village had turned on the Americans, so the whole village was being 
destroyed/’ as is only right and just. In a follow-up on the Cam Ne 
incident, Dan Rather offers a comment that Hallin cites as an example 
of “a muckraking tone,” the harshest he presents: the marines are 
holding Cam Ne 

by force, not through the pacification program . . . [which] hasn’t 
taken hold in Cam Ne. And until it does take hold here and a lot 
of other places in South Vietnam, nobody can feel very good about 
this dirty little war. 

In short, as long as there is still resistance to American violence, we 
cannot feel good about proceeding with our necessary chores^ such 
comments as these presumably account for Rather’s reputation among 
the “doves” as a courageous opponent of the war, and among the 
“hawks” as a dangerous leftist. Walter Cronkite reported “an urgent 
plea from the Vietcong for medical and surgical supplies” to the Inter¬ 
national Red Cross, “an indication that our bombing raids and infantry 
sweeps are taking a heavy toll of all kinds of Red equipment, ” S9 
Reporting of civilian casualties rose from 1966 to a peak in early 1968, 
then declined sharply as the United States turned to the murderous 
accelerated pacification campaign, which Hallin does not discuss, pre¬ 
sumably because it was largely ignored by television, which had shifted 
attention to the negotiating tables in Paris in accordance with Washing¬ 
ton priorities. The coverage rose again in 1972, when casualties could 
be attributed to a North Vietnamese offensive and the U.S. “response.” 
In a 1971 CBS documentary entitled “The Changing War in Indo¬ 
china,” Charles Coliingwood reported the progress of the pacification 
campaign in Kien Hoa Province in the Mekong Delta—“once an NLF 
stronghold,” Hallin observes. This province had been the target of 
Operation Speedy Express in early 1969, one of the most brutal Ameri¬ 
can operations of the war in an area that had been organized under 
NLF control with no known North Vietnamese presence, conquered 
through the “awesome firepower” of the Ninth Division. This included 
air strikes using napalm, high explosives, and anti-personnel bombs, 
B-52 bombing, and artillery shelling “around the clock” at a level that 
“it is impossible to reckon,” with armed helicopters “scouring the 
landscape from the air night and day” and accounting for “many and 
perhaps most of the enemy kills”—about 11,000 according to the U.S. 
command, with 748 weapons captured, a fair indication of who was
