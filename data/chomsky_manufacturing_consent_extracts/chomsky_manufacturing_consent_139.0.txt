strongly, perhaps more strongly than the public itself. It didn't 
work out that way, and eventually television brought the bad 
news. But it never explained why: it never reexamined the as¬ 
sumptions about the nature of the war it had helped to propagate 
in the early years* So to the public, the bad news must have 
seemed nearly as incomprehensible as an earlier "American de¬ 
feat” in Asia: the “loss” of China. 

Attribution of the American failure by the public to “treason” or “lack 
of American will” caused by the failure of the media to support our just 
cause with sufficient fervor is, therefore, “hardly surprising.” 93 

This may well explain why the public has apparently been willing to 
accept the tales about media treachery. But among the educated elites, 
the explanation may lie elsewhere: in a totalitarian cast of mind that 
regards even the actual level of media subservience to the state as 
inadequate and a threat to order and privilege by the “forces of anarchy

THE WAR 


5.5.1. The Tonkin Gulf incident 

By mid-1964, there was a growing consensus among Vietnamese in 
favor of a negotiated political settlement, while the United States was 
maneuvering with increasing desperation to evade what internal docu¬ 
ments describe as "premature negotiations,” The reason, as frankly 
explained, was that the United States was politically isolated, in opposi¬ 
tion to the NLF, the non-Communist opposition, and even the gener¬ 
als. It was therefore regarded as necessary to expand the war to the 
North to “obtain [the DRV's] cooperation in bringing an end to the 
Viet Cong insurgency” and to “persuade or force the DRV to stop its 
aid to the Viet Cong and use its directive powers to make the Viet Cong 
desist” (Ambassador Maxwell Taylor). Intelligence, meanwhile, con¬ 
cluded that “the basic elements of Communist strength in South Viet¬ 
nam remain indigenous*” 94
