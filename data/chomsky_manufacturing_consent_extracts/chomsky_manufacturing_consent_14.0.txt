numbers killed or damaged by the U.S. assault have been treated as 
“unworthy victims ” The overwhelming preoccupation of officials* jour¬ 
nalists* pundits* and intellectuals with media outreach has been on U.S. 
victims and the effects of the war on this country. Robert McNamara's 
widely publicized book* supposedly a mea culpa and moral tract* is no¬ 
table for the fact that his notion of the war's “high costs*” and the error 
and guilt he feels* extend only to US- lives and the effects of the war on 
“the political unity of our society.”® 1 He offers neither regrets* moral 
reflections, nor apologies for his country having invaded* mercilessly 
bombed* ravaged the land* and killed and wounded millions of innocent 
people in a small distant peasant society in pursuit of its own political 
ends. 

In a remarkable cultural process* also* the victims have been turned 
into the villains. As we describe in chapter 5* in an attempt to prolong the 
war President Richard Nixon seized on the question of the adequacy of 
Vietnamese accounting for our military personnel who were captured 
(POWs) and those missing in action (MIAs). He succeeded in keeping 
the war going* and some 16*000 more U.S. soldiers and untold numbers 
of Vietnamese died in the further fighting in the purported interest of 
missing POWs. But although there has never been any credible evidence 
that a single POW was hidden by the North Vietnamese* this claim be¬ 
came an article of faith and cult that dominated U.S. policy toward Viet¬ 
nam for many years. 82 

The myth also became the basis of popular culture accounts in movies 
such as The Deer Hunter , Uncommon Valor * DO. W: The Escape * and 
Missing in Action * in which Rambo-like heroes slaughter evil Vietnamese 
as they save our betrayed and tormented POWs. These movies turned 
history on its head. As Vietnam war historian H. Bruce Franklin points 
out* “America's vision of the war was being transformed. The actual 
photographs and TV footage of massacred villagers* napalmed children* 
Vietnamese prisoners being tortured and murdered* wounded GFs 
screaming in agony* and body bags being loaded by the dozen for ship¬ 
ment back home were being replaced by simulated images of American 
POWs in the savage hands of Asian communists ” 83 The powerful cul¬ 
tural myth of abused POWs as the central feature of the Vietnam war not 
only allowed the war to be extended; it helped justify the U.S. failure to 
aid its victim in accord with end-of-war promises and it provided the 
basis for an eighteen-year economic war against the victim country. It 
also functioned as a potent agent of militarization and force weakening 
the “Vietnam syndrome ”
