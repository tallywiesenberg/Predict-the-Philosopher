The U.S. mass 
media, while briefly noting the Salvadoran stonewalling, failed to call 
attention to the equally important lies and suppressions of their own 
government As we have pointed out, both the Carter and Reagan 
administrations put protection of its client above the quest for justice 
for four U.S. citizens murdered by agents of that government.The U.S. 
government’s stonewalling to protect its client took many forms.One 
was an active collaboration in the Salvadoran cover-up.Former Na¬ 
tional Guard sergeant Dagoberto Martinez was allowed to emigrate to 
the United States in December 1980, and although a subsequent inter¬ 
view by the FBI indicated that Martinez admitted knowledge of the 
perpetrators of the crime and a failure to report that information—in 
violation of Salvadoran law—no action was taken against him.U.S. 
officials also reiterated that there was no reason to believe that higher- 
level officials knew about the crime or participated in it, when they had 
clear knowledge of a cover-up and a refusal to investigate.
