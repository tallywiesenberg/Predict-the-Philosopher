67 The State 
Department also regularly lied about the thoroughness of the investiga¬ 
tion.Ambassador Hinton stated in public that national guardsman 
Perez Nieto “was thoroughly interrogated and repeatedly denied that 
anyone superior to him had ordered him to watch the women.” A State 
Department cable, however, describes Nieto’s testimony as “incom¬ 
plete, evasive, and uncooperative.” 68 

A second form of official U.S. participation in the cover-up was a 
refusal to make public information on the Salvadoran investigation and 
evidence uncovered by the United States itself.The Rogers report was 
released belatedly, in a version that edited out the original report’s 
statement about the sad state of the Salvadoran system of justice.In 
response to a growing chorus of criticism of the delays, Judge Harold 
R. Tyler was appointed by the U.S. government to carry out a further 
investigation.His report was kept under wraps for a long time, again 
apparently because it had some serious criticism of the Salvadoran 
judicial process that would have interfered with Reagan administration 
plans to claim progress every time such certification was required.
