As Ana Carrigan put 
it: 

Security in the courtroom was in the hands of a special Judicial 
Protection Unit, formed and trained in Glencoe, Alabama; the 
jurors were driven to the courtroom in the morning and returned 
to their homes after the verdict in bullet-proof American embassy 
vehicles; meals and camp beds were provided by the embassy so 
that if necessary the jurors and the staff of the court could sleep 
overnight within the protection of the guarded courthouse; and 
when the electricity failed, just as the prosecution began to make 
its presentation, light was restored by means of hurricane lamps 
delivered by embassy staff.71 

The stakes were U.S. dollars.Congress had frozen $194 million pend¬ 
ing the favorable outcome of the case.Within twenty-four hours of the 
decision, the State Department, announcing that justice had been done, 
released the money to the charge of Minister of Defense Vides Casa¬ 
nova, who had been head of the National Guard on December 4,1980, 
when the murders took place, whose first cousin, according to Colonel 
Santivanez, had given the direct order to kill, and who had so effectively 
protected his cousin and stalled the prosecution of underlings for three- 
and-a-half years.In conformity with the predictions of a propaganda model, the mass 
media failed entirely to capture the quality of this scene—the American 
omnipresence, the courtroom security, the failure of the defense to 
press the responsibility of the higher authorities, the role of Vides 
Casanova, the literal money transaction for justice in this single case y 
which dragged on for three-and-a-half years.
