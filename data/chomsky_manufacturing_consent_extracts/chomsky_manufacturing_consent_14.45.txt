From 1954 to the present day, neither reform nor democracy, let 
alone radical change, has been possible in Guatemala, The main reason 
for this is that the forces into whose hands the United States delivered 
that country in 1954 “bitterly opposed any change that might affect, 
however slightly, their entrenched position,” 76 and they had learned 
from the 1945-54 lesson that democracy moves inexorably toward re¬ 
form and threats to privilege in a system of extreme inequality.The 
very brief interludes of tentative openness after 1954 witnessed the 
quick emergence of protective organizations of urban workers and the 
peasantry, strikes, and reformist and radical parties and organizations.As Piero Gleijeses puts it, “in the last months of the Arana period 
[1970-74], the repression had acquired a more selective character, and 
on repeated occasions Laugerud [Arana's successor, 1974-78] refrained 
from ‘settling' strikes by force*” 77 But the feebleness of the reforms and 
the awakened hopes and pressures forced a further choice; and “given 
the nature of the regime,” the wave of terror that followed “was the 
only logical choice” for the Guatemalan ruling class.78 

Another reason for the failures of both reform and democracy has 
been ongoing U.S, influence.The U.S. establishment found the plural¬ 
ism and democracy of the years 1945-54 intolerable, and it eventually 
ended that experiment.
