The special role of the army in the counterinsurgency state gradually 
elevated its status and power, and evenrually gave it the institutional 
capacity to rule Guatemala.As in many U.S. client states, the military 
used its power to carve out economic opportunities and to steal, directly 
or indirectly, 80 The terrorism, thievery, and autonomy of the Guatema¬ 
lan military reached a temporary peak—later surpassed by Rios 
Montt—during the reign of Lucas Garcia (1978-82), This overlapped 
the brief interlude of the Carter human-rights policy, during which 
there was open criticism of the Guatemalan government and a brief and 
partial cutoff of arms supply from the United States under congressio¬ 
nal pressure.31 Even during the Carter years, however, relations with 
Guatemala were not hostile—it was as if a child in the family were 
naughty and briefly put in the comer.Part of the reason for the willing¬ 
ness of the Carter government to provide no new arms supplies was that 
the bad boy was in no danger.In El Salvador in 1980, by contrast, where 
the Carter administration saw the possibility of a left-wing victory, 
support was quickly forthcoming to a right-wing terror regime.
