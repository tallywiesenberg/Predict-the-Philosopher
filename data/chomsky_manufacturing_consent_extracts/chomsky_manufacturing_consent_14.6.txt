During the Reagan years, the number of civilians murdered in 
Guatemala ran into the tens of thousands, and disappearances and 
mutilated bodies were a daily occurrence.82 Studies by Amnesty Inter¬

ble to determine who was doing all the killing in Guatemala, and 
disappearances were attributed to the “right” and the “left,” but not 
to the government.
