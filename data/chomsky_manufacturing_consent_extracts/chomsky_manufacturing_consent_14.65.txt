Amnesty International, by contrast, in February 
1981, gave detailed evidence that the thousands of murders were almost 
entirely governmental in origin, including those of the death squads, 
whose victims were targeted in an annex of Guatemala’s national palace 
under the direct supervision of President Lucas Garcia, 87 

With the overthrow of Lucas Garcia, suddenly, as if by magic, the 
Reagan administration line altered, and Stephen Bosworth “could not 
emphasize strongly enough the favorable contrast between the current 
human rights situation in Guatemala and the situation last December* 
..Melvyn Levitsky, deputy assistant secretary of state for human 
rights, told another congressional committee that “the United States 
cannot easily sustain a relationship with a government which engages 
in violence against its own people,” as with the Lucas Garcia regime.88 

When Lucas Garcia was in power, Bosworth found it a caring regime 
that protected the innocent, and the State Department couldn’t deter¬ 
mine that the government was doing any killing.With Lucas Garcia 
ousted, the State Department discovered that he was an indiscriminate 
murderer and assumed a high moral tone about his behavior.
