In that context, the serial apologetics, the lies defending 
each murderer, and the mind-boggling hypocrisy will hardly be news¬ 
worthy.Given the U,S.role in originating and sustaining the Guatemalan 
counterinsurgency state, and the fact that that state is dedicated to 
blocking the growth of popular organizations (i.e., “anti-Communist” 
in Orwellian rhetoric) and has a strong U.S. business presence, a propa¬ 
ganda model would anticipate a lack of media interest in its “unworthy” 
victims and an evasion of the U.S. role in its evolution and practices.We would expect reports on Guatemala put out by Amnesty Interna¬ 
tional and other human-rights groups to be downplayed or ignored, 
despite their spectacular data and horrifying stories.This is a strong test 
of the model, as the number of civilians murdered between 1978 and 
1985 may have approached 100,000, with a style of killing reminiscent 
of Pol Pot.
