As AI pointed out in 1981: 

The bodies of the victims have been found piled up in ravines, 
dumped at roadsides or buried in mass graves.Thousands bore the 
scars of torture, and death had come to most by strangling with 
a garrotte, by being suffocated in rubber hoods or by being shot 
in the head, 90 

The expectations of a propaganda model are fully realized in this case.Referring to our table 2-1 comparison of media treatment of twenty- 
three religious victims in Guatemala with the coverage accorded Fopie- 
luszko, only four of the twenty-three were ever mentioned by name in 
our media sample, and the twenty-three taken together had approxiÂ¬ 
mately one-twentieth of the space in the New York Times that the 
newspaper of record gave to Popieluszko.In the case ^f the murder in 
Guatemala of the American priest Rev.Stanley Rothcr, the New York 
Times reported on August 5,1981, in a tiny back-page article, that three 
men had been arrested for questioning in the shooting.
