(Maxwell Taylor* Aug. 10, 1964), and who warned about “Saigon and 
Vientiane hanky panky with Reds 5 * (John McNaughton, October 
1964)—that is, moves toward a political settlement—in accordance with 
the NLF program as described by intelligence: “to seek victory through 
a "neutralist coalition 1 rather than by force of arms/ 5104 When the 
United States extended the war in early 1965 to try to salvage its 
position in the South, the media continued to offer total support, in 
accordance with “the guiding principle of American foreign policy 
since 1945” as outlined by the distinguished liberal commentator of the 
New York Times James Reston, 

that no state shall use military force or the threat of military force 
to achieve its political objectives. And the companion of this 
principle has been that the United States would use its influence 
and its power, when necessary and where it could be effective, 
against any state that defied this principle, 

which was “at stake in Vietnam,* 5 where “the United States is now 
challenging the Communist effort to seek power by the more cunning 
technique of military subversion. 55105 

In the Orwellian world of American journalism, the attempt to seek 
a political settlement by peaceful means is the use of “military force, 55 
and the use of military force by the United States to block a political 
settlement is a noble action in defense of the “guiding principle 55 that 
the use of military force is illegitimate. 

The United States then proceeded to fight a long and brutal war to 
try to achieve its objectives in Vietnam, demolishing much of Indo¬ 
china in the process and leaving a legacy that may never be overcome. 
Finally, m January 1973, the United States formally accepted a peace 
treaty that was virtually identical with the Vietnamese consensus it 
overturned by violence in 1964, except that by that time, the indige¬ 
nous NLF had been effectively demolished and little remained in In¬ 
dochina outside of North Vietnam, laying the basis for North 
Vietnamese domination of Indochina, exactly as had been predicted, 
long before, by “the wild men in the wings. 55 The media bear a major 
responsibility for these tragic events, coverage of the Tonkin Gulf 
incident with its congressional “blank check 55 for further aggression 
serving as a notable example,
