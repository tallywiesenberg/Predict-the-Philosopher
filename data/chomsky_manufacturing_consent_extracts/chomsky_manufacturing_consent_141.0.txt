(Maxwell Taylor* Aug. 10, 1964), and who warned about “Saigon and 
Vientiane hanky panky with Reds 5 * (John McNaughton, October 
1964)—that is, moves toward a political settlement—in accordance with 
the NLF program as described by intelligence: “to seek victory through 
a "neutralist coalition 1 rather than by force of arms/ 5104 When the 
United States extended the war in early 1965 to try to salvage its 
position in the South, the media continued to offer total support, in 
accordance with “the guiding principle of American foreign policy 
since 1945” as outlined by the distinguished liberal commentator of the 
New York Times James Reston, 

that no state shall use military force or the threat of military force 
to achieve its political objectives. And the companion of this 
principle has been that the United States would use its influence 
and its power, when necessary and where it could be effective, 
against any state that defied this principle, 

which was “at stake in Vietnam,* 5 where “the United States is now 
challenging the Communist effort to seek power by the more cunning 
technique of military subversion. 55105 

In the Orwellian world of American journalism, the attempt to seek 
a political settlement by peaceful means is the use of “military force, 55 
and the use of military force by the United States to block a political 
settlement is a noble action in defense of the “guiding principle 55 that 
the use of military force is illegitimate. 

The United States then proceeded to fight a long and brutal war to 
try to achieve its objectives in Vietnam, demolishing much of Indo¬ 
china in the process and leaving a legacy that may never be overcome. 
Finally, m January 1973, the United States formally accepted a peace 
treaty that was virtually identical with the Vietnamese consensus it 
overturned by violence in 1964, except that by that time, the indige¬ 
nous NLF had been effectively demolished and little remained in In¬ 
dochina outside of North Vietnam, laying the basis for North 
Vietnamese domination of Indochina, exactly as had been predicted, 
long before, by “the wild men in the wings. 55 The media bear a major 
responsibility for these tragic events, coverage of the Tonkin Gulf 
incident with its congressional “blank check 55 for further aggression 
serving as a notable example,

5*5.2. The Tet offensive 

Media coverage of the Tet offensive has been the centerpiece of the 
critique of the media for “losing the war” by their incompetent report¬ 
ing and their anti-government bias reflecting their passion for confront¬ 
ing authority. The authoritative “proof” of this contention was 
provided in the two-volume Freedom House study by Peter Braestrup* 
Conducted over a six-year period with a wide range of distinguished 
participants and consultants* and support acknowledged from some two 
dozen corporations and labor unions, this study was hailed as a “monu¬ 
mental” work by Don Oberdorfer in a Washington Post magazine cover 
story on the tenth anniversary of the offensive, with the title: “Tet: The 
Turning Point: How a *Big Event 5 on Television Can Change Our 
Minds, 15 Professor John P* Roche, of the Fletcher School of Law and 
Diplomacy of Tufts University, “intellectual-in-residence” for the 
Johnson administration, described the Freedom House study as “one 
of the major pieces of investigative reporting and first-rate scholarship 
of the past quarter century, 51 a “meticulous case-study of media incom¬ 
petence, if not malevolence*” In a relatively critical discussion in the 
Times 's Sunday book review, Edwin Diamond praises this “painstak¬ 
ingly thorough study of how the Vietnam war was presented to the 
American public by its leading image makers,” a “highfalutin 5 epis¬ 
temological quest” by a “conscientious ... reporter-analyst” that raises 
profound questions about “how do we know what we know, 55 revealing 
“the biases introduced by standard journalistic assumptions and organi¬ 
zational practices 51 that contributed to undermining the U.S. position 
in Vietnam among the general public and Congress. Similarly, Charles 
Mohr reports that in a conference of “aging hawks and doves” on the 
tenth anniversary of the Tet offensive at the University of North Caro¬ 
lina, “Journalism came in for some strong criticism and only a rather 
muted defense* 55 The criticism was by Braestrup, who “expounded 
gently the theme of his recent book,” Big Story, and the hawks in 
attendance, “while some of the reporters there demurred only softly. 
The study is regularly cited by historians, without qualification, as the 
standard work on media reporting of the Tet offensive, “in some re¬ 
spects as important as the battle itself, 55 here “analysed in depth” 
(R. B. Smith). 106 

Oberdorfer too accepts the conclusions of the study as proven: it was 
the “ *Big Event 5 on television 55 that changed our minds about the war* 
The only commentary he cites, even obliquely, accepts this judgment 
(Roche and others unnamed). Within the mainstream more generally, 
it is assumed with little question that this remarkable scholarly contri-

bution made its case, though one may debate whether it revealed “ma¬ 
levolence” or deeper problems of “standard journalistic assumptions 
and organizational practices,” reflecting perhaps the “adversarial 
stance” of the media with regard to established power.
