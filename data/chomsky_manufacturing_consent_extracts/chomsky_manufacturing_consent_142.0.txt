Braestrup claims to have shown that the reporting of the Tet offen¬ 
sive is “an extreme case” of the “unsatisfactory” performance of the 
media: “Rarely has contemporary crisis-journalism turned out, in retro¬ 
spect, to have veered so widely from reality” by presenting “a portrait 
of defeat for the allies”—“allies” being the term regularly used to refer 
to the U.S. invaders, the local forces they organized, and the largely 
mercenary forces they introduced to support U.S. military operations 
in Indochina, and a term chosen to exploit the favorable connotations 
provided by World War II, when “the allies” fought “the Axis.” “To 
have portrayed such a setback for one side [them] as a defeat for the 
other [us]—in a major crisis abroad—cannot be counted as a triumph 
for American journalism,” which “shouted that the patient was dying, 
then weeks later began to whisper that he somehow seemed to be 
recovering—whispers apparently not heard amid the clamorous domes¬ 
tic reaction to the initial shouts,” with television the worst offender. 
The whispers began “about late February,” he asserts. These journalis¬ 
tic failures, Braestrup concludes, reflect “the more volatile journalistic 
style—spurred by managerial exhortation or complaisance—that has 
become so popular since the late 1960s,” accompanied with “an often 
mindless readiness to seek out conflict, to believe the worst of the 
government or of authority in general, and on that basis to divide up 
the actors on any issue into the ‘good’ and the ‘bad.’ ” The “bad actors” 
include the U.S. forces in Vietnam, the “military-industrial complex,” 
and the CIA, among others, while “the good” in the eyes of the media 
are presumably the Communists, who, Braestrup argues sardonically 
throughout, were consistently overpraised and protected. The prospect, 
he foresees, “is for a continuation of the current volatile styles, always 
with the dark possibility that, if the managers do not themselves take 
action, then outsiders—the courts, the Federal Communications Com¬ 
mission, or Congress—will seek to apply remedies of their own,” a 
proposal taken up in Roche’s call for a congressional inquiry and the 
subsequent warnings of the Trilateral Commission, cited earlier (Big 
Story, I, 7°5ff-) 

The Braestrup-Freedom House thesis has two essential components: 
(1) coverage of the Tet offensive illustrates media incompetence and 
their “adversarial stance’’; (2) by their portrayal of an American victory 
as a defeat, the media bear responsibility for the loss of American 
resolve and the subsequent American defeat in Vietnam* It is the sec-

ond component of the thesis that carries the dramatic impact* and that 
has permitted it to set much of the agenda for subsequent discussion 
of the fourth estate and the dangers that its new-found power and
