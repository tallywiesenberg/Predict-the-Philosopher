reference to “straw man journalism/* “CBS exclusives” and the like* 
referring to alleged misdeeds of the media, is misplaced; case by case, 
we find, instead, “Freedom House exclusives.’* 

Before proceeding to details, we should take careful note of the 
background assumptions that guide this inquiry. As we noted, for Bra- 
estrup and Freedom House, the “allies” are the United States, the 
South Vietnamese client government, and the various South Korean, 
Thai, Australian, Chinese Nationalist, and other forces (largely merce¬ 
nary) mobilized by the United States* The “South Vietnamese 51 include 
our client government and the armed forces organized, supplied, 
trained, and directed by the United States, but exclude the indigenous 
NLF and its supporters, although the U,S. government never had the 
slightest doubt, and its specialists do not hesitate to concede, that the 
client regime had little support while its opponents in South Vietnam 
constituted so powerful a political force that any peaceful settlement 
was unthinkable. That the United States has a right to conduct military 
operations in South Vietnam to uproot the NLF and destroy the peas¬ 
ant society in which it was based, that its goals are democracy and 
self-determination, and that its forces “protect” and “bring security” 
to South Vietnamese peasants are principles taken for granted in the 
Braestrup-Freedom House version, where no patriotic assumption or 
cliche is ever challenged—or even noticed, so deeply rooted are these 
doctrines. Correspondingly, the fact that the media coverage surveyed 
is framed entirely within these patriotic premises passes unnoticed. The 
Freedom House inquiry cannot perceive fundamental bias favorable to 
the state because all of the premises of state doctrine are taken as given. 
There is “mindlessness” here, as Braestrup observes, although it is not 
quite what he perceives; rather, we find that Braestrup “mindlessly” 
adopts what we referred to in chapter 3 as a patriotic agenda, even more 
so than the media he condemns* And as we described in chapter 1, the 
function of such “flak machines” as Freedom House is to ensure that 
the press stays within the bounds of this patriotic agenda. 

The Tet offensive of January 1968 began on January 21 with a siege 
by North Vietnamese (NVA) regulars of a U.S, military base at Khe 
Sanh, near the 17th parallel* It was soon apparent that the purpose was 
to draw U.S. forces away from populated centers, and the siege suc¬ 
ceeded in this aim, as General Westmoreland rushed combat forces to 
the northern areas. On January 31, all major cities and thirty-six of 
forty-four provincial capitals, along with numerous other towns, came
