Johnson and his advisers were shocked by the suddenness and 
magnitude of the offensive . , . and intelligence estimates were 

much more pessimistic than Westmoreland-An “air of gloom” 

hung over White House discussions, [General Maxwell] Taylor 
later observed, and [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] Gen¬ 
eral [Earle] Wheeler likened the mood to that following the first 
Battle of Bull Run. 112 

General Wheeler reported that "to a large extent the VC now control 
the countryside,” the situation being particularly bad in the Mekong 
Delta, and the Pentagon systems-analysis group concluded that “our 
control of the countryside and the defense of the urban areas is now 
essentially at pre-August 1965 levels,” when the U.S, war was being lost, 
according to General Westmoreland, A U.S. government military-his¬ 
torical summary of the offensive in the Mekong Delta, completed in 
April 1968, concluded that “The Tet offensive in IV Corps had a 
devastating effect on the Revolutionary Development [pacification] 
Program,” As we shall see, these internal assessments are considerably 
more “pessimistic” than those of the media that are denounced for the 
crime of excessive pessimism by Freedom House standards. 

We might incidentally note that in IV Corps (including the Mekong 
Delta), there were “no regular North Vietnam units” according to 
Defense Secretary McNamara; the Freedom House study states that 
“In the southernmost Delta, it was an ARVN-Vietcong [actually, U.S,- 
Vietcong] guerrilla struggle,” and more generally, Hanoi “had yet to 
commit sizable (multi-division) forces in sustained, concerted attacks” 
anywhere in South Vietnam (I, 24). 113 These assessments are what 
motivated the mass-slaughter campaign carried out in the rural areas 
of the delta and elsewhere in the post-Tet accelerated pacification 
campaign, discussed earlier. 

Even before the Tet offensive. Defense Secretary McNamara had 
privately concluded that military victory was an unreasonable objective 
and that the course of the war should be changed- Clark Clifford, who 
was brought in to replace him after Tet, had long shared such doubts, 
and they were reinforced by the evidence available to him and by the 
conclusions of the “Wise Men” whom Johnson called in to assess the 
situation. 114 Dean Acheson, who headed this group of longtime hawks 
drawn from business and political elites, agreed with Clifford's pessi¬ 
mism and “advised Johnson to scale down ground operations, reduce
