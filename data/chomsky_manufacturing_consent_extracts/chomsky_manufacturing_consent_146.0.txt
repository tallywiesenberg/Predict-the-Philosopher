220 MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


gloomy despair and convinced U.S. elites that there was no realistic 
hope of a military victory in Vietnam at a cost acceptable to the United 
States, but also changed the character of media reporting and commen¬ 
tary, which mirrored the changes in elite opinion. On the ground, 
American correspondents were able to witness the war at first hand, 
gaining a view rather different from the sanitized and edited version 
presented under the control of the American military command. Media 
commentary at home reflected elite opinion in recognizing that the 
optimistic forecasts that had been relayed from Washington with little 
skepticism were inaccurate, and that a long and bitter war lay ahead. 
But on-the-scene reporting and domestic commentary never veered 
from the framework of the state propaganda system. In reporting the 
fighting in Ben Tre and My Tho in the Delta, for example, the press 
observed that American infantry participated while the towns were 
blasted by American bombers, helicopter gunships, navy patrol boats, 
and artillery to root out the Viet Cong—that is, the South Vietnamese 
guerrillas who “were probably living with the people,*’ according to an 
American officer quoted by Bernard Weinraub. Nonetheless, the news 
reports speak of the perceived need to “blast the city" with jets and 
helicopter gunships, particularly the poorer and most crowded sections, 
“to save other sections of the city and the lives of thousands of peo¬ 
ple ..(Lee Lescaze)—people whose lives were threatened not by the 
southern NLF guerrillas living among them but by the U.S. forces 
“defending" them from the NLF. Because of Tet, Weinraub explains, 
“the protection of Ben Tre was limited," and it was necessary to bring 
in troops from the U.S. Ninth Infantry Division by helicopter, and to 
carry out “bombing raids and fire by helicopter gunships and artillery" 
to “protect" Ben Tre, which “has long been a stronghold of the Viet¬ 
cong” and is “sometimes considered a Vietcong rest and recreation 
area," while surrounding hamlets “thought to be controlled by the 
Vietcong have been razed by allied bombing and artillery attacks and 
fire from armed helicopters." In Ben Tre itself, “the market place is 
rubble and near the gutted homes nearby women in shawls sit in the 
noon heat and mourn with loud groans," while “My Tho still smells of 
death,” with half the homes destroyed—thanks ro the effective “protec¬ 
tion" the population received from their American defenders, 122 
Throughout, it is taken for granted that the forces armed, trained, 
and supplied by the only foreign element in the delta are “the South 
Vietnamese," not the South Vietnamese guerrillas living among the 
population in their “Vietcong strongholds," from whom the United 
States is “protecting” the population by ferocious bombardment of 
civilian areas.
