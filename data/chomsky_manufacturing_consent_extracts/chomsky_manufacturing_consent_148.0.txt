the unfairness and anti-American bias of the media; comment seems 
superfluous* 

While the 1 LS. media rarely strayed from the framework of the state 
propaganda system, others were unconstrained by these limits: for ex¬ 
ample, the Le Monde correspondents cited; or British photo-journalist 
Philip Jones Griffiths, who concluded from his observations on the 
scene that the thousands of civilian victims of the reconquest of Hue 
“were killed by the most hysterical use of American firepower ever 
seen,” and then designated “as the victims of a Communist massa¬ 
cre*” 132 

To comprehend fully the nature of the Freedom House charges, we 
may imagine how the inquiry urged by John Roche might proceed. Who 
else is implicated in the terrible misdeeds that Freedom House per¬ 
ceives? General Westmoreland and the U,S* command in Saigon must 
surely be placed on the docket because of their estimates of early VC 
successes (see appendix 3 for further examples), along with William 
Bundy, assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs, given his 
extreme pessimism. He thought that the Tet offensive was “shattering 
to the South, especially in the area of pacification,” concluding for a 
time that “the South Vietnamese were through,” “they've had it”— 
where “South Vietnamese” excludes the South Vietnamese defending 
their country from a ILS. invasion, as usual* These conclusions, which 
do conform to the Freedom House parody of the media, were based not 
on the press but on “reports from people in the field out in Vietnam,” 
so presumably they too are implicated ( 1 ,625)- Similarly, Lyndon John¬ 
son was guilty, since he seemed “to some degree 'psychologically de¬ 
feated* by the threat to Khe Sanh and the onslaught on the cities of 
Vietnam,” so Braestrup concludes (I, 626, 630)* The same is true of 
Johnson's civilian advisers, given the “air of gloom” among them and 
the “Battle of Bull Run” mood, and the author of the official ILS. 
government military-historical summary, cited earlier; and Dean Ache- 
son and other “Wise Men” who urged a shift of course because of the 
same “undue pessimism” for which the media are condemned by Free¬ 
dom House. Also Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, who reported that the 
offensive had “disrupted the pacification effort for the time being,” and 
the pacification adviser who reported that in his “showcase” area, 
“pacification does not exist*' (II, 184-86)* 

Further candidates for investigation appear in the Pentagon Papers — 
for example. General Wheeler, who summarized the situation in the 
following terms to the president on February 27, just as Walter Cron- 
kite was speculating about “stalemate,** arousing Freedom House ire:
