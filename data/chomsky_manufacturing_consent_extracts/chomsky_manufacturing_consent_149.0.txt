Wheeler-Westmoreland request for additional troops. He was, Braest- 
rup says, the anonymous author of the Pentagon Papers section on this 
material* and here he described as “a startlingly accurate account” a 
New York Times article by Neil Sheehan and Hedrick Smith which, 
Braestrup claims, was a major example of “distorted and incomplete’* 
reporting (I, 581, 613). The authors of the “Epilogue” to the Pentagon 
Papers must also be included in the indictment, given their pessimistic 
post-Tet assessment of “the price for military victory” and the “illu¬ 
sory” nature of claimed progress- 

The category of people who were not threatening “free institutions” 
by the standards of Freedom House is small indeed, a fact that some 
may find suggestive. 

It is significant that the major criticism of the media in the Freedom 
House study is that they were too “pessimistic,” Strikingly absent is the 
obvious standard of comparison: the internal repons from the field and 
analysis by intelligence and official Washington—which were, if any¬ 
thing, even more pessimistic. The logic of the Freedom House brief 
against the media is highly revealing. In their view, the media in a free 
society must not only accept without question the principles of the state 
doctrinal system, as the media did throughout (a fact that Freedom 
House never addresses, and apparently cannot perceive), but must do 
so with a degree of enthusiasm and optimism that exceeds that of ILS. 
intelligence, the military command, Johnson’s “Wise Men,” and other 
leading figures in the military, political, and corporate world who draw 
their information from a full range of government sources. It is an 
interesting conception of a “free society-” 

We might ask how the Freedom House conception of a free press in 
a free society would be applied by Soviet commissars, let us say, to the 
case of the mass circulation weekly Ogonyok, which published a series 
of long articles that presented a “bleak picture” of the war in Afghanis¬ 
tan, depicting it “in stark terms,” speaking of “poor morale and deser¬ 
tion” among Afghan units and “tough fighting between elite Soviet 
troops and Afghan guerrillas,” and implying that “large areas of Afg¬ 
hanistan are under guerrilla control.” The articles also give “a broad 
hint that drug use is common among Russian troops in Afghanistan,” 
and they include extracts from a helicopter pilot’s journal describing 
“the sight and smell of colleagues’ charred bodies” and implying that 
“helicopter losses are high” after the receipt of sophisticated Western 
weaponry by the guerrillas, terrorists who finance themselves by pro¬ 
ducing drugs for the international market (charges verified by Western 
observers, incidentally). But it would be inhumane for the USSR simply 
to withdraw without guarantees for the population, because “a Soviet

withdrawal would lead to nationwide internecine warfare, 5 * as Afghans 
who are quoted anticipate* The article does not simply mimic standard 
U*S* media fare* as these excerpts indicate* Thus it describes an attack 
on Soviet villages by Afghan guerrillas; one can imagine the U*S* reac¬ 
tion had there been a Viet Cong attack on villages in Texas, But by 
Freedom House standards, it is plain that the editors merit severe 
censure for their “adversarial stance, 5 * “pessimism, 55 and “volatile 
styles, 5 * “always with the dark possibility that, if the managers do not 
themselves take action, then outsiders [in the government] will seek to 
apply remedies of their own” 134 And, in fact, in Januaiy 1988, General 
Dimitri T, Yakov, the Soviet defense minister, applied Freedom House 
and Braestrup principles to the “adversarial 55 Soviet press, sharply 
criticizing articles in Ogonyok and Literatumaya Gazeta for reporting 
on the Afghan war in ways that undermined public confidence in the 
Soviet army and played into the hands of the West* 135 

In the light of the evidence presented in the Freedom House study, 
and of much that is ignored, the following conclusions seem reasonable. 
During the Tet offensive and its aftermath, media performance was 
creditable, sometimes very highly so, in a narrow sense* More broadly, 
this reporting was highly deceptive in that it was framed within the 
unchallenged and unrecognized doctrines of the state propaganda sys¬ 
tem, which impose a severe distortion. Media reports compare favora¬ 
bly in accuracy with those available to official Washington at the highest 
level from internal sources, although they were regularly less alarmist, 
perhaps because the media tended to give credence to official state¬ 
ments and were unaware of the internal assessments. The repons from 
the scene led media commentators to draw approximately the same 
conclusions as Johnson*s high-level advisers* The manner in which the 
media covered the events had little effect on public opinion, except 
perhaps to enhance its aggressiveness and, of course, to instill ever more 
deeply the basic and unexamined tenets of the propaganda system* 
As we shall see in appendix 3, a closer examination establishes these 
conclusions still more firmly, while demonstrating further the utter 
incompetence—to use the kindest term—of the Freedom House study 
that has been so influential in the subsequent period* 

We have now addressed the argument presented by critics of the 
media for its alleged “adversarial stance 55 on their own chosen grounds, 
the grounds that they select as the strongest for their case. The propa¬ 
ganda model is once again confirmed, thus meeting the most severe test 
that can be posed* The model is also vindicated by the manner in which 
Freedom House fulfills its function as a flak machine, attempting to 
bully the media into a still more thoroughgoing conformity with the
