rup says, the anonymous author of the Pentagon Papers section on this 
material* and here he described as “a startlingly accurate account” a 
New York Times article by Neil Sheehan and Hedrick Smith which, 
Braestrup claims, was a major example of “distorted and incomplete’* 
reporting (I, 581, 613). The authors of the “Epilogue” to the Pentagon 
Papers must also be included in the indictment, given their pessimistic 
post-Tet assessment of “the price for military victory” and the “illu¬ 
sory” nature of claimed progress- 

The category of people who were not threatening “free institutions” 
by the standards of Freedom House is small indeed, a fact that some 
may find suggestive. 

It is significant that the major criticism of the media in the Freedom 
House study is that they were too “pessimistic,” Strikingly absent is the 
obvious standard of comparison: the internal repons from the field and 
analysis by intelligence and official Washington—which were, if any¬ 
thing, even more pessimistic. The logic of the Freedom House brief 
against the media is highly revealing. In their view, the media in a free 
society must not only accept without question the principles of the state 
doctrinal system, as the media did throughout (a fact that Freedom 
House never addresses, and apparently cannot perceive), but must do 
so with a degree of enthusiasm and optimism that exceeds that of ILS. 
intelligence, the military command, Johnson’s “Wise Men,” and other 
leading figures in the military, political, and corporate world who draw 
their information from a full range of government sources. It is an 
interesting conception of a “free society-” 

We might ask how the Freedom House conception of a free press in 
a free society would be applied by Soviet commissars, let us say, to the 
case of the mass circulation weekly Ogonyok, which published a series 
of long articles that presented a “bleak picture” of the war in Afghanis¬ 
tan, depicting it “in stark terms,” speaking of “poor morale and deser¬ 
tion” among Afghan units and “tough fighting between elite Soviet 
troops and Afghan guerrillas,” and implying that “large areas of Afg¬ 
hanistan are under guerrilla control.” The articles also give “a broad 
hint that drug use is common among Russian troops in Afghanistan,” 
and they include extracts from a helicopter pilot’s journal describing 
“the sight and smell of colleagues’ charred bodies” and implying that 
“helicopter losses are high” after the receipt of sophisticated Western 
weaponry by the guerrillas, terrorists who finance themselves by pro¬ 
ducing drugs for the international market (charges verified by Western 
observers, incidentally). But it would be inhumane for the USSR simply 
to withdraw without guarantees for the population, because “a Soviet
