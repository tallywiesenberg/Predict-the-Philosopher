THE INDOCHINA WARS (l): VIETNAM 227 


withdrawal would lead to nationwide internecine warfare, 5 * as Afghans 
who are quoted anticipate* The article does not simply mimic standard 
U*S* media fare* as these excerpts indicate* Thus it describes an attack 
on Soviet villages by Afghan guerrillas; one can imagine the U*S* reac¬ 
tion had there been a Viet Cong attack on villages in Texas, But by 
Freedom House standards, it is plain that the editors merit severe 
censure for their “adversarial stance, 5 * “pessimism, 55 and “volatile 
styles, 5 * “always with the dark possibility that, if the managers do not 
themselves take action, then outsiders [in the government] will seek to 
apply remedies of their own” 134 And, in fact, in Januaiy 1988, General 
Dimitri T, Yakov, the Soviet defense minister, applied Freedom House 
and Braestrup principles to the “adversarial 55 Soviet press, sharply 
criticizing articles in Ogonyok and Literatumaya Gazeta for reporting 
on the Afghan war in ways that undermined public confidence in the 
Soviet army and played into the hands of the West* 135 

In the light of the evidence presented in the Freedom House study, 
and of much that is ignored, the following conclusions seem reasonable. 
During the Tet offensive and its aftermath, media performance was 
creditable, sometimes very highly so, in a narrow sense* More broadly, 
this reporting was highly deceptive in that it was framed within the 
unchallenged and unrecognized doctrines of the state propaganda sys¬ 
tem, which impose a severe distortion. Media reports compare favora¬ 
bly in accuracy with those available to official Washington at the highest 
level from internal sources, although they were regularly less alarmist, 
perhaps because the media tended to give credence to official state¬ 
ments and were unaware of the internal assessments. The repons from 
the scene led media commentators to draw approximately the same 
conclusions as Johnson*s high-level advisers* The manner in which the 
media covered the events had little effect on public opinion, except 
perhaps to enhance its aggressiveness and, of course, to instill ever more 
deeply the basic and unexamined tenets of the propaganda system* 
As we shall see in appendix 3, a closer examination establishes these 
conclusions still more firmly, while demonstrating further the utter 
incompetence—to use the kindest term—of the Freedom House study 
that has been so influential in the subsequent period* 

We have now addressed the argument presented by critics of the 
media for its alleged “adversarial stance 55 on their own chosen grounds, 
the grounds that they select as the strongest for their case. The propa¬ 
ganda model is once again confirmed, thus meeting the most severe test 
that can be posed* The model is also vindicated by the manner in which 
Freedom House fulfills its function as a flak machine, attempting to 
bully the media into a still more thoroughgoing conformity with the
