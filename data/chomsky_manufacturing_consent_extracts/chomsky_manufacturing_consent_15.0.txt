Time does, in most unusual fashion, point out that 
the government was responsible for the “overwhelming majority’ 5 of the 
killings, and even more exceptionally, it cites Amnesty InternationaPs 
evidence that the paramilitary death squads are an arm of the govern¬ 
ment.But the article fails to give illustrations of the scope and quality 
of the murders, and retreats, as noted, to the civil-war rationale.Even 
more compromising is its framing of the U.S. policy debate.According 
to Time ?“Yet Guatemala confronts the Reagan administration with one 
of its toughest foreign policy challenges: on one hand, the country is 
viewed as a victim of Cuban-sponsored insurgency, needing U.S. sup¬ 
port; on the other, the government obviously violates human rights/* 
The dichotomy offered by Time is a bit uneven: the Cuban sponsorship 
is a Cold War ploy for which no evidence has ever been given, but it 
provides a convenient propaganda framework that is regularly deployed 
by the State Department to divert attention from its support of mass 
murderers.
