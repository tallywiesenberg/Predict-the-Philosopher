The British-based Mines Advisory Group (MAG) has been trying to 
remove the lethal objects* but the British press reports that the United 




introduction XXXV11 


States is “conspicuously missing from the handful of western organiza¬ 
tions that have followed MAG,” though it has finally agreed to train some 
Laotian civilians. 88 The British press also reports, with some annoyance, 
that the United States has refused to provide MAG specialists with “ren¬ 
der harmless procedures/' still treated as a state secret for weapons three 
decades old. 89 The US. mainstream media have treated in very low key 
the continuing human toll suffered in Laos and have maintained almost 
complete silence concerning the U,S. non-cooperativeness in attempts to 
alleviate a crisis dating back to the “secret war” against Laos, which again 
was “secret” only by tacit propaganda service of the mainstream media 
(see chapter 6). 


Cambodia 

Important changes have occurred in Cambodia since 1988, including 
Vietnam's withdrawal from that country, elections held under UN aus¬ 
pices, and the death of Pol Pot, We noted in chapter 7 that, after the Viet¬ 
namese had ousred Pol Pot in December 1978, although the United 
States and its allies had denounced Pol Pot as “another Hitler” commit¬ 
ting “genocide,” they quickly became his supporter, allowing him to re¬ 
tain Cambodia's UN. seat and otherwise aiding and protecting him in 
his Thailand refuge, Viemam was severely punished—by harsh sanctions 
and by U,S. support for a Chinese invasion to teach Viemam a lesson— 
for having terminated Pol Pot's atrocities! President Carter's National 
Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski stated in 1979 that “I encouraged 
the Chinese to support Pol Pot. I encouraged the Thai ro help D,K. 
[Democratic Kampuchea, Pol Pot's forces], Pol Pot was an abomination. 
We could never support him but China could ” 90 In the late 1980s and 
early 1990s, as the Vietnamese sought to end their isolation by exiting 
from Cambodia, but insisted as a condition for withdrawal that Pol Pot 
and his Khmer Rouge be excluded from returning to power, the United 
States objected, and insisted, with eventual success, that the Khmer 
Rouge be included as a contestant party in The post-occupation settle¬ 
ment. 91 

What dominated US, policy and led to its support of Pol Pot was the 
classic rule that the enemy of my enemy (Vietnam) is my friend, and per¬ 
haps also the new till toward China, also hostile toward Vietnam, The 
support of Pol Pot was awkward, given the prior denunciations of his 
policies, but the mainstream media handled it with aplomb, and the US,
