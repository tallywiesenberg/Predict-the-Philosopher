The holocaust years 1978-85 yielded a steady stream of documents 
by human-rights groups that provided dramatic evidence of a state 
terrorism in Guatemala approaching genocidal levels.Many of these 
documents had a huge potential for educating and arousing the public* 
but as a propaganda model would anticipate, they were treated in our 
media sample in a manner that minimized their informational value and 
capacity to create and mobilize public indignation.Using a selection of 
ten important reports on Guatemala by Amnesty International and 
Americas Watch issued in the years 1981-87, we could only find mention 
of four of them in our media sample.94 None of these four made it to 
the first page, and none provided the basis for an editorial or the 
building up of a press campaign of sustained coverage and indignation.The spectacular AI report of 1981 on “ DisappearancesA Workbook, 
describing a frightening development of state terrorism in the Nazi 
mold* was entirely ignored in our media sample, as was AFs March 1985 
report on “ Disappearances ".
