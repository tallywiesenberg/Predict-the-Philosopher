We will see in the next 
chapter, too, that the media reported Cerezo^s election in a framework 
of hopefulness and optimism, despite prior electoral experience in 
Guatemala and Cerezo’s own expressed doubts about his ability to rule; 
the ignoring of AW’s retrospective describing the actual results of 
Cerezo’s presidency reflects the media’s general failure to follow up on 
the effects of client state elections (as we show in chapter 3 with regard 
to El Salvador).We described earlier the important Americas Watch study 
Guatemala Revised: How the Reagan Administration Finds “Improve¬ 
ments” in Human Rights in Guatemala, whose most striking and impor¬ 
tant theme was the ex post facto admission by the State Department 
that its apologetics for the previous general had been false.This il¬ 
luminating document was ignored in our media sample, except for the 
New York Times, which gave it a three-inch article on page 7 under the 
benign title “Rights Group Faults U.S. on Guatemala Situation” (Sept. 
24,1985).The article describes the report as saying that the administra-

tion has refused to acknowledge major human-rights abuses in 
Guatemala, but it fails to mention the stress on the ex post facto tacit 
admission of lying.Mentioning this would, of course, suggest that the 
Times ’s primary source for its “news” is thoroughly untrustworthy.
