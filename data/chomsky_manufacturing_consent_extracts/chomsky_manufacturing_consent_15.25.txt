The 
last paragraph of the article, which absorbs a quarter of the three inches 
devoted to this document, gives a State Department response to the AW 
report, which is that AW is “less a human rights organization than it 
is a political one.” The brazen hypocrisy of this reton would have been 
clear and dramatic if the article had given the gist of AW’s evidence that 
the administration was not merely an apologist for state terrorism in 
Guatemala, but was also demonstrably dishonest.In its concern to protect the Guatemalan generals in their terroristic 
assault on the population, the Reagan administration took umbrage at 
organizations like Amnesty International and Americas Watch and 
mounted a systematic campaign in 1981 and 1982 to discredit them as 
left-wing and politically biased.In a letter dated September 15, 1982, 
directed to AI and the Washington Office on Latin America, Assistant 
Secretary of State Thomas Enders assailed the reporting of these or¬ 
ganizations as one-sided and apologetic for the “ferocious” and “ter¬ 
rorist attacks”—of the guerrillas.Enders writes that 

No one would deny the possibility [sic] of units of the military, 
in contravention of stated policy, having been involved in viola¬ 
tions of human rights.What is important is that since March 23 
the Government of Guatemala has committed itself to a new 
course and has made significant progress* 55 

This amazing piece of apologetics for an army that was in the midst of 
slaughtering thousands of civilians was distributed within Guatemala as 
an official U.S, document, and its full text appeared in the Guatemalan 
press.
