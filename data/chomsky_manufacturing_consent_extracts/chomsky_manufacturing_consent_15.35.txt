It is interesting that the New York Times never 
mentioned or criticized this sinister campaign, even though it was 
carried out in the context of a policy protecting mass murderers.We 
will see in the next chapter that Time magazine cooperated with the 
campaign, citing Americas Watch only once on Guatemala, but with the 
qualifying explanation that it is “a controversial group that is often 
accused of being too sympathetic to the left 5 * (the State Department, 
on which Time relies very heavily, is never subject to any adjective 
suggesting any bias).The Washington Post (Dec. 4, 1982) had one 
back-page article by Terri Shaw, on the Enders letter, which features 
the State Department charges in the title—“Embassy Sees ‘Disinfor¬ 
mation’ on Guatemala: U.S, Report Says Rights Groups are Used”— 
and in the text.The author allows the embassy claim that “the report 
never was meant to be made public” to stand unchallenged, and never 
refers to the threat posed to human-rights monitors by the release of 
such State Department charges.The human-rights groups are allowed 
to suggest a State Department intent to discredit, but the word “disin¬ 
formation” is never applied to State Department allegations, and no 
serious examination of the content of those charges is provided.
