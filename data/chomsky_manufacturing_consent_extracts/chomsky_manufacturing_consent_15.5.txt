become his ally and supporter. (The explicit statement of support by

Brzezinski quoted above was never mentioned in the New York Times , the 
Washington Post , or Newsweek; it was quoted once in both the Los Angeles 
Times and Time.) 

However, in the late 1990$, after Vietnam had left Cambodia and US. 
official anti-Vietnam passions had subsided, and Pol Pot was no longer 
a useful instrument of anti-Vietnam policy, US. officials and pundits 
rediscovered Pol Pot's and the Khmer Rouge’s villainy and candidacy for 
war crimes trials. The media handled the previous “tilt” toward Pol Pot 
mainly by evasions essentially blacking out the years 1979-95, 0r vaguely 
intimating that the U.S. had supported him for reasons of “realpolitik 
but avoiding both details on the nature and magnitude of support as well 
as any reflections on the morality of backing “another Hitler.” The New 
York Times' s summary of “Pol Pot's Rise and Fall” (April 17, 1998) lists 
for “1979-1990: Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge are given refuge at Thai bor¬ 
der where they fight back against the Vietnamese ” “Given refuge” is mis¬ 
leading: they were given economic and military aid and political support 
by the United States and its allies. The Times's main reporter on Cambo¬ 
dia in early 1998, Seth Mydans, repeatedly blacked out mention of U.S. 
support^ referring to “the decade-long civil war that followed” Pol Pot's 
ouster (April 13); and a nineteen-year “guerilla insurgency in the jungles 
of western and northern Cambodia” (April 17).

Timesy editorializing on the death of Pol Pot on April 17* 1998, were uni¬ 
formly indignant over his crimes and regretful at his escape from justice* 
but all avoided mentioning the long US. support of the criminal—as well 
as the US. contribution to the first phase of a “Decade of Genocide 
The Washington Post blacked out the inconvenient fifteen-year period of 
support of Pol Pot with this summary: “After the nightmare of Khmer 
Rouge rule and genocide, the United States and its allies pumped mil¬ 
lions of dollars into Cambodia to help rebuild and to hold elections 

It is enlightening to compare the media's treatment of Pol Pot and 
Indonesian leader Suharto, who was also in the news in 1998, as Indone¬ 
sia suffered a financial crisis that—along with popular resistance to the 
dictatorship—eventually led to his ouster. Pol Pot was described in the 
editorials and news columns of April 1998 as “crazed,” a “killer,” “war 
criminal,” “mass murderer,” “blood-soaked ” and as having engineered a 
“reign of terror” and “genocide ” But in 1998 and 1999, and in earlier 
years as well, while Suharto was occasionally referred to as a “dictator” 
and running an “authoritarian” regime, he was never a “killer” or “mass
