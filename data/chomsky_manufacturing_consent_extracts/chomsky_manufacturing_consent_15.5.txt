As McClintock points out, “In the next few 
years many AEU leaders and member law students were hunted down 
and killed.” 99 In the 1970s, a Committee of the Relatives of the Disap¬ 
peared was organized by the AEU, with headquarters in San Carlos 
National University.As Americas Watch points out, “It disbanded after 
plainsclothesmen walked into the University's legal aid center on 
March 10, 1974, and shot and killed i:z principal organizer, lawyer 
Edmundo Guerra Theilheimer, the center's director.” 100 Another 
human-rights group, the National Commission for Human Rights, was 
created in the late 1970s by psychologist and journalist Irma Flaquer.Her son was murdered, and she herself “disappeared” on October 16, 
1980.According to the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group, in 
1984 alone there were an average of one hundred political murders and 
over forty disappearances per month in Guatemala.101 These figures are 
almost surely an underestimate, as only the disappearances that took 
place in and around Guatemala City received any publicity.
