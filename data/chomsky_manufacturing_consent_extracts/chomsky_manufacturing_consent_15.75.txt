108 He had been 
burned with a blowtorch, on the stomach and elsewhere, and beaten on 
the face so severely that his lips were swollen and his teeth were broken; 
his tongue had been cut out.Then, on April 4, another leader of GAM, 
Maria Rosario Godoy de Cuevas, her twenty-one-year-old brother, and 
her two-year-old son were picked up, tortured, and murdered.Her 
breasts had bite marks and her underclothing was bloody; her two-year- 
old son had had his fingernails pulled out.WORTHY AND UNWORTHY VICTIMS S3 


On grounds of newsworthiness, the murders of the two GAM leadÂ¬ 
ers, along with the brother and the child of one of them, would seem 
to deserve high-order attention.Their bravery was exceptional; the 
villainy they were opposing was extraordinary; the justice of their cause 
was unassailable; and the crimes they suffered were more savage than 
those undergone by Popieluszko.
