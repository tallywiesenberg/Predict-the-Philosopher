Most important of all, these were 
crimes for which we bear considerable responsibility, since they were 
perpetrated by clients who depend on our support, so that exposure and 
pressure could have a significant effect in safeguarding human rights.On the other hand, the Reagan administration was busily trying to enter 
into warmer and more supportive relations with the Guatemalan mili¬ 
tary regime and, as we described earlier, was going to great pains to put 
the regime in a favorable light.A propaganda model would anticipate 
that even these dramatic and horrifying murders would be treated in 
a low-key manner and quickly dropped by the mass media—that, unlike 
Popieluszko, there would be no sustained interest, no indignation capa¬ 
ble of rousing the public (and disturbing the administration’s plans).These expectations are fully vindicated by the record.Table 2-3 compares media coverage of the Popieluszko case with that 
of the murders of the GAM leaders.
