It is immediately obvious that the 
treatment is radically different in the two cases.The GAM murders 
couldn’t even make “the news” at Time, Newsweek, or CBS News, The 
New York Times never found these murders worthy of the front page 
or editorial comment, and we can see that the intensity of its coverage 
was slight.The first report of the quadruple murder was on April 7, 
1985, in a tiny item on page 5 of the paper in which it is mentioned that 
the body of Maria Rosario Godoy de Cuevas was found in her car in 
a ravine, along with the bodies of her brother and her young son.In 
neither this item nor any succeeding article does the Times provide 
details on the condition of the bodies, or mention that the two-year-old 
child had his fingernails tom out.109 

In other respects, too, the Times articles, all written by Stephen 
Kinzer, generally employ an apologetic framework.
