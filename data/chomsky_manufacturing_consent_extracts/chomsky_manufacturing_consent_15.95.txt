He looks 
“objectively” at the scene, quoting some of the GAM survivors in brief 
and rhetorical statements that are offset by quotes from the generals: 
they approved the formation of GAM (an ambiguous half-truth); they 
appointed an investigating committee that “found no evidence of secret 
detention centers in Guatemala” (no mention of the composition of the 
committee, no counter-evidence, and no mention of issues they may 
have overlooked—like disappeared who are murdered); and they deny 
any responsibility for the murder of Godoy, her brother, and her son, 
who they claim to have been victims of an auto accident.If Kinzer had 
given the details of the victims' injuries, this lie would have been 
exposed as such, and further questions would have suggested them¬ 
selves.In article after article, Kinzer repeats that the Mejia Victores gov¬ 
ernment has pledged to return to civilian rule shortly, which helps 
deflect attention from the ongoing killing and its causes, and from the 
GAM murders under discussion; he also does not tell us just what 
“civilian rule” would mean in a terrorist state in which, as he knows, 
the effective rulers would be the same military forces, 110 In the Popie- 
luszko case, once it was established that the police had committed the 
murder, the media spent a great deal of space discussing the police 
apparatus and police methods, as well as attending to the responsibility 
of the people at higher levels for the murder.Kinzer doesn't discuss 
these questions at all.The structure of the Guatemalan murder ma¬ 
chine and how it works would make a good story, and numerous details 
of its operations were available, but this did not fit the government 
agenda and the Times format.
