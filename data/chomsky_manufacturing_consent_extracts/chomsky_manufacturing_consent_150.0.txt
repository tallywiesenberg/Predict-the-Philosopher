5.5*3- The Paris Peace Agreements 

The Tet offensive convinced large sectors of elite opinion that the costs 
of the U.S. effort were too high- Lyndon Johnson stepped down. In 
what was termed by the government a “bombing halt/ 5 and reported 
as such* the bombers were shifted from North Vietnamese targets to 
Laos, where the defenseless rural society of scattered villages in the 
North was demolished, and later Cambodia, where the same was true 
on an even more horrendous scale. U S. forces undertook the violent 
and destructive post-Tet accelerated pacification campaign in the 
South, and bombing was intensified to “step up refugee programs deliber¬ 
ately aimed at depriving the VC of a recruiting base 3 w in accordance with 
the advice of pacification director Robert Komer in April 1967, 136 The 
Phoenix program was established to destroy the “infrastructure* 5 of the 
NLF by terror. The burden of ground fighting was shifted to Viet¬ 
namese forces supplied and directed by the United States, and U.S, 
conscripts were withdrawn, a more typical pattern for colonial wars that 
essentially duplicated the earlier French effort to reconquer Indochina. 
And the United States finally agreed to pursue the path of a negotiated 
settlement, although still not relinquishing the aim of preventing the 
unification of Vietnam and retaining Indochina, apart from North Viet¬ 
nam, within the U.S. global system. 

This was not the maximal goal the United States had pursued; thus 
in the late 1950s the U.S. government still hoped for unification 
of Vietnam under anti-Communist leadership, and the U.S* client 
regime always regarded itself as the government of all of Vietnam 
(GVN ^ Government of Vietnam), and so declared in the first and 
unamendable article of its constitution. But by the late 1960s, if not 
before, control over all Indochina apart from North Vietnam was re¬ 
garded as the maximum goal attainable. As we have seen, opportunities 
for a peaceful diplomatic settlement had long existed, but they had 
never been pursued because they were regarded as inconsistent with the 
essential goal: preservation of an “independent” South Vietnam that 
would be a U.S. client state. 

By October 1972, the negotiators in Paris had reached the essential 
terms of an agreement: the 9-Poim Plan, President Nixon, however, 
objected to the terms of the agreement, and the Thieu government in 



THE INDOCHINA WARS (l): VIETNAM 229 


Saigon was completely opposed to them* Nixon's hope was to delay 
further negotiations until after the November presidential elections* 
when he would have more leverage* 137 The delay would also permit a 
vast shipment of arms to the GVN, something that would surely be 
prohibited by the agreements* 

In an effort to pressure Nixon to sign the agreements, the DRV made 
the terms public on October 26 in a radio broadcast* In a Washington 
press conference, Kissinger stated that the Radio Hanoi broadcast gave 
“on the whole a very fair account,” then offering the following para¬ 
phrase: “As was pointed out by Radio Hanoi, the existing authorities 
with respect to both internal and external politics would remain in 
office” in the South* Thus Kissinger sought to insinuate that according 
to the accurate account on Radio Hanoi, the GVN (“the existing au¬ 
thorities”) would remain “in office” as the government of the South, 
and would somehow deal with the other “party,” whose status remained 
mysterious* But “what was pointed out by Radio Hanoi”—correctly, as 
Kissinger conceded—was something quite different, namely, that “the 
two present administrations in South Vietnam will remain in existence 
with their respective domestic and external functions,” these being the 
GVN and the PRG (based upon the NLF)* Having reached agreement, 
these two parties were then to move toward reunification, to be “carried 
out step by step through peaceful means,” with no external—meaning 
U*S.—interference. 

The differences are crucial* From its earliest days, the war was 
fought over the question of whether “the South Vietnamese people 
shall decide themselves the political future of South Vietnam,” as the 
October 9-Point Plan explicitly stipulated must be the case, or whether 
the United States would enforce the rule of its client regime, the GVN, 
as the sole legitimate government in the South, in accordance with 
Kissinger's version of the terms to which he had theoretically agreed, 
a version that plainly departed radically from the text* 138 

Kissinger's announcement that “peace is at hand,” designed with the 
upcoming U*S. presidential elections in mind, was also blatant decep¬ 
tion* As his distortion of the essential terms of the agreement clearly 
revealed, the United States was backing away from the settlement and 
refusing to implement it* Nixon later explained that “We had to use 
[Kissinger's press conference] to undercut the North Vietnamese prop¬ 
aganda maneuver [namely, making public the terms of the agreement] 
and to make sure that our version of the agreement was the one that 
had great public impact*” 139 This result was substantially achieved; the 
media characteristically accepted Kissinger's version with no recogni¬ 
tion that it was diametrically opposed to the terms of the 9-Point Plan,
