THE INDOCHINA WARS (l): VIETNAM 229 


Saigon was completely opposed to them* Nixon's hope was to delay 
further negotiations until after the November presidential elections* 
when he would have more leverage* 137 The delay would also permit a 
vast shipment of arms to the GVN, something that would surely be 
prohibited by the agreements* 

In an effort to pressure Nixon to sign the agreements, the DRV made 
the terms public on October 26 in a radio broadcast* In a Washington 
press conference, Kissinger stated that the Radio Hanoi broadcast gave 
“on the whole a very fair account,” then offering the following para¬ 
phrase: “As was pointed out by Radio Hanoi, the existing authorities 
with respect to both internal and external politics would remain in 
office” in the South* Thus Kissinger sought to insinuate that according 
to the accurate account on Radio Hanoi, the GVN (“the existing au¬ 
thorities”) would remain “in office” as the government of the South, 
and would somehow deal with the other “party,” whose status remained 
mysterious* But “what was pointed out by Radio Hanoi”—correctly, as 
Kissinger conceded—was something quite different, namely, that “the 
two present administrations in South Vietnam will remain in existence 
with their respective domestic and external functions,” these being the 
GVN and the PRG (based upon the NLF)* Having reached agreement, 
these two parties were then to move toward reunification, to be “carried 
out step by step through peaceful means,” with no external—meaning 
U*S.—interference. 

The differences are crucial* From its earliest days, the war was 
fought over the question of whether “the South Vietnamese people 
shall decide themselves the political future of South Vietnam,” as the 
October 9-Point Plan explicitly stipulated must be the case, or whether 
the United States would enforce the rule of its client regime, the GVN, 
as the sole legitimate government in the South, in accordance with 
Kissinger's version of the terms to which he had theoretically agreed, 
a version that plainly departed radically from the text* 138 

Kissinger's announcement that “peace is at hand,” designed with the 
upcoming U*S. presidential elections in mind, was also blatant decep¬ 
tion* As his distortion of the essential terms of the agreement clearly 
revealed, the United States was backing away from the settlement and 
refusing to implement it* Nixon later explained that “We had to use 
[Kissinger's press conference] to undercut the North Vietnamese prop¬ 
aganda maneuver [namely, making public the terms of the agreement] 
and to make sure that our version of the agreement was the one that 
had great public impact*” 139 This result was substantially achieved; the 
media characteristically accepted Kissinger's version with no recogni¬ 
tion that it was diametrically opposed to the terms of the 9-Point Plan,
