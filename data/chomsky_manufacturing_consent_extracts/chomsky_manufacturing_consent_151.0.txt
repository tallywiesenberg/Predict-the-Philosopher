though the facts were plain to anyone who troubled to look at the 
readily available public record* 

The United States then proceeded with a vast shipment of arms to 
the GVN while demanding substantial changes in the October agree¬ 
ments. Hanoi* in contrast* publicly insisted that the October agreements 
be signed* The media adopted the version of events relayed regularly 
by Kissinger* depicting him as caught between two irrational adversar¬ 
ies* Hanoi and Saigon* The Christmas bombings of Hanoi and Hai¬ 
phong followed* causing great damage and also the loss of several dozen 
B-52S (the exact numbers are contested* but the losses clearly shocked 
the Pentagon)* as well as a highly adverse world reaction* although the 
media continued to relay the Washington interpretation of what had 
happened. Thus Stanley Karnow wrote that “evidently” the primary 
aim of “Nixon’s bombings of Hanoi” was “to compel the North Viet¬ 
namese to return to negotiations*” a curious version of the readily 
available facts* 140 After the military and political failures of the Christ¬ 
mas bombings* the U.S, government then signed the January peace 
agreements* which were virtually identical to the terms it had rejected 
the preceding October—and* still more significant* were hardly differ¬ 
ent in essentials from the NLF proposals of the early 1960s* which 
caused such dismay in Washington and compelled the U*S. government 
to escalate the war so as to prevent a political settlement* thus virtually 
destroying Indochina* with millions of casualties and three countries 
utterly devastated—a fact considered of little moment in the West. 

The charade that took place in October was reenacted in January* 
As the agreements were announced on January 24, the White House 
made an official statement* and Kissinger had a lengthy press confer¬ 
ence in which he explained clearly that the United States was planning 
to reject every essential provision of the accords the administration had 
been compelled to sign* presenting a version that explicitly violated 
them at every crucial point. In yet another astonishing demonstration 
of servility* the media accepted the Kissinger-White House version 
unquestioningly* thus guaranteeing that the Vietnamese enemy would 
appear to be violating the agreements if it adhered to them. 

Recall that all of this took place during the period when the media 
had allegedly reached their peak level of militant opposition to state 
authority- Let us now briefly inspect this remarkable record* 

The Paris Agreements committed ^the United States and all other 
countries [to] respect the independence* sovereignty, unity and territo¬ 
rial integrity of Vietnam as recognized by the 1954 Geneva Agreements 
on Vietnam” (article i). Pending reunification of Vietnam, which is to 
“be carried out step by step through peaceful means . . . and without

foreign interference*” the “military demarcation line” at the 17th paral¬ 
lel is to be regarded as “only provisional and not a political or territorial 
boundary” (article 15). In the South, there are two parallel and equiva¬ 
lent “South Vietnamese parties/’ the GVN and the PRG, This is the 
central element of the agreements* which proceed to specify in detail 
the responsibilities and commitments of the two “South Vietnamese 
parties*” These are to achieve national reconciliation through peaceful 
means, under conditions of full democratic freedoms, while “Foreign 
countries shall not impose any political tendency or personality on the 
South Vietnamese people” and “the United States will not continue its 
military involvement or intervene in the internal affairs of South Viet¬ 
nam” (articles 9c, 4). “The two South Vietnamese parties undertake to 
respect the cease-fire and maintain peace in South Vietnam, settle all 
matters of contention through negotiations, and avoid all armed con¬ 
flict” (article 10)* Furthermore, “the two South Vietnamese parties” 
will proceed to “Achieve national reconciliation and concord* end ha¬ 
tred and enmity, prohibit all acts of reprisal and discrimination against 
individuals or organizations that have collaborated with one side or the 
other,” and* in general, “ensure the democratic liberties of the people,” 
which are outlined, along with procedures to ensure the reconciiation 
undertaken by “the two South Vietnamese parties” (articles 11,12)* The 
agreements committed “the two South Vietnamese parties” not to “ac¬ 
cept the introduction of troops, military advisers* and military person¬ 
nel including technical military personnel, armaments, munitions, and 
war material into South Vietnam” and called for a “total withdrawal” 
of all such personnel within sixty days, while “the two South Viet¬ 
namese parties” will settle “The question of Vietnamese armed forces 
in South Vietnam * * . without foreign interference” (articles 5, 7, 13), 
In his January 24 press conference , Kissinger made it clear that the 
United States maintained the right to provide “civilian technicians 
serving in certain of the military branches,” and as its forces were 
withdrawn after the signing of the agreements, the United States pro¬ 
ceeded to keep or introduce 7,200 “contract civilians” to “handle main¬ 
tenance, logistics* and training jobs formerly performed by the U,S, 
military,” many of them “retired military men*” under the supervision 
of a U*S. major-general, 141 The provisions concerning technical per¬ 
sonnel were thus at once nullified* along with the U*S* pledge to refrain 
from any intervention “in the internal affairs of South Vietnam*” 

In a speech of January 23, Nixon announced that the GVN would 
be recognized as the “sole legitimate government in South Vietnam,” 
nullifying articles 9c and 4 as well as the basic principle of the agree¬
