though the facts were plain to anyone who troubled to look at the 
readily available public record* 

The United States then proceeded with a vast shipment of arms to 
the GVN while demanding substantial changes in the October agree¬ 
ments. Hanoi* in contrast* publicly insisted that the October agreements 
be signed* The media adopted the version of events relayed regularly 
by Kissinger* depicting him as caught between two irrational adversar¬ 
ies* Hanoi and Saigon* The Christmas bombings of Hanoi and Hai¬ 
phong followed* causing great damage and also the loss of several dozen 
B-52S (the exact numbers are contested* but the losses clearly shocked 
the Pentagon)* as well as a highly adverse world reaction* although the 
media continued to relay the Washington interpretation of what had 
happened. Thus Stanley Karnow wrote that “evidently” the primary 
aim of “Nixon’s bombings of Hanoi” was “to compel the North Viet¬ 
namese to return to negotiations*” a curious version of the readily 
available facts* 140 After the military and political failures of the Christ¬ 
mas bombings* the U.S, government then signed the January peace 
agreements* which were virtually identical to the terms it had rejected 
the preceding October—and* still more significant* were hardly differ¬ 
ent in essentials from the NLF proposals of the early 1960s* which 
caused such dismay in Washington and compelled the U*S. government 
to escalate the war so as to prevent a political settlement* thus virtually 
destroying Indochina* with millions of casualties and three countries 
utterly devastated—a fact considered of little moment in the West. 

The charade that took place in October was reenacted in January* 
As the agreements were announced on January 24, the White House 
made an official statement* and Kissinger had a lengthy press confer¬ 
ence in which he explained clearly that the United States was planning 
to reject every essential provision of the accords the administration had 
been compelled to sign* presenting a version that explicitly violated 
them at every crucial point. In yet another astonishing demonstration 
of servility* the media accepted the Kissinger-White House version 
unquestioningly* thus guaranteeing that the Vietnamese enemy would 
appear to be violating the agreements if it adhered to them. 

Recall that all of this took place during the period when the media 
had allegedly reached their peak level of militant opposition to state 
authority- Let us now briefly inspect this remarkable record* 

The Paris Agreements committed ^the United States and all other 
countries [to] respect the independence* sovereignty, unity and territo¬ 
rial integrity of Vietnam as recognized by the 1954 Geneva Agreements 
on Vietnam” (article i). Pending reunification of Vietnam, which is to
