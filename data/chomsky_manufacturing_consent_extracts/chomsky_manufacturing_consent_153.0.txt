considers [the PRG] to be a parallel administration, 5 * failing to observe 
that it is not only “the Vietcong,” but also the Paris Agreements just 
signed by the United States government that assign to the PRG a status 
exactly parallel to that of the GVN. 147 In Newsweek, Stewart Alsop

proclaimed that if the “marvelously elaborate” Nixon-Kissinger settle¬ 
ment “survives more or less intact, we will have won the war”—which 
would be true, under the Nixon-Kissinger interpretation, although 
under the evidently irrelevant terms of the Paris Agreements, the 
United States had abandoned its war aims and accepted the basic 
proposals of the Vietnamese enemy. Newsweek went on to explain in the 
same issue that Hanoi has now 

accepted the provision that north and south are divided by a 
sacrosanct demarcation line, thus tacitly acknowledging the legiti¬ 
macy of the Saigon regime. . . . Equally vital to the Nixon Ad¬ 
ministration was specific mention of the “sovereignty” of the 
Saigon government, and on this point, too, the U.S* had its way, 
Hanoi finally conceded that, in Kissinger's words, “there is an 
entity called South Vietnam.” In one important sense, the dispute 
over that question was what the war in Vietnam was all about. 143 

Again, utterly and transparently false in every respect, as a comparison 
with the text just quoted immediately demonstrates, although in accord 
with Kissinger's deceptive version of the agreements, taken as sac¬ 
rosanct by the loyal media. 

An honest and independent press would have announced the January 
agreements with headlines reading: “U.S. Announces Intention to Vio¬ 
late the Agreements Signed in Paris.” An informed press would have 
observed further that the Paris Agreements incorporate the principles 
rejected by the United States at Geneva twenty years earlier, as well 
as the essential principles of the NLF program of the early 1960s, which 
were similar to those advocated by Vietnamese quite generally and 
constituted the crucial fact that impelled the United States to escalate 
the war so as to block a political settlement among Vietnamese. The 
actual press simply adopted Washington's version of the agreements, 
never mentioning that this version contradicted them in every essential 
respect and thus guaranteed that the war would go on—as it did. Once 
again, the contribution of the media was to help implement further 
violence and suffering by adopting Washington's version of events—in 
this case, in the face of the fact that this version was, transparently, in 
flat contradiction to the documents readily at hand. One would have 
to search assiduously to discover a more blatant example of media 
subservience to state power.
