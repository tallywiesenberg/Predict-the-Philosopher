a domestic crisis of unprecedented proportions.” Earlier, the Pentagon 
feared that escalation of the land war beyond South Vietnam might lead 
to massive civil disobedience, particularly in view of opposition to the

war among young people* the underprivileged* women* and segments 
of the intelligentsia* “The sight of thousands of peaceful demonstrators 
being confronted by troops in battle gear” during “the massive anti-war 
demonstration” and “massive march on the Pentagon” in October 1967 
was particularly disturbing* the Pentagon Papers analyst observed. 356 
The gradual withdrawal of the increasingly demoralized U*S* military 
forces led to a diminution of visible protest by the early 19705* but the 
“Vietnam syndrome” was never cured* As late as 1982* 72 percent of 
the public (but far fewer “opinion makers” and, to judge by other 
evidence cited earlier, virtually none of the “American intellectual 
elite”) regarded the Vietnam War as “more than a mistake; it was 
fundamentally wrong and immoral,” a disparity between the public and 
its “leaders” that persists as of 1986** 57 

The primary task facing the ideological institutions in the postwar 
period was to convince the errant public that the war was “less a moral 
crime than the thunderously stupid military blunder of throwing half 
a million ground troops into an unwinnable war,” as the respected New 
York Times war correspondent Homer Bigart explained, while chastis¬ 
ing Gloria Emerson for her unwillingness to adopt this properly moder¬ 
ate view, 150 The “purpose of the war” must be perceived as “preventing 
North Vietnam from subjugating South Vietnam” (John Midgley), “the 
real enemy, of course, [being] North Vietnam, supplied and sustained 
by the Soviet Union and China” (Drew Middleton) 159 —all in defiance 
of the plain facts. The primary issue was the cost to the United States 
in its noble endeavor; thus Robert Nisbet describes the “intellectual 
pleasure” he derived from “a truly distinguished work of history” with 
a chapter covering the 1960s, “with emphasis on the Vietnam War and 
its devastating impact upon Americans,” obviously the only victims 
worthy of concern. 160 To persuade elite opinion was never much of a 
problem, since these were the reigning conceptions throughout, and 
clearly privilege, along with media access, accrues to those who follow 
this path. But the public has nevertheless remained corrupted* 

An ancillary task has been to keep the devastation that the United 
States left as its legacy in Indochina hidden from public view* Indeed, 
one finds only scattered reference to this not entirely trivial matter in 
the U.S* media—a remarkable achievement* given the agency of de¬ 
struction and its scale. Keeping just to Vietnam, the death toll may have 
passed three million* In an article entitled “Studies Show Vietnam 
Raids Failed,” Charles Mohr observes that the CIA estimated deaths 
from bombing of the North at welt over 30,000 a year by 1967, “heavily 
weighted with civilians.” 161 Crop-destruction programs from 1961 had 
a devastating impact, including aerial destruction by chemicals, ground

operations to destroy orchards and dikes, and land clearing by giant 
tractors (Rome plows) that “obliterated agricultural lands, often in¬ 
cluding extensive systems of paddy dikes, and entire rural residential 
areas and farming hamlets,” leaving the soil “bare, gray and lifeless,” 
in the words of an official report cited by Arthur Westing, who com¬ 
pares the operations to the “less efficient” destruction of Carthage 
during the Punic Wars* “The combined ecological, economic, and so¬ 
cial consequences of the wartime defoliation operations have been vast 
and will take several generations to reverse”; in the “empty landscapes” 
of South Vietnam, recovery will be long delayed, if possible at all, and 
there is no way to estimate the human effects of the chemical poison 
dioxin at levels “300 to 400% greater than the average levels obtaining 
among exposed groups in North America,” 162 

In the South, 9,000 out of 15,000 hamlets were damaged or de¬ 
stroyed, along with some twenty-five million acres of farmland and 
twelve million acres of forest, One-and-a-half million cattle were killed, 
and the war left a million widows and some 800,000 orphans. In the 
North, all six industrial cities were damaged (three razed to the ground) 
along with twenty-eight of thirty provincial towns (twelve completely 
destroyed), ninety-six of 116 district towns, and 4,000 of some 5,800 
communes. Four hundred thousand cattle were killed and over a mil¬ 
lion acres of farmland were damaged. Much of the land is a moonscape, 
where people live on the edge of famine, with rice rations lower than 
those in Bangladesh, Reviewing the environmental effects, the Swedish 
peace-research institute SIPRI concludes that “the ecological debilita¬ 
tion from such attack is likely to be of long duration.” The respected 
Swiss-based environmental group IUCN (International Union for 
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) concluded that the 
ecology is not only refusing to heal but is worsening, so that a “catastro¬ 
phe” may result unless billions of dollars are spent to “reconstruct” the 
land that has been destroyed, a “monumental” task that could be 
addressed only if the United States were to offer substantial repara¬ 
tions, a possibility that cannot be considered in a cultural climate of 
abysmal ignorance, chauvinism, and the self-righteous pursuit of self- 
interest. Destruction of forests has increased the frequency of floods 
and droughts and aggravated the impact of typhoons, and war damage 
to dikes (some of which, in the South, were completely destroyed by 
U.S. bombardment) and other agricultural systems has yet to be re¬ 
paired. The report notes that “humanitarian and conservationist 
groups, particularly in the United States, have encountered official 
resistance and red tape when requesting their governments* authoriza¬
