a domestic crisis of unprecedented proportions.” Earlier, the Pentagon 
feared that escalation of the land war beyond South Vietnam might lead 
to massive civil disobedience, particularly in view of opposition to the

war among young people* the underprivileged* women* and segments 
of the intelligentsia* “The sight of thousands of peaceful demonstrators 
being confronted by troops in battle gear” during “the massive anti-war 
demonstration” and “massive march on the Pentagon” in October 1967 
was particularly disturbing* the Pentagon Papers analyst observed. 356 
The gradual withdrawal of the increasingly demoralized U*S* military 
forces led to a diminution of visible protest by the early 19705* but the 
“Vietnam syndrome” was never cured* As late as 1982* 72 percent of 
the public (but far fewer “opinion makers” and, to judge by other 
evidence cited earlier, virtually none of the “American intellectual 
elite”) regarded the Vietnam War as “more than a mistake; it was 
fundamentally wrong and immoral,” a disparity between the public and 
its “leaders” that persists as of 1986** 57 

The primary task facing the ideological institutions in the postwar 
period was to convince the errant public that the war was “less a moral 
crime than the thunderously stupid military blunder of throwing half 
a million ground troops into an unwinnable war,” as the respected New 
York Times war correspondent Homer Bigart explained, while chastis¬ 
ing Gloria Emerson for her unwillingness to adopt this properly moder¬ 
ate view, 150 The “purpose of the war” must be perceived as “preventing 
North Vietnam from subjugating South Vietnam” (John Midgley), “the 
real enemy, of course, [being] North Vietnam, supplied and sustained 
by the Soviet Union and China” (Drew Middleton) 159 —all in defiance 
of the plain facts. The primary issue was the cost to the United States 
in its noble endeavor; thus Robert Nisbet describes the “intellectual 
pleasure” he derived from “a truly distinguished work of history” with 
a chapter covering the 1960s, “with emphasis on the Vietnam War and 
its devastating impact upon Americans,” obviously the only victims 
worthy of concern. 160 To persuade elite opinion was never much of a 
problem, since these were the reigning conceptions throughout, and 
clearly privilege, along with media access, accrues to those who follow 
this path. But the public has nevertheless remained corrupted* 

An ancillary task has been to keep the devastation that the United 
States left as its legacy in Indochina hidden from public view* Indeed, 
one finds only scattered reference to this not entirely trivial matter in 
the U.S* media—a remarkable achievement* given the agency of de¬ 
struction and its scale. Keeping just to Vietnam, the death toll may have 
passed three million* In an article entitled “Studies Show Vietnam 
Raids Failed,” Charles Mohr observes that the CIA estimated deaths
