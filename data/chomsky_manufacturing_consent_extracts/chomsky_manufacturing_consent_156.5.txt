constitute a tiny fraction of the victims of U*S, aggression in Indochina, 
Barbara Crossette adds that the Vietnamese have also not been suffi¬ 
ciently forthcoming on the matter of remains of American soldiers* 
although their behavior may be improving: “There has been progress* 
albeit slow* on the missing Americans*” The unresolved problem of the 
war is what they did to us* Since we were simply defending ourselves 
from “internal aggression” in Vietnam* it surely makes sense to con¬ 
sider ourselves the victims of the Vietnamese, 

In a derisive account of Vietnamese “laments” over the failure of the 
United States to improve relations with them* Barbara Crossette re¬ 
ports their “continuing exaggeration of Vietnam's importance to 
Americans” under the headline: “For Vietnamese* Realism Is in Short 
Supply,” The Vietnamese do not comprehend their “irrelevance*” she 
explains with proper imperial contempt* U.S. interest in Vietnam* she 
continues, is limited to the natural American outrage over Hanoi's 
invasion of Cambodia (to overthrow our current ally Pol Pot), and its 
failure to be sufficiently forthcoming “on the issue of American service¬ 
men missing since the end of the war.” She cites a Pentagon statement 
noting that Vietnam “has agreed to return the remains of 20 more 
servicemen” and expressing the hope that the Communists will proceed 
“to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue*” She quotes an 
“Asian official” as saying that “We all know they have the bones some¬ 
where, , , , If Hanoi's leaders are serious about building their country, 
the Vietnamese will have to deal fairly with the United States.” When 
a Vietnamese official suggested that the U.S. send food aid to regions 
where starving villagers are being asked to spend their time and energy 
searching for the remains of American pilots killed while destroying 
their country. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley reacted 
with great anger: “We are outraged at any suggestion of linking food 
assistance with the return of remains,” she declaimed. So profound is 
the U.S. commitment to humanitarian imperatives and moral values 
that it cannot permit these lofty ideals to be tainted by associating them 
with such trivial concerns and indecent requests, 166 It is difficult to 
know how to react to a cultural climate in which such words can be 
spoken, evoking no reaction. 

According to standard state and media doctrine, South Vietnam (i,e*,
