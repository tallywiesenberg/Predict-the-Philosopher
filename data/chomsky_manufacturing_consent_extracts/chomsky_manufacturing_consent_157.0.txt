the client regime that we established) lost the war to North Vietnam— 
the official enemy* since the U.S. attack against the South cannot be 
conceded* “North Vietnam, not the Vietcong, was always the enemy,” 
John Corry proclaims in reporting the basic message of an NBC white 
paper on the war* 167 a stance that is conventional in the mainstream. 
Corry is indignant that anyone should question this higher truth* As

proof of the absurdity of such “liberal mythology/' he cites the battle 
of la Drang Valley in November 1965: 

It was clear then that North Vietnam was in the war* Nonetheless, 
liberal mythology insisted that the war was being waged only by 
the Vietcong, mostly righteous peasants, 

Corry presents no example of liberals who described the Viet Cong as 
“righteous peasants/' there being none, and no example of anyone who 
denied that North Vietnamese troops had entered the South by No¬ 
vember 1965, since, again* there were none. Furthermore* opponents of 
the war at that time and for several years after included few representa¬ 
tives of mainstream liberalism. Corry’s argument for North Vietnamese 
aggression, however* is as impressive as any that have been presented. 

The NBC white paper was one of a rash of retrospectives on the 
tenth anniversary of the war's end, devoted to “The War that Went 
Wrong, The Lessons It Taught/' 168 These retrospective assessments 
provide considerable insight into the prevailing intellectual culture. 
Their most striking feature is what is missing: the American wars in 
Indochina. It is a classic example of Hamlet without the Prince of 
Denmark. Apart from a few scattered sentences, the rare allusions to 
the war in these lengthy presentations—as in postwar commentary 
rather generally, including cinema and literature as well as the media— 
are devoted to the suffering of the American invaders. The Wall Street 
Journal, for example, refers to “the $180 million in chemical companies' 
compensation to Agent Orange victims”—U.S. soldiers, not the South 
Vietnamese victims whose suffering was and remains vastly greater. 169 
It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of these startling facts. 

There is an occasional glimpse of reality. Time opens its inquiry by 
recalling the trauma of the American soldiers, facing an enemy that 

dissolved by day into the villages, into the other Vietnamese. They 
maddened the Americans with the mystery of who they were—the 
unseen man who shot from the tree line, or laid a wire across the 
trail with a Claymore mine at the other end, the mama-san who 
did the wash, the child concealing a grenade.
