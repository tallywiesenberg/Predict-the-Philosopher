No doubt one could find similar complaints in the Nazi press about the 
Balkans. 

The meaning of these facts is almost never perceived. Time goes so 
far as to claim that the “subversion” was “orchestrated” by Moscow, 
so that the United States had to send troops to “defend” South Viet-

nam, echoing the fantasies concocted in scholarship—for example, by 
Walt Rostow, who maintains that in his effort “to gain the balance of 
power in Eurasia,” Stalin turned “to the East, to back Mao and to 
enflame the North Korean and Indochinese Communists.” 170 

Throughout the war, elite groups remained loyal to the cause, apart 
from expressing qualms about the bombing of North Vietnam, which 
was regarded as problematic since it might lead to a broader conflict* 
drawing in China and the USSR, from which the United States might 
not be immune. This was the “toughest” question, according to the 
McNamara memo cited earlier, and the only serious question among 
“respectable” critics of the war. The massacre of innocents is a problem 
only among emotional or irresponsible types, or among the “aging 
adolescents on college faculties who found it rejuvenating to play ‘revo¬ 
lution/ ” 171 Decent and respectable people remain silent and obedient, 
devoting themselves to personal gain, concerned only that we too might 
ultimately face unacceptable threat—a stance not without historical 
precedent. In contrast to the war protestors, two commentators explain, 
“decent, patriotic Americans demanded—and in the person of Ronald 
Reagan have apparently achieved—a return to pride and patriotism, a 
reaffirmation of the values and virtues that had been trampled upon by 
the Vietnam-spawned counterculture” 172 —most crucially, the virtues 
of marching in parades chanting praises for their leaders as they con¬ 
duct their necessary chores, as in Indochina and El Salvador, 

The extent of this servility is revealed throughout the tenth-anniver¬ 
sary retrospectives, not only by the omission of the war itself but also 
by the interpretation provided. The New York Times writes sardonically 
of the “ignorance” of the American people* only 60 percent of whom 
are aware that the United States “sided with South Vietnam”—as Nazi 
Germany sided with France, as the USSR now sides with Afghanistan. 
Given that we were engaged in “a defense of freedom” in South Viet¬ 
nam (Charles Krauthammer), it must be that the critics of this noble 
if flawed enterprise sided with Hanoi, and that is indeed what standard 
doctrine maintains; the fact that opposition to American aggression in
