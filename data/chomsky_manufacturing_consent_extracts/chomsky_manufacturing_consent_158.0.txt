South Vietnam, or even against the North, entails no such support, just 
as opposition to Soviet aggression entails no support for either the 
feudalist forces of the Afghan resistance or Pakistan or the United 
States, is an elementary point that inevitably escapes the mind of the 
well-indoctrinated intellectual. The Times retrospective alleges that 
North Vietnam was “portrayed by some American intellectuals as the 
repository of moral rectitude,” No examples are given, nor is evidence 
presented to support these charges, and the actual record is, as always, 
scrupulously ignored. Critics of the peace movement are quoted ex-

pounding on its “moral failure of terrifying proportions,” and several 
“former peace activists who had leaped across the ideological divide 5 * 
and now “are taking their stand with conservative Christians” of the 
Reaganite variety are quoted at length* But those who are allegedly 
guilty of these “terrifying” crimes are given no opportunity to explain 
the basis for their opposition to U.S* aggression and massacre. Nor are 
they permitted to assign to their proper place in history those who 
condemn the “moral failure” of opposing U.S* aggression or those who 
praise themselves for their occasional twitters of protest when the cost 
to us became too great* We read that the opponents of the war “bran¬ 
dished moral principles and brushed aside complexity” but nothing of 
what they had to say—as was the case throughout the war* 273 A current 
pretense is that principled critics of the war had access to the main¬ 
stream media during these years. In fact, they were almost entirely 
excluded, and now we are regaled with accounts of their alleged crimes 
but are almost never permitted to hear their actual words, exactly as 
one would expect in a properly functioning system of indoctrination 
with the task of preserving privilege and authority from critical analysis* 
The Times informs us that Vietnam “now stands exposed as the 
Prussia of Southeast Asia, 55 because since 1975 they have “unleashed a 
series of pitiless attacks against their neighbors, 55 referring to the Viet¬ 
namese invasion that overthrew the Pol Pot regime (after two years of 
border attacks from Cambodia), the regime that we now support despite 
pretenses to the contrary* Although the Times is outraged at the Prus- 
sian-style aggression that overthrew our current Khmer Rouge ally, and 
at the Vietnamese insistence that a political settlement must exclude 
Pol Pot, the reader of its pages will find little factual material about any 
of these matters* There are, incidentally, countries that have “un¬ 
leashed a series of pitiless attacks against their neighbors 55 in these 
years—for example, Israel, with its invasions of Lebanon in 1978 and 
1982—but as an American client state, Israel inherits the right of aggres¬ 
sion, so it does not merit the bitter criticism Vietnam deserves for 
overthrowing Pol Pot; and in any event, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon 
was a “liberation,” as the Times explained at the time, always carefully 
excluding Lebanese opinion on the matter as obviously irrelevant, 174 
The Times recognizes that the United States did suffer “shame 55 
during its Indochina wars: “the shame of defeat. 51 Victory, we are to 
assume, would not have been shameful, and the record of aggression 
and atrocities generally supported by the Times evokes no shame* 
Rather, the United States thought it was “resisting 55 Communists 
“when it intervened in Indochina 55 ; how we “resist” the natives defend¬ 
ing their homes from our attack, the Times does not explain. 




THE INDOCHINA WARS (i): VIETNAM 245 


That the United States lost the war in Indochina is “an inescapable 
fact” (Wall Street JournalX repeated without question throughout the 
retrospectives and in American commentary generally* The truth is 
more complex* although to see why, it is necessary to escape the con¬ 
fines of the propaganda system and to investigate the rich documentary 
record that lays out the planning and motives for the American wars 
in Indochina over thirty years* This record shows that a rather different 
conclusion is in order, an important fact to understand* 

The United States did not achieve its maximal goals in Indochina, 
but it did gain a partial victory. Despite talk by Eisenhower and others 
about Vietnamese raw materials, the primary U*S* concern was not 
Indochina but rather the “domino effect,” the demonstration effect of 
independent development that might cause “the rot to spread” to Thai¬ 
land and beyond, perhaps ultimately drawing Japan into a “New 
Order” from which the United States would be excluded* 175 This threat 
was averted as the United States proceeded to teach the lesson that a 
“ ‘war of liberation 5 , * * is costly, dangerous and doomed to failure” 
(Kennedy adviser General Maxwell Taylor, testifying to Congress)* 176 
The countries of Indochina will be lucky to survive; they will not 
endanger global order by social and economic success in a framework 
that denies the West the freedom to exploit, infecting regions beyond, 
as had been feared* It might parenthetically be noted that although this 
interpretation of the American aggression is supported by substantial 
evidence, 177 there is no hint of its existence in the popular histories or 
the retrospectives, for such ideas do not conform to the required image 
of aggrieved benevolence. Again, we see here the operation of the 
Orwellian principle that ignorance is strength. 

While proceeding to extirpate the “rot” of successful independent 
development in Indochina, the United States moved forcefully to but¬ 
tress the second line of defense. In 1965, the United States backed a 
military coup in Indonesia (the most important “domino, 55 short of 
Japan), while American liberals and Freedom House lauded the “dra¬ 
matic changes 55 that took place there—the most dramatic being the 
massacre of hundreds of thousands of landless peasants and the de¬
