The Times recognizes that the United States did suffer “shame 55 
during its Indochina wars: “the shame of defeat. 51 Victory, we are to 
assume, would not have been shameful, and the record of aggression 
and atrocities generally supported by the Times evokes no shame* 
Rather, the United States thought it was “resisting 55 Communists 
“when it intervened in Indochina 55 ; how we “resist” the natives defend¬ 
ing their homes from our attack, the Times does not explain. 




THE INDOCHINA WARS (i): VIETNAM 245 


That the United States lost the war in Indochina is “an inescapable 
fact” (Wall Street JournalX repeated without question throughout the 
retrospectives and in American commentary generally* The truth is 
more complex* although to see why, it is necessary to escape the con¬ 
fines of the propaganda system and to investigate the rich documentary 
record that lays out the planning and motives for the American wars 
in Indochina over thirty years* This record shows that a rather different 
conclusion is in order, an important fact to understand* 

The United States did not achieve its maximal goals in Indochina, 
but it did gain a partial victory. Despite talk by Eisenhower and others 
about Vietnamese raw materials, the primary U*S* concern was not 
Indochina but rather the “domino effect,” the demonstration effect of 
independent development that might cause “the rot to spread” to Thai¬ 
land and beyond, perhaps ultimately drawing Japan into a “New 
Order” from which the United States would be excluded* 175 This threat 
was averted as the United States proceeded to teach the lesson that a 
“ ‘war of liberation 5 , * * is costly, dangerous and doomed to failure” 
(Kennedy adviser General Maxwell Taylor, testifying to Congress)* 176 
The countries of Indochina will be lucky to survive; they will not 
endanger global order by social and economic success in a framework 
that denies the West the freedom to exploit, infecting regions beyond, 
as had been feared* It might parenthetically be noted that although this 
interpretation of the American aggression is supported by substantial 
evidence, 177 there is no hint of its existence in the popular histories or 
the retrospectives, for such ideas do not conform to the required image 
of aggrieved benevolence. Again, we see here the operation of the 
Orwellian principle that ignorance is strength. 

While proceeding to extirpate the “rot” of successful independent 
development in Indochina, the United States moved forcefully to but¬ 
tress the second line of defense. In 1965, the United States backed a 
military coup in Indonesia (the most important “domino, 55 short of 
Japan), while American liberals and Freedom House lauded the “dra¬ 
matic changes 55 that took place there—the most dramatic being the 
massacre of hundreds of thousands of landless peasants and the de¬
