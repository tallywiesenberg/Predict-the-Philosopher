struction of the only mass-based political party—as a proof that we 
were right to defend South Vietnam by demolishing it, thus encourag¬ 
ing the Indonesian generals to prevent any rot from spreading there. In 
1972, the United States backed the overthrow of Philippine democracy, 
thus averting the threat of national capitalism there with a terror-and- 
torture state on the preferred Latin American model. A move toward 
democracy in Thailand in 1973 evoked some concern, prompting a 
reduction in economic aid and increase in military aid in preparation

for the military coup that took place with U.S. support in 1976. Thai¬ 
land has had a particularly important role in the U.S. regional system 
since 1954, when the National Security Council laid out a plan for 
subversion and eventual aggression throughout Southeast Asia, in re¬ 
sponse to the Geneva Accords, with Thailand serving as its “focal 
point” and, subsequently, as a major base for the U.S* attacks on 
Vietnam and Laos. m In his personal Times retrospective. Pentagon 
Papers director Leslie Gelb observes that ten years after the war ended, 
“the position of the United States in Asia is stronger” than at any time 
since World War II, despite “the defeat of South Vietnam,” quoting 
“policy analysts” from government and scholarship who observe that 
“Thailand and Indonesia , . . were able to get themselves together 
politically, economically and militarily to beat down Communist insur¬ 
gencies,” in the manner just indicated, as were the Philippines and 
South Korea, also graced with a U.S.-backed military coup in 1972* 179

In short, the United States won a regional victory, and even a sub¬ 
stantial local victory in Indochina, left in ruins. The U.S. victory was 
particularly significant within South Vietnam, where the peasant-based 
revolutionary forces were decimated and the rural society was demol¬ 
ished* “One hard-core revolutionary district just outside Saigon, Cu 
Chi,” Paul Quinn-Judge observes, “sent 16,000 men and women to fight 
for the National Liberation Front. Some 9,900 did not return.” Much 
the same was true throughout the South. “The deaths left a major 
political gap for the new regime,” he adds* “The south was stripped of 
the trained, disciplined and presumably committed young cadres who 
would have formed the backbone of the present administration* In 
many areas the losses were near complete- - * * And the casualties put 
further strains on the state’s limited financial and organisation capaci- 
ties.” m The U.S. victory over the overwhelmingly rural society of 
South Vietnam, always the primary enemy, laid the basis for the take¬ 
over by North Vietnam (as anticipated years earlier in the much- 
derided peace-movement literature), 182 allowing American hypocrites 
to “prove” that this predictable consequence of the war they supported
