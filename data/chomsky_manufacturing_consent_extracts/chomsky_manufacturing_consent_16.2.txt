that at¬ 
tempt to compromise the democratic international image of 
Guatemala.112 

Although very similar threats preceded the murder of two leaders of 
GAM in March and April of 1984, the U.S. mass media entirely ignored 
this new information—despite strenuous efforts by GAM, the 
Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, and their allies to elicit pub¬ 
licity.As in the past, the unworthiness of these victims remains an 
essential ingredient in the Guatemalan army’s continued freedom to 
kill.3 

Legitimizing versus 
Meaningless Third World 
Elections: 

El Salvador 
Guatemala 
Nicaragua 


Third world elections provide an excellent testing 
ground for a propaganda model* Some elections are held in friendly 
client states to legitimize their rulers and regimes, whereas others are 
held in disfavored or enemy countries to legitimize their political sys¬ 
tems* This natural dichotomization is strengthened by the fact that 
elections in the friendly client states are often held under U,S.sponsor¬ 
ship and with extensive U.S. management and public-relations support.
