Thus, in the Dominican Republic in 1966, and periodically thereafter, 
the United States organized what have been called “demonstration 
elections” in its client states, defined as those whose primary function 
is to convince the home population that the intervention is well inten- 
tioned, that the populace of the invaded and occupied country wel¬ 
comes the intrusion, and that they are being given a democratic choice* 1 
The elections in El Salvador in 1982 and 1984 were true demonstra¬ 
tion elections, and those held in Guatemala in 1984-85 were strongly 
supported by the United States for image-enhancing purposes* The

election held in Nicaragua in 1984* by contrast* was intended to legiti¬ 
mize a government that the Reagan administration was striving to 
destabilize and overthrow.The U.S. government therefore went to 
great pains to cast the Nicaraguan election in an unfavorable light, 

A propaganda model would anticipate mass-media support of the 
state perspective and agenda.That is* the favored elections will be 
found to legitimize* no matter what the facts; the disfavored election 
will be found deficient, farcical* and failing to legitimize—again* irre¬ 
spective of facts.What makes this another strong test of a propaganda 
model is that the Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections of 1982 and 
1984—85 were held under conditions of severe* ongoing state terror 
against the civilian population, whereas in Nicaragua this was not the 
case.To find the former elections legitimizing and the Nicaraguan 
election a farce* the media would have had to use different standards 
of evaluation in the two sets of cases* and, more specifically* it would 
have been necessary for them to avoid discussing state terror and other 
basic electoral conditions in the Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections.
