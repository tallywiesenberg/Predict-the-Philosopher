As we will see* the media fulfilled these requirements and met the needs 
of the state to a remarkable degree.In order to demonstrate the applicability of a propaganda model in 
these cases* we will first describe the election-propaganda framework 
that the U.S. government tried to foist on the media; we will then 
review the basic electoral conditions under which elections were held 
in the three countries; and finally* we will examine how the U.S. mass 
media treated each of the three elections.3*1.ELECTION-PROPAGANDA 
FRAMEWORKS 

The U.S. government has employed a number of devices in its spon¬ 
sored elections to put them in a favorable light- It has also had an 
identifiable agenda of issues that it wants stressed, as well as others it 
wants ignored or downplayed- Central to demonstration-election man¬ 
agement has been the manipulation of symbols and agenda to give the 
favored election a positive image.The sponsor government tries to 
associate the election with the happy word “democracy” and the mili¬ 
tary regime it backs with support of the elections (and hence democ¬ 
racy).
