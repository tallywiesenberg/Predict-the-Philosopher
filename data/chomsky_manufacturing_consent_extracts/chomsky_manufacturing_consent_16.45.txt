Nobody who proposed a peace option could appear as a seriÂ¬ 
ous candidate in Vietnam in 1967* 7 and as we describe below* there was 
no peace candidate at all in El Salvador in either 1982 or 1984* although 
the polls and reporters kept saying that peace was the primary concern 
of the electorate.This highlights both the fraudulence of these elections 
and the urgency that the intentions of the sponsor be kept under wraps.In elections held in disfavored or enemy states* the U.S. government 
agenda is turned upside down.Elections are no longer equated with 
democracy, and U.S. officials no longer marvel at the election being 
held under adverse conditions.They do not commend the army for 
supporting the election and agreeing to abide by the results.
