denouement of the struggle between a democratic army and its rebel

election is altered- From the stress on the superficial—long lines and 
smiling faces of voters* the simple mechanics of election-day balloting* 
and the personalities of the candidates—attention is now shifted to the 
basic parameters that were off the agenda in the sponsored election.As 
noted by Secretary of State Shultz* “The important thing is that if there 
is to be an electoral process, it be observed not only at the moment when 
people vote* but in all the preliminary aspects that make an election 
meaningful.” Spelling this out further* Shultz mentioned explicitly that 
for elections to be meaningful* “rival political groups” must be allowed 
“to form themselves and have access to people* ro have rhe right of
