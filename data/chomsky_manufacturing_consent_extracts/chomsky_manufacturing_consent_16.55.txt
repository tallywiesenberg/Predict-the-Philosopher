No congresspersons or media 
commentators raised any question about whether these criteria should 
perhaps be applied to the Salvadoran or Guatemalan elections sched¬ 
uled during the same year* 

In brief, the government used a well-nigh perfect system of Orwel¬ 
lian doublethink: forgetting a criterion “that has become inconvenient, 
and then, when it becomes necessary again, * - * drawing] it back from 
oblivion for just so long as it is needed*”* It even acknowledges this fact: 
a senior U*S. official told members of the Latin American Studies 
Association (LASA) observing the Nicaraguan election: 

The United States is not obliged to apply the same standard of 
judgment to a country whose government is avowedly hostile to 
the U,S.as for a country like El Salvador, where it is not* These 
people [the Sandinistas] could bring about a situation in Central 
America which could pose a threat to U*S, security* That allows 
us to change our yardstick* 10 

But while a government may employ a blatant double standard, media 
which adhere to minimal standards of objectivity and are not them¬ 
selves part of a propaganda system would apply a single standard* Did 
the mass media of the United States follow a single standard in dealing 
with the elections in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, or did 
they follow their government’s agenda in order to put the Salvadoran 
and Guatemalan elections in a favorable light and to denigrate the one 
held in Nicaragua?3.2.BASIC ELECTORAL

All three of these countries, in which elections were held in the years 
1982-85, were in the midst of serious conflict: Nicaragua was being 
subjected to regular border incursions by the U.S.-organized and sup¬ 
plied contras.El Salvador was in the midst of a combination civil 
conflict and externally (U.S.) organized and funded counterinsurgency
