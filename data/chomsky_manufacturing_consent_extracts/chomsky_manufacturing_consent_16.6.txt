Despite the common feature of ongoing conflict* however* electoral 
conditions were far more favorable in Nicaragua than in El Salvador 
and Guatemala, for several reasons.First* and crucially important* in 
the tatter countries, at the time of the elections the army was still 
engaged in mass slaughter of the civilian population, with the toll in the 
tens of thousands in each country and the killing often carried out with 
extreme sadism.Nothing remotely similar was true in Nicaragua, These 
facts, which are not controversial among people with a minimal concern 
for reality* immediately establish a fundamental distinction with regard 
to the electoral climate.In countries that are being subject to the terror 
of a rampaging murder machine* supported or run by a foreign power* 
electoral conditions are fatally compromised in advance* a point that 
the media would recognize at once if we were considering the sphere 
of influence of some official enemy .11 

A further—and related—distinction was that the ruling Sandinista 
government was a popular government* which strove to serve majority 
needs and could therefore afford to allow greater freedom of speech and 
organization.
