The Sandinistas could appeal to nationalist senti¬ 
ments* easily mobilized against Yankee-organized terrorism.The Sal¬ 
vadoran and Guatemalan governments could hardly do the same—the 
Salvadoran government especially had to contend with a negative na¬ 
tionalist reaction to obvious foreign (i,e.* U-S.) domination and manipu¬ 
lation of its affairs, a fact that reached the level of absurdity when 
Duarte, visiting Washington in the fall of 1987, made himself an object 
of ridicule throughout Latin America by promptly kissing the American 
flag* While the Sandinistas did increasingly crack down on internal 
supporters of the contras as the conflict intensified* by the standards the 
United States usually applies to this region dissenters were dealt with 
remarkably benignly in Nicaragua* 14 In El Salvador and Guatemala* the 
ruling elites could not afford such toleration* and repression by large- 
scale terror had long been institutionalized in these states.A fourth factor making for a more benign electoral environment in 
Nicaragua, paradoxically* was U.S* hostility and the power of its propa¬ 
ganda machine* Every arrest or act of harassment in Nicaragua was 
publicized and transformed into evidence of the sinister quality of the 
Sandinista government in the free press of the United States* Mean¬ 
while* as we described in chapter 2* the Guatemalan and Salvadoran 
regimes could indulge in torture* rape, mutilation* and murder on a 
daily and massive basis without invoking remotely proportional atten¬ 
tion* indignation, or inferences about the quality of these regimes* In 
the context* the Nicaraguan government was under intense pressure to 
toe the mark, whereas the U,S- satellites were free to murder at will 
without serious political cost.Let us examine briefly how El Salvador* Guatemala* and Nicaragua 
compared in the individual categories of conditions of a free election* 
before we turn to the media treatment of these issues*
