Under these rulings* in the thirty months before the March 
198a election* and prior to the 1984 elections* many thousands of civil¬ 
ians were seized* imprisoned* tortured* raped* and murdered outside of 
legal processes for alleged “subversive” actions and thoughts.The state 
of siege was lifted in early 1982 solely for the six parties contesting the 
election* and it was lifted entirely ten days before the election for all 
Salvadorans—although* unfortunately* the citizenry was not informed 
of this fact until after the election was over and state-of-siege condi¬ 
tions were reimposed.15 The practice of exposing mutilated bodies for 
the edification of the citizenry became institutionalized in the early 
1980s in El Salvador.We described in chapter 2 the difficulty the U.S. 
government had in getting underlings jailed* tried* and convicted for 
the murder of four American citizens* even under intense U.S. pressure.The people of El Salvador had no protection whatsoever from the state 
terrorists* apart from that afforded by the guerrilla army in the regions 
under their control.
