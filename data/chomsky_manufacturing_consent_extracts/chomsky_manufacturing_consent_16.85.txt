The threat of extreme violence by the state against 
dissident speech was acute in El Salvador in 1982 and 1984, and was 
incompatible with a free election.In Guatemala, similarly* during 1984 and 1985* and for many years 
before* the actions of the armed forces against alleged subversives was 
entirely outside the rule of law.Thousands were seized* tortured* and 
killed without warrant and without any individual right to hearing or 
trial.As in El Salvador* mutilation and exposure of the tortured bodies 
became commonplace in the late 1970s and the 1980s.16 The courts were 
dominated by the military* as the latter would simply not execute or 
obey a court order of which they disapproved, and the judges were not 
inclined to challenge the military for reasons of dependency or fear.
