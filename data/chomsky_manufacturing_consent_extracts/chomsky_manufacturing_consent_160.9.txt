North Vietnam is fighting to liberate the South. We may not believe, 
however, that the United States is invading South Vietnam, which, we 
learn two episodes later, it had been bombing since 1961. Rather, we 
must assume, as a given fact not subject to debate, that the U.S. com¬ 
mitment was “to defend South Vietnam.”
