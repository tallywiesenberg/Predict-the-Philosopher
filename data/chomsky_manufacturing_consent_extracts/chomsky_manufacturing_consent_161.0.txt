48,500, 97 percent of them South Vietnamese guerrillas (“Viet Cong”). 
A few months after the la Drang Valley battle, in March 1966, the 
Pentagon reported 13,100 North Vietnamese forces in the South, along 
with 225,000 Viet Cong, facing 216,400 U.S. troops and 23,000 third- 
country troops (mostly South Korean), in addition to 690,000 ARVN 
troops. 189 Considering these facts, and the earlier history, it would seem 
possible to imagine a point of view that departs from the framework 
established here, one that is, furthermore, plainly accurate: the United 
States was stepping up its attack against South Vietnam. But that goes

beyond “balance,” which is construed similarly throughout, thus con¬ 
signing the series to the familiar system of state propaganda on the most 
crucial and essential point. A position critical of foreign aggression (that 
is, the U.S, aggression that was plainly the central element of the war) 
is excluded as unthinkable, although it may be conceded that “To the 
Communists in Hanoi, America’s presence in the South was yet another 
act of foreign aggression” (episode 4). The NLF in the South is granted 
no opinion on the matter, and the episode ends with a ringing declara¬ 
tion by LBJ. 190 

It is not that the facts are entirely hidden. Thus episode 5 (“America 
Takes Charge”) opens with a description by a GI of how “the ARVN 
and the VC are the same people, the same race, the same culture, and 
yet one side seems to be chicken and the other side seems to fight in 
the face of overwhelming disadvantages” in what is clearly “their coun¬ 
try.” A U.S. major discusses the problem in Binh Dinh Province, which 
“had never been really in friendly hands” since 1946 but rather “under 
VC control” throughout, compelling the United States to resort to 
“awesome fire power” that turns heavy jungle into a “moonscape.” But 
the plain truth that such facts entail cannot be expressed, or perceived. 

Balance is also preserved in an “account from both sides” of what 
happened in the village of Thuy Bo, in January 1967, where British 
producer Martin Smith had been shown the site of what villagers 
claimed to be a My Lai-style massacre, one of many they alleged, with 
a hundred women and children killed. Fox Butterfield reports that in 
contrast to the “balanced” picture actually presented by PBS, the 
British participants in the series argued that “the Marine attack on 
[Thuy Bo] should be labeled a war crime.” This failure to maintain 
“balance” was in keeping with what a filmmaker involved in the project 
termed their “more moralistic stance, anxious to accentuate the aspects 
of the war that were immoral at the expense of looking at it afresh,” 
which would apparently exclude the “more moralistic stance.” 191 In 
this episode, the marines tell their story of an assault on a VC-defended 
village and then the villagers (given thirty-five lines of the transcript,
