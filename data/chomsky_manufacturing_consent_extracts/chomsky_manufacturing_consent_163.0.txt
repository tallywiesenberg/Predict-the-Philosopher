tional assembly, along with four candidates of the left-leaning neutral¬ 
ists ("‘fellow travelers,” as they were called by Ambassador Parsons). 
Thus “Communists or fellow travelers” won thirteen of the twenty-one 
seats contested. The largest vote went to the leader of the Pathet Lao, 
Prince Souphanouvong, who was elected chairman of the national 
assembly, 

U.S. pressures—including, crucially, the withdrawal of aid—quickly 
led to the overthrow of the government in a coup by a “pro-Western 
neutralist” who pledged his allegiance to “the free world” and declared 
his intention to disband the political party of the Pathet Lao (Neo Lao 
Hak Sat, or NLHS), scrapping the agreements that had successfully 
established the coalition. He was overthrown in turn by the CIA favor* 
ite, the ultra-right-wing General Phoumi Nosavan. After U.S. clients 
won the i960 elections, rigged so crudely that even the most pro-U,S. 
observers were appalled, civil war broke out, with the USSR and China 
backing a coalition extending over virtually the entire political spec¬ 
trum apart from the extreme right, which was backed by the United 
States, The U.S, government assessment was that “By the spring of 1961 
the NLHS appeared to be in a position to take over the entire country,” 
primarily because of its control of the countryside, where it had “dili¬ 
gently built up an organization covering most of the country's ten 
thousand villages,” as noted ruefully by the bitterly anti-Communist 
Australian journalist Denis Warner. 2 The problem was the familiar one: 
the United States and its clients were militarily strong but politically 
weak. 

Recognizing that its policies were in a shambles, the United States 
agreed to take part in a new Geneva conference, which proposed a new 
settlement in 1962, This too quickly broke down, and the civil war 
resumed with a different line-up and with increasing intervention by the 
United States and its allies, and by North Vietnam, in the context of 
the expanding war in Vietnam, U.S, clandestine military operations 
began in 1961, and the regular U.S, bombing began in early 1964: 
Operation Barrel Roil, directed against northern Laos, was initiated in 
December 1964, several months before the regular bombing of North 
Vietnam. The bombing of northern Laos was intensified in 1966, reach¬ 
ing extraordinary levels from 1968 with the “bombing halt” in North
