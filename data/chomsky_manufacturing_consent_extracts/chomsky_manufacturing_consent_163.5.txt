Media coverage of Laos during the earlier period was sometimes 
extensive—over three times as great as of Vietnam in the New York 
Times in 1961, the Pentagon Papers analyst observes* But its contents 
were often absurd* For example, the aid cut-off that was the essential 
factor in the U*S, subversion of the elected government of Laos in 1958 
“was never even reported in the national press*” which barely men¬ 
tioned the events, and then with misleading commentary reflecting 
Washington deceit. 4 Bernard Fall gave a detailed and derisive exposure 
of some of the more ludicrous incidents* including inflammatory fabri¬ 
cations that helped create major crises and led to deeper U*S* involve¬ 
ment in Thailand and Indochina* Joseph Alsop’s fevered reports of 
largely invented Communist military actions were particularly note¬ 
worthy* 5 

As the Vietnam War escalated* Laos became “only the wan on the 
hog of Vietnam*” as Dean Rusk put it* a “sideshow war*” in Walter 
Haney’s phrase, as Cambodia was to be later on. Media coverage de¬ 
clined as the “sideshow war” escalated. There were* in fact, three 
distinct U*S* wars: the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail in the South; 
the bombing of the peasant society of northern Laos, which the U,S, 
government conceded was unrelated to the war in South Vietnam; and 
the “clandestine war” between a CIA-run mercenary force based on 
mountain tribesmen and the Pathet Lao, backed by North Vietnam 
apparently at about the level of the Thai and other mercenaries intro¬ 
duced by the United States* The bombing of southern Laos was re¬ 
ported; the clandestine war and the bombing of northern Laos were not* 
apart from tales about North Vietnamese aggression* often fanciful and 
subjected to no critical analysis. 6 

In July 1968, the Southeast Asia correspondent oiLeMonde y Jacques 
Decornoy* published lengthy eyewitness reports of the bombing of 
northern Laos* which had become “* * . a world without noise* for the 
surrounding villages have disappeared, the inhabitants themselves liv¬ 
ing hidden in the mountains . * * it is dangerous to lean out at any time 
of the night or day” because of the ceaseless bombardment that leads 
to “the scientific destruction of the areas held by the enemy,” He 
describes “the motionless ruins and deserted houses” of the capital of 
Sam Neua district, first bombed by the U*S, Air Force in February 1965, 
Much of this “population center” had been “razed to the ground” by 
bombing* and as he arrived he observed the smoking ruins from recent 
raids with phosphorus bombs* the “enormous craters” everywhere in 
the town* the churches and houses “demolished*” the remnants of U*S*
