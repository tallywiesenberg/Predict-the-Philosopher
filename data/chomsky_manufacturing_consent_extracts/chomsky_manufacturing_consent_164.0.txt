and hamlets had been spared. Bridges had been destroyed* fields up to 
the rivers were holed with bomb craters/’ 7 After Decornoy’s reports* 
there could be no doubt that the U.S. Air Force was directing murder¬ 
ous attacks against the civilian society of northern Laos. These reports 
of terrible destruction were repeatedly brought to the attention of the 
media* but ignored or, more accurately, suppressed. Later described as 
“secret bombings” in an “executive war,” the U.S. attack was indeed 
“secret,” not simply because of government duplicity as charged but 
because of press complicity. 

Not only did the media fail to publish the information about the 
attack against a defenseless civilian society or seek to investigate further 
for themselves* but they proceeded to provide exculpatory accounts 
that they knew to be inaccurate* on the rare occasions when the bomb¬ 
ing was mentioned at all. As the bombing of Laos began to be reported 
in 1969* the claim was that it was targeted against North Vietnamese 
infiltration routes to South Vietnam (the “Ho Chi Minh trail”), and* 
later* that U.S. planes were providing tactical support to government 
forces fighting North Vietnamese aggressors* a far cry from what 
Decornoy had witnessed and reported* and a much more tolerable 
version of the unacceptable facts. 8 

Keeping just to the New York Times, through 1968 there was no 
mention of the bombing apart from tiny items reporting Pathet Lao 
complaints (Dec, 22,31* 1968). On May 18,1969, the Times reported U.S. 
bombing in Laos, alleging that it was “directed against routes* including 
the so-called Ho Chi Minh Trail* over which the North Vietnamese 
send men and supplies to infiltrate South Vietnam.” A June 14 report 
states that “American planes bomb targets all over Laos* especially 
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in an effort to harass the Pathet Lao* the 
Communist-led rebel movement in Laos* and to stop the flow of enemy 
supplies to South Vietnam-” Charles Mohr reported on July 16 that 
U.S. bombing “is directed against infiltration routes from North Viet¬ 
nam that pass through Laos en route to the South.” There is a July 28 
reference to “200 American bombing sorties a day over northeastern 
Laos,” directed against North Vietnamese forces, and Hedrick Smith 
adds from Washington on August 2 that the United States “has been 
bombing North Vietnamese concentrations” in Laos, T. D. Allman 
reported bombing sorties “in tactical support” of government forces 
fighting the North Vietnamese and “harassing attacks against Commu¬ 
nist positions all over northeast Laos” on August 25* the latter providing

the first glimpse of something beyond the approved version. Further 
reports of U*S. air power in tactical support and “to cut North Viet¬ 
namese supply routes” appear on September 7* followed by Allman’s
