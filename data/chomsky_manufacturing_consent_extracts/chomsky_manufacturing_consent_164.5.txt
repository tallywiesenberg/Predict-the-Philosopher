report of successes of a government offensive with forces “stiffened by 
Thai soldiers,” supported by “the most intense American bombing ever 
seen in Laos” (Sept* 18)* Then followed reports from Washington and 
Vientiane (Sept, 19, 20, 23* 24, 30) confirming that the U,S. Air Force 
was providing tactical support for government combat missions in addi¬ 
tion to bombing North Vietnamese infiltration routes, including a Sep¬ 
tember 23 Agence-France-Presse dispatch reporting “bombing of 
Pathet Lao areas by United States aircraft/ 5 thus implying that the 
bombing went well beyond infiltration routes and combat operations, 
common knowledge in Paris and Vientiane but yet to be reported here. 

In short, the terror bombing of northern Laos, although known, 
remained off the agenda, and reporting in general was slight and highly 
misleading, to say the least. Elterman observes that the war in Laos and 
Cambodia was virtually “invisible” in the media through 1969, apart 
from the leftist National Guardian, which gave substantial coverage to 
what was in fact happening. 9 

On October 1, 1969, the New York Times finally ran an account by 
T. D. Allman, whose valuable reporting throughout the war appeared 
primarily overseas, concluding that “the rebel economy and social fab¬ 
ric” were “the main United States targets now,” and that the American 
bombardment had driven the population to caves and tunnels during 
the daylight hours, making it difficult for the Pathet Lao “to fight a 
£ people 5 s war 5 with fewer and fewer people.” Control of territory was 
now of lesser importance, he wrote, “with United States bombers able 
to destroy, almost at will, any given town, bridge, road or concentration 
of enemy soldiers or civilians*” 10 

This confirmation of what had long been known in restricted peace- 
movement circles, and consciously suppressed in the mainstream press, 
passed without particular notice* The CIA clandestine army had swept 
through the Plain of Jars in the preceding months, evacuating all re¬ 
maining civilians to areas near Vientiane, where they and their harrow¬ 
ing stories were largely ignored by the well-represented media, 
although available elsewhere. 11 

Walter Haney, a Lao-speaking American who compiled a detailed 
collection of refugee interviews that was described as “serious and 
carefully prepared 55 by U.S. Ambassador to Laos William Sullivan, 
quotes remarks by a UN official in Laos as “the most concise account 
of the bombing”:

By 1968 the intensity of the bombings was such that no organized 
life was possible in the villages* The villages moved to the outskirts
