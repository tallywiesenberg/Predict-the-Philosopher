and then deeper and deeper imo the forest as the bombing reached 
its peak in 1969 when jet planes came daily and destroyed all 
stationary structures* Nothing was left standing. The villagers 
lived in trenches and holes or in caves. They only farmed at night. 
[Each] of the informants* without any exception* had his village 
completely destroyed. In the last phase* bombings were aimed at 
the systematic destruction of the [material] basis of the civilian 
society. 12 

A staff study by a Kennedy subcommittee concluded that a main pur¬ 
pose of the U.S* bombardment was “to destroy the physical and social 
infrastructure*' in areas held by the Pathet Lao* a conclusion well 
supported by the factual record. 13 

There were also eyewitness reports of the destruction of northern 
Laos by Western reporters* but published overseas, T. D. Allman flew 
over the Plain of Jars in late 1971* reporting that “it is empty and 
ravaged” by the napalm and B-52 saturation bombing being “used in 
an attempt to extinguish all human life in the target area”; “All vegeta¬ 
tion has been destroyed and the craters* literally, are countless” and 
often impossible to distinguish among the “endless patches of churned 
earth* repeatedly bombed,” At the same time, the Washington Post 
published the statement of Air Force Secretary Robert Seamans* who 
reported from northern Laos that “I have seen no evidence of indis¬ 
criminate bombing”; it is the North Vietnamese who are “rough*” and 
the people are not “against the United States—just the opposite.” The 
Lao-speaking Australian reporter John Everingham traveled in 1970 
“through dying village after dying village” of the Hmong tribesmen 
who had been “naive enough to trust the CIA” and were now being 
offered “a one-way "copter ride to death' ” in the CIA clandestine army, 
in the remains of a country where bombing had “turned more than half 
the total area of Laos to a land of charred ruins where people fear the 
sky” so that “nothing be left standing or alive for the communists to 
inherit*” No U.S. journal, apart from the tiny pacifist press* was inter¬ 
ested enough to run his story* although later the media were to bewail 
the plight of the miserable remnants of the Hmong* put on display as 
“victims of Communism*” In 1970* the Bangkok World (Oct* 7) pub¬ 
lished an AP report on U.S, bombing that was “wiping out” towns, and 
by 1972 such reports sometimes appeared in the U.S* press* 14 Latex* 
Nayan Chanda visited the Plain of Jars* reporting overseas that from 
the air it “resembles a lunar landscape, pockmarked as it is with bomb
