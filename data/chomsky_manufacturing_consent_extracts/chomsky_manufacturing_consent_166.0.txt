population, with another tenth uprooted in this “fratricidal strife that 
was increased to tragic proportions by warring outsiders,” The “fratri¬ 
cidal strife” might well have been terminated by the 1958 coalition 
government had it not been for “outsiders," with the United States 
playing a decisive role throughout, a role completely ignored in this 
purported historical analysis apart from a few misleading comments. At 
this late date, the Times continued to pretend that the U.S. bombing 
was directed against North Vietnamese supply trails—nothing else is 
mentioned. The crucial events of the actual history also disappear, or 
are grossly misrepresented. Subsequent reporting also regularly 
obliterated the U.S, role in creating the devastation and postwar “prob¬ 
lems” attributed to the Communists alone, a shameful evasion in the 
light of the undisputed historical facts, 19 

Once again, the media record, less than glorious, is well explained 
throughout by the propaganda model. 


6,2. CAMBODIA 


6.2.1. “The decade of the genocide*’ 

Few countries have suffered more bitterly than did Cambodia during 
the 1970s- The “decade of the genocide,” as the period is termed by the 
Finnish Inquiry Commission that attempted to assess what had taken 
place, 20 consisted of three phases—now extending the time scale to the 
present* which bears a heavy imprint of these terrible years: 

Phase I: From 1969 through April 1975, U.S. bombing at a histori¬ 
cally unprecedented level and a civil war sustained by the United 
States left the country in utter ruins. Though Congress legislated 
an end to the bombing in August 1973, U.S* government participa¬ 
tion in the ongoing slaughter continued until the Khmer Rouge 
victory in April 1975. 21 

Phase II: From April 1975 through 1978 Cambodia was subjected 
to the murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge (Democratic Kampu¬ 
chea, DK), overthrown by the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia 
in December 1978, ^
