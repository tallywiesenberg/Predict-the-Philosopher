tion apart from the Soviet bloc* Reconstructed with the aid of 
China and the United States on the Thai-Cambodia border and 
in Thai bases, the Khmer Rouge guerrillas* the only effective DK 
military force, continue to carry out activities in Cambodia of a 
sort called “terrorist” when a friendly government is the target. 


We turn now to the travail of Cambodia during these grim years, and 
the way it has been depicted, first with some preliminary observations 
and then in further detail* phase by phase. 


6*2.2* Problems of scale and 
responsibility 

The three phases of the “decade of the genocide*' have fared quite 
differently in the media and general culture* and in a way that conforms 
well to the expectations of a propaganda model* Phase I, for which the 
United States bore primary responsibility* was little investigated at the 
time, or since, and has never been described with anything like the 
condemnatory terms applied to phase II* The vast number of Cambodi¬ 
ans killed, injured* and traumatized in this period were, in our concep¬ 
tualization of chapter 2, “unworthy” victims. 

Phase II, the Pol Pot era, is the “holocaust” that was widely com¬ 
pared to the worst atrocities of Hitler and Stalin* virtually from the 
outset, with massive publicity and outrage at the suffering of these 
“worthy” victims. 

Phase III renewed the status of the people of Cambodia as worthy 
victims* suffering under Vietnamese rule. The Vietnamese being official 
enemies of the United States, they quickly became the villains of the 
piece* responsible for unspeakable conditions within Cambodia and 
guilty of unprovoked aggression. Meanwhile* the United States backed 
its ally China as it conducted a punitive invasion of Vietnam in Febru¬ 
ary 1979 and reconstructed the defeated Pol Pot forces* 

In the early stages of phase III, it was alleged “that the Vietnamese 
are now conducting a subtle "genocide* in Cambodia,” a charge tacitly 
endorsed in a CIA demographic study* which estimated a population 
drop of 700,000 during “the first year of the Heng Samrin rule,” 22 This 
new “holocaust” was constructed on the basis of serious misinterpreta-
