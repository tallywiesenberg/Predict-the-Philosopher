a response to William Shawcross’s warnings of “the end of Cam¬ 
bodia, but not before it had left its mark on popular perceptions* and 
many distortions and, indeed, contradictions persist. In his Quality of 
Mercy y Shawcross agrees that, as Vickery had concluded, there was no 
large-scale famine of the character initially reported, 24 but he later 
wrote that the Heng Samrin regime '"was responsible for creating many 
of the conditions that caused the famine'* in Cambodia, These conflict¬ 
ing accounts were noted by Australian Cambodia scholar Ben Kieman, 
who suggested a partial explanation: “There was a threat of famine, as 
the Heng Samrin government proclaimed in mid-1979. But it was offset 
by the small but crucial December-January harvest, which Shawcross 
hardly mentions, and by the massive international aid program, which 
he regularly denigrates." 25 

The eagerness to uncover Vietnamese villainy in “ending Cam¬ 
bodia," the easy reliance on sources known ro be unreliable, 26 and the 
subsequent evasions after the accusations dissolve are readily explained 
by U.S, (indeed, general Western-bloc) hostility to Vietnam, which led 
the United States to align itself quietly with Pol Pot and to transform 
its alleged concern over Cambodians to the victims of the Vietnamese 
occupation. 

Phase III also had 3 domestic US, aspect that is highly relevant to 
our concerns- In an intriguing exercise, characteristic of system-sup¬ 
portive propaganda campaigns, it was charged that the horrors of phase 
II were passed over in “silence” at the time. This alleged fact, devel¬ 
oped in William Shawcross’s influential book Quality ofMercy 3 elicited 
much commentary on “Holocaust and Modem Conscience," the subti¬ 
tle of Shawcross’s book, and on the failure of civilized people to react 
appropriately to ongoing atrocities. In “Phase III at home" (p, 288), we 
will turn to the merits of this charge with regard to phase II. As for 
phase I of “the decade of the genocide," the charge of silence is dis¬ 
tinctly applicable, but it was never raised, then or now, nor is phase I 
designated a period of “holocaust" or “genocide” in mainstream litera¬ 
ture. Phase I elicited no calls for international intervention or trials for 
crimes against humanity, and it has since been largely expunged from 
the record. In retrospect, the harshest critics within the mainstream 
attribute “the destruction of Cambodian society” during phase I to 
“years of warfare” and “careless policies of the White House, 5 * nothing

Watergate hearings, but the primary concern there was the failure to 
notify Congress,
