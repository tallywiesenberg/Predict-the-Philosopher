ately terminated* Sources close to the U*S, government predicted a 
million deaths in Cambodia if U,S_ aid were to cease* A Western doctor 
working in Phnom Penh in 1974-75 reported that 

This generation is going to be a lost generation of children* Mal¬ 
nutrition is going to affect their numbers and their mental capaci¬ 
ties* So, as well as knocking off a generation of young men, the war 
is knocking off a generation of children. 

The U,S. embassy estimated that available rice in Phnom Penh would 
suffice for at most a few weeks. The final U.S. AID report observed that 
the country faced famine in 1975, with 75 percent of its draft animals 
destroyed by the war, and that rice planting for the next harvest, eight 
months hence, would have to be done “by the hard labor of seriously 
malnourished people.” The report predicted “widespread starvation” 
and “Slave labor and starvation rations for half the nation's people” for 
the coming year, and “general deprivation and suffering . . . over the 
next two or three years before Cambodia can get back to rice self- 
sufficiency*” 33 

There is also the matter of the effect of the U.S, bombing on the 
Khmer Rouge and the peasant society that provided their social base, 
a factor noted by all serious analysts, Cambodia specialist Milton Os¬ 
borne concludes that Communist terror was “surely a reaction to the 
terrible bombing of Communist-held regions” by the U.S* Air Force, 
Another Cambodia scholar, David Chandler, comments that the bomb¬ 
ing turned “thousands of young Cambodians into participants in an 
anti-American crusade,” as it “destroyed a good deal of the fabric of 
prewar Cambodian society and provided the CPK [Khmer Rouge] with 
the psychological ingredients of a violent, vengeful, and unrelenting 
social revolution,” a “class warfare between the "base people,' who had 
been bombed, and the ‘new people' who had taken refuge from the 
bombing and thus had taken sides, in CPK thinking, with the United 
States*” “French intransigence had turned nationalists into Commu¬ 
nists,” Philip Windsor observes, while “American ruthlessness now 
turned Communists into totalitarian fanatics*” 34 One may debate the 
weight that should be assigned to this factor in determining Khmer 
Rouge policies, embittering the peasant society of “base people,” and 
impelling them to force those they perceived as collaborators in their 
destruction to endure the lives of poor peasants or worse. But that it 
was a factor can hardly be doubted- 

Assessing these various elements, it seems fair to describe the re-
