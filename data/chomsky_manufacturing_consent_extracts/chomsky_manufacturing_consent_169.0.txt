new, nonideological scholarship much admired by the New York Times . 
Pike described Pol Pot in November 1979 as the “charismatic*' leader 
of a “bloody but successful peasant revolution with a substantial resi¬ 
due of popular support/ 5 under which “on a statistical basis* most of 
them [peasants]... did not experience much in the way of brutality/* 37 
The 1980 CIA demographic study assigns the Pol Pot-era executions 
to the period ending in January 1977* and for 1977-78 merely says that 
“living conditions most likely did not vary during these two years from 
the conditions during 1976/’ although as was known when the CIA 
study was undertaken* these later years were the worst* by far, in the 
context of internal purges and the escalating conflict with Vietnam at 
a time when the United States was beginning its “tilt” toward China 
and Pol Pot* The CIA concludes that among the “old people/ 5 the 
“rural population” who were “the foundation for the new Khmer 
Rouge revolutionary society,” there was a slight increase in population 
through the DK period, A still more muted assessment is provided by 
the close U.S. ally Deng Xiaoping, who emerged as “party strongman” 
in China in December 1978 and soon implemented his plan to “punish 
Vietnam/ 5 and who remained the main supporter of Pol Pot* He bitterly 
opposed attempts to remove the Khmer Rouge from their leading role 
in the DK coalition in 1984, stating in a rage that “I do not understand 
why some people want to remove Pol Pot, It is true that he made some 
mistakes in the past but now he is leading the fight against the Viet¬ 
namese aggressors/* 38 Deng has been backed in this stance by the 
Reagan administration (see “Phase III in Indochina/ 5 p, 285)/® 

In addition to such real examples of less harsh interpretations of the 
Pol Pot period, there are also mythical ones to which we return* 


6.2.3* The “not-so-gentle” land: 
some relevant history 

Part of the illusory story constructed about Cambodia during the 1970s 
and since is that this “gentle land” with its “smiling people” had known 
little suffering before the country was drawn into the Indochina war and 
then subjected to Pol Pot “autogenocide/ 5 The reality is different* 
Behind the famous “Khmer smile*” as Prince Sihanouk’s French ad- 
viser Charles Meyer observed, lies ample bitterness and violence* 39 
Vickery observes that earlier chronicles “are filled with references to 
public executions* ambushes* torture, village-burnings and forced emi¬ 
gration*” with the destruction of villages and landscapes* torture* and

killing a matter of course, and few institutional restraints on terror. The 
peasantry of inner Cambodia, largely unknown to Western scholarship 
or to the urban population* appear to have lived under conditions of 
extreme violence and hatred for the oppressors from outside the village. 

During the French war of reconquest in the late 1940s, up to “per* 
haps one million rural inhabitants . ., were forcibly 'regrouped. 5 55 The 
huge flow of refugees to Phnom Penh during phase l of the "decade 
of the genocide” was not the first massive dislocation in recent history, 
Vickery continues, adding that it is, furthermore, "a strange kind of 
history 55 that regards the displacement of people fleeing from U.S. 
bombs and savage fighting “as somehow less abhorrent or more 'nor¬ 
mal 5 than the reverse movement of 1975,” the forcible evacuation when 
the peasant army of the Khmer Rouge conquered the city. Leaders of 
the anti-French resistance after World War II describe horrifying 
atrocities conducted with obvious pleasure as a “normal 55 part of 
“Khmer mores, 55 In the same years, government forces led by Lon Nol, 
who was to head the U.S.-backed client government in the early 1970s, 
carried out wholesale massacres in villages as the French withdrew, 
including such “individual tests of strength 55 as “grasping infants by the 
legs and pulling them apart,” actions that “had probably not been 
forgotten by the men of that area who survived to become the Khmer 
Rouge troops 55 whose later atrocities in this “gentle land 55 aroused such 
outrage in the West, “Thus for the rural 80-90 percent of the Cambo¬ 
dian people, 55 Vickery concludes, “arbitrary justice, sudden violent 
death, political oppression, exploitative use of religion and anti-reli¬ 
gious reaction, both violent and quiescent, were common facts of life 
long before the war and revolution of the 1970s, 55 These conditions 
elicited no interest in the West. “The creations of Pol Pot-ism were all 
there in embryo, 55 Vickery continues, to be “directed first of all at the 
urban population 55 after a war which was in large measure “a war 
between town and countryside in which the town's battle was increas¬ 
ingly for the sole purpose of preserving its privileges while the rural 
areas suffered.” 40 

It is superfluous to observe that the United States deployed its ample 
means of violence in defense of urban privilege. But, in fact, these tasks 
were only of secondary importance. For the United States, the destruc¬ 
tion of rural Cambodia was ancillary to the goal of maintaining in power 
the client regime in South Vietnam. 

Contrary to the arrangements in Laos and Vietnam, the Geneva 
Accords afforded no recognition to the anti-French resistance in Cam¬ 
bodia, a source of much bitterness. The country was ruled by Prince 
Sihanouk until March 1970, when he was overthrown in a coup sup-
