new, nonideological scholarship much admired by the New York Times . 
Pike described Pol Pot in November 1979 as the “charismatic*' leader 
of a “bloody but successful peasant revolution with a substantial resi¬ 
due of popular support/ 5 under which “on a statistical basis* most of 
them [peasants]... did not experience much in the way of brutality/* 37 
The 1980 CIA demographic study assigns the Pol Pot-era executions 
to the period ending in January 1977* and for 1977-78 merely says that 
“living conditions most likely did not vary during these two years from 
the conditions during 1976/’ although as was known when the CIA 
study was undertaken* these later years were the worst* by far, in the 
context of internal purges and the escalating conflict with Vietnam at 
a time when the United States was beginning its “tilt” toward China 
and Pol Pot* The CIA concludes that among the “old people/ 5 the 
“rural population” who were “the foundation for the new Khmer 
Rouge revolutionary society,” there was a slight increase in population 
through the DK period, A still more muted assessment is provided by 
the close U.S. ally Deng Xiaoping, who emerged as “party strongman” 
in China in December 1978 and soon implemented his plan to “punish 
Vietnam/ 5 and who remained the main supporter of Pol Pot* He bitterly 
opposed attempts to remove the Khmer Rouge from their leading role 
in the DK coalition in 1984, stating in a rage that “I do not understand 
why some people want to remove Pol Pot, It is true that he made some 
mistakes in the past but now he is leading the fight against the Viet¬ 
namese aggressors/* 38 Deng has been backed in this stance by the 
Reagan administration (see “Phase III in Indochina/ 5 p, 285)/® 

In addition to such real examples of less harsh interpretations of the 
Pol Pot period, there are also mythical ones to which we return* 


6.2.3* The “not-so-gentle” land: 
some relevant history 

Part of the illusory story constructed about Cambodia during the 1970s 
and since is that this “gentle land” with its “smiling people” had known 
little suffering before the country was drawn into the Indochina war and 
then subjected to Pol Pot “autogenocide/ 5 The reality is different* 
Behind the famous “Khmer smile*” as Prince Sihanouk’s French ad- 
viser Charles Meyer observed, lies ample bitterness and violence* 39 
Vickery observes that earlier chronicles “are filled with references to 
public executions* ambushes* torture, village-burnings and forced emi¬ 
gration*” with the destruction of villages and landscapes* torture* and
