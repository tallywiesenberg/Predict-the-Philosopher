All such meetings, when 
they do occur, are subject to surveillance, supervision and control 
by the authorities, so they do nor enjoy the freedom implied by 
such rights.22 

Public demonstrations were permissible in Guatemala during the 
1984-85 elections, with three days’ advance notice and approval of the 
military authorities.In the Guatemalan context, however, this grant of 
rights was not meaningful.The delegation of the International Human

Rights Law Group and the Washington Office on Latin America noted 
that whatever the election guarantees, 

the military and civil defense patrols and the climate of fear also 
made it difficult for many Guatemalans to organize and assemble.One local observer said that years of terror and oppression against 
local organizations had demobilized the whole rural population: 
“Four CUC [peasant league] members were killed in this village 
alone* Now it would be very difficult to organize any kind of 
group.” Civil patrols, police and army checkpoints on highways, 
and the need for travel permits for residents of the model villages 
impeded free movement* In the rural areas the civil patrols dis¬ 
couraged gatherings because people feared being reported* 23 

It was noted by many observers of the Guatemalan elections that 
although the big issues in that country were land distribution and 
reform and human rights, no political candidates discussed or ad¬ 
vocated either land reform, or restructuring the military and forcing an 
accounting of tens of thousands of “disappearances*” One Christian 
Democratic adviser explained to the law group that “We Christian 
Democrats haven't raised such issues because this isn*t the moment to 
start a confrontation with either the army or the private sector.” 24 

In short, despite the “momentary improvement in the conditions of 
free speech” that occurred during the election campaign, Guatemala 
did not meet the first condition of a free election* The rural masses were 
under army discipline and traumatized by mass killings and the absence 
of any vestige of rule of law, and the candidates were unable to raise 
openly the fundamental issues of the society* 

Free speech and rights of assembly were constrained in Nicaragua 
in 1984 by social pressures and threats and by a state of siege that had 
been terminated some six months prior to the November 1984 election.
