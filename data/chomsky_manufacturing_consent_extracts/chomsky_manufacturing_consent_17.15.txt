In El Salvador, the only substantial newspapers critical of the govern¬ 
ment, La Cronica del Pueblo and El Independiente —neither by any 
means radical papers—were closed in July 1980 and January 1981, re¬ 
spectively, the first because its top editor and two employees were 
murdered and mutilated by the security forces, the second because the 
army arrested its personnel and destroyed its plant.The church paper 
and radio station were repeatedly shut down by bombing attacks.No 
paper or station representing the principal opposition has been able to 
operate except clandestinely.Over thirty journalists have been mur¬ 
dered in El Salvador since the revolutionary junta took power.An 
intensified campaign against the press occurred just prior to the 1982 
election.
