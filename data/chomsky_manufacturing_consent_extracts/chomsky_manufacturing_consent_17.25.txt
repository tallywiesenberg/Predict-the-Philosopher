There are no 
papers or radio or television stations in Guatemala that express the 
views of the rebels or the majority Indian population or the lower 
classes in general, “At most, the variants reflect shades of strictly con¬ 
servative thinking/* 29 Given the extreme climate of fear* and threats for 
stepping out of line, even the conservative press is cautious and engages 
in continuous self-censorship.All the central topics that should be 
debated in this terrorized society are carefully avoided.30 

In Nicaragua, once again, there have been no reported deaths of 
journalists by state terrorists, nor even threats of personal violence.In 
1984, the majority of the fifty-odd radio stations were privately owned, 
and some of them provided their own news programs; four other inde¬ 
pendent producers supplied radio news programs without prior censor¬ 
ship.Foreign radio and television from commercial and U,S, 
propaganda sources broadcasting from Costa Rica, Honduras, and else¬ 
where were of growing importance in 1984.
