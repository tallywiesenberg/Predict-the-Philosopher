31 Two of the three newspa¬ 
pers were privately owned, one supportive of the government but 
critical of specific programs and actions, the other violently hostile.The 
latter, La Prensa , which represented the small, ultraconservative mi¬ 
nority and supported the contras and a foreign-sponsored invasion of 
the country, was allowed to operate throughout the 1984 election, al¬ 
though it was censored.The censorship still allowed the paper to 
publish manifestos of opposition groups and a pastoral letter critical of 
the regime.No comparable paper has been allowed to exist above¬ 
ground, even briefly, in El Salvador and Guatemala.There is no doubt that the media in Nicaragua have been under 
government constraint, with censorship and periodic emergency con¬ 
trols that seriously encroached on freedom of the press.
