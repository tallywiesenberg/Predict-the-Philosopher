noted, however, that Nicaragua is under foreign attack and in a state 
of serious warfare.John S. Nichols points out that under the U.S.Espionage Act of 1917, over one hundred publications were banned

threatened by the fighting, the range of public discussion tolerated

others that the control of the Nicaraguan media was virtually 
totalitarian, the diversity of ownership and opinion was unusual 
for a Third World country, particularly one at war.
