LEGITIMIZING VERSUS MEANINGLESS THIRD WORLD ELECTIONS 99 


Our conclusion is that the condition of freedom of the press necessary 
for a free election was dearly absent in El Salvador and Guatemala, and 
that it was partially met in Nicaragua.3.2.3.Freedom of organization of 
intermediate groups* 

Perhaps the most important fact about El Salvador in the two years 
prior to the election of March 1982 was the decimation of popular and 
private organizations that could pose any kind of challenge to the army 
and oligarchy.As we noted in chapter 2* this was the main thrust of 
policy of the revolutionary junta from late 1979 onward, and thousands 
of leaders were murdered and numerous organizations were destroyed 
or driven underground.The teachers 5 union was decimated by several 
hundred murders; the university was occupied* looted, and closed down 
by the army; organized student and professional groups were destroyed 
by arrests and killings, and even the peasant union sponsored by the 
AFL-CIO (i.e., supporters of the regime) had some one hundred of its 
organizers and leaders murdered between October 1979 and the elecÂ¬ 
tion of March 1982.
