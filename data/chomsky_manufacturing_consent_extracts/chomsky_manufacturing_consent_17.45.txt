In Guatemala, too, intermediate organizations such as peasant and 
trade unions, teacher and student groups, and professional organiza¬ 
tions have been regularly attacked by the armed forces since 1954- The 
process of demobilization of institutions threatening the dominant 
elites culminated in the early 1980s, when by government proclamation 
“illicit association 55 was made punishable by law.All groups “which 
follow, or are subordinated to, any totalitarian system of ideology” 
(evidently an exception is made of the Guatemalan armed forces and 
the national-security ideology) are illicit.Only the armed forces deter¬ 
mine when illicitness occurs.If General Mejia Victores finds the GAM 
mothers to be agents of subversion, they may be killed (see chapter 2).Unions, peasant groups, student and professional organizations have 
grown up periodically in Guatemala, only to be crushed by systematic 
murder as soon as their demands were pressed with any vigor.
