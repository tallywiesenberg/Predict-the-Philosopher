It should also be emphasized that no party could organize and run 
candidates in El Salvador that put high priority on terminating the war 
by negotiations with the rebels* What makes this especially important 
is that reporters and observers were unanimous in 1982 that the main 
thing the public wanted out of the election was peace.The propaganda 
formula for getting out the vote in 1982 was “ballots versus bullets,” 
with the implication that ballots were a possible route to a reduction 
in the use of bullets.If, in fact, no peace candidate was eligible to run, 
the election was a fraud for this reason alone* 

Defenders of these elections have argued that there was a substantial 
difference between the candidates, especially between D’Aubuisson and 
Duarte, so that voters had a meaningful choice.40 But D’Aubuisson and 
Duarte did not disagree on the central issue of interest to the Salvado¬ 
ran people—whether to fight to win, or to strive for a negotiated settle¬ 
ment with the rebels* Both were members of the war party, with only 
tactical differences* Although Duarte made occasional demagogic 
claims that he would talk with the rebels and bring about peace, he 
never spelled out a peace-making agenda, never went beyond suggest¬ 
ing “dialogue” (as opposed to “negotiations,” which imply the possibil¬ 
ity of substantive concessions), and never departed from the position 
that the rebels should lay down their arms and participate in the new 
“democracy” that Duarte and the army had established* 

Duarte joined the junta at a moment of severe crisis in March 1980, 
when all the progressive civilians had left and immediately after the 
murder of the Christian Democratic attorney-general, Mario Zamora, 
by the newly prospering death squads* It was clear that the army and 
affiliated death squads had embarked on a policy of large-scale massa¬ 
cre.Duarte provided the fig leaf and apologetics that the army needed 
for the second matanza .
