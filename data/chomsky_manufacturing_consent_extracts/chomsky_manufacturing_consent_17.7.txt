received U*S* support and protection, and could not have survived in 
El Salvador, unless he had made it clear that he was in basic accord with 
the aims of the U.S. administration and the Salvadoran army.From

1980 onward, Duarte always accepted fully the pursuit of a military 
solution and no compromise with “the subversives” (a phrase that 
Duarte uses continually, just as do the army and death-squad leaders).As Raymond Bonner points out, 

The repression in 1980 reached a magnitude surpassed only by the 
[first] maianza and was far worse than anything imagined under 
General Romero.... By the end of the year the number [mur¬ 
dered] had reached at least 9,000- Every day mutilated bodies, 
missing arms or heads, were found: behind shopping centers; 
stuffed in burlap bags and left on dusty rural roads; hurled over 
cliffs into ravines.42 

And through all of this, Duarte not only provided the facade of “re¬ 
form,” he regularly complimented the army for its loyal service.
