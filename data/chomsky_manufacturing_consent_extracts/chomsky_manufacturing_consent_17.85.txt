In brief, the Salvadoran public was never offered the option that the 
press itself acknowledged the voters craved.In Guatemala, as in El Salvador, no parties of the left participated 
in the 1984 election for a constituent assembly, and only one crippled 
party made a tentative but wholly ineffectual foray in the 1985 presiden¬ 
tial election.43 The main guerrilla movements were, of course, outside 
the electoral orbit.Their leaders would have been killed if ap¬ 
prehended, but they would not have participated anyway without a 
drastic alteration in basic social and electoral conditions.44 Even a 
centrist party like the Christian Democrats had suffered scores of mur¬ 
ders in the years 1980-83, and the current president of Guatemala, the 
Christian Democrat Vinicio Cerezo, survived three known assassina¬ 
tion attempts.
