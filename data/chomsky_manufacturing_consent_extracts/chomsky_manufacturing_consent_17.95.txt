As with Duane in El Salvador, the presence of Vinicio Cerezo as a 
candidate, and as the eventual winner in the 1985 election, raises the 
question of whether, despite the constraints on the left* Cerezo did not 
really offer a significant option to the voting public, Cerezo differenÂ¬ 
tiated himself from his electoral rivals* especially toward the end of the 
campaign and the runoff, by expressing compassion for the masses and 
a determination to make changes in the human-rights picture and mass 
poverty.He occasionally mentioned the need for structural reform* 
although he was not specific and stressed that the first requirement was 
to reestablish civilian control.He was quite clear, however, that if he 
were elected, his power would be nominal at first and would have to 
be enlarged while he was in office: 

The election will not bring automatic transfer of real power to the 
president.There will be a handover of formal power.What are my 
chances of consolidating that power?
