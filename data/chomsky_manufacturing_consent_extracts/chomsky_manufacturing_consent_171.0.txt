temperament for the job,” although “the Administration’s instinct has 
been to try to save a wayward young nation’s independence in spite of 
itself and, at times, despite its own leaders.” Washington is also alarmed 
by “Cambodia’s current effort to force the United States into a major 
conference that would embarrass its Thai and Vietnamese friends,” 
Frank el continues, an effort that will “be resisted”—referring to a 
conference that would settle border questions and guarantee Cam¬ 
bodia’s neutrality at a time when the United States was desperately 
seeking to undermine international efforts to neutralize South Vietnam, 
Laos, and Cambodia so as to avert the major war toward which the 
United States was driving because of its political weakness in Indo¬ 
china. 

This classic of colonialist paternalism reflects quite accurately the 
general mood of the day—as does the refusal to report such trivial 
matters as the regular U-S.-ARVN attacks on Cambodia, which have 
largely passed from history in the United States, apart from the dissi¬

of Cambodia 

On March 18,1969, the notorious “secret bombings” began. One week

reports circulating in the United States that he “would not oppose U.S. 
bombings of communist targets within my frontiers.” “Unarmed and 
innocent people have been victims of U.S. bombs,” including “the 
latest bombing, the victims of which were Khmer peasants, women and 
children in particular.” He then issued an appeal to the international 
press: “I appeal to you to publicize abroad this very clear stand of 
Cambodia—that is, I will in any case oppose all bombings on Cambo¬ 
dian territory under whatever pretext.” 45 

It will come as no surprise that his appeal went unanswered. Further¬ 
more, this material has been suppressed up to the present time, apart 
from the dissident literature. 46 The standard position within the main-
