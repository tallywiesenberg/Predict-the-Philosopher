stream* adopted by defenders of the bombing and critics as well* is that 
“Sihanouk did not protest” (William Shawcross), When the “secret 
bombings” became public knowledge in 1973* it was claimed that Siha¬ 
nouk had privately authorized bombing of Vietnamese bases near the 
border areas* True or false* that is irrelevant to the suppression of 
Sihanouk’s impassioned appeals* which referred to the bombing of 
Khmer peasants. Furthermore* as we observed in earlier discussion* 
st while commentators and media analysts may draw whatever conclu¬ 
sions they please from the conflicting evidence available, this does not 
entitle them to suppress what is* by any standards, crucial evidence* in 
this case* Sihanouk’s attempt to arouse international protest over the 
U*S* bombing of the civilian society.” 47 

Reviewing this period in his Cambodia Year Zero, Francois Pon- 
chaud remarks that Sihanouk called the U*S. bombings of “Vietcong 
bases” a “scandal and a crime over Radio Phnom Penh, but nobody was 
deceived*” Ponchaud and his readers* however* are deceived: Sihanouk 
publicly denounced the bombing and other attacks on Khmer peasants, 
and not only over Radio Phnom Penh but in quite public documents 
and appeals to the international press , In his Sideshow, Shawcross says 
only that Cambodia “continued to denounce” American air and artil¬ 
lery attacks through 1969, but “made no public protest that specifically 
mentioned B-52 attacks” (p* 94)—true* but irrelevant for the reasons 
repeated in the last paragraph. 48 

In May 1969, William Beecher reported B-52 raids on “Vietcong and 
North Vietnamese supply dumps and base camps in Cambodia*” citing 
U.S. sources, Beecher stated that “Cambodia has not made any pro¬ 
test*” disregarding Sihanouk’s appeals and his protest against the mur¬ 
der of “Khmer peasants* women and children in particular*” not 
Vietnamese military bases, Beecher also commented that “in the past, 
American and South Vietnamese forces had occasionally fired across 
the border and even called in fighters or helicopter gunships to counter 
fire they received from enemy units there,” ignoring the somewhat 
more important fact that U*S* aircraft and U*S -ARVN-South Korean 
forces had been attacking Cambodian villages, according to the 
“friendly” government of Cambodia, The headline for his article states 
falsely: “Raids in Cambodia by U,S, Unprotested,” Beecher’s article 
caused consternation in Washington* setting off the first stage of what 
later became the Watergate scandal. As we have commented elsewhere* 
“It is remarkable that Beecher’s unique though quite inadequate ac¬ 
count is now held up as evidence that the press maintained its honor 
throughout this period, despite the crimes of Richard Nixon.” 49
