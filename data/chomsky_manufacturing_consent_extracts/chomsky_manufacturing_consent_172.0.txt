coincided with similar efforts in Laos and Vietnam. The general reac¬ 
tion was similar throughout, and remains so- The post-Tet accelerated 
pacification campaign, which thoroughly demolished the civilian base 
of the NLF, was regarded as so uninteresting that it is passed over in 
virtual silence in the popular retrospectives- As for the wars in Laos and 
Cambodia, Elterntan comments, after reviewing the major media cover¬ 
age, that apart from the “alternative press,* 5 they were virtually “invisi¬ 
ble” in the press in 1969 when they were expanding to new heights as 
the U-S, Air Force was shifted from North Vietnam to Laos and Cam¬ 
bodia after the “bombing halt/* 50 

In March 1970, Cambodia was drawn irrevocably into the carnage 
sweeping Indochina. On March 18, Sihanouk was overthrown in “an 
upper-class coup, not a revolution,” carried out for “interests of domes¬ 
tic and political expedience,” and with at least “indirect U.S. support,” 
if not more, 51 Two days later, ARVN ground and air operations began 
in Svay Rieng Province, at the Vietnamese border, continuing through 
April and leading to the U.S.-ARVN invasion on April 29, conducted 
with an extreme brutality sometimes vividly depicted in the media, 
which were particularly appalled by the behavior of the ARVN forces. 
Much of the enormous civilian toll, however, resulted from air power, 
including U.S. bombing strikes that leveled or severely damaged towns 
and villages. 52 One effect of the invasion was to drive the Vietnamese 
forces away from the border and deeper into Cambodia, where they 
began to support the growing peasant resistance against the coup lead¬ 
ers. A second effect, as described by U.S. correspondent Richard Dud- 
man, who witnessed these events at first hand after his capture by the 
Cambodian resistance, was that “the bombing and shooting was radi¬ 
calizing the people of rural Cambodia and was turning the countryside 
into a massive, dedicated, and effective revolutionary base.” 53 Cam¬ 
bodia was now plunged into civil war, with increasing savagery on both 
sides. 

U.S. bombing continued at a high level after the withdrawal of U.S. 
forces from Cambodia, By late 1971, an investigating team of the Gen¬ 
eral Accounting Office concluded that U.S. and Saigon army bombing 
is “a very significant cause of refugees and civilian casualties,” estimat¬ 
ing that almost a third of the seven-million population may be refugees. 
U.S. intelligence reported that “what the villagers feared most was the 
possibility of indiscriminate artillery and air strikes,” and refugee re¬ 
ports and other sources confirm that these were the major cause of 
civilian casualties and the flight of refugees. 54
