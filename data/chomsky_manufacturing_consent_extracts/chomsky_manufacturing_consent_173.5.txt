ing on the wreckage of the democratic republic it set out to create* 1 with 
the coup that overthrew Sihanouk. 64 The Americans try, but with little 
success, to “give the Cambodians some sense of confidence in their 
leadership, 55 but, nevertheless, “Cambodian morale has been sliding 
steadily for a long time/ 5 However, “Rather than any sense of urgency 
here [in Phnom Penh], there is the grand fatalism that is so much a part 
of Cambodia's Hindu-influenced Buddhism,” 65 although it somehow 
does not seem to affect “the enemy, 55 whose “determination” in the face 
of the awesome firepower unleashed against them “baffles” the Ameri¬ 
cans, But there is still “a feeling that the Americans will save the 
Cambodians at the last minute because they cannot save themselves* 55 
“Almost every conversation with a Cambodian now is the same,” 
namely, fear that the “demoralized army will collapse” when the 
American bombing terminates on August 15. The impending bombing 
cutoff is “painful 55 to the “Cambodians” because of “the recent steady 
successes of enemy troops 55 against overwhelming odds. In his final 
summary report from Phnom Penh as the U.S* bombing ended, Sydney 
Schanberg raised “the key unanswered question: How have the insur¬ 
gents—without any planes of their own, and without the extensive 
artillery support the Government troops have, with only small arms and 
mobile weapons * . *—been able not just to match the Government 
forces, which are more than twice their size, but to push the Govern¬ 
ment forces back and sustain the offensive for six months without any 
significant lull? 55 “Since the insurgents are not superhuman, there must 
be other explanations for their success. 55 Perhaps they are so “deter¬ 
mined and capable 55 because they “are less fatalistic than the Khmers 
on this side 55 and “believe they can change their environment 55 (U-S. 
embassy official). In this regard, “the enemy 55 are quite different from 
“the Cambodian villager, 55 who “usually has no politics 55 and “is not 
interested in taking sides, only to be left alone to farm and fish and feed 
his family and once in a while to celebrate on a Buddhist holiday. 5566 

The civil war, then, pits “the Cambodians” against “the enemy, 55 
Cambodian peasants who were surely not full of pleasantries during the 
pre-1973 U.S. bombings. “The Cambodians, 55 fatalistic and resigned, 
either want to be left alone (“the Cambodian villager 55 ) or hope that the 
United States will save them and their government, striving for democ¬ 
racy (“the Cambodians 55 generally)* The enemy struggle on successfully 
against overwhelming odds, baffling the Americans—exactly as Ameri¬ 
cans building “democracy 55 have been baffled by the same problem in
