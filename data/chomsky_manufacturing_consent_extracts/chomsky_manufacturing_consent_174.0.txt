South Vietnam, Central America, and many other places. Since these 
are the conclusions drawn from “almost every conversation with a 
Cambodian, 55 they are surely realistic, at least as long as we understand

that “Cambodians” are those Cambodians who are not “the enemy” of 
the objective press, just as “South Vietnamese” were South Vietnamese 
collaborating with the U,S. aggressors. 

The framework is the usual one, although perhaps a shade more 
egregious in the light of what might have been passing through the 
minds of those Cambodians who were not “Cambodians” during phase 
I of the genocide. 

About that topic, we learn very little from the media. The refugees 
flooding Phnom Penh and other areas where U.S. reporters traveled 
were virtually ignored. To gain a measure of this remarkable fact, let 
us review the reports during these months in the New York Times, most 
of them by its Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent Sydney Schan¬ 
berg, who, more than any other U.S. reporter, came to be regarded as 
the conscience of the media with regard to Cambodia. 

Schanberg arrived in Phnom Penh in May 1973, at the height of the 
intensified bombing, which continued until the mid-August halt. Dur¬ 
ing this period, the Times published twenty-seven of his reports from 
Cambodia, many of them long and detailed, along with a column in 
which he expressed his contempt for the “so-called international press 
corps” who spend their time “interviewing each other” in the Hotel Le 
Phnom. 67 

From the outset, Schanberg reports “refugees pouring into the city,” 
but there are no interviews with refugees who relate the circumstances 
of life under the bombs. We hear a “well to do Cambodian woman” who 
tells us that “The bombing is terrible”; she is “not frightened, just 
annoyed—because it wakes my baby up every night in the middle of 
the night, and I have to get up” (May 3), But those villagers who want 
to be left alone are not granted the opportunity to relay their accounts 
of somewhat more serious concerns, apart from a few scattered phrases, 
and there is not a word to suggest that refugees might have had any 
attitude, apart from fear, with regard to those “determined” fighters 
who “believe they can change their environment,” although plainly 
they had a solid base in the peasant society that was being torn to shreds 
by saturation bombing. As in Laos a few years earlier, the refugees 
simply had the wrong tale to tell, and the kinds of stories that readily 
flow if one is sufficiently interested to inquire are lacking here.
