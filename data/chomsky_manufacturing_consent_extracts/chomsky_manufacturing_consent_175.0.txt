Luoog—in error—killing many government soldiers and their families. 
This is the sole example of American bombing that was shown in the 
film The Killing Fields^ the only depiction there of phase I of the 
genocide, a memory that is acceptable since it was plainly an error.

March 25 through August i8. 6S One quotes a villager who says “The 
bombers may kill some Communists but they kill everyone else, too” 
(Browne, April 11), but we found no other examples of reactions by the 
victims, although there is a picture of a Cambodian soldier weeping for 
his wife and ten children killed in the bombing of Neak Luong by error 
(Aug. 10). 

In forty-five columns, then, there are three in which victims of U.S. 
bombing are granted a few phrases to describe what is happening in 
Cambodia, Not a single column seeks to explore the reactions of the 
refugees not far from the Hotel Le Phnom, or in Battambang, or in the 
far more miserable refugee camps in the countryside nearby; or to 
attempt to develop some sense of what must have been happening 
under the frenzied bombing of these months* Recall that in Phnom 
Penh alone there were almost 1*5 million refugees who had fled from 
the countryside, some, surely, who must have had some information to 
relate about phase I of the genocide at its peak. The reader could no 
doubt ascertain that terrible things were happening in the Cambodian 
countryside, but what they were remains obscure, and the Americans 
are explicitly exonerated, apart from the error of bombing the wrong 
village* 

The story remained much the same as phase I of the genocide 
continued. The horrors in Phnom Penh itself were sometimes vividly 
described, primarily abroad, 69 but there was little effort to determine 
what was happening in the areas held by the enemy of the U*S. govern¬ 
ment—hence the enemy of the U,S, press; virtually the entire country 
as “the Cambodians” were confined to urban centers swelled by a huge 
flood of refugees who remain as hidden from view as those in the 
teeming slums of Saigon or the camps around Vientiane. 

Western correspondents evacuated from Phnom Penh after the 
Khmer Rouge victory were able to obtain a fleeting picture of what had 
taken place in the countiyside, British correspondent Jon Swain sum¬ 
marizes his impressions as follows: 

The United States has much to answer for here, not only in terms
