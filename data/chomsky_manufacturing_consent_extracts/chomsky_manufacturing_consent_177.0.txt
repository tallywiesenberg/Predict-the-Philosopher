ture,” As we repeatedly stressed, in this chapter of a two-volume study 
on U.S. policy and ideology, our concern remained the United States, 
not Indochina; our purpose was not to “establish the facts with regard to 
postwar Indochina” on the basis of the evidence available, but rather to 
examine the constructions developed on the basis of this evidence, 
to analyze the way this evidence was refracted “through the prism of 
Western ideology, a very different task.” 78 The conclusions drawn there

remain valid. To our knowledge, no error or even misleading statement 
or omission has been found. 79 

This review of an impressive propaganda exercise aroused great 
outrage—not at all surprisingly: the response within Soviet domains is 
similar, as are the reasons, when dissidents expose propaganda fabrica¬ 
tions with regard to the United States, Israel, and other official enemies. 
Indignant commentators depicted us as “apologists for Khmer Rouge 
crimes” 80 —in a study that denounced Khmer Rouge atrocities (a fact 
always suppressed) and then proceeded to demonstrate the remarkable 
character of Western propaganda, our topic throughout the two-vol¬ 
ume study in which this chapter appeared. There was also a new wave 
of falsification, often unanswerable when journals refused to permit 
response. We will not review these further propaganda exercises here, 
but merely note that they provide an intriguing expression of what, in 
other contexts, is described as the totalitarian mentality: it is not enough 
to denounce official enemies; it is also necessary to guard with vigilance 
the right to lie in the service of power. The reaction to our challenge 
to this sacred right again fits neatly within the expectations of a propa¬ 
ganda model, standing alongside the Freedom House attack on the 
media for failure to serve state policy with sufficient vigor and opti¬ 
mism. 

By early 1977, denunciations of the Khmer Rouge for having caused 
unprecedented “murder in a gentle land” and “autogenocide” extended 
from mass circulation journals such as Reader's Digest (with tens of 
millions of readers) and TV Guide (circulation nineteen million), to the 
New York Review of Books and the media generally, in addition to a 
best-selling book by John Barron and Anthony Paul based on their 
Reader’s Digest article and the widely misquoted study by Francois 
Ponchaud mentioned earlier. Similar material continued to flow in 
abundance in the press and newsweeklies, the New York Times Maga¬ 
zine and elsewhere. Evidence about the 1977-78 period became availa¬ 
ble primarily after the Vietnamese expulsion of the Khmer Rouge 
regime, which brought phase II of the genocide to a close, eliciting new 
outrage over the alleged “genocide” brought about by the “Prussians
