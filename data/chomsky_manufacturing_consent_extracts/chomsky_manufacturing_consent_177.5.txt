of Asia.” 

The picture created by this chorus of denunciation, from the first 
days of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) in 1975, is described sardonically 
by Michael Vickery as “the standard total view” (STV), According to 
the STV, prior to the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, Cambodia 
had been a “gentle land” (Barron and Paul) of “gentle if emotional 
people” who “wanted only to live in peace in their lush kingdom” (Jack 
Anderson), a land in which hunger was “almost unknown” (Henry

Kamm). But in 1975, the “formerly fun-loving, easy-going Cambodi¬ 
ans” were subjected to the “harsh regime” of the Khmer Rouge, who 
ordered that all those not under their rule before the victory can be 
“disposed of” because they are “no longer required,” even if only one 
million Khmers remain (Donald Wise, citing several of the frequently 
quoted Khmer Rouge statements that were conceded to be fabrica¬ 
tions), 81 

According to the STV, during the pre-1977 period on which the 
conclusions were based, the Khmer Rouge leadership was engaged in 
a policy of systematic extermination and destruction of all organized 
social and cultural life apart from the Gulag run by the “nine men at 
the top,” Paris-trained Communists, without local variation and with 
no cause other than inexplicable sadism and Marxist-Leninist dogma. 
By early 1977, it was alleged that they had “boasted” of having slaugh¬ 
tered some two million people (Jean Lacouture in the New York Re¬ 
view). This figure remained the standard even after Lacouture 
withdrew it a few weeks later, acknowledging that he had misread his 
source (Ponchaud) and that the actual figure might be in the thousands, 
but adding that he saw little significance to a difference between thou¬ 
sands killed and a “boast” of two million killed. This position expresses 
with some clarity the general attitude toward fact during this period and 
since, as does his further statement that it is hardly important to deter¬ 
mine “exactly which person uttered an inhuman phrase”—the case in 
question had to do with inhuman phrases he attributed to Khmer 
Rouge officials but which turned out to be mistranslations of phrases 
that had been fabricated outright by his source (Ponchaud) or that had 
appeared not in a Cambodian journal, as he asserted, but in a Thai 
journal mistranslated by Ponchaud that expressed virtually the oppo¬ 
site of what was claimed. The two-million figure was later upgraded to 
three million or more, often citing Vietnamese wartime propaganda. 
The examples are quite typical. 

Not everyone joined in the chorus. The most striking exceptions 
were those who had the best access to information from Cambodia,
