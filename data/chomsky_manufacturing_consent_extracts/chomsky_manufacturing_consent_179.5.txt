David Hawk alleges that “it is common knowledge that Reagan- 
administration political officers and defence attaches from the US Em¬ 
bassy in Bangkok have visited Khmer Rouge enclaves.” 93 

The reasons for supporting the Thai-based DK coalition go beyond

their “continuity” with the Khmer Rouge regime, A more fundamental 
reason was outlined by our ally Deng Xiaoping in 1979: “It is wise to 
force the Vietnamese to stay in Kampuchea because that way they will 
suffer more and more and will not be able to extend their hand to 
Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore.” 94 This motive of “bleeding Viet¬ 
nam” to ensure that it does not recover from its victimization at the 
hands of the West has additional advantages. By acting in such a way 
as to enhance suffering and repression in Indochina, we demonstrate 
retrospectively the “benevolence” of our “noble crusade” of earlier 
years. 

As we discussed earlier, the Cambodians were “worthy victims” 
when they were being terrorized by the Khmer Rouge under phase II 
of the genocide, and they achieved this status once again after the 
Vietnamese invasion brought phase II of the genocide to an end, al¬ 
though with a change in the cast of characters, as the United States 
joined China in support of the Khmer Rouge. After early efforts to 
charge the Vietnamese with “genocide,” the condemnation of the offi¬ 
cial enemy shifted to the terrible acts of “the Prussians of Asia,” who 
have “subjugated and impoverished” Cambodia since overthrowing Pol 
Pot, according to the editors of the New York Times. Recall that of ail 
the horrors of the past years, including the atrocities of phase I, “what 
cannot be sponged away” are “the Khmer Rouge's butcheries”—evi¬ 
dently of lesser moment in Washington now that the Pol Pot forces 
qualify as resistance forces under the Reagan doctrine. 

One would be hard put to find any serious observers of the current 
Cambodian scene who believe that the Vietnamese have reduced Cam¬ 
bodia to a level below that of the DK period, as these comments imply. 
Rather, among people who are concerned about the people of Cam¬ 
bodia for themselves and not merely because of their value for propa¬ 
ganda exercises, few would question that “it is clear that life for the 
people is far better now than under Democratic Kampuchea,” 95 and 
some Cambodia specialists have suggested that the current regime com¬ 
pares favorably with any of its predecessors- Consistent opponents of 
aggression would have a moral basis for condemning the Vietnamese 
invasion, despite the rapidly escalating atrocities of 1977-78 and the 
murderous raids against Vietnam by Cambodian forces under Pol Pot's 
rule. 96 It is a little difficult to take this argument seriously, however,
