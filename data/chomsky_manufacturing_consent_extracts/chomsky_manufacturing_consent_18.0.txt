In December 1994, only eleven months after NAFTA went into effect, 
Mexico suffered a major financial crisis, including a massive flight of cap¬ 
ital, a devaluation of the currency, and a subsequent bailout by the IMF 
that required Mexico to carry out painful deflationary measures. Despite 
the fact that the meltdown occurred within a year of the introduction of 
NAFTA, which the media had portrayed as ushering in a prospective

golden age of economic advance, they were unanimous that NAFTA 
was not to blame. And in virtual lock-step they supported the Mexican 
(investor) bailout, despite poll reports of general public opposition in the 
United States* Experts and media pundits and editorialists repeatedly 
explained that one great merit of NAFTA was that it had “locked Mexico 
in” so that it couldn’t alter its overall policy direction or resort to controls 
to protect itself from severe deflation and unemployment. They were 
oblivious to the profoundly undemocratic nature of this lock-in, made 
more questionable by the fact that it had been negotiated by a Mexican 
government that ruled as a result of electoral fraud. 110 

More recently, when the growing global opposition to the policies of 
the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank led to mass protests at the WTO 
conference in Seattle in November and December 1999, and then at the 
annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D*C*, in 
April 2000, media coverage of these events was derisive and hostile to the 
protesters and almost uniformly failed to deal with the substantive issues 
that drove the protests* The media portrayed the Seattle protesters as “all¬ 
purpose agitators” (U.S. News & World Report) y “terminally aggrieved” 
(Philadelphia Inquirer ) 3 simply “against world trade 55 (ABC News), and 
making “much ado about nothing” (CNN), but the bases of the protest¬ 
ers’ grievances were almost entirely unexplored* 111 Similarly, in the case 
of the Washington, D.C., protests, the media repeatedly reported on 
activists’ attire, looks, body odors, fadism, and claimed a lack of “any¬ 
thing that can coherently be called a cause” (Michael Kelly, journalist, 
Washington Post ), and they continued their refusal to address issues* 112 
There were many informed protesters with coherent agendas at Seattle 
and Washington—including reputable economists, social theorists, and 
veteran organizers from around the world 113 —but the media did not seek 
them out, preferring to stereotype antiglobalization activists as ignorant 
troublemakers* On op-ed pages, there was a major imbalance hostile to 
the protesters. TV bias was at least as great, and often misleading on the 
facts* In his November 29,1999, backgrounder on the WTO, Dan Rather 
explained that the organization had ruled on many environmental issues, 
implying that those rulings were protective of the environment when in 
fact they generally privileged trade rights over environmental needs* 

Another notable feature of media reporting on both the Seattle and 
Washington, D.C., protests, and a throwback to their biased treatment 
of the protests of the Vietnam War era (1965-75), 114 was their exaggera¬ 
tion of protester violence, their downplaying of police provocations 
and violence, and their complaisance at illegal police tactics designed to 
limit all protestor actions, peaceable or otherwise* 115 Although the Seattle

police resorted to force and used chemical agents against many nonvio¬ 
lent protesters well before a handful of individuals began breaking win¬ 
dows* both then and later the media reversed this chronology* stating that 
the police violence was a response to protester violence. In fact* the van¬ 
dals were largely ignored by the police* while peaceful protesters were 
targeted for beatings, tear gas* torture with pepper spray* and arrest, 116 
One New York Times article went so far as to claim that the Seattle pro¬ 
testers had thrown excrement* rocks, and Molotov cocktails at delegates 
and police officers; the Times later issued a correction acknowledging that 
these claims were false* 117 Dan Rather, who had falsely alleged that the 
protesters had “brought on today’s crackdown” at Seattle, later suggested 
that the Washington protesters were possibly “hoping for a replay of last 
year’s violence in Seattle* 5 * setting this off against “those charged with 
keeping the peace” who “have other ideas ” 113 

In their eighty-scven-page report* Out of Control: Seattle Flawed Re¬ 
sponse to Protests Against the World Trade Organization^ the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that “demonstrators [in Seattle] were 
overwhelmingly peaceful* Not so the police *” The response of the Seattle 
police to the protests was characterized by “draconian” violations of civil 
liberties* including widespread use of ^chemical weapons* rubber bullets 
and clubs against peaceful protesters and bystanders alike. 55 But NBC* 
ABC* CBS, CNN, and the New York Times and Washington Post all ig¬ 
nored the release of the ACLU’s findings, which ran counter to their own 
uniformly pro-police and anti-protester line* 

The media’s reversal of chronology and inflation of the threat of ac¬ 
tivist violence* and their low-keyed treatment of numerous illegal police 
actions designed to instill fear in those wanting to protest peaceably, 119 
provided the enabling ground for both police violence and serious 
restrictions on free speech* These increased in scope and sophistication 
between Seattle and Washington* and were then applied to squelch pro¬ 
test at the Republican and Democratic conventions in Philadelphia and 
Los Angeles in July and August 2000* 120 The corporate media’s hostility 
to the goals of the protests* closely aligned with that of the rest of the cor¬
