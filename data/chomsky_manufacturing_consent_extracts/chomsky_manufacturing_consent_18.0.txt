During the election campaign* Cerezo never straightforwardly ad¬ 
dressed the question of land reform* and news reports in Guatemala 
suggested that he had promised the landowners’ lobby that land reform 
was not on his agenda, 48 Similarly, he did not promise any legal action 
against those who had murdered thousands* nor did he say that he 
would dismantle the counterinsurgency state.There would seem to 
have been at least a tacit understanding between Cerezo and the mili¬ 
tary that he would protect them against prosecution and preserve their 
power and relative autonomy; in fact, he could not do otherwise and 
survive.49 In the year and a half that has elapsed since he took office*

Cerezo has made no meaningful move toward land reform, has sup¬ 
ported the army vigorously against any accounting, and has made no 
move to dismantle the civil patrols, the development poles, and other 
features of institutionalized terror* 50 The human-rights situation in 
Guatemala “remains terrible,” 51 although improved (but partly because 
higher rates of killing are no longer deemed beneficial).The poor, for 
whom he expressed so much compassion during the electoral campaign, 
have suffered further losses in real income, as Cerezo’s “reforms” have 
accommodated the demands of the army and oligarchy.
