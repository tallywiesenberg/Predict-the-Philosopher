He is on very 
poor terms with the Mutual Support Group, Thus, the postelection 
pattern shows that Cerezo, in pan by prior agreement but more deci¬ 
sively by structural constraints, has been entirely unable to serve his 
mass constituency.In the 1984-85 election, Cerezo gave the Guatema¬ 
lan people an opportunity to vote for a man of seeming goodwill and 
good intentions, but one unable to respond to democratic demands 
opposed by the real rulers of the state.In Nicaragua, in 1984, the spectrum of candidates was much wider

The Conservative Democratic party and the Independent Liberal party 
both issued strong calls for respect for private property, reduced gov¬ 
ernment control of the economy, elimination of press and other con¬ 
trols, and a foreign policy of greater nonalignment and accommodation.Both were able to denounce the Sandinistas for the war and to call for 
depoliticization of the army and negotiations with the contras.
