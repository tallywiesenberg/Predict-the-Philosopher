...Generally 
speaking* in this campaign the FSLK did little more to take adÂ¬ 
vantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere 
(including the United States) routinely do* and considerably less 
than ruling parties in other Larin American countries traditionally 
have done.55 

We would conclude that the ability of candidates to qualify and run* 
and the range of options* was substantially greater in Nicaragua than 
in El Salvador and Guatemala.
