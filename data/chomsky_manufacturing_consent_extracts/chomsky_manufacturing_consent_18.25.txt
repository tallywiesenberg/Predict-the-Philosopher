Even William Doherty of the American Institute for Free Labor Devel¬ 
opment—a longtime supporter of U.S. policy in El Salvador—asserted 
before a congressional committee that there was no system of justice 
operative in that country, while Leonel Gomex, a former land-reform 
official in El Salvador, told the same committee a bit later that state 
terror had put the population in a state of “fearful passivity.” 56 

In Guatemala* too, the endemic fear based on years of unconstrained 
and continuing army violence was a dominant fact of national life.According to Americas Watch* writing in early 1985* 

Torture* killings* and disappearances continue at an extraordinary 
rate* and millions of peasants remain under the strict scrutiny and 
control of the government through the use of civil patrols and 
“model villages.” Guatemala remains, in short, a nation of prison¬ 
ers.57 



106 MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


The law group described Guatemala in 1985 as “a country where the 
greater part of the people live in permanent fear.” 58 

In the case of Nicaragua* we repeat the central fact that differentiates 
it from the U.S. client states: in 1984 its government was not murdering 
civilians.5 * The main fear of ordinary citizens in Nicaragua was of 
violence by the contras and the United States, 

Our conclusion is that the fifth condition for a free election was met 
in Nicaragua, but not in El Salvador and Guatemala.And our overall 
finding is that neither El Salvador nor Guatemala met any of the five 
basic conditions of a free election, whereas Nicaragua met some of 
them well, others to a lesser extent.
