3.3* THE COERCION PACKAGES 
IN EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, 
AND NICARAGUA 

As we noted, in the U.S. government’s sponsored elections, voter turn¬ 
out is interpreted as public support for the election and its sponsors.In disapproved elections (here, Nicaragua), this frame is abandoned, 
and voter turnout is either ignored or declared meaningless because of 
limited options or coercive threats by the authorities.But the question 
of coercive threats should clearly be raised in all cases where this is a 
potential problem.As we have just described, the elections in El Salva¬ 
dor were held under conditions of military rule where mass killings of 
“subversives” had taken place and a climate of fear had been estab¬ 
lished.If the government then sponsors an election and the local mili¬ 
tary authorities urge people to vote, a significant part of the vote should 
be assumed to be a result of built-in coercion.
