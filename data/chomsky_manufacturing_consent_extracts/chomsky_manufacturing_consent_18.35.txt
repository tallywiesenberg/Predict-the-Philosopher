A propaganda model 
would anticipate that the U.S. mass media make no such assumption, 
and they did not.In El Salvador in 1982 and 1984, voting was also required by law.The 
law stipulated that failure to vote was to be penalized by a specific 
monetary assessment, and it also called on local authorities to check out 
whether voters did in fact vote.This could be done because at the time 
of voting one’s identification card (ID, cedula) was stamped, acknowl¬ 
edging the casting of a vote.Anybody stopped by the army and police 
would have to show the ID card, which would quickly indicate whether 
the individual had carried out his or her patriotic duty.
