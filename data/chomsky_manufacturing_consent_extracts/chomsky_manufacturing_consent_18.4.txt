regarded as an act of treason.And in the 1984 election, “Advertising by 
the government and military prior to the elections stressed the obliga¬ 
tion to vote rather than the freedom to vote.” 60 Given the climate of 
fear, the voting requirement, the ID stamp, the army warning, and the 
army record in handling “traitors,” it is evident that the coercive ele¬

newspaper ads sponsored by the army asserted that it was treasonous 
to fail to vote or to vote null or blank.
