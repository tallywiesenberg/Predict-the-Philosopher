62 The law group reported that 
“many” people expressed fears that nonvoting would subject them to 
reprisals, and after the military threats in the week before the election 
there was “a widespread belief that failure to vote would be punishable 
by more than the fivt-quetzal fine stipulated by law.” 63 

In Nicaragua, while registration was obligatory, voting was not re¬ 
quired by law.Voter-registration cards presented on election day were 
retained by election officials, so that the failure to vote as evidenced by 
the lack of a validated voter credential could not be used as the basis 
of reprisals.64 Most of the voters appeared to LASA observers to be 
voting under no coercive threat—they did not have to vote by Jaw; they 
were urged to vote but not threatened with the designation of “traitors” 
for not voting; there were no obvious means of identifying nonvoters; 
and the government did not kill dissidents, in contrast to the normal 
practice in El Salvador and Guatemala.In sum, Nicaragua did not have a potent coercion package at work 
to help get out the vote—as did the Salvadoran and Guatemalan gov¬ 
ernments.3.4.
