EL SALVADOR: HOW THE 
U.S. MEDIA TRANSFORMED A 
“DERANGED KILLING 
MACHINE” INTO THE 
PROTECTOR OF AN INCIPIENT 
DEMOCRACY 


In reporting on the 1982 Salvadoran election, the U.S. mass media

media outlet* particularly the networks* cast the election-day story in 
a framework of voting in the midst of extensive guerrilla violence at 
polling places,” 66 Warren Hoge and Richard Meislin, of the New York 
Times , repeated day after day that the rebels were threatening disrup¬ 
tion* Hoge asserting that “The elections have taken on a significance 
beyond their outcome because leftist guerrillas mounted a campaign to 
disrupt them and discourage voters from going to the polls.” 67 This is 
a precise statement of the government's propaganda frame.But Hoge 
and Meislin never once cited a rebel source vowing disruption* and 
nobody else did* either.On election day no voters were killed or polling 
stations attacked* and the general level of rebel military activity was 
below average.In short* the disruption claims were falsifications of both 
plans and election-day results* but as they fit the patriotic agenda they 
were given prominence* repeated frequently* and used to establish the 
contest between the forces of good and evil.
