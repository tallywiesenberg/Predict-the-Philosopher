The 
destruction of La Gronica and El Independiente and the murder of 
twenty-six journalists prior to the election were unmentioned in disÂ¬ 
cussing the election's quality and meaning.70 The army and its allies had 
been killing civilians on a massive scale in El Salvador* for many months

and, in conjunction with a state of siege, somewhat encumber free 
debate and free choice?The point was rarely even hinted at in the mass 
media.Could candidates run freely and campaign without fear of murder?Could the rebels qualify and run?
