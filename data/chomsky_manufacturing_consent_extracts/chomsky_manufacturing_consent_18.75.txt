This 
is in accordance with the hypothesis that the real purpose of the elec¬ 
tion was to placate the home population of the United States and render 
them willing to fund more war and terror.It is a poor fit to the hypothe¬ 
sis that the people of El Salvador had a free choice.An honest press 
would point up the failure of the election to substitute “ballots for 
bullets,” The mass media of the United States did not raise the issue.Nor did the experience of 1982 and its aftermath affect the media’s

coverage of the Salvadoran and Nicaraguan elections*

OPTS FOR MODERATION” 73 

The U,S, government was less deeply involved in the Guatemalan 
elections of 1984 and 1985 than it was in those held in El Salvador, but, 
as we saw in chapter 2, the Reagan administration went to great pains 
to put a favorable gloss on the murderous regimes of Lucas Garcia, Rios 
Montt, and Mejia Victores, and to attempt to reintegrate them fully into 
the free-world alliance* 74 It encouraged the 1984-85 elections, provided 
advisory and financial support for election management, and gave pub¬ 
lic-relations assistance and sent official observers to help put the elec¬ 
tion in a favorable light* There was little effort made to disguise the fact 
that the purpose of the election, from the standpoint of the Reagan 
administration and the ruling army, was to alter the international 
“image” of Guatemala in order to facilitate aid and loans* 

With the administration supporting the new look, but without the 
intensity of commitment and propaganda backup brought to bear in El 
Salvador, and given the steady stream of reports of ongoing mass 
murder in Guatemala, a propaganda model would anticipate a media 
response that put the Guatemalan elections in a favorable light, but 
with qualifications* There was, in fact, far less coverage than of the 
Salvadoran election; what there was had a little more “balance,” but the 
apologetic framework was still overwhelmingly dominant* 

A telling manifestation of bias was the media’s ready acceptance of 
the Guatemalan elections as meaningful, even though they were admit¬ 
tedly for image-making, in a context of long-standing army rule and 
massacre, and despite new institutional arrangements in the country¬ 
side—the massive relocations of the population, the “model villages,” 
and the civil-defense patrols—that were, on their face, incompatible 
with a free election* In an enemy state where an election was held under 
comparable conditions, it would be designated a meaningless public- 
relations exercise* 75 In the case of Guatemala, however, the civil patrols 
and ongoing massacres were rarely mentioned, sources that addressed 
these matters were ignored, and the overall tone of the news was 
cautiously hopeful and optimistic* It was the consensus that the 1984

election for a constituent assembly was “encouraging” and an impor¬ 
tant first step, and that the 1985 presidential election “ended [emphasis 
added] more than 30 years of military domination” ( Newsweek, Jan. 17, 
1986}.Dan Rather, on CBS News, reported that Cerezo became 
GuatemaJa’s “first civilian leader after thirty years of almost uninter¬ 
rupted military rule” (Dec. 9,1985), This is ambiguous, but the implica¬ 
tion, directly asserted by Newsweek, is that Cerezo, not the army, rules .
