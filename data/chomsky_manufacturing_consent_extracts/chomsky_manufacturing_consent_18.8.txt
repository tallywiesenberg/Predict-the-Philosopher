Julio Mendez Montenegro was a civilian president from 1966 to 1970, 
but he did not rule, and he was eventually discredited by the fact that 
he presided over a huge escalation of army violence.Given the earlier 
experience, the fact that the generals had made it clear that the civilian 
government was “a project” of the military, 76 and Cerezo’s own ex¬ 
pressed reservations about his power, objective news reporting would 
have been careful about an alleged ending of military rule.As in the case of El Salvador, the murderous rule of the Guatemalan 
generals did not delegitimize them for the U.S. mass media nor suggest 
any possible justice to the rebel cause.Time noted (Feb. 27,1984) that 
a leftist insurgency “poses a permanent challenge to the regime,” but 
it did not inquire into the roots of this insurgency or suggest that its 
leaders constituted a “main opposition” whose ability to run would be 
an “acid test” of election integrity (as they pronounced in Nicaragua).Time also did not observe that the regime poses a permanent challenge 
to the survival of its population.
