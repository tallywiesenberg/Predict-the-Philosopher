The mass murders of the Guatemalan 
state were even semi-justified by the unquestioned need to quell insur¬ 
gents—“Much of the killing,” says Time, “is linked to Mejia’s success 
against the insurgents.” The phrase “linked to” is an apologetic euphe¬ 
mism to obscure the fact that Mejia’s “success” was based on the mass 
murder of men, women, and children in literally hundreds of destroyed 
villages.77 Mejia has a “mixed record,” with the mass murder offset by 
“improvements in some important areas” (the State Department, 
quoted by Time).Mejia, says Time, “won support because he has kept 
the promises he made after seizing power.” Time never explains how 
it determined that Mejia “won support,” or from whom, other than the 
U.S. State Department.Was the press then free to speak out?Did a 
system of justice come into being?
