Spokespersons for 
the insurgents—what in Nicaragua would be labeled the “main opposi¬ 
tion”—the smaller parties, spokespersons for popular organizations, 
the churches, human-rights groups, and ordinary citizens, were essen¬ 
tially ignored by the media.Time f Newsweek and CBS News almost 
never talked to ordinary citizens or spokespersons for the insurgents.Stephen Kinzer, in the Times> had only one citation to a rebel source 
in several dozen articles on Guatemala during the election periods, 
although on election day in 1984 he did speak with a number of ordinary 
citizens (who gave a much less optimistic view than Kinzer’s usual 
sources).The restricted menu of media sources flows from and reinforces the 
media’s propensity to adopt a patriotic agenda.U.S. government offi¬ 
cials and observers are always optimistic and hopeful in their state¬ 
ments about sponsored elections.
