when it is put forth by people who condemn the West for not having 
undertaken more vigorous actions to “rescue” the Cambodians from 
Pol Pot—a “rescue” that would have been no less self-serving in intent 
than the Vietnamese invasion, as history makes ciear. And we need not 
tarry over the argument when it is offered by those who tolerate or

applaud murderous aggression when it suits their ends: the Indonesian 
invasion of Timor, the “liberation” of Lebanon by Israeli forces in 1982

6.2.8. Phase III at home: the great 
silence and the hidden potency of 
the 1 e f t 

Turning to the home front, phase III illustrates the expectations of a 
propaganda model in yet a different way. The truth about the response 
to the Pol Pot atrocities in the media and “the culture” in general, and 
the dramatic contrast to comparable examples where the United States 
bears primary responsibility, is not pleasant to contemplate. Since the 
facts are too overwhelming to refute, it is a better strategy simply to 
dispatch them to the memory hole. This task having been achieved with 
the customary alacrity, we may now observe with wonder that “The 
West awoke to the suffering of Kampuchea in autumn, 1979” (William 
Shawcross), and then go on to ruminate about the curious inability of 
the West, always consumed with self-flagellation, to perceive the atroci¬ 
ties of its enemies. 97 And so matters have proceeded in the latest phase 
of the sad tale of Cambodia. 

“There was silence in the mid-1970s during the mass murders by the 
Khmer Rouge” (Floyd Abrams), and “The atrocity stories coming out 
of Cambodia after 1975 quite simply were not believed” (David 
Hawk)—at a time when accusations of genocide of the Hitler-Stalin 
variety were resounding from the New York Times and Washington Post 
to the Reader's Digest and TV Guide to the New York Review of Books , 
and the mass media extensively. “The West woke up to the horror of 
what had happened only after the Vietnamese invasion” (Economist), 
and “hardly anyone outside, on Left or Right, had noticed [the horrors 
of the Pol Pot regime] at the time they were actually going on (1975- 
1978)” (Conor Cruise O’Brien)—that is, at the time when Jimmy Carter 
branded Pol Pot “the world’s worst violator of human rights,” and a 
British Foreign Office report condemned the regime for the death of 
“many hundreds of thousands of people.” 98 One might imagine that 
such outlandish claims could not pass without a raised eyebrow at least,
