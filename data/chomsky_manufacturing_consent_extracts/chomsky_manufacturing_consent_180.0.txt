when it is put forth by people who condemn the West for not having 
undertaken more vigorous actions to “rescue” the Cambodians from 
Pol Pot—a “rescue” that would have been no less self-serving in intent 
than the Vietnamese invasion, as history makes ciear. And we need not 
tarry over the argument when it is offered by those who tolerate or

applaud murderous aggression when it suits their ends: the Indonesian 
invasion of Timor, the “liberation” of Lebanon by Israeli forces in 1982 
(as the Times editors called it), or the “defense of South Vietnam/ 5 to

6.2.8. Phase III at home: the great 
silence and the hidden potency of 
the 1 e f t 

Turning to the home front, phase III illustrates the expectations of a 
propaganda model in yet a different way. The truth about the response 
to the Pol Pot atrocities in the media and “the culture” in general, and 
the dramatic contrast to comparable examples where the United States 
bears primary responsibility, is not pleasant to contemplate. Since the 
facts are too overwhelming to refute, it is a better strategy simply to 
dispatch them to the memory hole. This task having been achieved with 
the customary alacrity, we may now observe with wonder that “The 
West awoke to the suffering of Kampuchea in autumn, 1979” (William 
Shawcross), and then go on to ruminate about the curious inability of 
the West, always consumed with self-flagellation, to perceive the atroci¬ 
ties of its enemies. 97 And so matters have proceeded in the latest phase 
of the sad tale of Cambodia. 

“There was silence in the mid-1970s during the mass murders by the 
Khmer Rouge” (Floyd Abrams), and “The atrocity stories coming out 
of Cambodia after 1975 quite simply were not believed” (David 
Hawk)—at a time when accusations of genocide of the Hitler-Stalin 
variety were resounding from the New York Times and Washington Post 
to the Reader's Digest and TV Guide to the New York Review of Books , 
and the mass media extensively. “The West woke up to the horror of 
what had happened only after the Vietnamese invasion” (Economist), 
and “hardly anyone outside, on Left or Right, had noticed [the horrors 
of the Pol Pot regime] at the time they were actually going on (1975- 
1978)” (Conor Cruise O’Brien)—that is, at the time when Jimmy Carter 
branded Pol Pot “the world’s worst violator of human rights,” and a 
British Foreign Office report condemned the regime for the death of 
“many hundreds of thousands of people.” 98 One might imagine that 
such outlandish claims could not pass without a raised eyebrow at least, 
but that is to underestimate the ability of the ideological institutions to 
rally to a worthy cause: in this case, the cause of suppressing the truth

about the Western response to “the decade of the genocide” and other 
atrocities. 

That there was “silence” over Pol Pot atrocities was also an insistent 
claim right at the peak of the bitter outrage over Pol Pot genocide. Time 
magazine published a major article by David Aikman on July 31,1978, 
claiming that the Khmer Rouge “experiment in genocide” was being 
ignored, and adding a new twist that was also taken up with enthusiasm 
in the subsequent reconstruction of hisrory; “there are intellectuals in 
the West so committed to the twin Molochs of our day—‘liberation and 
‘revolution 5 —that they can actually defend what has happened in Cam¬ 
bodia”; “some political theorists have defended it* as George Bernard 
Shaw and other Western intellectuals defended the brutal social engi¬ 
neering in the Soviet Union during the 1930s.” No one was mentioned, 
for the simple reason that no one could be found to fit the bill, although 
Time did vainly attempt to elicit positive statements about the Pol Pot 
regime from antiwar activists to buttress this useful thesis. 

Each of these themes—the “silence 55 of the West, the defense of Pol 
Pot by Western intellectuals—is unequivocally refuted by massive evi¬ 
dence that is well known, although ignored, by the mobilized intellec¬ 
tual culture. But this level of misrepresentation in the service of a noble 
cause still does not suffice. The two themes were combined by William 
Shawcross in an inspired agitprop achievement that carried the farce 
a step further.® 9 This new contribution evoked much enthusiasm; sev¬ 
eral of the comments just cited are from reviews of his book, or are 
obviously inspired by it. 

In his study of “Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience,” 
Shawcross muses on the relative “silence” of the West in the face of 
Khmer Rouge atrocities. The facts are radically different, but the idea 
that the West ignores Communist atrocities while agonizing over its 
own is far more appealing to the Western conscience. Shawcross then 
proceeds to adopt Aikman’s second thesis, applying it in an ingenious 
way to explain the mechanism that lies behind this unwillingness of the 
West to face up to Communist atrocities, so notable a feature of West¬ 
ern life. The silence over phase II of the genocide, he argues, resulted 
from “the skepticism (to use a mild term) displayed by the Western left 
toward the stories coming out of Democratic Kampuchea. That skepti¬ 
cism was most fervently and frequently expressed by Noam Chomsky 
..[who] asserted that from the moment of the Khmer Rouge victory 
in 1975 the Western press colluded with Western and anti-Communist
