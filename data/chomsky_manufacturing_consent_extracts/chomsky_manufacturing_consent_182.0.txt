institutions* in part to Vietnamese propaganda. Vietnam’s “spokesmen 
had undercut the refugee stories about Khmer Rouge conduct,” he 
writes* “thus adding to disbelief in them* particularly on the Western 
left,” 108 which naturally takes its cues from Hanoi and closely parrots 
its doctrines* according to approved dogma—although it is interesting 
that Shawcross also insinuates that the influence of Hanoi extended 
beyond its acolytes. And why not? If we have reached the point of 
claiming that the Western left silenced the media and governments, 
why not proceed to maintain that even outside these dangerous circles* 
Vietnamese propaganda is a powerful force in shaping opinion? Natu¬ 
rally Shawcross does not make even a pretense of providing any evi¬ 
dence for what he knows perfectly well to be the sheerest fantasy* from 
beginning to end. 

We may place this outlandish explanation of the “silence” of the 
West alongside the similar claims that State Department Communists 
lost China, that the media are threatening the foundations of democ¬ 
racy with their “adversarial stance,” etc. The reaction, however* was 
not ridicule, but rather great enthusiasm. To cite just one typical exam¬ 
ple, David Hawk observes that Shawcross “attributes the world's indif¬ 
ference” to “the influence of antiwar academics and activists on the 
American left who obfuscated Khmer Rouge behavior* denigrated the 
post-1975 refugee reports and denounced the journalists who got those 
stories,” 109 He accepts this thesis as valid but cites no evidence either 
for the ^indifference” to the atrocities* which were being denounced 
worldwide as genocidal* or for the alleged behavior of the American 
left, nor does he explain the mechanisms whereby this behavior, had 
it existed, could have controlled the mainstream media, or even margin¬ 
ally influenced them. Convenient mythologies require neither evidence 
nor logic. Nor do they require any attention to Hawk’s own perform¬ 
ance at the time, as an Amnesty International official and specialist on 
Southeast Asia. The AI Annual Report for 1977 noted that the number 
of alleged executions in Cambodia was “fewer than during the preced¬ 
ing year,” and while it summarizes a number of reports of executions 
and disappearances, its account is restrained. The 1978 Annual Report, 
while stronger in its allegations of violence, pointed out that refugee 
reports, on which it was necessary to rely heavily, “are often imprecise 
or conflicting,” thus leaving AI and Hawk in the Shawcross-Hawk 
category of those who “denigrated the post-1975 refugee reports.” It is 
so easy to moralize in retrospect.
