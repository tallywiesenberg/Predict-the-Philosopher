Shawcross develops his thesis further in interesting ways. 110 To show 
that Western commentators refused to recognize that “the Khmer 
Rouge was a Marxist-Leninist government,” he states that British jour-

nalist John Pilger “constantly compared” the Khmer Rouge with the 
Nazis, suppressing the fact that he explicitly compared their actions 
with “Stalin’s terror,” as Pilger noted in a response to one of the many 
reviews that repeated Shawcross’s inventions. 111 Shawcross claims fur¬ 
ther that the present authors “were to believe for years” that “the 
refugees were unreliable, that the CIA was cooking up a bloodbath to 
say, ‘We told you so.’ ” He cites our one article {The Nation, 1977), in 
which there is no hint of any such thesis, as there is none elsewhere. 
In that article we were clear and explicit, as also subsequently, that 
refugee reports left no doubt that the record of Khmer Rouge atrocities 
was “substantial and often gruesome,” and that “in the case of Cam¬ 
bodia, there is no difficulty in documenting major atrocities and oppres¬ 
sion, primarily from the reports of refugees,” 113 To support his 
contention with regard to our alleged denial of the reliability of re¬ 
fugees, Shawcross cites our comment on the need to exercise care in 
analyzing refugee reports, carefully suppressing the fact that we are 
quoting Ponchaud, his primary source, and that the comment he cites 
is a familiar truism. His reference to the CIA cooking up a bloodbath 
is pure fantasy, although we might add that by the time he wrote, 
although after our book appeared, Michael Vickery did present evi¬ 
dence that the Barron-Paul Reader^ Digest account was in part a CIA 
disinformation effort. 113 Shawcross states further his view, “contrary to 
Chomsky and Herman,” that the U.S, government was “remarkably 
inactive” in anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda. We proposed no U.S. 
government role whatsoever in orchestrating the deceit we docu¬ 
mented, by William Shawcross and others, and in fact endorsed State 
Department reports as the most plausible then available. And so on, 
throughout. 

But Shawcross and others who are deeply offended by our challenge 
to the right to lie in the service of one’s favored state understand very 
well that charges against dissident opinion require no evidence and that 
ideologically useful accusations will stand merely on the basis of end¬ 
less repetition, however ludicrous they may be—even the claim that the 
American left silenced the entire West during the Pol Pot period. 

Shawcross’s charges against other enemies follow the same pattern— 
another factor, presumably, in the appeal of his message. Thus in 
pursuit of his fashionable quest to attribute primary responsibility for 
the continuing tragedy of Cambodia to Vietnam, not to those who were
