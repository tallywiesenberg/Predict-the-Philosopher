admirably frank in explaining their stand. This carefully channeled 
benevolence succeeded in the goal of keeping the Pol Pot forces active 
and injuring Vietnam and also, incidentally, the suffering people of 
Cambodia who are the objects of our profound concern. The relief 
effort in 1979-80 did succeed in aiding Cambodians in distress, but it 
has also sustained the Pol Pot forces and thereby impeded Cambodia’s 
recovery and, perhaps, its independence, although about this we can 
only speculate. 

Putting aside the undoubtedly sincere reactions of many people who 
were exposed to evidence of properly selected atrocities that passed 
through the media filter, the only rational conclusion from this il¬ 
luminating record is that the West was consumed with horror over 
Khmer Rouge atrocities during phase II not because of a sudden pas¬ 
sion for the fate of the suffering people of Cambodia—as the record 
during phase I, and elsewhere, makes sufficiently clear—but because 
the Khmer Rouge had a useful role to play: namely, to permit a retro¬ 
spective justification for earlier French and American crimes in Indo¬ 
china, and to facilitate the reconstruction of Western ideology after the 
Vietnam trauma, so as to overcome the dread “Vietnam syndrome” and 
prepare the ground for a “resurgent America” pursuing its historical 
vocation of defending freedom and justice. The actual facts were, and 
remain, of little interest, for the same reason.
