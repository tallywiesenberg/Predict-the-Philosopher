the media to exercise “the power to root about in our national life, 
exposing what they deem right for exposure,” without regard to exter¬ 
nal pressures or the dictates of authority (Lewis). It is this period, then, 
that poses a challenge to a propaganda model, and we have therefore 
taken it as the focus of our inquiry. Many of the examples we discuss 
are from the past decade, when the liberal media were allegedly in 
confrontation with a “conservative” administration that they would

have been expected to oppose vigorously* In a further effort to ensure 
that we are not selecting exceptional cases* we have cast the net widely* 
We have selected for close examination cases that pose the most severe 
challenge to our model* namely* those put forth by critics as demon¬ 
strating that the media have gone too far in their exuberant indepen¬ 
dence and challenge to authority* so far that they must be curbed if 
democracy is to survive: for example, the coverage of the Tet offensive* 
the prime illustration of alleged excesses of the media offered in the 
1970s and 1980s* Even these cases demonstrate the subordination of the 
media to the requirements of the state propaganda system* At the peak 
of alleged media independence* as the Vietnam War entered its final 
period and the media were threatening Nixon’s presidency* the subor¬ 
dination to these demands never flagged* as illustrated by the media 
coverage of the Paris peace treaty of 1973* one of the most flagrant 
examples of media misrepresentation based on an uncritical reiteration 
of official claims and adherence to the political agenda of the state* 

We may illustrate the point in yet another case* chosen by those who 
defend the standard version of the media as their strongest ground: the 
Watergate affair. To many critics of the media* this incident illustrates 
their irresponsible excesses; to those who proudly defend the media, it 
illustrates their independence of higher authority and commitment to 
the values of professional journalism. What* then* are the lessons of 
Watergate? 

The major scandal of Watergate as portrayed in the mainstream 
press was that the Nixon administration sent a collection of petty 
criminals to break into the Democratic party headquarters* for reasons 
that remain obscure. The Democratic party represents powerful do¬ 
mestic interests* solidly based in the business community, Nixon’s ac¬ 
tions were therefore a scandal. The Socialist Workers party, a legal 
political party* represents no powerful interests. Therefore, there was 
no scandal when it was revealed, just as passions over Watergate 
reached their zenith* that the FBI had been disrupting its activities by 
illegal break-ins and other measures for a decade, a violation of demo¬ 
cratic principle far more extensive and serious than anything charged 
during the Watergate hearings* What is more* these actions of the
