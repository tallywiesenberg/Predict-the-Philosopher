ary international law—in its attack against Nicaragua. The sponsorship 
and support of state terror that cost some 200,000 lives in Central 
America in the preceding decade was not the subject of congressional 
inquiries or media concern. These actions were conducted in accord 
with an elite consensus, and they received steady media support, as we 
have seen in reviewing the fate of worthy and unworthy victims and the 
treatment of elections in client and errant states. 5 

In the case of the Vietnam War as well, as we showed in chapter 5, 






CONCLUSIONS pi 


even those who condemn the media for their alleged adversarial stance 
acknowledge that they were almost universally supportive of U*S* pol¬ 
icy until after large numbers of U*S. troops had been engaged in the 
“intervention” in South Vietnam* heavy casualties had been taken* 
huge dollar sums had been spent, and elite protest had surfaced on 
grounds of threats to elite interests. Only then did elements of the 
media undertake qualified reassessments of the “cost-benefit” trade-off. 
But during the period of growing involvement that eventually made 
extrication difficult, the watchdog actually encouraged the burglar to 
make himself at home in a distant land* and to bomb and destroy it with 
abandon. 

In short* the very examples offered in praise of the media for their 
independence* or criticism of their excessive zeal* illustrate exactly the 
opposite. Contrary to the usual image of an “adversary press'* boldly 
attacking a pitiful executive giant* the media's lack of interest, investi¬ 
gative zeal, and basic news reporting on the accumulating illegalities of 
the executive branch have regularly permitted and even encouraged 
ever larger violations of law* whose ultimate exposure when elite inter¬ 
ests were threatened is offered as a demonstration of media service “on 
behalf of the polity*” These observations reinforce the conclusions that 
we have documented throughout. 

The existing level of media subordination to state authority is often 
deemed unsatisfactory by critics. We have discussed several examples. 
Thus, Freedom House and others who are concerned to protect state 
authority from an intrusive public condemn the media for lack of 
sufficient enthusiasm in supporting official crusades* and even the lim¬ 
ited challenge to established authority during the Vietnam War and the 
Watergate period aroused concerns over the excessive power of the 
media* Quite commonly, the slight opening occasionally granted to 
dissent is considered far too dangerous to permit. This perception
