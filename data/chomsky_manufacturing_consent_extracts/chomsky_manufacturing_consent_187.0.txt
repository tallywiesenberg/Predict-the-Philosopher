aggression and slaughter. Plainly, news about East Timor would not 
have been useful, and would, in fact, have discomfited important do¬ 
mestic power groups. The mass media—and the intellectual community 
generally—therefore channeled their benevolent impulses elsewhere: 
to Cambodia, not Timor. 

As we have stressed throughout this book, the U.S. media do not 
function in the manner of the propaganda system of a totalitarian state. 
Rather, they permit—indeed, encourage—spirited debate, criticism, 
and dissent, as long as these remain faithfully within the system of 
presuppositions and principles that constitute an elite consensus, a 
system so powerful as to be internalized largely without awareness. No 
one instructed the media to focus on Cambodia and ignore East Timor. 





CONCLUSIONS 303 


They gravitated naturally to the Khmer Rouge and discussed them 
freely 8 —just as they naturally suppressed information on Indonesian 
atrocities in East Timor and U,S. responsibility for the aggression and 
massacres* In the process* the media provided neither facts nor analyses 
that would have enabled the public to understand the issues or the bases 
of government policies toward Cambodia and Timor* and they thereby 
assured that the public could not exert any meaningful influence on the 
decisions that were made* This is quite typical of the actual “societal 
purpose” of the media on matters that are of significance for established 
power; not “enabling the public to assert meaningful control over the 
political process*” but rather averting any such danger* In these cases* 
as in numerous others, the public was managed and mobilized from 
above, by means of the media’s highly selective messages and evasions* 
As noted by media analyst W, Lance Bennett* 

The public is exposed to powerful persuasive messages from 
above and is unable to communicate meaningfully through the 
media in response to these messages, * * , Leaders have usurped 
enormous amounts of political power and reduced popular control 
over the political system by using the media to generate support* 
compliance* and just plain confusion among the public. 9 

More significantly for our particular concerns here, the media typically 
provide their own independent contribution even without being 
“used*” in the manner and for the reasons that we have discussed, 
Another media analyst, Ben Bagdikian, observes that the institutional 
bias of the private mass media “does not merely protect the corporate 
system. It robs the public of a chance to understand the real world,” 10 
That conclusion is well supported by the evidence we have reviewed*
