vides a basis for understanding this pervasive phenomenon. 

No simple model will suffice, however, to account for every detail of 
such a complex matter as the working of the national mass media, A 
propaganda model, we believe, captures essential features of the pro¬ 
cess, but it leaves many nuances and secondary effects unanalyzed. 
There are other factors that should be recognized. Some of these con¬ 
flict with the “societal purpose” of the media as described by the 
propaganda model; some support it. In the former category, the human¬ 
ity and professional integrity of journalists often leads them in direc¬ 
tions that are unacceptable in the ideological institutions, and one 
should not underestimate the psychological burden of suppressing ob¬ 
vious truths and maintaining the required doctrines of benevolence

(possibly gone awry)* inexplicable error, good intentions, injured inno¬ 
cence, and so on, in the face of overwhelming evidence incompatible 
with these patriotic premises. The resulting tensions sometimes find 
limited expression, but more often they are suppressed either con¬ 
sciously or unconsciously, with the help of belief systems that permit 
the pursuit of narrow interest, whatever the facts. 

In the category of supportive factors, we find, first of all, elemental 
patriotism, the overwhelming wish to think well of ourselves, our insti¬ 
tutions, and our leaders. We see ourselves as basically good and decent 
in personal life, so it must be that our institutions function in accord¬ 
ance with the same benevolent intent, an argument that is often persua¬ 
sive even though it is a transparent non sequitur . The patriotic premise 
is reinforced by the belief that u we the people” rule, a central principle 
of the system of indoctrination from early childhood, but also one with 
little merit, as an analysis of the sociahand political system will quickly 
reveal. There are also real advantages in conformity beyond the re¬ 
wards and privilege that it yields. If one chooses to denounce Qaddafi, 
or the Sandinistas, or the FLO, or the Soviet Union, no credible evi¬ 
dence is required. The same is true if one repeats conventional doc¬ 
trines about our own society and its behavior—say, that the U.S. 
government is dedicated to our traditional noble commitment to de¬ 
mocracy and human rights. But a critical analysis of American institu¬ 
tions, the way they function domestically and their international 
operations, must meet far higher standards; in fact, standards are often 
imposed that can barely be met in the natural sciences. One has to work
