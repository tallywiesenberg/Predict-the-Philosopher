demonizing the Sandinistas and eliminating from Congress and the 
mass media all controversy beyond tactical debate over the means that 
should be employed to return Nicaragua to the “Central American 
mode” and “contain” its “aggressiveness” in attempting to defend itself 
from a murderous and destructive U.S. assault on al fronts. But it 
failed to win public support even for proxy army warfare against 
Nicaragua, and as the costs to the U*S* mounted, and the proxy war 
accompanied by embargo and other pressures succeeded in restoring 
the “Central American mode” of misery and suffering in Nicaragua and 
aborting the highly successful reforms and prospects for development 
of the early years after the overthrow of Washington's ally Somoza, 
elite opinion too shifted—quite dramatically, in fact—toward resort to 
other, more cost-effective means to attain shared ends* 13 The partial 
failures of the very well organized and extensive state propaganda 
effort, and the simultaneous rise of an active grass-roots oppositional 
movement with very limited media access, was crucial in making an 
outright U*S. invasion of Nicaragua unfeasible and driving the state 
underground, to illegal clandestine operations that could be better

media complicity. 14 

Furthermore, while there have been important structural changes 
centralizing and strengthening the propaganda system, there have been 
counterforces at work with a potential for broader access. The rise of 
cable and satellite communications, while initially captured and domi¬ 
nated by commercial interests, has weakened the power of the network 
oligopoly and retains a potential for enhanced local-group access. 
There are already some 3,000 public-access channels in use in the 
United States, offering 20,000 hours of locally produced programs per 
week, and there are even national producers and distributors of pro¬ 
grams for access channels through satellites (e.g., Deep-Dish Televi¬ 
sion), as well as hundreds of local suppliers, although all of them must 
struggle for funding. Grass-roots and public-interest organizations 
need to recognize and try to avail themselves of these media (and 
organizational) opportunities. 15 Local nonprofit radio and television 
stations also provide an opportunity for direct media access that has 
been underutilized in the United States. In France, many local groups 
have their own radio stations. In a notable case, the progressive cooper¬ 
ative Longo Mai, in Upper Provence, has its own 24-hour-a-day Radio 
Zinzine, which has become an important community institution that 
has helped inform and activate many previously isolated farmers. The 
potential value of noncommercial radio can be perceived in sections of 
the country where stations such as Pacifica Radio offer a view of the
