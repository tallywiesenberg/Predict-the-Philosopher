The leading contestant politicians are 
also moderately optimistic, as they have a good chance of acquiring at 
least nominal power.They do, however, express occasional doubts 
about whether the army will relinquish power.This allows the election 
drama to assume a slightly different character from that in El Salvador, 
where it was the democratic army “protecting the election” versus the 
undemocratic rebels who refused to lay down their arms and partici¬ 
pate.In Guatemala, the frame was: Will the generals keep their promise 
to stay in the barracks?The triumph is that they do stay in the bar¬ 
racks—a civilian president takes office and now “rules.” The media 
then quickly drop the subject, so that whether the army really does 
relinquish power to the civilian leaders is never checked out (just as the 
“peace” sought by the populace in El Salvador was never considered 
in retrospect).
