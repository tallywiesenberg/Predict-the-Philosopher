In Poland, in January 1947, and Nicaragua, in 1984, and 
in enemy states generally, the focus was on the substance of power, and

as by limiting the ability of important constituencies to run for office 
and compete effectively.Not so for Guatemala.LEGITIMIZING VERSUS MEANINGLESS THIRD WORLD ELECTIONS 113 


If the mass media had enlarged their sources, fundamental condi¬ 
tions would have assumed greater prominence.For example, before 
both the July I, 1984, and December 1985 elections in Guatemala, the 
Guatemala Bishops 5 Conference issued pastoral statements that sug¬ 
gested in no uncertain terms and with detailed arguments that condi¬ 
tions in the country were incompatible with a free election.Its pastoral 
letter of June 8,1984, focused on the civil-defense patrols as “suscepti¬ 
ble to manipulation, 15 and it discussed the disappearances, “insatiable 
corruption, 51 and the fact that sociopolitical structures are “not capable 
of promoting the welfare of the whole society,* 579 Stephen Kinzer men¬ 
tioned this report in a Times news article of July 22, 1984, but his 
reference is made after the election of July 1, and Kinzer did not use 
it to frame the discussion of electoral conditions and to arrive at an 
assessment of the quality of the election.
