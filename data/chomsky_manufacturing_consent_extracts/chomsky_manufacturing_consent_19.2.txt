Consider also the following facts: On May 3, General Oscar Mejia 
Victores removed Ricardo Sagastume Vidaure from his position as 
president of the judiciary and the supreme court.On April 11, the 
judiciary had issued writs of habeas corpus on behalf of 157 kidnapped 
individuals, and Sagastume had protested to Mejia Victores over the 
difficulty in proceeding against military abuses.On May 4, Acisco 
Valladares Molina, head of the Populist party, noted that Sagastume 
had been “fired like a simple subordinate.” On May 8, a communique 
from the Guatemalan bar association stated that in Guatemala there is 
no rule of law, as demonstrated by the constant violation of human 
rights and uncontrolled exercise of arbitrary power.By May 8, at least 
sixteen judicary officials, including supreme court and court of appeals 
magistrates, had resigned in protest at Sagustume’s removal.Stephen Kinzer never discussed any of these events, or their mean¬ 
ing, in the TimeSy nor did any of his colleagues elsewhere in the mass 
media.
