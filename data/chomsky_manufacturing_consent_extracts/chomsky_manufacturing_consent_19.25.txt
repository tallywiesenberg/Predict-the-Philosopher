This is in accord with our hypothesis that in elections held in 
client states, fundamental electoral conditions, such as the presence or 
absence of the rule of law, are off the agenda.The point applies to other 
relevant structural conditions.Thus, while Kinzer occasionally men¬ 
tioned the civil-defense patrols, he never described them and their 
operations in any detail or tied them in with other institutional struc¬ 
tures of control, and he failed to relate them in a systematic way to army 
power.The numerous reports on these coercive institutions and their 
terrorist role by Amnesty International, Americas Watch, and the Brit¬ 
ish Parliamentary Human Rights Group were almost never cited by 
Kinzer in providing facts relevant to the Guatemalan elections.Al¬ 
though the constituent assembly elected in 1984 produced a new consti¬ 
tution, Kinzer never once discussed the nature of this instrument, 
which validated the special army role and structural constraints on 
freedom of the press.
