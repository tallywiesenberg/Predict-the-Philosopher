LEGITIMIZING VERSUS MEANINGLESS THIRD WORLD ELECTIONS 


Kinzer was reporting news in a way that fit the Times 's editorial 
position and the U.S. government agenda.The Times editorial frame 
was that “The military, in power for most of 31 years, has honored its 
promise to permit the free election of a civilian president.” 82 Kinzeris 
news articles of the same period convey the same message—one of them 
is entitled “After 30 Years Democracy Gets a Chance in Guatemala” 
(Nov. io, 1985)—which accurately summarizes the contents, although 
they contain an undercurrent of reserved final judgment.That central 
message was false, however, if the basic conditions of a free election 
were not met, if the army's power remained unimpaired, and if these 
were confirmed in a written constitution that allows the army freedom 
from the rule of law and a license to kill without constraint from the 
nominal “democracy.” 53 Kinzer could only convey this false message 
by ignoring the Sagastume case, the institutional arrangements of the 
counterinsurgency state, the ongoing murders, and the omnipresent 
fear—i.e., the basic conditions of a free election—and by laying stress 
instead on expressions of hope, orderliness of the election processes, 
and army promises—i.e., the government's propaganda agenda in a 
demonstration election.In what must be one of the low points of his journalistic career, in 
an article of December 27,1985 (“Guatemala Vote Heartens Nicaragua 
Parties”), Kinzer even implies that the Guatemala election establishes 
an electoral model for Nicaragua.He describes a Cerezo visit to Nicara¬ 
gua, in which Kinzer features the encouragement Cerezo gives to the 
dissident parties that perhaps the power of the Sandinistas can be 
broken by patience (implying that Cerezo had broken the power of the 
army in Guatemala and was in full command).
