From the inception of 
Nicaraguan planning for the election, therefore, the administration 
began to express doubts about its quality.And just as it devoted itself 
to creating a positive image of the two client-state elections, so it 
expended substantial resources to depict the Nicaraguan election in the 
worst possible light.The media dutifully followed course, as a propa¬ 
ganda model predicts.The mass media failed to call attention to the cynicism of first 
assailing Nicaragua for failing to hold an election, and then striving to 
have the election either postponed or discredited.85 Time even cites the 
absence of “official delegations [of observers] from the major western 
democracies” (Nov. 19, 1984), as if this were evidence of something 
discreditable in the election, rather than as a reflection of U.S. power.
