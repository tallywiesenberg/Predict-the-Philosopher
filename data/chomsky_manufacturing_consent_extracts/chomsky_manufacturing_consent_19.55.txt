There were 450-odd foreign observers in attendance at the Nicaraguan 
election, some with superb credentials, observing more freely and at 
greater length than the official U.S. observers in El Salvador and 
Guatemala, Time and the rest of the mass media paid no attention to 
them, 86 

Stephen Kinzer’s use of observers is noteworthy.In the case of 
Nicaragua, he completely ignored the unofficial observers—many ex¬ 
ceedingly well qualified to observe, as we have noted—and he even 
ignored the official Dutch government team, drawn from the center- 
right and highly apologetic about atrocities in El Salvador, which 
observed both the Salvadoran and the Nicaraguan elections and con¬ 
cluded that the elections in Nicaragua “were more open than in El 
Salvador, in the sense that more people were able to take part; that the 
opposition did not fear for their lives”; and that “the legitimation of the 
regime is thus confirmed,” 87 In Guatemala, by contrast, he cited the 
official observer report in both the 1984 and 1985 elections, despite their 
great bias and superficiality (see the report discussed in appendix r).In 
the 1984 Guatemala election, Kinzer did refer to the report of the 
unofficial Human Rights Law Group that we cited earlier, quoting their 
statement that the voting process was “procedurally correct,” but neg¬ 
lecting to note here and elsewhere their numerous statements to the 
effect that “the greater part of the population lives in permanent fear” 
(p. 4), so that “procedural correctness” has little meaning.With no U.S.-government-designated official observers available in 
Nicaragua, the media relied even more heavily than usual on U.S. 
government handouts.It is enlightening to compare this conduited 
propaganda of the mass media with the findings of foreign-observer
