For the purpose of this comparison* 
which follows* we will use two such reports.One, that of the Irish 
Inter-Party Parliamentary Delegation* is The Elections in Nicaragua, 
November 1984.The delegation was composed of four individuals* three 
from right-wing or moderate-right political parties* who spent seven¬ 
teen days in Nicaragua at the time of the election.We will also use as 
a basis of comparison of media coverage the previously cited report of 
the 15-member delegation sent by the Latin American Studies Associa¬ 
tion (LASA)* half of whom had had “substantial field experience” in 
Nicaragua itself.This delegation spent eight days in Nicaragua before 
the election* traveled in a rented bus* determined their own itinerary, 
and “spoke with anyone who we chose to approach (as well as numer¬ 
ous people who spontaneously approached us).” 88
