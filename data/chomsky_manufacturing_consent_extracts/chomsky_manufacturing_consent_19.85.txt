90 In Guatemala too, “Some 1.8 million voters braved 
four-hour polling lines* tropical rainstorms and a bewildering array of 
political choices to cast ballots in their country's most open and fraud- 
free elections in more than a decade” (July 16* 1984).There is never 
apathy or fear of government force in Time's renditions of demonstra¬

Stephen Kinzer* in the Times, also took a far less kindly view of the 
election in Nicaragua than of those in Guatemala, giving enormous 
attention to election opponents like the ILS.candidate Arturo Cruz 
(whereas in Guatemala he almost completely ignored the small parties* 
union protesters* rebels* and human-rights groups)* and finding more 
people voting out of fear than he did in Guatemala, a remarkable 
discovery given the circumstances in the two countries, 91 He focuses 
steadily on the Sandimstas 5 efforts to get out the vote* the fact that the 
election result is a foregone conclusion, claims of the breaking up of 
election rallies, and allegations of unfairness and withdrawals by the 
opposition.As with Time, the voters are “philosophical,” “enthusiasm 
for the election was not universal,” and “there was little visible enthusi¬ 
asm,” Kinzer did not compare the electoral modalities* range of op¬ 
tions* or other basic conditions in Nicaragua and Guatemala (or El 
Salvador), In short, he discussed different questions in his news report¬ 
ing on the elections in Nicaragua and Guatemala* adhering closely to 
the propaganda frame, 92 

On the alleged negativism and apathy, both the Irish and LASA 
delegations noted that voting was not required in Nicaragua and was 
entirely secret.
