120 MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


It is our belief that the invariable enthusiasm and optimism found by 
the U*S. mass media in client-state elections* and the apathy and nega¬ 
tivism found in elections in states disfavored by the U*S* administra¬ 
tion, has nothing to do with electoral realities and must be explained 
entirely by an imposed propaganda agenda and the filtering out of 
contrary opinion and information* 


3.6*2* Ignoring the superior 
quality of the Nicaraguan 
election 

In the propaganda format, a great deal of attention is paid to the 
mechanical properties of elections in client states, but not in states 
whose elections are being denigrated.This was true in the cases under 
discussion.Time (Apr* 9,1984) described in detail the elaborate elec¬ 
toral preparations in El Salvador* the “tamper-proof* procedures, the 
use of transparent Lucite ballot boxes* and the indelible-ink marking 
and stamping of ID cards* It turned out* however, that the high-tech, 
computerized voting procedures weren't understood by the population, 
more than half of whom were illiterate.At no point did Time, or its 
media colleagues, raise any question about the importance of improving 
literacy as a necessary prelude to an election; nor did they suggest that 
the Lucite boxes might compromise the secrecy of the vote* or that the 
stamped ID card might be a coercive instrument helping to explain 
turnout, 

Nicaragua went to great pains to provide for election secrecy* and 
for an easy and intelligible system of voting.For one thing, they had 
a massive literacy campaign before the election, making electoral 
printed matter generally accessible* Both the Irish and LASA delega¬ 
tions mention this as an electoral plus* Nicaragua also put a high 
priority on getting a complete registration list and getting the voters 
registered* The Irish delegation noted that “Recent elections in other 
Central American countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala did not 
introduce such measures, and there was considerable debate concern¬ 
ing the validity of their registers* which were based on out-of-date 
census figures* incomplete official registers of population changes, and 
other sources” (p* 5).
