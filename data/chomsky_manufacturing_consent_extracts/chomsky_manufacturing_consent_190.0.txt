Illicit Association,” “state terrorism,” “death squad,” “massacre,” “torture,” 
“forced relocations,” “civil-defense patrols,” “freedom of the press,” or “vot¬ 
ing requirement.” None of the observers doubted the authenticity of “posi¬ 
tive” responses by Guatemalan peasants to questions by non-Spanish-speaking 
foreigners flown in by helicopter in a country subject to military occupation. 
All of the observers felt quite capable of assessing the true feelings of the 
Guatemalan people on the basis of long lines, facial expressions, and a handful 
of responses to visitors under official protection. There was no dissent among 
the observers from the conclusion that the election was fair, inspiring, a 
testimonial to the eagerness of the Guatemalan people to participate and 
express their patriotic sentiments, and a first step toward democracy. No 
demonstration-election cliche was omitted—history was blacked out, and no 
basic condition of a free election was examined by the observers. 

Let us sample a few of the cliches offered by these Guatemalan election 
observers: 

1. People full of hope—very positive start. This was a “dynamic begin¬ 
ning, ... a first step,” according to delegation head Ralph Regula. Father 
Kenneth Baker found a “great sense of hope for the future ... the spirit of 
hopefulness.” Jack Brier also observed “a spirit of hopefulness about the 
future, but not necessarily confidence in whatever actions may come about as 
a result of the elections.” (This is a very nuanced distinction that Brier was 
able to make on the basis of translated brief answers by a few voters.) Tom 
Kahn claimed that “many of the workers whom we spoke to on the voting lines 
told us that they had great hope, that this was a first step.” Kahn was asked 
during the press conference whether he had visited any of the embattled 
Coca-Cola workers. He hadn’t. Neither Kahn nor his AIFLD colleague, Jesse 
Friedman, mentioned the enormous decline in union membership or the deci¬ 
mation of union leadership by murder. 

2. Long lines, patient voters. The observers were deeply impressed with 
“the way the people patiently waited” to vote (Regula). Howard Penniman 
noted “the extraordinary patience of the people voting.” Ed Simcox pointed 
out that the voters “did go out, they formed lines very early in the morning, 
they waited in some instances two, three, four hours to go up and vote.” 
According to Congressman Hightower, “The thing that impressed us instantly 
was the long lines.” Tom Kahn was impressed with the “calm and order which 
prevailed around the voting tables.” 

Long lines and patient voters are quite compatible with voting by a terror¬ 
ized population desiring mainly to survive. The official observers, who never 
once mention the record of spectacular state terror in Guatemala, merely 
postulate that voters who get in line and wait patiently do so for reasons that 
are benign. 

3 . The patriotic imperative . The main theme of this observer team is that 
the voters are eager to vote as good patriots, loyal to the militarized terrorist
