Tagliabue points out that although the trial was supposed merely to verify the 


findings of the preliminary investigation, in fact the prosecution did a great 
deal of new investigative work. This suggests that the trial court may have 
found Martella’s investigation sadly lacking, but Tagliabue never addresses the 
point. 


Agca’s Desertion of the Case 

An important part of the apologetic framework is the claim that Agca, who had 
presented an allegedly coherent version of a connection up to the trial, sud¬ 
denly did an about face and refused to testify altogether. Tagliabue devotes 
several paragraphs to this theme, eventually suggesting that Agca’s increas¬ 
ingly erratic behavior “may have been designed to torpedo the efforts of the 
court.” He suggests that the prosecutor couldn’t overcome this difficulty, so 
that the loss of the case is lodged in Agca’s behavior rather than in any inherent 
deficiencies in the prosecution’s case. 

In reality, Agca’s claims emerged very slowly and contradictorily, with 
dozens of retractions that, taken together, are best explained by coaching, 
outside information, and guesses by Agca as to what Martella and the press 
would like to hear. There is no reason to believe that Agca ever offered or 
settled upon a coherent version of a Bulgarian connection. On the contrary, 
it appears that his version changed continually, and that the final result in 
Martella’s report was Martella’s own arbitrary synthesis. 4 

The claim that Agca became more erratic during the trial is also not based 
on evidence. Agca’s persistently erratic behavior was obscured by the secrecy 
of his earlier testimony, but it is clear from the Martella report that he was 
already claiming to be Jesus and displaying other symptoms of irrationality. 
Furthermore, Tagliabue’s statement that Agca refused to cooperate during the 
trial is false—Agca periodically withdrew from the proceedings when his 
testimony became too incoherent, but he always returned to the stand, and he 
answered a vast number of questions. One hypothesis that Tagliabue never 
entertains is that if Agca’s claims were based on coaching and/or imagination, 
in an open court he would be vulnerable and quickly pushed to the wall. 

Tagliabue also never asks this further question: Even if Agca had clammed 
up (which was not true), given the extensive Martella investigation and report, 
why would the court not be able to follow the already established leads to a 
successful outcome? Why was not a single witness produced to confirm Agca’s 
allegations of numerous meetings and trips with Bulgarians in Rome? Why was 
the car allegedly rented by the Bulgarians never found? Where is the money 
supposedly given to Agca? Tagliabue fails to address these questions.
