format—good Martella, Agca the betrayer of the case, the Soviet motive, 
Agca’s visit to Bulgaria, and his knowledge of details. All other materials are 
designated “sinister” or blacked out to enhance the credibility of the party line. 


Agca Helped the Bulgarians 

Tagliabue closes his article with a quote from Agca’s attorney that the Bulgari¬ 
ans “should be thankful” to Agca. This reiterates one of Tagliabue’s preferred 
themes—that Agca deliberately blew the case. This is derived from Sterling’s 
theory that Agca’s vacillations were really “signals” to the Bulgarians, alter¬ 
nately threatening and rewarding them, but aiming at getting them to help him 
out of jail. In his earlier articles Tagliabue followed this line, and it is implicit 
in this summing-up article, although it is a wholly unproven Sterling gimmick. 7 
What was Agca bargaining for in the trial? Did he expect the Bulgarians to 
spring him? To admit their own involvement in the case by arranging a deal 
for his release? And if he was sabotaging the case in order to win favor with 
the Bulgarians, and since the Bulgarians obviously refused to respond, why did 
he not finally decide to do them injury? Tagliabue never addresses these points. 

In sum, this is a model case of propaganda under the guise of “news” or 
“news analysis.” In this instance there are a number of lies, but these are less 
important than the other systematic distortions. Tagliabue and the Times 
frame the issue in terms of probable Bulgarian guilt and the factors that caused 
the case to be lost—exclusive of those suggesting that there was no case to 
begin with. They refuse to discuss the failure to obtain confirmation of any 
factual claims of meetings or deals with Bulgarians. They fail to discuss—or 
even to mention—problems of plausible deniability. They reiterate the ele¬ 
ments of the preferred SHK model without noting the illogic or the incompati¬ 
ble facts. They ignore evidence that would support the coaching model. They 
use invidious language only for the disfavored line of argument and spokesper¬ 
sons, manipulating words and bending evidence to the desired end. This article 
should be perfect for classroom use in courses on propaganda, media bias, and 
related subjects. 


“The More Sinister View” 


In a single, late paragraph devoted to the possibility of coaching, Tagliabue 
merely asserts it as a claim, without providing a single supportive point of 
evidence, although there are many. 6 He uses a double propagandist’s put- 
down—ironically designating the coaching hypothesis as “the more sinister 
view,” and stating that it is “espoused by critics of the case on the political 
left, including Soviet bloc governments.” Even Tagliabue, in his earlier news
