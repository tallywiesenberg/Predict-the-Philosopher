the communists had in achieving them. 55 They “failed 55 in many of their aims, 
but in a third phase the enemy might “recoup there what he lost in the first 
two phases. 55 In what he calls a “speculative, personal, subjective 55 judgment, 
Cronkite states that he is “not sure . . . who won and who lost, 55 or to what 
extent. He concludes that the United States is probably “mired in stalemate, 55 
and that historians may conclude that the Tet battle was “a draw 55 ; “To suggest 
we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. 55 He does 
not say that Johnson will be “forced 55 to the negotiating table by a “defeat, 55 
but rather that if indeed there is a “stalemate, 55 then “the only rational way 
out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who 
lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could. 55 
Note the typical reiteration of government propaganda concerning American 
aims, unsullied by the factual record—enormous in scale, by this time—of U.S. 
government efforts to undermine democracy and to destroy all popular 
forces—the NLF, the Buddhist “third force, 55 etc.—in South Vietnam, on the 
assumption, openly admitted, that the forces placed in power by U.S. violence 
could not survive political competition. Recall also that in these comments that 
Freedom House derides, Cronkite reaches essentially the same conclusion as 
did the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Wheeler, in his summary 
to the president on the same day as Cronkite’s broadcast, and the president’s 
advisers a month later. 

We may note also that two weeks earlier, Cronkite had “assessed 55 the 
impact of the Communist offensive, on the basis of U.S. and Vietnamese 
sources, reporting that “first, and simplest, the Vietcong suffered a military 
defeat” ( 1 ,158). Similarly, on an NBC-TV special of March 10 that Braestrup 
repeatedly condemns, Howard Tuckner stated that “Militarily the allies won 55 
(I, 159), as did others repeatedly. 

Cronkite’s “special” is exhibit A in the Freedom House indictment. The 
example is typical of the relation between their conclusions and the evidence 
they cite. 


Braestrup refers to a television comment by Robert Schakne on February 
28 for which he gives the following paraphrase: “In short, the United States 
would now have to take over the whole war, including the permanently dam¬ 
aged pacification program, because of Saigon’s failures” ( 1 ,562-63). Braestrup 
claims further that Schackne attributed “this argument” to Robert Komer. 
This he calls “a CBS exclusive,” his standard term of derision. In fact, “this 
argument” is yet another “Freedom House exclusive.” What Schackne said, 
according to Braestrup, is that it was “likely” that Komer was in Washington 
with General Wheeler to ask for more troops “to help get the Vietnam pacifi¬ 
cation program back on the road.” The preceding day, Wheeler had requested 
that the troop level be raised from 525,000 to 731,756, one primary concern 
being that “There is no doubt that the RD Program [pacification] has suffered 
a severe set back,” that “To a large extent the VC now control the country¬ 
side,” and that “US forces will be required in a number of places to assist and 
encourage the Vietnamese Army to leave the cities and towns and reenter the 
country.” 1 While Braestrup’s version of Schackne’s “argument” has little re¬
