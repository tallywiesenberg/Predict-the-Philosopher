missed his golden opportunity” by bad tactics. Newsweek ’s picture of “a foe 
without setbacks or flaws” is another Freedom House exclusive. 

What of the other sins? As for the reference to the “wily” Giap, compare 
Newsweek with what Braestrup regards as the outstanding analysis by Douglas 
Pike, who describes Giap as a “master tactician,” “one of the best tactical 
commanders of the 20th century,” etc. (I, i96f.). On the “toughness” of the 
North Vietnamese and their “ominous” activity, see the regular reports of the 
U.S. military command, and an extensive literature by Vietnam veterans. 

Braestrup claims that “one searches in vain through most of the media 
descriptions of the foe, even well into March 1968, for indications that the 
enemy’s planning, tactics, execution, zeal, and weaponry were less than flaw¬ 
less”; “there were few hints in Times analyses or battlefield reporting that the 
foe was anything but shrewd, tenacious, ascetic, infallible and menacing, and 
in this case the paper had plenty of company” (I, 186, 216). Apart from 
“flawless” and “infallible,” further Freedom House exclusives, the adjectives 
can be taken from the military reports and seem unexceptionable. The claim 
that the media regarded the enemy as infallible is defended through pages 186 
to 231, along with typical Freedom House self-refutation: example after exam¬ 
ple to the contrary is cited, in addition to those just mentioned. The media 
reported that the VC “undoubtedly” alienated the population, as they caused 
“indiscriminate slaughter” and “totally misjudged the mood of the South 
Vietnamese.” They may be suffering “a severe manpower problem” and “hurt¬ 
ing badly.” 6 They “failed to achieve their main objectives.” Captured VC got 
lost in Saigon and were falsely told that they would be welcomed. (This 
appears under Braestrup’s heading “Television: in praise of the VC.”) They 
did not “get—or heed” important information. And so on. All in all, hardly 
the picture of an “infallible” and “flawless” enemy. 

Note also the Freedom House assumption that a free press, militantly 
guarding its objectivity, should not only consider those who are resisting the 
U.S. attack as “the enemy,” “the foe,” etc., but must also refrain from accu¬ 
rately describing “the enemy” as tough, resolute, and courageous. To play its 
proper role in a free society by Freedom House standards, the media should 
never veer a moment from the kind of service to the state demanded and 
secured by force in totalitarian states, so it appears. 

The impact of the Freedom House study comes from the impression of 
massive documentation and the huge resources that were employed to obtain 
and analyze it. Case by case, the examples collapse on inspection. Here are a 
few more examples, far from exhaustive. 7 

On pacification, “TV and radio commentators went far beyond the available 
information to imply the dramatic worst.” Three examples are cited to prove 
the point ( 1 ,565). Howard Tuckner, of NBC-TV, reported from New York the 
views of “U.S. intelligence officials” and “Some U.S. officials in Vietnam”— 
correctly, as Braestrup concedes in a footnote, adding that these were the views 
of “CIA in Washington” and “Disheartened junior CORDS officials in Viet¬ 
nam.” By Freedom House standards, it is improper to cite such sources accu¬
