Repeatedly, the study claims that the media were “vengeful” or bent on 
“retribution” in reacting skeptically to government claims. An alternative 
possibility is that this reaction reflected a newfound realism. Braestrup agrees, 
for example, that “Westmoreland was wrong in publicly underestimating (in 
November [1967]) the enemy” ( 1 ,69), and cites many other false and mislead-

ing optimistic statements, among them Robert Komer’s prediction of “steady 
progress in pacification” a week before the Tet offensive (I, 72; Braestrup’s 
paraphrase). In fact, part of the shock of the Tet offensive resulted from the 
faith of the media in previous government assessments, undermined by the Tet 
offensive, as the U.S. military and official Washington were well aware. 

Furthermore, General Westmoreland’s accounts were hardly persuasive 
during the offensive. Thus he claimed that “all 11 of the Vietnamese division 
commanders . . . commanded their units effectively,” whereas, as a journalist 
learned, one “had gone into a state of shock during the Tet attacks” ( 1 ,454-55). 
Or consider Westmoreland’s claim that allegations about inaccuracy and in¬ 
flation of body counts were “one of the great distortions of the war” by the 
media—there were at most “relatively small inaccuracies” (II, 163). His own 
generals had a rather different view. In his study of the opinions of the 
generals, General Douglas Kinnard reports that 61 percent of those responding 
describe the body count as “often inflated,” and only 26 percent “within reason 
accurate.” The responses include: “a fake—totally worthless,” “often blatant 
lies,” “a blot on the honor of the Army,” and “grossly exaggerated by many 
units primarily because of the incredible interest shown by people like 
McNamara and Westmoreland.” Perhaps journalists had some reason for 
skepticism, apart from “vengefulness.” 9 

To demonstrate the absurd extent of press efforts to find shock value, 
Braestrup cites a story in Time on enemy tunneling at Khe Sanh, “as occurred 
around Dienbienphu” ( 1 ,435; his emphasis), in general ridiculing the analogy— 
but forgetting to ridicule the remark by Marine Commander General Cush¬ 
man, who said that “He is digging trenches and doing other tricks of the trade 
which he learned to do at Dienbienphu” (I, 403). 

“All Vietnam, it appeared on film at home, was in flames or being battered 
into ruins, and all Vietnamese civilians were homeless refugees,” Braestrup 
alleges (1,234), in typically fanciful rhetoric, adding that “there were virtually 
no films shown or photographs published during this period of undamaged 
portions of Saigon, Hue, or other cities” (his emphasis). This shows that 
coverage was unbalanced, supportive of the enemy. One wonders how many
