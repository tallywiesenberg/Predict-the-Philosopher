few cities, were implicitly depicted as callously destroying all Vietnam . . ., 
while the Vietcong’s indiscriminate use of their own firepower, as well as the 
Hue killings, were largely overlooked” (I, 286). The dominant themes in the 
media “added up to a portrait of defeat for the allies” (I, 705). “At Tet, the 
press shouted that the patient was dying” (I, 714). And so on. 

We have already cited enough to show how much merit there is in these 
characterizations. Furthermore, as already indicated, the media reports gener¬ 
ally conformed to those of the U.S. military, although they were often less 
extreme in suggesting enemy success, as we have seen. Braestrup is not un¬ 
aware of this. He writes, for example, that “MACV spokesmen in Saigon 
themselves contributed in February to a general journalistic perception that 
no logistics, organizational, or manpower limitations inhibited the NVA’s ca¬ 
pacity, even after the ‘first wave,’ to strike anywhere at will (‘No place was safe 
any more’)” (I, 190). Furthermore, “most eyewitness combat reporting, rare 
and restricted as it was, showed up better in February than the MACV com¬ 
muniques or the communique rewrites in Saigon” ( 1 ,334). In fact, the military 
briefings cited are closely similar to media commentary in basic content, e.g., 
Brigadier General John Chaisson, February 3, who described “a real battle,” 
“a very successful offensive in its initial phases,” “surprisingly well coor¬ 
dinated,” “surprisingly intensive,” conducted with “a surprising amount of 
audacity”—for example, in Hu6, where “the VC had the town,” etc. Naturally

the media varied more widely in content and style, but characterizations of the 
sort cited above must simply be dismissed as hysteria, even apart from the 
numerous misrepresentations and sheer fabrications. 

If this is one of the great achievements of contemporary scholarship, as John 
Roche claims, then scholarship is in a bad way indeed.

Preface 

1. We use the term “special interests” in its commonsense meaning, not in the 
Orwellian usage of the Reagan era, where it designates workers, farmers, 
women, youth, blacks, the aged and infirm, the unemployed—in short, the 
population at large. Only one group did not merit this appellation: corpora¬ 
tions, and their owners and managers. They are not “special interests,” they 
represent the “national interest.” This terminology represents the reality of 
domination and the operational usage of “national interest” for the two major 
political parties. For a similar view, with evidence of the relevance of this usage 
to both major political parties, see Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers, Right
