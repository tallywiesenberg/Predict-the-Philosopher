tutional critique such as we present in this volume, that the various parts 
of media organizations have some limited autonomy, that individual and 
professional values influence media work, that policy is imperfectly en¬ 
forced, and that media policy itself may allow some measure of dissent 
and reporting that calls into question the accepted viewpoint* These con¬ 
siderations all work to assure some dissent and coverage of inconvenient 
facts. 2 The beauty of the system, however, is that such dissent and incon¬ 
venient information are kept within bounds and at the margins, so that 
while their presence shows that the system is not monolithic, they are 
not large enough to interfere unduly with the domination of the official 
agenda. 

It should also be noted that we are talking about media structure and 
performance, not the effects of the media on the public. Certainly, the 
media's adherence to an official agenda with little dissent is likely to 
influence public opinion in the desired direction, but this is a matter of 
degree, and where the public’s interests diverge sharply from that of the 
elite, and where they have their own independent sources of information, 
the official line may be widely doubted. The point that we want to stress 
here, however, is that the propaganda model describes forces that shape 
what the media does; it does not imply that any propaganda emanating 
from the media is always effective. 

Although now more than a dozen years old, both the propaganda 
model and the case studies presented with it in the first edition of this 
book have held up remarkably well. 3 The purpose of this new Introduc¬ 
tion is to update the model, add some materials to supplement the case 
studies already in place (and left intact in the chapters that follow), and 
finally, to point out the possible applicability of the model to a number of 
issues under current or recent debate. 


UPDATING THE PROPAGANDA MODEL 

The propaganda model, spelled out in detail in chapter i, explains the 
broad sweep of the mainstream media's behavior and performance by 
their corporate character and integration into the political economy of 
the dominant economic system. For this reason, we focused heavily on 
the rise in scale of media enterprise, the media's gradual centralization

and concentration, the growth of media conglomerates that control many 
different kinds of media (motion picture studios, TV networks, cable 
channels, magazines, and book publishing houses), and the spread of the 
media across borders in a globalization process* We also noted the grad¬ 
ual displacement of family control by professional managers serving a 
wider array of owners and more closely subject to market discipline. 

All of these trends, and greater competition for advertising across 
media boundaries, have continued and strengthened over the past dozen 
years, making for an intensified bottom-line orientation. Thus, cen¬ 
tralization of the media in a shrinking number of very large firms has 
accelerated, virtually unopposed by Republican and Democratic admin¬ 
istrations and regulatory authority* Ben Bagdikian notes that when the 
first edition of his Media Monopoly was published in 1983 , fifty giant 
firms dominated almost every mass medium; but just seven years later, in 
1990 , only twenty-three firms occupied the same commanding position . 4 

Since 1990 , a wave of massive deals and rapid globalization have 
left the media industries further centralized in nine transnational con¬ 
glomerates—Disney, AOLTime Warner, Viacom (owner of CBS), News 
Corporation, Bertelsmann, General Electric (owner of NBC), Sony, 
AT&T-Liberty Media, and Vivendi Universal. These giants own all the 
world's major film studios, TV networks, and music companies, and a 
sizable fraction of the most important cable channels, cable systems, 
magazines, major-market TV stations, and book publishers. The largest, 
the recently merged AOL Time Warner, has integrated the leading Inter¬ 
net portal into the traditional media system. Another fifteen firms round 
out the sysrem, meaning that two dozen firms contro] nearly the entirety 
of media experienced by most U*S. citizens. Bagdikian concludes that “it 
is the overwhelming collective power of these firms, with their corporate 
interlocks and unified cultural and political values, that raises troubling 
questions about the individual's role in the American democracy 

Of the nine giants that now dominate the media universe, all but Gen¬ 
eral Electric have extensively conglomerated within the media, and are 
important in both producing content and distributing it* Four of them— 
Disney, AOL Time Warner, Viacom, and News Corporation—produce 
movies, books, magazines, newspapers, TV programs, music, videos, 
toys, and theme parks, among other things; and they have extensive dis¬ 
tribution facilities via broadcasting and cable ownership, retail stores, 
and movie-theater chains* They also provide news and occasional inves¬ 
tigative reports and documentaries that address political issues, but the 
leaders of these pop-cultural behemoths are mainly interested in enter¬ 
tainment, which produces large audiences with shows like ABC TV's
