The large-scale application of chemical weapons, and napalm* in Viet¬ 
nam was confined to the South, One reason for this was that North Viet¬ 
nam bad a government with links to other countries* so that the use of 
these barbarous and illegal weapons against it would have been widely 
publicized.South Vietnam was occupied by the United States and its 
client regime* so that the victimized people of the South were voiceless 
and could be treated with unlimited savagery.This of course contra¬ 
dicted the claim that we were protecting them against aggression, but the 
media not only underplayed the savagery* they failed to call attention to 
the contradiction and its significance.New York Times journalist Barbara 
Crossette did report that the U.S. failure to get involved in studying the 
effects of chemical warfare in Vietnam had been unfortunate* because as 
this country had used it heavily in the South but not in the North* this 
made Vietnam a controlled experiment in the effects of dioxin on humans 
from which much could be learned of benefit to ourselves.71 But neither 
Crossette nor any other mainstream reporter had anything to say about 
the fact that the United States had used dioxin only on the ones it was 
allegedly protecting against aggression* nor did they suggest that this 
constituted a serious war crime* or that this country might have an obli¬ 
gation to help those it had victimized.
