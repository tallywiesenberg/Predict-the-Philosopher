tutional critique such as we present in this volume, that the various parts 
of media organizations have some limited autonomy, that individual and 
professional values influence media work, that policy is imperfectly en¬ 
forced, and that media policy itself may allow some measure of dissent 
and reporting that calls into question the accepted viewpoint* These con¬ 
siderations all work to assure some dissent and coverage of inconvenient 
facts. 2 The beauty of the system, however, is that such dissent and incon¬ 
venient information are kept within bounds and at the margins, so that 
while their presence shows that the system is not monolithic, they are 
not large enough to interfere unduly with the domination of the official 
agenda. 

It should also be noted that we are talking about media structure and 
performance, not the effects of the media on the public. Certainly, the 
media's adherence to an official agenda with little dissent is likely to 
influence public opinion in the desired direction, but this is a matter of 
degree, and where the public’s interests diverge sharply from that of the 
elite, and where they have their own independent sources of information, 
the official line may be widely doubted. The point that we want to stress 
here, however, is that the propaganda model describes forces that shape 
what the media does; it does not imply that any propaganda emanating 
from the media is always effective. 

Although now more than a dozen years old, both the propaganda 
model and the case studies presented with it in the first edition of this 
book have held up remarkably well. 3 The purpose of this new Introduc¬ 
tion is to update the model, add some materials to supplement the case 
studies already in place (and left intact in the chapters that follow), and 
finally, to point out the possible applicability of the model to a number of 
issues under current or recent debate. 


UPDATING THE PROPAGANDA MODEL 

The propaganda model, spelled out in detail in chapter i, explains the 
broad sweep of the mainstream media's behavior and performance by 
their corporate character and integration into the political economy of 
the dominant economic system. For this reason, we focused heavily on 
the rise in scale of media enterprise, the media's gradual centralization

and concentration, the growth of media conglomerates that control many 
different kinds of media (motion picture studios, TV networks, cable 
channels, magazines, and book publishing houses), and the spread of the 
media across borders in a globalization process* We also noted the grad¬
