The Journal s publisher Peter Kann, eventually wrote that the 
Vietnam war record had clarified "who were the good guys and who were 
the bad guys/’ definitively shown by “the poisoned fields of Laos' 7 (his 
euphemism for Yellow Rain).73 In short, Kann places the massive real- 
world use of chemical warfare by the United States in Orwell's black hole 
and demonstrates Communist evil by putting forward the discredited 
claim of Yellow Rain that his paper has still not admitted to be fraudu¬ 
lent.But the more important facts are these: that with the help of the 
media, the Soviet Union was effectively linked to the use of this ugly 
weapon, based on false evidence; while by treating the real and large- 
scale use of chemical weapons in Indochina by the United States in very 
low key up to this very day, the media have helped convey the impression 
that this country is a moral force on this issue and opposes use of this ter¬ 
rible weaponry.U.S. leaders have opposed the use of chemical warfare— 
by enemy states—but it is a different matter when they choose to use 
such weaponry themselves, or when a client state does the same.74
