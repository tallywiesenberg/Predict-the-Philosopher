end in 1975* For the dominant elite the war represents an era in which 
resistance to national policy and the associated rise of formerly apathetic 
sectors of society caused a “crisis of democracy” Those unruly sectors 
and the dissidents are seen as having damaged the cultural and political 
framework and imposed unreasonable impediments to the use of force,

tained in the face of the split and hostility between China and the Soviet 
Union, tension between China and North Vietnam, and the absence of 
any evidence that North Vietnam was anybody's tool.In his book In Ret¬ 
rospect / 7 former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara admits that he 
and his colleagues made a serious error on this point.
