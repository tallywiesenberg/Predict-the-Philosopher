But neither he nor 
the other establishment figures who have used this argument have ever 
questioned the U.S, right to intervene by force to stop the “march of 
communism" in a country where the Communists had Jed a nationalist 
revolution, were recognized by all official and nonofficia] authorities to 
command the support of a Large majority of the population, and where 
their defeat would require open aggression, mass killing, and the virtual 
destruction of a distant society.Closely related was the theme that we were protecting “South Viet¬ 
nam" and the “South Vietnamese," who “let the Americans take over the 
fighting” (editorial, Washington Post , April 30, T995).A subtheme of this 
line is that we “let down" the South Vietnamese.But as noted earlier.South Vietnam as a political entity was a U.S. concoction and the U.S, 
war managers recognized that most of the southern population sup¬ 
ported the side the United States was fighting.
