Robert McNamara's 
widely publicized book* supposedly a mea culpa and moral tract* is no¬ 
table for the fact that his notion of the war's “high costs*” and the error 
and guilt he feels* extend only to US- lives and the effects of the war on 
“the political unity of our society.”® 1 He offers neither regrets* moral 
reflections, nor apologies for his country having invaded* mercilessly 
bombed* ravaged the land* and killed and wounded millions of innocent 
people in a small distant peasant society in pursuit of its own political 
ends.In a remarkable cultural process* also* the victims have been turned 
into the villains.As we describe in chapter 5* in an attempt to prolong the 
war President Richard Nixon seized on the question of the adequacy of 
Vietnamese accounting for our military personnel who were captured 
(POWs) and those missing in action (MIAs).He succeeded in keeping 
the war going* and some 16*000 more U.S. soldiers and untold numbers 
of Vietnamese died in the further fighting in the purported interest of 
missing POWs.But although there has never been any credible evidence 
that a single POW was hidden by the North Vietnamese* this claim be¬ 
came an article of faith and cult that dominated U.S. policy toward Viet¬ 
nam for many years.
