The myth also became the basis of popular culture accounts in movies 
such as The Deer Hunter , Uncommon Valor * DO.W: The Escape * and 
Missing in Action * in which Rambo-like heroes slaughter evil Vietnamese 
as they save our betrayed and tormented POWs.These movies turned 
history on its head.As Vietnam war historian H. Bruce Franklin points 
out* “America's vision of the war was being transformed.The actual 
photographs and TV footage of massacred villagers* napalmed children* 
Vietnamese prisoners being tortured and murdered* wounded GFs 
screaming in agony* and body bags being loaded by the dozen for ship¬ 
ment back home were being replaced by simulated images of American 
POWs in the savage hands of Asian communists ” 83 The powerful cul¬ 
tural myth of abused POWs as the central feature of the Vietnam war not 
only allowed the war to be extended; it helped justify the U.S. failure to 
aid its victim in accord with end-of-war promises and it provided the 
basis for an eighteen-year economic war against the victim country.
