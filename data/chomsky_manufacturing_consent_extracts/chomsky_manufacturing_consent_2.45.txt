In his review of Lind’s book, Vietnam War historian Lloyd Gardner 
noted that any U.S. “credibility” problem that arose in connection with 
the Vietnam war was a creation of the war managers themselves and 
flowed from their own decisions; and Gardner also comments, after ana¬ 
lyzing a series of lind arguments in defense of the war* that “the evidence 
simply washes away his positions like a sand castle on the beach ” 86 But 
Lind was saying what the elite wants said, and Franklin was not, so that 
mainstream media treatment followed accordingly.Laos 

Laos’s Plain of Jars was subjected to some of the heaviest bombings of 
civilian targets in history, especially after 1968* when Washington was 
compelled under domestic pressure to enter negotiations with North

although that small peasant country was a marginal factor in the wars; 
but Nixon and Kissinger could hardly leave U.S. bombers inactive.Over¬ 
all, some 2 million tons of bombs were dropped on Laos.These raids 
wiped out 353 villages and killed thousands of civilians, and they con¬

of “bombies”—tiny antipersonnel weapons specifically designed to kill
