ual displacement of family control by professional managers serving a 
wider array of owners and more closely subject to market discipline. 

All of these trends, and greater competition for advertising across 
media boundaries, have continued and strengthened over the past dozen 
years, making for an intensified bottom-line orientation. Thus, cen¬ 
tralization of the media in a shrinking number of very large firms has 
accelerated, virtually unopposed by Republican and Democratic admin¬ 
istrations and regulatory authority* Ben Bagdikian notes that when the 
first edition of his Media Monopoly was published in 1983 , fifty giant 
firms dominated almost every mass medium; but just seven years later, in 
1990 , only twenty-three firms occupied the same commanding position . 4 

Since 1990 , a wave of massive deals and rapid globalization have 
left the media industries further centralized in nine transnational con¬ 
glomerates—Disney, AOLTime Warner, Viacom (owner of CBS), News 
Corporation, Bertelsmann, General Electric (owner of NBC), Sony, 
AT&T-Liberty Media, and Vivendi Universal. These giants own all the 
world's major film studios, TV networks, and music companies, and a 
sizable fraction of the most important cable channels, cable systems, 
magazines, major-market TV stations, and book publishers. The largest, 
the recently merged AOL Time Warner, has integrated the leading Inter¬ 
net portal into the traditional media system. Another fifteen firms round 
out the sysrem, meaning that two dozen firms contro] nearly the entirety 
of media experienced by most U*S. citizens. Bagdikian concludes that “it 
is the overwhelming collective power of these firms, with their corporate 
interlocks and unified cultural and political values, that raises troubling 
questions about the individual's role in the American democracy 

Of the nine giants that now dominate the media universe, all but Gen¬ 
eral Electric have extensively conglomerated within the media, and are 
important in both producing content and distributing it* Four of them— 
Disney, AOL Time Warner, Viacom, and News Corporation—produce 
movies, books, magazines, newspapers, TV programs, music, videos, 
toys, and theme parks, among other things; and they have extensive dis¬ 
tribution facilities via broadcasting and cable ownership, retail stores, 
and movie-theater chains* They also provide news and occasional inves¬ 
tigative reports and documentaries that address political issues, but the 
leaders of these pop-cultural behemoths are mainly interested in enter¬ 
tainment, which produces large audiences with shows like ABC TV's
