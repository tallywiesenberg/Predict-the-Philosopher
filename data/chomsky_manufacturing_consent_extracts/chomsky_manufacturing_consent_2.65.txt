However, in the late 1990$, after Vietnam had left Cambodia and US.official anti-Vietnam passions had subsided, and Pol Pot was no longer 
a useful instrument of anti-Vietnam policy, US.officials and pundits 
rediscovered Pol Pot's and the Khmer Rouge’s villainy and candidacy for 
war crimes trials.The media handled the previous “tilt” toward Pol Pot 
mainly by evasions essentially blacking out the years 1979-95, 0r vaguely 
intimating that the U.S. had supported him for reasons of “realpolitik 
but avoiding both details on the nature and magnitude of support as well 
as any reflections on the morality of backing “another Hitler.” The New 
York Times' s summary of “Pol Pot's Rise and Fall” (April 17, 1998) lists 
for “1979-1990: Pol Pot and Khmer Rouge are given refuge at Thai bor¬ 
der where they fight back against the Vietnamese ” “Given refuge” is mis¬ 
leading: they were given economic and military aid and political support 
by the United States and its allies.The Times's main reporter on Cambo¬ 
dia in early 1998, Seth Mydans, repeatedly blacked out mention of U.S. 
support^ referring to “the decade-long civil war that followed” Pol Pot's 
ouster (April 13); and a nineteen-year “guerilla insurgency in the jungles 
of western and northern Cambodia” (April 17).
