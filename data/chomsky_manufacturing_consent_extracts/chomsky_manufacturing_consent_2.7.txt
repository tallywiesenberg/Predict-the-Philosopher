Timesy editorializing on the death of Pol Pot on April 17* 1998, were uni¬ 
formly indignant over his crimes and regretful at his escape from justice*

support of Pol Pot with this summary: “After the nightmare of Khmer

It is enlightening to compare the media's treatment of Pol Pot and 
Indonesian leader Suharto, who was also in the news in 1998, as Indone¬ 
sia suffered a financial crisis that—along with popular resistance to the 
dictatorship—eventually led to his ouster.Pol Pot was described in the 
editorials and news columns of April 1998 as “crazed,” a “killer,” “war 
criminal,” “mass murderer,” “blood-soaked ” and as having engineered a 
“reign of terror” and “genocide ” But in 1998 and 1999, and in earlier 
years as well, while Suharto was occasionally referred to as a “dictator”

murderer” or one responsible for “genocide ” The terminological double 
standard is maintained reliably throughout the mainstream media.94
