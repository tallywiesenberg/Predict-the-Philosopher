In the case of Pol Pot, there is no uncertainty or complexity: editorials 
and news articles uniformly make him and the Khmer Rouge leadership 
clearly and unambiguously responsible for all deaths in Cambodia dur¬ 
ing the period 1975-78- He was the “man who slaughtered two million” 
(USA Today), “the executioner 55 (Boston Globe) who “presided over the 
deaths” of his victims (Washington Post), “the man who drove Cambodia 
to ruin” (New York Times ).But in Suharto's case, we move to an ambiguous responsibility, which 
means none at all: in the New York Times, for example, “a 1965 coup led to 
the massacres of hundreds of thousands of supposed communists” (edi¬ 
torial, Aug. 23, 1996), where we have no agent doing the killing; or “a 
wave of violence that took up to 500*000 lives and led Suharto to seize 
power from Sukarno in a military coup” (Seth Mydans, Aug. 7* 1996), 
where the massacre not only has no agent, but is falsely situated before 
the takeover of power by Suharto.In a later piece, Mydans states that 
“more than 500,000 Indonesians are estimated to have died in a purge of 
leftists in 1965, the year Mr. Suharto came to power” (April 8, 1997).Note the passive voice, never used in connection with Pol Pot, the word 
“purge” instead of “slaughter 55 or “massacre,” and the continued failure 
to identify the agent.In the case of East Timor, also, the Times is uncertain about the source 
of the killing: “This is one of the world's sadder places, where 100,000 to 
200,000 people died from 1974 in a brutal civil war and the consequent 
invasion through combat, execution, disease and starvation... (Steven 
Erlanger, Oct. 21, 1990).
