In addition to the lack of a clear agent, this sen¬ 
tence seriously misrepresents the facts—the civil war was short and left 
small numbers dead; and the invasion was not “consequent” to a brutal 
civil war, except in Indonesian propaganda.Another important difference in the treatment of the “worthy 55 victims 
of Pol Pot and the “unworthy” victims of Suharto is in the willingness to 
explain away the killings.With Pol Pot, as we describe in chapter 7, the 
background of the first phase of the genocide was completely blacked out 
in the mainstream account—‘there is no qualification to Pol Pot 5 s respon¬ 
sibility as a killer because his forces had undergone terrible damage and 
sought vengeance for the crimes they had suffered; nor are any deaths in 
Pol Pot 5 s years of rule to be explained by the starvation and disease 
already pervasive in April 1975.No, the only mentionable background is 
his Paris training and Communist fanaticism.But with Suharto we encounter a whole new world of contextualized 
apologetics.
