For many years the main protective formula was that the 
1965-66 killings were “a result of a failed coup, 55 which “touched off

a wave of violence,” or followed an "onslaught from the left.” 95 This 
formula, invoked repeatedly* suggests that the mass killings were pro¬ 
voked and thus maybe justified by a prior “onslaught ” The writers never 
explain why a failed coup could possibly justify a large-scale slaughter* 
but the hint is left hanging.In more recent years* usually in connection 
with the explanation and rationalization of the continuation of a dicta¬ 
torship* the media regularly juxtaposed political repression with “stabil¬ 
ity” and “growth”: “the signs of his success are everywhere,” although 
Suharto has brought these gains “by maintaining a tight grip on power 
and suppressing public criticism and political opposition ” 96 These state¬ 
ments, from the New York Times , offer a kind of context that the paper 
never gives to Castro* let alone a Pol Pot, and it shows an apologetic that 
runs deep.This apologetic extends to the Suharto invasion and occupation of 
East Timor, For years* New York Times reporters have claimed that In¬ 
donesia invaded in the midst of a civil war* 97 when in fact that civil war 
was over well before the invasion.The paper's news coverage of East 
Timor actually fell to zero as the Indonesian attacks and killings in East 
Timor reached a deadly peak in 1977-78* a slaughter that elsewhere 
would be called “genoridal.” And although Indonesia occupied East 
Timor in violation of standing U.N, rulings till its induced exit in 1999, 
the paper’s reporters repeatedly referred to East Timor as a “disputed 
province” and East Timorese resistance as “separatist*” thereby internal¬ 
izing and explicitly legitimizing the aggression and occupation, 98 

The bias and gentle treatment of Suharto and the Indonesian govern¬ 
ment in the media is once again correlated with U.S. policy support that 
dates back to the military coup and slaughters of 1965.These were 
greeted with enthusiasm by U.S, officials—then Secretary of Defense 
Robert McNamara referred to the events as one of the “dividends” of 
U,S.
