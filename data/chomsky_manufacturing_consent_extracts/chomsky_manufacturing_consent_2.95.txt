In his book Golden Rule , political scientist Thomas Ferguson argues that 
where the major investors in political parties and elections agree on an 
issue, the parties will not compete on that issue, no matter how strongly 
the public might want an alternative.He contends that for ordinary vot¬ 
ers to influence electoral choices they would have to have “strong chan¬ 
nels that directly facilitate mass deliberation and expression ” 101 These 
would include unions and other intermediate organizations that might, 
through their collective power, cause the interests of ordinary voters to be 
given greater weight in the political system.The propaganda model, and the institutional arrangements that it re¬ 
flects, suggests that the same forces that preclude competition among the 
parties on issues on which the major investors agree, will also dominate 
media choices and rule out “mass deliberation and expression 55 on those 
issues.For example, polls regularly indicate that, except in periods of war 
and intense war propaganda, the public wants a smaller defense budget 
and favors a spending shift from defense to education and other civil 
functions.102 But because the major investors agree that a large defense 
budget is desirable, the two dominant parties compete only on whether 
the one or the other is stinting on military expenditures, with both prom¬ 
ising to enlarge it (as both George W. Bush and A 1 Gore did in the presi¬ 
dential election campaign of 2000).
