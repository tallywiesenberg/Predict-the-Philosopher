Nicaragua also deliberately avoided transparent 
ballot boxes* ID stamping, and any other mechanism that would allow 
the authorities to identify whether or how somebody had voted* LASA

LEGITIMIZING VERSUS MEANINGLESS THIRD WORLD ELECTIONS 121 


The ballots were also printed on heavy opaque white paper* The 
contrast with Somoza-era elections is striking* The Somozas used 
translucent ballots, so virtually everyone assumed that their ballot 
was not secret* The same problem occurred in the 1984 elections 
in El Salvador, where thin-paper ballots were deposited in trans¬ 
parent ballot boxes.The vote in Nicaragua in 1984 was truly a 
secret ballot (p, 14)4 

In Nicaragua, also, there was proportional voting, which made it possi¬ 
ble for the smaller parties to obtain legislative representation.Parties 
could also qualify quite easily to participate in the election* In 
Guatemala, 4,000 signatures were needed to qualify in 1984, a large 
number and not easy for dissident parties to collect in a society with 
daily political murders* 

Stephen Kinzer and his associates never mentioned these differ¬ 
ences.More generally, the substantial merits of the Nicaraguan elec¬ 
tions were never contrasted with the procedures in the U*S. client 
states, a comparison that would have been most revealing and that 
would have thoroughly undermined the Reagan agenda to which the 
media were committed in their reporting of the election.Time 3 as noted, 
mentions the compromised Salvadoran procedures as if they were meri¬ 
torious* The Times mentioned the transparent voting boxes in El Salva¬ 
dor only once (Richard Meislin, on March 25,1984), repeating without 
question the official line that the purpose of the translucent boxes was 
to prevent fraud.
