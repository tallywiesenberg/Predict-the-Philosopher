In sum* the two observer reports discuss rebel disruption in Nicara¬ 
gua, turnout* and the meaning of that turnout.The U.S. mass media* 
which had featured these matters heavily in reference to the Salvadoran 
election—where they fitted the government’s propaganda agenda— 
found them entirely unnewsworthy as regards Nicaragua, 


3.6.4.The revived sensitivity to 
coercion 

As we described earlier* the “coercion package” was off the agenda for 
the U.S. government and mass media in addressing the Salvadoran and 
Guatemalan elections.So was the element of fear engendered by mass 
murder and the absence of any rule of law in these U.S. client states.Coercion and fear were back on the agenda* however* for Nicaragua, 
This revival was illustrated with amazing dishonesty and hypocrisy in 
Time^ which had never mentioned fear and pressures from the govern¬ 
ment as factors possibly explaining turnout in the U.S.-sponsored elec¬ 
tions, even after the murder of 50,000 civilians.
