In Nicaragua* however, 
the “pugnacious” Sandinistas had “an awesome monopoly of force,” 
and gening them to “relax their grip,” which was “essential for free 
electoral competition*” was extremely dubious.Time’s Central Ameri¬ 
can correspondent George Russell even located a “Latin American 
diplomat” who says, “You can’t have democracy where there is no 
personal liberty at all” (Oct. 8 and May 14* 1984).Russell and Time had 
never found the Salvadoran government “pugnacious*” with any “awe¬ 
some monopoly of force*” or as having a “grip” that needed relaxing 
for electoral competition, and personal liberty was never mentioned as 
lacking or even pertinent to Salvadoran elections.For the Nicaraguan 
election, however* Time found that “The pressure to participate was 
high: many citizens feared they would lose precious rationing cards.” 
Further, “the government had made it clear that it considered failure 
to vote a counterrevolutionary stance.” Later, quoting Daniel Ortega* 
“All Nicaraguans who are Nicaraguans are going to vote.The only ones 
who are not going to vote are sellouts” (Nov. 19* 1984).
