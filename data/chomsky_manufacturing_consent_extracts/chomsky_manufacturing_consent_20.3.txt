It suppresses the fact that the Nicaraguan army did not 
regularly murder even “counterrevolutionaries/ 1 whereas the Salvado¬ 
ran and Guatemalan armies murdered numerous people who weren't 
“revolutionaries” but were somehow in the way.In shorty propaganda 
could hardly be more brazen.Time's alleged “fact/ 1 that “many” people feared the removal of the 
rationing card* is contested by LASA, which states that “in our inter¬ 
views in many neighborhoods in several cities, we found no evidence 
that ration cards were being held back or withdrawn , ..for any 
reason,” They note that there were five reports filed with the supreme 
electoral council alleging intimidation by threat of withdrawal of ration 
cards, “but none of these allegations were sustained upon investiga¬ 
tion” (p. 27).
