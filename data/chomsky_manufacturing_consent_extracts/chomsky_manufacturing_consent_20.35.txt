Time does not indicate the source of its evidence and fails 
to provide a single illustration of the “many” cases.We noted earlier that Stephen Kinzer cited more claims of coercion 
in the Nicaraguan than the Guatemalan elections, a remarkable jour¬ 
nalistic achievement, given the unchallenged facts about the actual 
scale and character of repression in the two states.His playing down 
of state terror in Guatemala as a basic factor affecting the quality of the 
election in all its dimensions—the ability of candidates to run, freedom 
of speech and press, the existence of intermediate groups, endemic fear, 
and the meaning of turnout—amounts to massive deceit.His Nicarag¬ 
uan coverage also involved large-scale misrepresentation.He did not 
point out the absence of mass killings, and he failed to mention the 
absence of a coercion package—no transparent boxes, no requirement 
that an ID card be stamped, and no legal obligation to vote.
