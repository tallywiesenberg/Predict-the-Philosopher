100 There is good 
reason to believe that Cruz never intended to run, but that he and his 
sponsors had held out this possibility precisely to allow the propaganda 
frame to be used effectively.101 

The mass media focused on the Cruz drama heavily and uncritically.Cruz was given enormous play: he was continually referred to as the 
“main opposition 51 or “leading opponent” of the ruling party (without 
any supporting evidence), and his candidacy was made “an acid test of 
the Sandinistas 5 democratic intentions” {Time* Oct. 29, 1984).For the 
Times, the election would be a “sham” without Cruz (editorial, Oct. 7, 
1984), and its news columns placed “main opposition” Cruz on center 
stage, from which vantage point he could regularly denounce the pro¬ 
ceedings as a “farce” or sham.102 The Times did have one good back¬ 
page article that provided evidence that Cruz had not intended to run 
or would not have been allowed to run by his closest Nicaraguan allies 
and U.S, officials, and that his function was, as we stated, to discredit 
the election by pretending to be interested, thus capturing press atten¬ 
tion, 103 But this low-keyed article stood alone and did not alter the 
unremitting focus on the alleged exclusion of this alleged main opposi¬ 
tion as the centerpiece of the Nicaraguan election drama.
