In focusing on an alleged “main opposition” in Nicaragua, which 
voluntarily chose not to run, while ignoring a real main opposition in 
El Salvador, excluded by force and plan, the mass media simply 
adopted without question the government’s propaganda framework.Sources that would speak to the condition of the “main opposition” in 
El Salvador and the significance of its exclusion—both Salvadorans and 
foreign observers—were simply ignored.104 In the case of the Nicara¬ 
guan election, in contrast, Cruz and U.S. government officials were 
given the floor to present their themes, which were transmitted on a 
daily basis with no accompanying notice of their possible falsity and 
manipulative intent, in perfect accord with the expectations of a propa¬ 
ganda model.The Reagan administration not only dangled Cruz before the media, 
it tried hard to induce or bribe other candidates in the Nicaraguan 
election to withdraw in order to fulfil the prophecy of a meaningless 
election.The brazenness of this intervention by a great power was 
remarkable, but the U.S. media gave it minimal attention.
