It even quotes without comment the State Department 
fabrication that “it did not try to influence the outcome of the election” 
(Nov. 19* 1984).All substantive evidence is placed in the black hole.In 
the same article, Time asserts that “the U.S. had pushed hard for 
elections in which all parties felt free to participate, 55 a fabrication of 
considerable audacity.As regards the scope of electoral options in Nicaragua* the Irish 
delegation noted that “The [political parties] law guarantees participa¬ 
tion to political parties of all ideologies,” an interesting point validated 
by a range of political opinion in the contesting parties far wider than 
that found in El Salvador and Guatemala (or the United States).LASA states that “No major political tendency in Nicaragua was 
denied access to the electoral process in 1984” (p. 18).
