In retrospect* Kinzer concedes the fact* although with the customary 
propaganda twist.He writes that “Ortega’s landslide victory was never 
in doubt,” because “the opposition was splintered” (and* as he fails to 
observe* had no popular base* in contrast to the well-organized San- 
dinista party), and “because the Sandinistas controlled the electoral 
machinery,” Neither he nor anyone else has offered a particle of evi¬ 
dence that Sandinista control over the electoral machinery made the 
elections a sham* or to contest the conclusion of the LASA delegation 
that “the FSLN did little more to take advantage of its incumbency 
than incumbent parties everywhere (including the United States) rou¬ 
tinely do*” A few days earlier* Kinzer had quoted Arturo Cruz as 
observing that the Sandinistas deserve credit for having overthrown 
Somoza and “having broken barriers in Nicaragua that had to be bro¬ 
ken* and that is irreversible*” because “the Sandinistas were working 
in the catacombs while we in the traditional opposition were out of 
touch with the rising expectations of the masses*” As Kinzer knows, but 
will not write* the same was true at the time of the 1984 elections* which 
is why the Sandinista victory was never in doubt* This deceitful dismis¬ 
sal of the 1984 elections is one of Kinzer’s many contributions to the 
media campaign to contrast the “elected presidents” of the four Central 
American “democracies” with the Sandinista dictator Ortega, not an 
elected president by U*S. government imprimatur* The specific context 
was the massive media campaign to attribute the failures of the 
Guatemala City peace agreement of August 1987 to the Sandinistas, in 
accordance with Reagan administration priorities, on the eve of the 
crucial congressional vote on renewed contra aid* 105 

LASA also stresses the fact that Cruz—effectively representing the 
contras, a segment of the local business community, and the United 
States—could have run in the Nicaraguan election, with excellent 
funding, ample media access* and without fear of being murdered.Even 
without Cruz the contras had an electoral voice* LASA notes that 

We know of no election in Latin America (or elsewhere) in which 
groups advocating the violent overthrow of an incumbent govern¬ 
ment have themselves been incorporated into the electoral pro¬ 
cess* particularly when these groups have been openly supported 
by a foreign power* The contras nevertheless had a voice in the 
1984 election campaign* Two of the Coordinadora-affiliated par-

ties, the PSD and the PLC, supported their inclusion in the elec¬ 
tions.And while denying that they represented the contras, Arturo 
Cruz and the Coordinadora seemed to endorse and promote their 
cause, both within Nicaragua and abroad (p. 18).LASA also discusses in some detail the U.S. intervention in the elec¬ 
tion, noting the terrorizing overflights by U.S. planes during the elec¬ 
tion campaign, and considering at some length the U-S. efforts to 
induce the withdrawal of candidates.
