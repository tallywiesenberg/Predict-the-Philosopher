the press and assembly 

Not only the rights of any and all candidates to run for public office, 
but other basic conditions that had been off the agenda in El Salvador 
and Guatemala were of deep concern to the U.S. government and mass 
media in reference to Nicaragua.The New York Times, Time, Newsweek, 
and CBS News all put great stress on the trials and tribulations of La 
Prensa , 106 although during the Salvadoran election none of them had 
even mentioned the destruction by physical violence and murder of La 
Cronica and El Independienze, or the toll of murdered journalists.Mob 
violence allegedly organized by the government, and the threat of the 
neighborhood defense committees, were featured by Time in NicaraÂ¬ 
gua, whereas ORDEN and the death squads in El Salvador and 
Guatemala it had never mentioned as pertinent to election quality, 
Basic conditions of a free election were not only back on the media 
agenda, but there were strong suggestions that Nicaragua was failing 
to meet these conditions .
