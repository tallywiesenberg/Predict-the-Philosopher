These suggestions were based almost entirely 
on quotes from U.S. officials and Cruz and his allies in Nicaragua.The 
media never gave evidence of having actually looked into these matters 
for themselves or tapped independent sources of evidence.Richard Wagner, on CBS News (Nov. 3, 1984), citing as usual Ar¬ 
turo Cruz as the “strongest opposition, 54 also mobilizes a single Nica¬ 
raguan citizen (no doubt selected at random) who says: “How can this 
be free elections [ric] when we don't have freedom of speech, free¬ 
dom of the press?” Wagner says that “In addition to censorship” 
there were food shortages, a deteriorated transportation system, an

unpopular draft, and church opposition, so that “it becomes apparent 
why a free and open election is not in the cards.” The cynicism in 
failing to raise the question of why there are food shortages and a 
deteriorated transportation system in Nicaragua is remarkable.Wag¬ 
ner also misses another distinction between Nicaragua and El Salva¬ 
dor; the former has an “unpopular draft,” whereas in the terror state 
of El Salvador there is no draft—instead there is press-ganging of 
young men into the army from the slums, refugee camps, and rural 
areas, while the young sons of the wealthy live the high life in San 
Salvador and Miami (much the same is true in Guatemala and Hon¬ 
duras).Wagneris double standard is also remarkable.
