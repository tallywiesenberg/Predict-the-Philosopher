5. Public Opinion, p. 248. Lippmann did not find this objectionable, as “the 
common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be' 
managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the 
locality” (p. 310). He was distressed that the incorrigible bias of the press might 
mislead the “specialized class” as well as the public. The problem, therefore, 
was how to get adequate information to the decision-making elites (pp. 31—32)* 
This, he believed, might be accomplished by development of a body of inde¬ 
pendent experts who could give the leadership unbiased advice. Lippmann 
raised no question about possible personal or class interests of the “specialized 
class” or the “experts” on whom they might choose to rely, on their ability, 
or their right, to articulate “the common interest.” 

6. For example, Claire Sterling and the experts of the Georgetown Center for 
Strategic and International Studies—Walter Laqueur, Michael Ledeen, and 


Robert Kupperman—have been established as the authorities on terrorism by 
the mass media; on the Sterling and Paul Henze role in working up the 
Bulgarian Connection in the plot against the pope, see chapter 4. In the case 
of Latin America, the media have been compelled to avoid the usual resort to 
the academic profession for expression of approved opinion, as the profession 
largely rejects the framework of state propaganda in this instance. It has 
therefore been necessary to create a new cadre of “experts” (Robert Leiken, 
Ronald Radosh, Mark Falcoff, Susan Kaufman Purcell, etc.) to whom they can 
turn to satisfy doctrinal needs. See Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Terrorism 
(Boston: South End Press, 1988), for examples. On the process of creating 
experts to meet system demands, see our chapter 1 under “Sourcing Mass- 
Media News.” 

7. Like other terms of political discourse, the word “democracy” has a techni¬ 
cal Orwellian sense when used in rhetorical flights, or in regular “news report¬ 
ing,” to refer to U.S. efforts to establish “democracy.” The term refers to 
systems in which control over resources and the means of violence ensures the 
rule of elements that will serve the needs of U.S. power. Thus the terror states 
of El Salvador and Guatemala are “democratic,” as is Honduras under the rule 
of the military and oligarchy, and the collection of wealthy businessmen, 
bankers, etc., organized by the United States as a front for the Somocista-led 
mercenary army created by the United States is entitled “the democratic 
resistance.” See further, chapter 3.

York Times and the Washington Post in the first three months of 1986, during
