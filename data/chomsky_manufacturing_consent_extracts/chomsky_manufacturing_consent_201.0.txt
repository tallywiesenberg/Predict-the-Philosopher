Chapter 1: A Propaganda Model 

1. See note 4 of the preface. 

2. Media representatives claim that what the government says is “news¬ 
worthy” in its own right. If, however, the government’s assertions are transmit¬ 
ted without context or evaluation, and without regard to the government’s 
possible manipulative intent, the media have set themselves up to be 
“managed.” Their objectivity is “nominal,” not substantive. 

In early October 1986, memos were leaked to the press indicating that the 
Reagan administration had carried out a deliberate campaign of disinformation 
to influence events in Libya. The mass media, which had passed along this 
material without question, expressed a great deal of righteous indignation that 
they had been misled. To compound the absurdity, five years earlier the press 
had reported a CIA-run “disinformation program designed to embarrass Qad- 
dafi and his government,” along with terrorist operations to overthrow Quad- 
dafi and perhaps assassinate him {Newsweek, Aug. 3,1981; P. Edward Haley, 
Qaddafi and the United States since 1969 [New York: Praeger, 1984], p. 272). 
But no lessons were learned. In fact, the mass media are gulled on an almost 
daily basis, but rarely have to suffer the indignity of government documents 
revealing their gullibility. With regard to Libya, the media have fallen into line 
for each propaganda ploy, from the 1981 “hit squads” through the Berlin 
discotheque bombing, swallowing each implausible claim, failing to admit 
error in retrospect, and apparently unable to learn from successive entrap¬ 
ment—which suggests willing error. See Noam Chomsky, Pirates & Emperors 
(New York: Claremont, 1986), chapter 3. As we show throughout the present 
book, a series of lies by the government, successively exposed, never seems to 
arouse skepticism in the media regarding the next government claim. 

3. For a description of the government’s strategy of deflecting attention away 
from the Nicaraguan election by the fabricated MIG story, and the media’s 
service in this government program, see chapter 3, under “The MIG Crisis 
Staged during the Nicaraguan Election Week.”
