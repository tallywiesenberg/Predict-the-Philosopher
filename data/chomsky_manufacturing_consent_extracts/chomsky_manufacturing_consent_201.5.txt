10. Note that we are speaking of media with substantial outreach—mass 
media. It has always been possible to start small-circulation journals and to 
produce mimeographed or photocopied news letters sent around to a tiny 
audience. But even small journals in the United States today typically survive 
only by virtue of contributions from wealthy financial angels.

Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, and Hartford, Connecticut, had book pub¬ 
lishing and magazine subsidiaries, and owned cable systems and seven televi¬ 
sion stations.

14. The four major Western wire services—Associated Press, United Press 
International, Reuters, and Agence-France-Presse—account for some 80 per¬ 
cent of the international news circulating in the world today. AP is owned by 
member newspapers; UPI is privately owned; Reuters was owned mainly by 
the British media until it went public in 1984, but control was retained by the 
original owners by giving lesser voting rights to the new stockholders; Agence- 
France-Presse is heavily subsidized by the French government. As is pointed 
out by Jonathan Fenby, the wire services “exist to serve markets,” and their 
prime concern, accordingly, “is with the rich media markets of the United 
States, Western Europe, and Japan, and increasingly with the business com¬ 
munity. ...” They compete fiercely, but AP and UPI “are really U.S. enter¬ 
prises that operate on an international scale.... Without their domestic base, 
the AP and UPI could not operate as international agencies. With it, they must 
be American organizations, subject to American pressures and requirements” 
{The International News Services [New York: Schocken, 1986], pp. 7,9,73-74).

15. The fourteenth annual Roper survey, “Public Attitudes toward Television 

and Other Media in a Time of Change” (May 1985), indicates that in 1984, 64 
percent of the sample mentioned television as the place “where you usually 
get most of your news about what’s going on in the world today . . (p. 3). 

It has often been noted that the television networks themselves depend heavily 
on the prestige newspapers, wire services, and government for their choices 
of news. Their autonomy as newsmakers can be easily exaggerated.
