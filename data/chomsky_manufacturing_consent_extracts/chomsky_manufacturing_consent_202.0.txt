as setters of news standards, and asset and profit totals. The last half dozen 
or so in our twenty-four involve a certain amount of arbitrariness of choice,

because of its joint strength in trade books and magazines of political content 
and outreach. 

17. As noted in table 1-1, note 7, Storer came under the temporary control of 
the securities firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in 1985. As its ultimate fate 
was unclear at the time of writing, and as financial data were no longer 
available after 1984, we have kept Storer on the table and list it here, despite 
its uncertain status. 

18. John Kluge, having taken the Metromedia system private in a leveraged 
buyout in 1984 worth $1.1 billion, sold off various parts of this system in 1985-86 
for $5.5 billion, at a personal profit of some $3 billion (Gary Hector, “Are 
Shareholders Cheated by LBOs?” Fortune, Jan. 17, 1987, p. 100). Station 
KDLA-TV, in Los Angeles, which had been bought by a management-outsider 
group in a leveraged buyout in 1983 for $245 million, was sold to the Tribune 
Company for $510 million two years later (Richard Stevenson, “Tribune in TV 
Deal for $510 Million,” New York Times , May 7,1985). See also “The Media 
Magnates: Why Huge Fortunes Roll Off the Presses,” Fortune, October 12, 
1987. 

19. A split among the the heirs of James E. Scripps eventually resulted in the 
sale of the Detroit Evening News . According to one news article, “Daniel 
Marentette, a Scripps family member and a self described ‘angry shareholder/ 
says family members want a better return on their money. ‘We get better yields 
investing in a New York checking account/ says Mr. Marentette, who sells 
race horses” (Damon Darlin, “Takeover Rumors Hit Detroit News Parent,” 
Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1985). The Bingham family division on these 
matters led to the sale of the Louisville Courier-Journal', the New Haven papers 
of the Jackson family were sold after years of squabbling, and “the sale price 
[of the New Haven papers], $185 million, has only served to publicize the 
potential value of family holdings of family newspapers elsewhere” (Geraldine 
Fabrikant, “Newspaper Properties, Hotter Than Ever,” New York Times, Aug. 
17, 1986). 

20. The Reagan administration strengthened the control of existing holders of 
television-station licenses by increasing their term from three to five years, and 
its FCC made renewals essentially automatic. The FCC also greatly facilitated 
speculation and trading in television properties by a rule change reducing the 
required holding period before sale of a newly acquired property from three
