years to one year. 

The Reagan era FCC and Department of Justice also refused to challenge 
mergers and takeover bids that would significantly increase the concentration 
of power (GE-RCA) or media concentration (Capital Cities-ABC). Further¬ 
more, beginning April 2, 1985, media owners could own as many as twelve 
television stations, as long as their total audience didn’t exceed 25 percent of 
the nation’s television households; and they could also hold twelve AM and 
twelve FM stations, as the 1953 “7-7-7 rule” was replaced with a “12-12-12 
rule.” See Herbert H. Howard, “Group and Cross-Media Ownership of Tele¬ 
vision Stations: 1985” (Washington: National Association of Broadcasters, 
I98 5). 

21. This was justified by Reagan-era FCC chairman Mark Fowler on the 
grounds that market options are opening up and that the public should be free 
to choose. Criticized by Fred Friendly for doing away with the law’s public-

interest standard, Fowler replied that Friendly “distrusts the ability of the 
viewing public to make decisions on its own through the marketplace mecha¬ 
nism. I do not” (Jeanne Saddler, “Clear Channel: Broadcast Takeovers Meet 
Less FCC Static, and Critics Are Upset,” Wall Street Journal, June n, 1985). 
Among other problems, Fowler ignores the fact that true freedom of choice 
involves the ability to select options that may not be offered by an oligopoly 
selling audiences to advertisers. 

22. CBS increased its debt by about $1 billion in 1985 to finance the purchase 
of 21 percent of its own stock, in order to fend off a takeover attempt by Ted 
Turner. The Wall Street Journal noted that “With debt now standing at 60% 
of capital, it needs to keep advertising revenue up to repay borrowings and 
interest” (Peter Barnes, “CBS Profit Hinges on Better TV Ratings,” June 6, 
1986). With the slowed-up growth of advertising revenues, CBS embarked on 
an employment cutback of as many as six hundred broadcast division em¬ 
ployees, the most extensive for CBS since the loss of cigarette advertising in 
1971 (Peter Barnes, “CBS Will Cut up to 600 Posts in Broadcasting,” Wall 
Street Journal, July 1,1986). In June 1986, Time, Inc., embarked on a program 
to buy back as much as 10 million shares, or 16 percent of its common stock, 
at an expected cost of some $900 million, again to reduce the threat of a hostile 
takeover (Laura Landro, “Time Will Buy as Much as 16% of Its Common,” 
Wall Street Journal, June 20, 1986). 

23. In response to the Jesse Helms and Turner threats to CBS, Laurence 
Tisch, of Loews Corporation, was encouraged to increase his holdings in CBS 
stock, already at 11.7 percent. In August 1986, the Loews interest was raised 
to 24.9 percent, and Tisch obtained a position of virtual control. In combina¬ 
tion with William Paley, who owned 8.1 percent of the shares, the chief 
executive officer of CBS was removed and Tisch took over that role himself,
