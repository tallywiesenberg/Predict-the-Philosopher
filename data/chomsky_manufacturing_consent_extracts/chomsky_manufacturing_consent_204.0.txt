43. “. . . producers presenting patrons [advertisers] with the greatest oppor¬ 
tunities to make a profit through their publics will receive support while those 
that cannot compete on this score will not survive” (Joseph Turow, Media 
Industries: The Production of News and Entertainment [New York: Longman, 
1984]* p. 52). 

44. Noncommercial television is also at a huge disadvantage for the same 
reason, and will require a public subsidy to be able to compete. Because public 
television does not have the built-in constraints of ownership by the wealthy, 
and the need to appease advertisers, it poses a threat to a narrow elite control 
of mass communications. This is why conservatives struggle to keep public 
television on a short leash, with annual funding decisions, and funding at a low 
level (see Barnouw, The Sponsor, pp. 179-82). Another option pursued in the 
Carter-Reagan era has been to force it into the commercial nexus by sharp 
defunding.

ment of “efficiency” in “delivering an audience.” In the magazine business, the 
standard measure is CPM, or “costs per thousand,” to an advertiser to reach 
buyers through a full-page, black-and-white ad. Recent developments, like 
CBS’s CAP, have been in the direction of identifying the special characteristics 
of the audience delivered. In selling itself to advertisers, the Soap Opera Digest 
says: “But you probably want to know about our first milestone: today Soap 
Opera Digest delivers more women in the 18-49 category at the lowest CPM 
than any other women’s magazine” (quoted in Turow, Media Industries, p. 55).

55. According to Procter & Gamble’s instructions to their ad agency, “There 
will be no material on any of our programs which could in any way further 
the concept of business as cold, ruthless, and lacking in all sentiment or 
spiritual motivation.” The manager of corporate communications for General 
Electric has said: “We insist on a program environment that reinforces our 
corporate messages” (quoted in Bagdikian, Media Monopoly, p. 160). We may 
recall that GE now owns NBC-TV.

57. Advertisers may also be offended by attacks on themselves or their pro¬ 
ducts. On the tendency of the media to avoid criticism of advertised products 
even when very important to consumer welfare [e.g., the effects of smoking], 
see Bagdikian, Media Monopoly, pp. 168-73. 

58. This is hard to prove statistically, given the poor data made available by 
the FCC over the years. The long-term trend in advertising time/programming 
time is dramatically revealed by the fact that in 1929 the National Association 
of Broadcasting adopted as a standard of commercial practice on radio the 
following: “Commercial announcements ... shall not be broadcast between 7 
and 11 p.m.” William Paley testified before the Senate Commerce Committee 
in 1930 that only 22 percent of CBS’s time was allocated to commercially 
sponsored programs, with the other 78 percent sustaining; and he noted that 
advertising took up only “seven-tenths of 1 percent of all our time” (quoted 
in Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees, FCC [Washington: GPO, 
Mar. 7,1946], p. 42). Frank Wolf states in reference to public-affairs program¬ 
ming: “That such programs were even shown at all on commercial television 
may have been the result of FCC regulation” {Television Programming for News
