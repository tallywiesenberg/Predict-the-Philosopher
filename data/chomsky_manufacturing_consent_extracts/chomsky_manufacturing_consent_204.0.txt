tunities to make a profit through their publics will receive support while those 
that cannot compete on this score will not survive” (Joseph Turow, Media 
Industries: The Production of News and Entertainment [New York: Longman, 
1984]* p. 52). 

44. Noncommercial television is also at a huge disadvantage for the same 
reason, and will require a public subsidy to be able to compete. Because public 
television does not have the built-in constraints of ownership by the wealthy, 
and the need to appease advertisers, it poses a threat to a narrow elite control 
of mass communications. This is why conservatives struggle to keep public 
television on a short leash, with annual funding decisions, and funding at a low 
level (see Barnouw, The Sponsor, pp. 179-82). Another option pursued in the 
Carter-Reagan era has been to force it into the commercial nexus by sharp 
defunding.

ment of “efficiency” in “delivering an audience.” In the magazine business, the 
standard measure is CPM, or “costs per thousand,” to an advertiser to reach 
buyers through a full-page, black-and-white ad. Recent developments, like 
CBS’s CAP, have been in the direction of identifying the special characteristics 
of the audience delivered. In selling itself to advertisers, the Soap Opera Digest 
says: “But you probably want to know about our first milestone: today Soap 
Opera Digest delivers more women in the 18-49 category at the lowest CPM 
than any other women’s magazine” (quoted in Turow, Media Industries, p. 55).

patrons plays a dominant part in setting the general boundary conditions for 
day-to-day production activity” (Media Industries, p. 51).
