55. According to Procter & Gamble’s instructions to their ad agency, “There 
will be no material on any of our programs which could in any way further 
the concept of business as cold, ruthless, and lacking in all sentiment or 
spiritual motivation.” The manager of corporate communications for General 
Electric has said: “We insist on a program environment that reinforces our

ducts. On the tendency of the media to avoid criticism of advertised products 
even when very important to consumer welfare [e.g., the effects of smoking],

the FCC over the years. The long-term trend in advertising time/programming 
time is dramatically revealed by the fact that in 1929 the National Association 
of Broadcasting adopted as a standard of commercial practice on radio the

in 1930 that only 22 percent of CBS’s time was allocated to commercially 
sponsored programs, with the other 78 percent sustaining; and he noted that 
advertising took up only “seven-tenths of 1 percent of all our time” (quoted 
in Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees, FCC [Washington: GPO, 
Mar. 7,1946], p. 42). Frank Wolf states in reference to public-affairs program¬ 
ming: “That such programs were even shown at all on commercial television 
may have been the result of FCC regulation” {Television Programming for News
