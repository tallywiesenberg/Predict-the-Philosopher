ITT’s post-early-i970s-scandals sponsorship of “The Big Blue Marble,” see 
Barnouw, The Sponsor, ibid., pp. 51-52, 84-86. Barnouw shows that network 
news coverage of ITT was sharply constrained during the period of ITT 
program sponsorship.

70. Its nine regional offices also had some public-information operations, but 
personnel and funding are not readily allocable to this function. They are 
smaller than the central office aggregate. 

The AFSC aggregate public-information budget is about the same size as 
the contract given by the State Department to International Business Com¬ 
munications (IBC) for lobbying on behalf of the contras ($419,000). This was 
only one of twenty-five contracts investigated by the GAO that “the Latin 
American Public Diplomacy office awarded to individuals for research and 
papers on Central America, said a GAO official involved in the investigation” 
(Rita Beamish, “Pro-contra Contracts are Probed,” Philadelphia Inquirer, July 
22,1987, p. 4A). 

71. The NCC’s news services are concentrated in the Office of Information, 
but it has some dispersed staff in communications functions elsewhere in the 
organization that produce a few newsletters, magazines, and some videotapes 
and filmstrips. 

72. In 1980, Mobil Oil had a public-relations budget of $21 million and a 
public-relations staff of seventy-three. Between 1976 and 1981 it produced at 
least a dozen televised special reports on such issues as gasoline prices, with 
a hired television journalist interviewing Mobil executives and other experts, 
that are shown frequently on television, often without indication of Mobil 
sponsorship. See A. Kent MacDougall, Ninety Seconds To Tell It All (Home-

82. On January 16, 1986, the American Friends Service Committee issued a 
news release, based on extended Freedom of Information Act inquiries, which 
showed that there had been 381 navy nuclear-weapons accidents and “inci¬ 
dents” in the period 1965-77, a figure far higher than that previously claimed.
