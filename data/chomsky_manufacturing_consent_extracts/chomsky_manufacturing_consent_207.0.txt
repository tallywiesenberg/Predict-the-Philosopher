105. AIM’s impact is hard to gauge, but it must be recognized as only a part 
of a larger corporate-right-wing campaign of attack. It has common funding 
sources with such components of the conservative labyrinth as AEI, Hoover, 
the Institute for Contemporary Studies, and others (see Saloma, Ominous 
Politics, esp. chapters 2, 3, and 6), and has its own special role to play. AIM’s 
head, Reed Irvine, is a frequent participant in television talk shows, and his 
letters to the editor and commentary are regularly published in the mass media. 
The media feel obligated to provide careful responses to his detailed attacks 
on their news and documentaries, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
even helped fund his group’s reply to the PBS series on Vietnam. His ability
