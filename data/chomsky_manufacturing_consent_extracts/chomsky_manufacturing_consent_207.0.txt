Crooks, Conmen and Clowns: Businessmen in TV Entertainment, which contends 
that businessmen are treated badly in television entertainment programs.

105. AIM’s impact is hard to gauge, but it must be recognized as only a part 
of a larger corporate-right-wing campaign of attack. It has common funding 
sources with such components of the conservative labyrinth as AEI, Hoover, 
the Institute for Contemporary Studies, and others (see Saloma, Ominous 
Politics, esp. chapters 2, 3, and 6), and has its own special role to play. AIM’s 
head, Reed Irvine, is a frequent participant in television talk shows, and his 
letters to the editor and commentary are regularly published in the mass media. 
The media feel obligated to provide careful responses to his detailed attacks 
on their news and documentaries, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
even helped fund his group’s reply to the PBS series on Vietnam. His ability

to get the publisher of the New York Times to meet with him personally once 
a year—a first objective of any lobbyist—is impressive testimony to influence.

noted that in reference to Reagan’s errors of fact, “You write the stories once, 
twice, and you get a lot of mail saying, ‘You’re picking on the guy, you guys 
in the press make mistakes too.’ And editors respond to that, so after a while 
the stories don’t run anymore. We’re intimidated” (quoted in Hertsgaard, 
“How Reagan Seduced Us”).

115. Daix, in 1949, referred to the Stalin concentration camps as “one of the 
Soviet Union’s most glorious achievements,” displaying “the complete sup¬ 
pression of man’s exploitation of man” (quoted in Miliband et al., Socialist 
Register, p. 337). Kriegel, formerly a hard-line Communist party functionary, 
was the author of a 1982 book explaining that the KGB organized the Sabra- 
Shatila massacres, employing German terrorists associated with the PLO and 
with the tacit cooperation of the CIA, in order to defame Israel as part of the 
Soviet program of international terrorism. For more on this profound study, 
and its influence, see Noam Chomsky, Fateful Triangle (Boston: South End
