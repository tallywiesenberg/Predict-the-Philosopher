ish case is the Western press’s refusal to publicize the Turkish government’s 
attacks on the press, including the U.S. press’s own reporters in that country. 
UPI’s reporter Ismet Imset, beaten up by the Turkish police and imprisoned 
under trumped-up charges, was warned by UPI not to publicize the charges 
against him, and UPI eventually fired him for criticizing their badly compro¬ 
mised handling of his case. See Chris Christiansen, “Keeping In With The 
Generals,” New Statesman, January 4, 1985. 

119. We believe that the same dichotomization applies in the domestic sphere. 
For example, both British and American analysts have noted the periodic 
intense focus on—and indignation over—“welfare chiselers” by the mass 
media, and the parallel de-emphasis of and benign attitudes toward the far 
more important fraud and tax abuses of business and the affluent. There is also 
a deep-seated reluctance on the part of the mass media to examine the struc¬ 
tural causes of inequality and poverty. Peter Golding and Sue Middleton, after 
an extensive discussion of the long-standing “criminalization of poverty” and 
incessant attacks on welfare scroungers in Britain, point out that tax evasion, 
by contrast, is “acceptable, even laudable,” in the press, that the tax evader 
“is not merely a victim but a hero.” They note, also, that “The supreme 
achievement of welfare capitalism” has been to render the causes and condi¬ 
tion of poverty almost invisible (Images of Welfare: Press and Public Attitudes 
to Poverty [Oxford: Martin Robertson, 1982], pp. 66-67, 98-100, 186, 193). 

In a chapter entitled “The Deserving Rich,” A. J. Liebling pointed out that 
in the United States as well, “The crusade against the destitute is the favorite 
crusade of the newspaper publisher,” and that “There is no concept more 
generally cherished by publishers than that of the Undeserving Poor” (The 
Press [New York: Ballantine, 1964], pp. 78-79). Liebling went into great detail 
on various efforts of the media to keep welfare expenses and taxes down “by 
saying that they [the poor] have concealed assets, or bad character, or both” 
(p. 79). These strategies not only divert, they also help split the employed 
working class from the unemployed and marginalized, and make these all 
exceedingly uncomfortable about participating in a degraded system of 
scrounging. See Peter Golding and Sue Middleton, “Attitudes to Claimants: 
A Culture of Contempt,” in Images of Welfare, pp. i69ff. President Reagan’s 
fabricated anecdotes about welfare chiselers, and his complete silence on the 
large-scale chiseling of his corporate sponsors, have fitted into a long tradition 
of cynical and heartless greed. 

120. For a full discussion of this dichotomized treatment, see Edward S. Her¬ 
man, “Gatekeeper versus Propaganda Models: A Critical American Perspec¬ 
tive,” in Peter Golding, Graham Murdock and Philip Schlesinger, eds., 
Communicating Politics (New York: Holmes & Meier, 1986), pp. 182-94. 

121. Editorial, March 1, 1973. The Soviets apparently didn’t know that they 
were shooting down a civilian plane, but this was covered up by U.S. officials, 
and the false allegation of a knowing destruction of a civilian aircraft provided 
the basis for extremely harsh criticism of the Soviets for barbaric behavior. 
The Israelis openly admitted knowing that they were shooting down a civilian
