plane, but this point was of no interest in the West in this particular case. 

122. The New York Times Index, for example, has seven full pages of citations 
to the KAL 007 incident for September 1983 alone. 

123. Patriotic orgies, such as the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the

space-shuttle flights, and “Liberty Weekend,” perform a similar function in 
“bringing us all together.” See Elayne Rapping, The Looking Glass World of 
Nonfiction TV (Boston: South End Press, 1987), chapter 5, “National Rituals.” 

124. See below, chapter 6. 

125. On issues where the elite is seriously divided, there will be dissenting 
voices allowed in the mass media, and the inflation of claims and suspension of 
critical judgment will be subject to some constraint. See the discussion of this 
point in the preface, pp. xii-xiii, and examples in the case studies that follow. 

126. The role of the government in these cases cannot be entirely discounted, 
given the close ties of the Reader’s Digest to the CIA and the fact that Paul 
Henze, one of the primary sources and movers in the Bulgarian Connection 
campaign, was a longtime CIA official. On the CIA -Reader’s Digest connec¬ 
tion, see Epstein, “The Invention of Arkady Shevchenko,” pp. 40-41. On 
Henze, see below, chapter 4. On the strong likelihood that an influential 
Reader’s Digest best-seller on Cambodia was in part a CIA disinformation 
effort, see below chapter 6, p. 293, and sources cited. 

127. We provide many illustrations of these points in the chapters that follow. 
Watergate and, more recently, the late-Reagan-era exposures of Iran-Contra- 
gate, which are put forward as counterexamples, are discussed in chapter 7, 
below. 

128. These points apply clearly to the case of the alleged Bulgarian Connection 
in the plot to assassinate the pope. See below, chapter 4. 

129. We have noted elsewhere that the New York Times regularly relied upon 
Indonesian officials in “presenting the facts” about East Timor, which was 
being invaded by Indonesia, and ignored refugees, church sources, etc. In 
contrast, refugees, not state officials, were the prime source in the Times’ s 
reporting on postwar events in Vietnam and Cambodia ( The Washington Con¬ 
nection and Third World Fascism [Boston: South End Press, 1979], pp. IS 1 -? 2 * 
169-76, 184-87). On attempts to evade the obvious implications, see chapter
