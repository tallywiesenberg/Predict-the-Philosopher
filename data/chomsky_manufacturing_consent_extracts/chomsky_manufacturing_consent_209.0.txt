6, under “The Pol Pot Era” (pp. 284-85). 

130. Thus when the CIA directs Nicaraguan contras to attack such “soft 
targets” as farming cooperatives, with explicit State Department approval, the 
media commentators, including doves, either applaud or offer philosophical 
disquisitions on whether such targets are legitimate, given that they are de¬ 
fended by lightly armed militia. Terrorist attacks on Israeli kibbutzim, also 
defended by armed settlers, are regarded somewhat differently. For details, see 
Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Terrorism (Boston: South End Press, 1988). 

131. The variable use of agendas and frameworks can be seen with great clarity 
in the treatment of Third World elections supported and opposed by the 
United States, as described in chapter 3. 

132. Classic in their audacity are Michael Ledeen’s assertions that: (1) Qad- 
dafi’s word is given more credence in the mass media than that of the U.S. 
government; and (2) “Relatively minor human rights transgressions in a 
friendly country (especially if ruled by an authoritarian government of the 
Right) are given far more attention and more intense criticism than far graver 
sins of countries hostile to us . . .” ( Grave New World [New York: Oxford 
University Press, 1985], p. 131; Qaddafi’s superior credence is described on pp. 
132—33). See chapter 2 of this book for documentation on the reality of mass- 
media treatment of abuses by clients and enemy states. 



Chapter 2: Worthy and Unworthy 
Victims 

1. In a speech of July 19,1986, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, in answer¬ 
ing charges of religious persecution, asserted that of 138 religious persons 
murdered and 278 kidnapped or disappeared in Central America since 1979 (a 
figure that includes Lay Delegates of the Word), none had been victimized by 
the Nicaraguan government. ( Central America News Update , Aug. 4, 1986). 
Many had been killed by the contras, however, in an ongoing tradition of 
Somocista violence. See Andrew Reding, “The Church in Nicaragua,” 
Monthly Review (July-August 1987), pp. 34-36. The large majority were mur¬ 
dered by the army and security forces of U.S. client states, or the death squads 
affiliated with them. 

2. In The Real Terror Network (Boston: South End Press, 1982), Edward Her¬ 
man shows that in the years 1976-81, the only massive coverage of the victimi¬ 
zation of individuals abroad by the New York Times was of Soviet dissidents, 
most notably Sharansky and Sakharov (pp. 196-99), although there were nu¬ 
merous cases of comparable or far worse treatment within U.S. domains. 

3. Computed by dividing the number of articles and CBS News reports (or 
column inches) devoted to Popieluszko by the number dealing with the one 
hundred religious victims and multiplying by 100.
