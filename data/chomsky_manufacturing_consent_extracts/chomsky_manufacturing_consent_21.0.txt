In El Salvador 
in 1982 and 1984 there was far more severe censorship (including out¬ 
right murder), food shortages, a deteriorating transport system, and 
church opposition—and more pertinent, a complete exclusion of the 
“main opposition” and massive state terror—but these didn't make it 
apparent to CBS News that a free and open election was not in the 
cards in that U.S.-sponsored election.107 

The Irish delegation and LASA, especially the latter, addressed these 
issues, gave evidence of having examined them seriously, and came up 
with conclusions sharply at odds with the U.S. government-media 
portrayals.LASA provided an extensive discussion of the Sandinista 
defense committees and the scope of the turba violence and interfer¬ 
ence with freedom of assembly, concluding that the total number of 
disruptive incidents reported was “quite small,” and that the most 
serious occurred before the official campaign began.“In spite of Daniel 
Ortega's unfortunate statement on these disruptions, there is no evi¬ 
dence that the FSLN had a coherent strategy of stimulating or orches¬ 
trating them” (p. 24).As regards the defense committees, LASA 
concluded that they did not seem to be functioning as a spying network 
and that there was no serious evidence that they were a force making 
for intimidation (p. 27).
