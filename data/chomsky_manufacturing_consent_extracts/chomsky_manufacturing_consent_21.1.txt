It considers the imposition 
of press censorship to have been damaging to the election’s quality and 
credibility, even though the argument of the Sandinistas, that a country 
at war “can’t allow a newspaper which is the instrument of the enemy 
to publish its opinions freely” (Sergio Ramirez), is viewed as not wholly 
unreasonable.Nevertheless, while the censorship was also somewhat 
arbitrary and legalistic, LASA concluded that “The opposition could 
and did get its message out’’ (p. 26).And the finding overall was that 
the Nicaraguan election “by Latin American standards was a model of 
probity and fairness” (p. 32).The U.S. mass media did not concur, but it is striking how they avoid 
comparisons and data.The way in which the media can denounce 
restrictions on freedom of the press in Nicaragua after having totally 
ignored the question in El Salvador, where restrictions were far more 
severe, is remarkable.
