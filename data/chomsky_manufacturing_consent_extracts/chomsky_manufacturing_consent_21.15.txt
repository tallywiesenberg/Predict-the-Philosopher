This process of dichotomization is so internalized 
that the writers use the double standard within the same article, appar¬ 
ently unaware of their own bias.In an article in the New York Times 
of March 12,1984, “Clear Choices in Salvador, Murky Plans in Nicara¬ 
gua,” Hedrick Smith regards the choices as “clear” in El Salvador, 
whereas in Nicaragua the problem is whether in an election the San¬ 
dinistas will “give up significant power and control.” Multiple parties 
from the far right to the center-right in El Salvador demonstrate clear 
choices, but a variety of parties from right to far left in Nicaragua didn’t 
cause Smith to perceive real choices there, although he didn’t explain 
why.It apparently never occurs to Smith that there is an issue of 
whether the army and United States “will give up power and control” 
(and their determination to fight to victory) by the electoral route in El 
Salvador.Are there essential freedoms and absence of coercion in El Salvador 
that are necessary for a truly free election?Hedrick Smith talks about 
substantive electoral conditions only in Nicaragua.
