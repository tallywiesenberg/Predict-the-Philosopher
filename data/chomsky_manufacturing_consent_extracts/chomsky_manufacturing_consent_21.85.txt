As the basic conditions for 
a free election were superior in Nicaragua and the coercive elements 
less acute* the emphasis on basic conditions only in the Nicaraguan case 
is even more clearly evidence of systematic bias.3*8.THE MIG CRISIS STAGED 
DURING NICARAGUA’S 
ELECTION WEEK 

As Newsweek pointed out on November 19* 1984* “The story of the 
freighter [to Nicaragua, allegedly carrying MIGs] first broke during the 
election-night coverage*” but at no point does Newsweek (or Time, the 
Times, or CBS News) suggest that the timing was deliberate.The Times, 
in its extensive coverage of the MIGs that weren’t there, at one point 
quotes a Nicaraguan official who suggests that the crisis was purely a 
public-relations operation* but that exhausts the Times’s exploration of 
this point.Although the MIGs weren’t there, and the timing was per¬ 
fect for diverting attention from a successful election that the Reagan 
adminstration had been attempting to discredit, the elite media asked 
no questions* even in retrospect.
