media well attuned to state policy. The two assaults on Laura Pinto and the 
detention of the twelve members of the Mothers were totally suppressed by 
the New York Times and its confreres. There was not a word in the quality 
papers when a member of the “Mothers of the Disappeared” who had herself 
been a victim of the atrocities of Duarte’s security forces was denied entry to 
the United States in March 1987, to visit several small towns where she had 
been invited to speak on the occasion of International Women’s Day. See 
Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Terrorism (Boston: South End Press, 1988). 
The attention that the Times mentions as a constraint on Polish violence was 
not available to protect an unworthy victim. 

11. For a review of Times editorials on El Salvador in the 1980s, exculpating 
the state terrorists throughout, see Noam Chomsky, “U.S. Polity and Society,” 
in Thomas Walker, ed., Reagan versus the Sandinistas (Boulder, Colo.: West- 
view, 1987), pp. 295-96. 

12. The press may also have been constrained by the fact that reporters who 
dig deeply and provide accounts unfavorable to the military regimes in Latin 
America may be barred from the country, or even murdered. Western reporters 
are very rarely physically threatened—let alone murdered—in Poland, the 
Soviet Union, Cuba, or Nicaragua. They are often threatened and sometimes 
murdered in El Salvador, Guatemala, and other U.S. clients in Latin America. 
This irony is not commented upon in the free press, nor are the effects of this 
potential and actual violence against dissident reporters on the possibilities of 
honest reporting. This point is discussed further in chapter 3, pp. 97-98.

16. Carter sent former New York mayor Robert Wagner to persuade the pope 
to rein in Romero, which the pope then tried to do. See Raymond Bonner, 
Weakness and Deceit (New York: Times Books, 1984), p. 176. The provincial 
of the Jesuit order in Central America, Father C6sar Jerez, was called to Rome 
shortly after to explain the Romero letter. Father Jerez, who had fled from 
Guatemala after the military had threatened his life, was very close to Arch¬ 
bishop Romero. Subsequently he was forced to flee El Salvador as well and 
is now a refugee in Nicaragua, where he is rector of the Universidad Cen- 


troamericana, unable to return to the two “fledgling democracies” except for 
brief (and dangerous) visits. 

17. Quoted in Bonner, Weakness and Deceit , p. 172. 

18. On September 27, 1981, Alan Riding wrote in the New York Times that 
“under the Carter administration, United States officials said security forces 
were responsible for 90 percent of the atrocities,” not “uncontrollable right- 
wing bands.” In short, not only was Bushnell lying, but the media knew it, and 
failed to use that information. Riding had an article on March 23,1980, entitled 
“El Salvador’s Junta Unable to Halt the Killing.” On media coverage of El 
Salvador during 1980, including gross falsification and cover-up of even con¬ 
gressional reports, see Noam Chomsky, Towards A New Cold War , pp. 35ff., 
reprinted in James Peck, ed., The Chomsky Reader (New York: Pantheon, 
1987). 

19. Church estimates were that the government was responsible for some nine 
hundred civilian deaths in the first three months of 1980, exceeding the total 
for all of 1979; a report of Amnesty International dated March 21, 1980, 
contains seven pages of incidents in which security forces, army units, or 
paramilitary groups under general military control or guidance killed unarmed 
civilians, usually peasants (quoted in Bonner, Weakness and Deceit , p. 172). 

20. This is a point that was conceded by Duarte himself, who admitted in an 
interview with Raymond Bonner that the army ruled El Salvador, but that he 
hoped to do so in the future (see New York Times , Mar. 1, 1982). 

21. Weakness and Deceit , p. 146. 

22. See chapter 3, pp. 101-102. 

23. One proof of the fact that the paramilitary forces kill under official protec¬ 
tion is that, year after year, paramilitary murders never resulted in arrests (see 
Herman, Real Terror Network, pp. 115-19). As for the regular forces, through 
1986, “there were no known instances of military officers or soldiers who were 
criminally punished for human rights abuses against Salvadoran civilians” 
{The Reagan Administration's Record on Human Rights in 1986 [New York: The 
Watch Committees and Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, February 
1987], p. 46).

tions of how the networks continued to label the junta “moderate” throughout 
1980, as atrocities mounted to what Archbishop Romero’s successor, Bishop 
Rivera y Damas, described in October 1980 as the armed forces’ “war of 
extermination and genocide against a defenseless civilian population” (Bonner, 
Weakness and Deceit, p. 207).
