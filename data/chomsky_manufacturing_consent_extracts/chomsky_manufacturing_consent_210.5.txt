were responsible for 90 percent of the atrocities,” not “uncontrollable right- 
wing bands.” In short, not only was Bushnell lying, but the media knew it, and 
failed to use that information. Riding had an article on March 23,1980, entitled 
“El Salvador’s Junta Unable to Halt the Killing.” On media coverage of El 
Salvador during 1980, including gross falsification and cover-up of even con¬ 
gressional reports, see Noam Chomsky, Towards A New Cold War , pp. 35ff., 
reprinted in James Peck, ed., The Chomsky Reader (New York: Pantheon, 
1987). 

19. Church estimates were that the government was responsible for some nine 
hundred civilian deaths in the first three months of 1980, exceeding the total 
for all of 1979; a report of Amnesty International dated March 21, 1980, 
contains seven pages of incidents in which security forces, army units, or 
paramilitary groups under general military control or guidance killed unarmed 
civilians, usually peasants (quoted in Bonner, Weakness and Deceit , p. 172). 

20. This is a point that was conceded by Duarte himself, who admitted in an 
interview with Raymond Bonner that the army ruled El Salvador, but that he 
hoped to do so in the future (see New York Times , Mar. 1, 1982).

23. One proof of the fact that the paramilitary forces kill under official protec¬ 
tion is that, year after year, paramilitary murders never resulted in arrests (see 
Herman, Real Terror Network, pp. 115-19). As for the regular forces, through 
1986, “there were no known instances of military officers or soldiers who were 
criminally punished for human rights abuses against Salvadoran civilians” 
{The Reagan Administration's Record on Human Rights in 1986 [New York: The 
Watch Committees and Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, February 
1987], p. 46).

tions of how the networks continued to label the junta “moderate” throughout 
1980, as atrocities mounted to what Archbishop Romero’s successor, Bishop 
Rivera y Damas, described in October 1980 as the armed forces’ “war of 
extermination and genocide against a defenseless civilian population” (Bonner, 
Weakness and Deceit, p. 207).
