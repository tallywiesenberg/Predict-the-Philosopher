30. From White’s cable to the State Department, quoted in Bonner, Weakness 
and Deceit, p. 184. 

31. This statement is quoted in Armstrong and Shenk, El Salvador, p. 152. 
Others present claim that troops were on the scene, contradicting Duarte, 
junta, and Treaster assertions to the contrary. Phillip Berryman, who was at

37. It is possible that this failure was based on an honest lack of knowledge 
of the event. Lack of knowledge, however, reflects in part a lack of concern, 
and a distorting perspective that removes certain questions from the focus of 
investigation. 

38. Actually, this may be true. The killer may have been a contra assassin hired 
by the Salvadoran security forces.
