and Deceit, p. 184. 

31. This statement is quoted in Armstrong and Shenk, El Salvador, p. 152. 
Others present claim that troops were on the scene, contradicting Duarte, 
junta, and Treaster assertions to the contrary. Phillip Berryman, who was at 
the funeral, told the authors that he saw quite clearly two truckloads of troops 
in the vicinity. Treaster is cagey, though—he speaks only of troops in the plaza, 
not near the plaza, or in the national palace and other buildings. 

32. The view expressed in Ambassador White’s cables was that the leftists 
acted to provoke a response by the security forces, a self-destructive tactic not 
supported by any evidence. 

33. Quoted in Brockman, The Word Remains, p. 212. 

34. See note 18. Time magazine did the same kind of misrepresenting as 
Treaster, but with a little more finesse: “From his pulpit, he regularly con¬ 
demned the tyranny and terrorism that have torn tiny, impoverished El Salva¬ 
dor apart and brought it to the verge of civil war” (Apr. 7, 1980).

bishop’s cautious remarks for an apologetic purpose, see Herman, Real Terror 
Network, pp. 178-79. 

37. It is possible that this failure was based on an honest lack of knowledge 
of the event. Lack of knowledge, however, reflects in part a lack of concern, 
and a distorting perspective that removes certain questions from the focus of 
investigation. 

38. Actually, this may be true. The killer may have been a contra assassin hired 
by the Salvadoran security forces.

CIA-organized murder of Patrice Lumumba, see Alleged Assassination Plots

44. Craig Pyes, “Dirty War in the Name of Freedom,” Albuquerque Journal, 
December 18, 1983. In November 1987, Duarte announced new (and rather 
flimsy) evidence implicating D’Aubuisson, but no one associated with the 
reigning security forces, in the assassination. The announcement was a trans¬ 
parent effort to maintain his image as a “moderate,” holding the middle ground 
between extremists of right and left. It was carefully timed to coincide with 
a daring visit to El Salvador by two actual “moderates,” FDR leaders Ruben 
Zamora and Guillermo Ungo, who have lived in exile under threat of assassi¬ 
nation in this terror state.

47. In an article of February 11, 1982, datelined San Salvador, the Mexican 
paper El Dxa quoted D’Aubuisson telling two European reporters, one a 
German, that “You Germans are very intelligent; you realized that the Jews 
were responsible for the spread of communism and you began to kill them.” 
While the U.S. press played up the fabricated claims of Sandinista anti- 
Semitism, this statement of approval of the Holocaust was not picked up by 
the elite media.
