44. Craig Pyes, “Dirty War in the Name of Freedom,” Albuquerque Journal, 
December 18, 1983. In November 1987, Duarte announced new (and rather 
flimsy) evidence implicating D’Aubuisson, but no one associated with the 
reigning security forces, in the assassination. The announcement was a trans¬ 
parent effort to maintain his image as a “moderate,” holding the middle ground 
between extremists of right and left. It was carefully timed to coincide with 
a daring visit to El Salvador by two actual “moderates,” FDR leaders Ruben 
Zamora and Guillermo Ungo, who have lived in exile under threat of assassi¬ 
nation in this terror state.

47. In an article of February 11, 1982, datelined San Salvador, the Mexican 
paper El Dxa quoted D’Aubuisson telling two European reporters, one a 
German, that “You Germans are very intelligent; you realized that the Jews 
were responsible for the spread of communism and you began to kill them.” 
While the U.S. press played up the fabricated claims of Sandinista anti- 
Semitism, this statement of approval of the Holocaust was not picked up by 
the elite media.
