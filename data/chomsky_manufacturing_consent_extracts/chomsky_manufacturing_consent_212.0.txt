52. Foreign Assistance Legislation for Fiscal Year 1982, part 1, Hearings before 
the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 97th Cong., 1st sess., March 1981, p. 
163. Letter from David E. Simcox, State Department, to William P. Ford, 
dated April 16,1981. At the time Haig made his statement, the evidence was 
quite clear that the women had been raped, and killed by close-range shots 
from behind. Haig himself never apologized for this insulting lie, nor did he 
suffer any serious attack for this in the mass media, with the honorable excep¬ 
tion of Anthony Lewis. This episode also appears to have had no noticeable 
effect on Haig’s reputation. 

53. “We ought to be a little more clear about this than we actually are [ric]. 
They were political activists on behalf of the Frente and somebody who is 
using violence to oppose the Frente killed these women” (interview in Tampa 
Tribune, Dec. 16,1980, quoted in Carrigan, Salvador Witness, p. 279.) Former 
ambassador Robert White pointed out that remarks like these by Kirkpatrick, 
in the context of El Salvador, were “an incitement to murder” (T. D. Allman, 
Unmanifest Destiny [New York: Doubleday, 1984], p. 17). 

Jean Donovan asked Ambassador Robert White, “What do you do when 
even to help the poor, to take care of the orphans, is considered an act of 
subversion by the government?” (quoted in Allman, p. 3). Helping orphans in 
the Salvadoran countryside was also regarded as an act of subversion by 
officials of the Reagan administration. 

54. The New York Times’s version, shown on table 2-2, gives a succinct and 
inaccurate version of the use of the underwear. 

55. “Statement by Revolutionary Governing Junta,” December 8, 1980. The 
statement also notes that “the Revolutionary Government repudiates and 
condemns violence and the irrational crimes it generates”! 

56. Juan de Onis, December 24. The question does not arise for the Times of 
why the security forces would want to conceal the bodies if they were unin¬ 
volved in the murders. 

57. We discussed this myth in “Archbishop Oscar Romero” (p. 48). 

58. Juan de Onis, “Rightist Terror Stirs Argentina,” New York Times, August 
29, 1976.

Deaths,” National Catholic Reporter , July 17, 1981. 

61. Stephen Kinzer, “Ex-Aide in Salvador Accuses Colleagues on Death 
Squads,” March 3,1984. Note the “soft” headline. An option forgone by the 
Times was a headline like: “Duarte and Defense Minister Casanova Accused 
of Cover-up of Murder of Four American Women.” Santivanez was paid 
$50,000 to give his evidence, a sum he requested on the ground of the risk he 
was taking and the probability that he would be income-short in the future as 
a result of his confession. This payment was given unusual publicity as sug¬ 
gesting a compromising quality to his testimony, and the New York Times 
squelched a second installment of his evidence on this principled ground— 
which they never apply to Soviet defectors, who are less in need of protection. 
The revelation that the “leading democrats” who were formed into a civilian 
front for the contras by the CIA have been receiving over $80,000, tax-free, 
annually from the CIA for years has never compromised their integrity as 
media sources. Nicaraguan defector Miranda got $800,000 for his services 
without being discredited. 

62. Excellent accounts were produced by Michael Posner and the Lawyers’ 
Committee for International Human Rights in a series of investigatory reports, 
dated September 1981, July 20, 1982, and February 1, 1983, which contain 
detailed and crushing evidence of a completely broken-down judicial process 
and an official cover-up. Once again, as with the Dinges report, these docu¬ 
ments were essentially ignored in the U.S. mass media and their facts and leads 
suppressed. News coverage of the lawyers’ committee documents was negligi¬ 
ble. Michael Posner and Scott Greathead did succeed in placing an Op-Ed 
article in the Times on December 6,1983, entitled “3 Years after Killings, No 
Justice in Salvador.” 

63. Both Time and Newsweek had articles featuring stonewalling in February 
1981— Time 's article was entitled “Stonewalling” (Feb. 23)—but although the 
stonewalling continued for years, this was the end of the news magazines’ 
interest in the matter.

67. In the same month that Hinton was asserting with assurance that the 
low-level guardsmen were acting on their own, internal State Department 
memos were stating that “Reading the documents provoked several questions 
which we think should have occurred to an investigator whose real aim was 
to determine who committed the crime” (quoted in Update, p. 31).
