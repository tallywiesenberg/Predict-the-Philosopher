52. Foreign Assistance Legislation for Fiscal Year 1982, part 1, Hearings before 
the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 97th Cong., 1st sess., March 1981, p. 
163. Letter from David E. Simcox, State Department, to William P. Ford, 
dated April 16,1981. At the time Haig made his statement, the evidence was 
quite clear that the women had been raped, and killed by close-range shots 
from behind. Haig himself never apologized for this insulting lie, nor did he 
suffer any serious attack for this in the mass media, with the honorable excep¬ 
tion of Anthony Lewis. This episode also appears to have had no noticeable 
effect on Haig’s reputation. 

53. “We ought to be a little more clear about this than we actually are [ric]. 
They were political activists on behalf of the Frente and somebody who is 
using violence to oppose the Frente killed these women” (interview in Tampa 
Tribune, Dec. 16,1980, quoted in Carrigan, Salvador Witness, p. 279.) Former 
ambassador Robert White pointed out that remarks like these by Kirkpatrick, 
in the context of El Salvador, were “an incitement to murder” (T. D. Allman, 
Unmanifest Destiny [New York: Doubleday, 1984], p. 17). 

Jean Donovan asked Ambassador Robert White, “What do you do when 
even to help the poor, to take care of the orphans, is considered an act of 
subversion by the government?” (quoted in Allman, p. 3). Helping orphans in 
the Salvadoran countryside was also regarded as an act of subversion by 
officials of the Reagan administration. 

54. The New York Times’s version, shown on table 2-2, gives a succinct and 
inaccurate version of the use of the underwear. 

55. “Statement by Revolutionary Governing Junta,” December 8, 1980. The 
statement also notes that “the Revolutionary Government repudiates and 
condemns violence and the irrational crimes it generates”! 

56. Juan de Onis, December 24. The question does not arise for the Times of 
why the security forces would want to conceal the bodies if they were unin¬ 
volved in the murders. 

57. We discussed this myth in “Archbishop Oscar Romero” (p. 48). 

58. Juan de Onis, “Rightist Terror Stirs Argentina,” New York Times, August 
29, 1976.
