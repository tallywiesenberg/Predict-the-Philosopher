also highly desirable for both equity and efficiency. See, especially, Jose M.

reductions in rates of murder, but they have consistently supported and helped 
organize the framework that eroded the democratic reforms and increased rates 
of murder. In Guatemala (and elsewhere), the reasons for the regular backing 
of antidemocratic institutions have been the fear of the left and the chronic 
hostility of U.S. officials and businessmen to popular organizations (unions, 
peasant organizations, mass political parties), for both economic and political 
reasons. Thus the periodic support for liberal forms has been rendered nuga¬ 
tory by the systematic bolstering up of institutions that regularly undermine 
the substance of liberalism. As Lars Schoultz points out, the function of “mili¬ 
tary authoritarianism,” beginning with the U.S.-backed Brazilian coup of 1964 
and widely prevalent in Latin America and elsewhere within the U.S. sphere 
of influence, has been “to destroy permanently a perceived threat to the 
existing structure of socioeconomic privilege by eliminating the participation 
of the numerical majority,...” {Human Rights and United States Policy toward 
Latin America [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981], p. 7). We may let 
them “participate,” however, with elections held after extended periods of 
military pacification and the dismantling of popular organizations. See chap¬
