91. While this is true almost without exception for news articles, there were 
perhaps a dozen Op-Ed columns in the New York Times and the Washington 
Post, and some letters, in the period 1980-86, that criticized Guatemalan state 
terrorism; some of these were harshly critical of U.S. policy. 

92. A few of the opinion pieces cited in the previous note did discuss the U.S. 
role. 

93. “Requiem for a Missionary,” August 10, 1981. 

94. The documents include the following four put out by Amnesty Interna¬

106. Ibid., p. 36. This was, of course, a complete fabrication. What Mejia 
Victores is referring to is an investigative body that he established, manned

and that, predictably, gave the government a clean bill of health.

109. Two very terse exceptions should be noted: On April 13, an article on the 
case mentions that Gomez was tortured; and one on April 19 notes that his 
tongue was cut out. No details whatsoever were provided about the murders 
of Godoy de Cuevas and her brother and son. 

no. As we will see in the next chapter, the new civilian government did nothing 
to stem the army assault on the civilian population; but as we might also 
expect, the optimism of the press on the promise of the new civilian adminis¬ 
tration was not followed up with reports on what actually happened. 
hi. As we pointed out earlier, the U.S. press entirely ignored the administra¬ 
tion’s refusal to allow one of the El Salvador “Mothers of the Disappeared” 
to come to speak in the United States. See note 10, above.

Guatemala Human Rights Commission/USA, dated October 3, 1986.
