37. It has often been observed by serious students of American democracy that 
the relative weakness of intermediate organizations (unions, political clubs, 
media not under corporate control, etc.) is a severe impediment to meaningful 
political democracy in the United States—one reason, no doubt, why voter 
participation is so low and cynicism about its significance so high.

40. Enrique A. Baloyra, who argues that there was a real choice, says that 
people voted “primarily because they wanted to make use of this massive 
action to urge an end to violence and civil war.” But Baloyra nowhere discusses 
Duarte's and D’Aubuisson’s views on a negotiated settlement of the war, which 
allows him to convey the erroneous impression that one of them supported a 
nonmilitary route to ending the violence and civil war (El Salvador in Transi¬ 
tion [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982], p. 175).

leadership returned for the 1985 election.
