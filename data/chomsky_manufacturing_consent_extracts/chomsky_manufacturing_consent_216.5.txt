37. It has often been observed by serious students of American democracy that 
the relative weakness of intermediate organizations (unions, political clubs,

allows him to convey the erroneous impression that one of them supported a 
nonmilitary route to ending the violence and civil war (El Salvador in Transi¬ 
tion [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982], p. 175).
