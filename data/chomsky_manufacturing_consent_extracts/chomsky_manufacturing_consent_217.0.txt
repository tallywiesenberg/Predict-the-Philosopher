44. The guerrilla position was that with the army having set up a national 
control system, military domination had been institutionalized and elections 
would have no meaning. See “Guerrillas’ View of Elections: Army Will Hold 
Power Despite Polls,” Latin America Weekly Report, October 25, 1985, p. n.

Amigos del Pais, which allegedly has strong death squad connections, PDCG 
deputies to the Constituent Assembly pledged that if the party came to power, 
they would refrain from agrarian and banking reforms, investigation into 
human rights abuses by the armed forces, and any interference in the coun¬ 
terinsurgency program” (“Guatemala Votes,” Washington Report on the Hemi¬ 
sphere, Nov. 27, 1985). Stephen Kinzer also reports on a private meeting 
between Cerezo and right-wing landowners, in which “he said we all needed 
each other at this moment...” (“When a Landslide Is Not a Mandate,” New 
York Times, Dec. 15, 1985). 

49. Allen Nairn and Jean-Marie Simon, in their “The Bureaucracy of Death,” 
New Republic, (June 30,1986), describe the “tactical alliance” between Cerezo 
and the army, which protected them against any accountability for past ac¬ 
tions, in exchange for which the army would allow Cerezo to occupy office.

and Information Bureau (May-June 1986). 

51. American Watch, Human Rights in Guatemala during President Cerezo’s 
First Year, February 1987. Cerezo argued for not prosecuting the military for 
old crimes on the ground that everyone wanted to start afresh. But Americas 
Watch points out that if terrible crimes of the past are exempt from the rule 
of law, it suggests that Cerezo doesn’t have the power to stop further military 
crimes. “It is a sign that the rule of law has not been established in Guatemala, 
and that it cannot be established” (p. 4). This point is supported by Cerezo’s 
inaction in the face of a hundred violent deaths a month—many of them 
political murders by the army—after he assumed office.

his failure to participate in the 1984 elections was one of his major political 
mistakes.” 

54. See LASA, Report, pp. 24-25, 29-31. We discuss this point, and the likeli¬ 
hood that Cruz’s withdrawal was part of a public-relations strategy, in our 
treatment below of the media’s handling of the Nicaraguan election.

61. Based on conversations with voters, the Long group states that “most 
people waited these long hours because of their desire to have their cedula 
stamped and their finger inked to avoid fines for not voting and/or possible 
reprisals from the government and military....” They note that at many places 
voting officials stamped the cedulas of those unable to vote because of crowding 
just so they could leave (ibid., p. 6). 

62. In the July 1,1984, election for a constituent assembly, null and blank votes 
exceeded those of any party and were a staggering 26 percent of the total.

was sharply restricted in 1982, allegedly for security reasons but making for 
longer lines.
