“Without any lies, you can see here what it is that the people want . . .” 
(“Salvadorans Jam Polling Stations,” New York Times, Mar. 29, 1982). 

70. Eleven days before the 1982 election, four Dutch journalists were mur¬ 
dered by the Salvadoran security forces. The foreign press corps was trooped 
into the morgue to see the bodies, whose ripped genitals were exposed to media

promises that “his troops would provide adequate security for the election of 
March 25” (1984); Blandon is quoted as saying “Pm giving you the assurance

often described as the godfather of the death squads in Central America, was 
present at Reagan’s first inauguration, met with his defense and foreign-policy 
advisers, and claimed that “verbal agreements” were entered into at that time 
to cut back on criticism of Guatemalan human-rights abuses and to renew 
military aid. See Marlise Simons, “Guatemala: The Coming Danger,” Foreign 
Policy (Summer 1981), p. 101; Scott Anderson and John Lee Anderson, Inside
