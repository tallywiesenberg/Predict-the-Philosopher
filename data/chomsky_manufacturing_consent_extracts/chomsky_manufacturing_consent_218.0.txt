69. Warren Hoge did quote Garcia, but only to suggest an open election: 
“Without any lies, you can see here what it is that the people want . . .” 
(“Salvadorans Jam Polling Stations,” New York Times, Mar. 29, 1982). 

70. Eleven days before the 1982 election, four Dutch journalists were mur¬ 
dered by the Salvadoran security forces. The foreign press corps was trooped 
into the morgue to see the bodies, whose ripped genitals were exposed to media 
view. This episode—described in the 1984 documentary film In the Name of 
Democracy —was suppressed in the U.S. mass media, led to no large outcries 
and generalizations about the qualities of the Salvadoran government, and may 
have contributed to the remarkable silence of journalists in El Salvador on the

unfavorable media (as well as other) conditions in the incipient democracy. 

71. “Salvador Vote: Uncertainty Remains,” April 3, 1982. 

72. The Times devoted an entire article to the Salvadoran chief of staffs 
promises that “his troops would provide adequate security for the election of 
March 25” (1984); Blandon is quoted as saying “Pm giving you the assurance 
that there will be secure elections for all of the country” (Lydia Chavez, 
“Salvadoran Promises Safe Election,” New York Times , Mar. 14, 1984). 

73. Time , July 16,1984. “Moderation” is a favorite media word in descriptions 
of demonstration elections. Newsweek ’s article of May 7,1984, on Duarte and 
the Salvadoran election of May 1984 is entitled “El Salvador: A Miracle of 
Moderation.” For a discussion of some of the ways in which the media use the 
word “moderate,” see Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Terrorism , (Boston: 
South End Press, 1988), chapter 2.8. 

74. The Guatemalan extreme right-wing leader, Mario Sandoval Alarcon, 
often described as the godfather of the death squads in Central America, was 
present at Reagan’s first inauguration, met with his defense and foreign-policy 
advisers, and claimed that “verbal agreements” were entered into at that time 
to cut back on criticism of Guatemalan human-rights abuses and to renew 
military aid. See Marlise Simons, “Guatemala: The Coming Danger,” Foreign 
Policy (Summer 1981), p. 101; Scott Anderson and John Lee Anderson, Inside 
the League: The Shocking Expose of How Terrorists , Nazis , and Latin American 
Death Squads Have Infiltrated the Anti-Communist League (New York: Dodd, 
Mead, 1986), p. 175; and Alan Nairn, “Controversial Reagan Campaign Links 
with Guatemalan Government and Private Sector Leaders,” Research Memo 
for Council on Hemispheric Affairs, October 30, 1980, p. 11. 

75. The Polish election of January 1947 was so designated by the U.S. mass 
media, although Polish state terrorism was much less severe than that of 
Guatemala in 1984-85. See Herman and Brodhead, Demonstration Elections, 
pp. 173-80. 

76. Council on Hemispheric Affairs, News and Analysis , February 6, 1987. 

77. We may be quite certain that Time will not assert that “Much of the killing 
in Afghanistan is linked to General Zakov’s success against the insurgents.” 

78. For evidence of the complete servility and dishonesty of Time in its cover¬ 
age of the elections in the Dominican Republic and Vietnam in the 1960s, see 
Herman and Brodhead, Demonstration Elections , pp. 45, 46, 51-52, 83-86. 

79. A summary of this document was given in Enfoprensa News Agency, 
“Information on Guatemala,” June 22,1984. This excellent weekly bulletin of 
news on Guatemala reports a continuing flow of seemingly newsworthy 
items—regrettably, however, on unworthy victims, and therefore not of inter¬ 
est to the mass media. 

80. This statement, dated October 1985, is reproduced in IHRLG, Report. 

81. The two stories that follow were discussed in Enfoprensa, “Information on 
Guatemala.” 

82. “A New Chance in Guatemala,” December 12, 1985. The Times never 
found that the Sandinistas had “honored” a promise in 1984, but then neither 
did the Reagan administration. Nor did the editorial consider the meaning of 
the fact that the ruling generals had declared an amnesty—for themselves— 
before allowing the electoral “project” to proceed. 

83. The Times' s editorial of December 12, 1985, congratulates Cerezo for 




NOTES TO PAGES II5-II8 361 


pledging to “take charge without vengeance against the military for its murder¬ 
ous rule.” Translated from the propaganda format, this means Cerezo is too 
weak to promise minimal justice for terrible crimes, which raises serious doubts 
about whether he has any real power. The newspaper of record makes this 
exoneration of mass murderers a virtue, and pretends that it is just an act of 
mercy on Cerezo’s part! The Times also does not speculate on what would 
happen to President Cerezo if he chose to wreak “vengeance against the 
military,” or how exactly he might proceed with this mission under conditions 
of effective military rule.
