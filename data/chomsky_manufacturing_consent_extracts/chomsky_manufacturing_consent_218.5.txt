77. We may be quite certain that Time will not assert that “Much of the killing 
in Afghanistan is linked to General Zakov’s success against the insurgents.” 

78. For evidence of the complete servility and dishonesty of Time in its cover¬ 
age of the elections in the Dominican Republic and Vietnam in the 1960s, see 
Herman and Brodhead, Demonstration Elections , pp. 45, 46, 51-52, 83-86. 

79. A summary of this document was given in Enfoprensa News Agency, 
“Information on Guatemala,” June 22,1984. This excellent weekly bulletin of 
news on Guatemala reports a continuing flow of seemingly newsworthy 
items—regrettably, however, on unworthy victims, and therefore not of inter¬ 
est to the mass media. 

80. This statement, dated October 1985, is reproduced in IHRLG, Report. 

81. The two stories that follow were discussed in Enfoprensa, “Information on 
Guatemala.” 

82. “A New Chance in Guatemala,” December 12, 1985. The Times never 
found that the Sandinistas had “honored” a promise in 1984, but then neither 
did the Reagan administration. Nor did the editorial consider the meaning of 
the fact that the ruling generals had declared an amnesty—for themselves— 
before allowing the electoral “project” to proceed. 

83. The Times' s editorial of December 12, 1985, congratulates Cerezo for

pledging to “take charge without vengeance against the military for its murder¬ 
ous rule.” Translated from the propaganda format, this means Cerezo is too 
weak to promise minimal justice for terrible crimes, which raises serious doubts 
about whether he has any real power. The newspaper of record makes this 
exoneration of mass murderers a virtue, and pretends that it is just an act of 
mercy on Cerezo’s part! The Times also does not speculate on what would 
happen to President Cerezo if he chose to wreak “vengeance against the 
military,” or how exactly he might proceed with this mission under conditions 
of effective military rule.
