85. Of course, there was an even deeper hypocrisy in failing to call attention 
to the administration’s devotion to a free election in Nicaragua but not in 
Chile, Indonesia, Namibia, or South Korea, among many others, and its pre¬ 
tense that the elections in the terror states of El Salvador and Guatemala are 
free and have anything to do with democracy. 

86. The New York Times had an article on the numerous observers in Nicara¬ 
gua, but before the election (“Election Draws Many U.S. Observers,” Nov. 4, 
1984). The thrust of the article was to suggest observer bias favorable to the 
Sandinistas, a subject the Times never addresses in regard to official observers. 
In later discussion of the elections, the 450 observers, including even the 
professional society of Latin American scholars, were entirely ignored by the 
Times. An excellent study by Lucinda Broadbent, “Nicaragua’s Elections: A 
Cruz Around the Issues; Comparative Analysis of Media Coverage of the 1984 
Elections,” as yet unpublished, parallels our findings in detail, based on an 
analysis of a wide sample, including U.S. network TV and the British as well 
as U.S. press. Broadbent points out that in her sample, the opposition to the 
Nicaraguan government is given more than twice the space accorded the 
government, “an unusual priority for media usually so wedded to ‘official 
sources’ in whichever country they find themselves” (p. 77). Broadbent 
stresses, as we do, the domination of the Reaganite frame, even in Britain and 
in the liberal press, and the massive distortion of reality that resulted from this 
biased framing. She notes also that the media never addressed the programs 
of the contesting parties in Nicaragua, which allowed Reaganite cliches about 
Sandinista intentions and policies to prevail. The media portrayals were 
“roughly the opposite of what was witnessed by international observers of the 
election” (p. 99), which is why, in our view, these observers had to be ignored.

and James Petras, The Reagan Administration and Nicaragua , Institute for 
Media Analysis, Monograph 1 (New York: 1987), note 32, which also discusses 
the distortion of the Dutch observers’ report by Robert Leiken in the New York 
Review of Books, December 5,1985. Leiken dismisses the LASA report without 
comment as pro-Sandinista, i.e., as coming to the wrong conclusions.

89. This was partially true, as the Sandinistas were trying to alter their image. 
But the same was true in El Salvador, with the added problem that the election 
was held in an environment of ongoing state terror. Time never used the word 
“theatre” to describe either of the two Salvadoran elections.
