then would we react, what are our policy options, etc.The truth of the 
claim and the likelihood that this is a manipulative ploy to help remove 
the unwanted elections from attention are not discussed; and, naturally, 
the fact that this is part of a policy of aggression against a tiny victim 
is never raised.The only credits in the media coverage of the MIG crisis go to CBS 
News, On November 6, Dan Rather gave the straight administration 
“news” that MIGs might be on their way and that a strategic option 
to destroy them was under consideration.On November 7 and 8, how¬ 
ever, perhaps out of a recognition that it had once again been “used,” 
CBS gave substantial coverage to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel 
D’Escoto’s rebuttal, which allowed him to point out the absurdity of 
the Nicaraguan “threat,” the tie-in of the MIG claims to the Nicarag¬ 
uan election, and the U.S. refusal to go along with the Contadora peace 
proposals.The MIG ploy was, nevertheless, entirely successful.
