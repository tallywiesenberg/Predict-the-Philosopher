The Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections 
successfully legitimized the U.S.-backed regimes* at least for American 
elite opinion.The far more honest Nicaraguan election failed to accom¬ 
plish this, thanks to the loyal service of the media.3.9* THE ROLE OF OFFICIAL 
‘‘OBSERVERS*’ IN 
REINFORCING A 
PROPAGANDA LINE 

Official observers provide a perfect example of the use of government- 
controlled “experts'* and “pseudo-events 5 * to attract media attention 
and channel it in the direction of the propaganda line.And they regu¬ 
larly succeed in doing this in demonstration elections, no matter how 
brief their stay and foolish their comments (see appendix 1).The media 
take it for granted that official observers are newsworthy: they are 
notables, their selection by the government from “reputable” institu¬ 
tions adds to their credibility, and their observations will have effects 
on opinion and policy.
