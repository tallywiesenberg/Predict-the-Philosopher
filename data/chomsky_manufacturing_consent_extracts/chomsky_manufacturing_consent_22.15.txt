This rationale is in the nature of a self-fulfilling 
prophecy; they have effects only because the media accord them atten¬ 
tion.As the official observers reliably commend the elections as fair 
without the slightest attention to basic conditions, the media's regular 
use of these observers for comments on election quality violates norms 
of substantive objectivity in the same manner as the use of any straight 
government handout by the Times or Pravda .110 

The Nicaraguan election was remarkable for the number of foreign 
observers and observer teams.We pointed out earlier that Time men¬ 
tioned 450 foreign observers, but the magazine failed to cite any one 
of them (relying instead, and characteristically, on State Department 
handouts).As we saw, the State Department was able to get the media 
to follow its agenda, even though this involved them in a blatant rever¬ 
sal of the criteria they had employed the same year in El Salvador and 
Guatemala.
