The authors represent a variety of opinÂ¬ 
ions, on balance liberal but revealing a strong critical capability (and 
in no sense biased, as are the official observer teams to whom the media 
accord much attention).Their report covers every issue of importance 
and openly confronts and weighs evidence.If one reads the LASA 
report, and then the accounts of the Nicaraguan election in Time, 
Newsweek, and the New York Times, it is not so much the difference in 
conclusions that is striking but the difference in depth, balance, and 
objectivity.LASA offers serious history and context, a full account of 
the organization of the election, and a full discussion of each relevant 
issue with comparisons to other elections.We believe that an important 
reason the mass media failed to use LASA as a source of information 
was that its report contradicts in every way the propaganda claims 
which the media were disseminating daily and uncritically.
