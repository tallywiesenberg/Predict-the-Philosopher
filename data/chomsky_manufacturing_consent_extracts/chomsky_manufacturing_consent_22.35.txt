Just as the government of Guatemala could 
kill scores of thousands without major repercussion because the media 
recognized that these were “unworthy” victims, so today aid to state 
terrorists in HI Salvador and Guatemala, and the funding of contra 
attacks on “soft targets” in Nicaragua, depend heavily on continued 
media recognition of “worth” and an appropriate legitimization and 
delegitimization.As their government sponsors terror in all three states 
(as well as in Honduras), we may fairly say that the U.S. mass media, 
despite their righteous self-image as opponents of something called 
terrorism, serve in fact as loyal agents of terrorism.£ 



The KGB-Bulgarian 
Plot to Kill 
the Pope: 

Free-Market Disinformation 
as “News” 


In the case of the Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and nicarag- 
uan elections* the government was the moving force in providing the 
suitable frames of analysis and relevant facts* with the mass media’s role 
mainly that of channeling information and assuring that the govern¬ 
ment’s agenda was not seriously challenged.With the shooting of the 
pope* in May 1981, and the eventual charges of a KGB-Bulgarian plot* 
the mass media played a much larger role in originating the claims and 
in keeping the pot boiling from inception to conclusion of the case.1 

In many ways* however* the process was similar.
