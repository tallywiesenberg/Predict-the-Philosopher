When the 
legal proceeding brought against the Bulgarians in Italy was lost after 
a lengthy trial, this was rationalized by the media as far as could be 
done.No serious retrospectives were entertained, and, without resolv¬ 
ing the contradictions, the story was then dropped.What makes the Bulgarian Connection so apt an illustration of the 
value of a propaganda model is that there was no credible case for a 
Bulgarian Connection from the very beginning, and long before the 
Rome trial it had taken on a truly comic aspect.But the mass media 
played it straight to the bitter end- An analogous sequence carried out 
in Moscow, with the West as the target—with a half-crazed criminal, 
after seventeen months in a Soviet prison and some friendly sessions 
with the KGB and a prosecutor, implicating employees of the American 
embassy in a conspiracy to murder, and subsequently changing his 
testimony on a daily basis—would have been hooted off the stage in the 
West without anyone even bothering to look at alleged evidence.The 
Bulgarian Connection, however, although no less absurd, met the crite¬ 
rion of utility.
