The case began when Mehmet Ali Agca shot and seriously injured 
Pope John Paul II in St. Peteris Square on May 13, 1981.Agca was a 
Turkish rightist and assassin long associated with the Gray Wolves, an 
affiliate of the extreme right-wing Nationalist Action party.Initial 
Western news reports pointed out that Agca was a wanted criminal who 
had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979, and that his durable politiÂ¬ 
cal affiliations had been with the Fascist right.His motives in shooting 
the pope were unclear, Agca J s friends were violently anti-Communist, 
so that, at first, pinning the crime on the East seemed unpromising.Two factors allowed a KGB-Bulgarian plot to be developed.
