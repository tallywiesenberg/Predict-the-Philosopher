U,$. aid, his use of chemical weapons against the Kurds in Iraq , which killed 
thousands in 1988, did not interfere with support by the Bush administration, 
which continued up to the moment of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on August

30. The CIA itself designated the 1965-66 slaughters in Indonesia as “one of 
the worst mass murders of the 20th century” (quoted in Robert Cribb, ed 0 
The Indonesian Killings of 7965-/966 [Monash Papers on Southeast Asia, no. 
21,1991]). The figure of 500,000 victims in this slaughter, given by the head 
of Indonesian state security, must be taken as an absolute minima] figure. For 
other estimates that run up to 2 million, see Noam Chomsky and Edward 
Herman, The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism (Boston: South 
End Press, 1979), pp. 208-9; Benedict Anderson, “Petrus Dadi Ratu ” Ne&t

31. Former US. Ambassador to the United Nations Patrick Moynihan brags 
in his autobiography of how back in 1975 he protected Indonesia from any 
effective international action that might have interfered writh its aggression: 
“The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly inef¬ 
fective in whatever measures it took [regarding the Indonesian invasion of 
East Timor]. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no in¬ 
considerable success.” He added, without the slightest expression of regret, 
that within a few weeks 60,000 people had been killed in this aggression that 
he was protecting. A Dangerous Place (New York: Little, Brown, 1978), p. 19.
