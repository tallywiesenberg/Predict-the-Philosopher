The 
first was that in his travels through Europe in the Gray Wolves under¬ 
ground, which carried him through twelve different countries, Agca had 
stayed for a period in Bulgaria.Turkish drug dealers, who had connec¬ 
tions with the Gray Wolves, also participated in the drug trade in 
Bulgaria, There were, therefore, some “links” between Agca and Bul¬ 
garians, minimal facts that would eventually be put to good use.The second factor was Western elite needs and the closely associated 
flare-up of a carefully stoked anti-Communist fervor in the West.At 
the first meeting of the Jonathan Institute, in Jerusalem, in July 1979, 
at which a large Western political and media contingent were present

tion's propaganda campaign that began in 1981, designed to support its 
planned arms increase, placement of new missiles in Europe, and inter¬ 
ventionist policies in the Third World.
