Thus the shooting of the pope 
by Agca in May 1981 occurred at a time when important Western 
interests were looking for ways to tie the Soviet Union to “international 
terrorism.” 5

KALB MODEL 

Although the initial media reaction to the shooting was that the roots 
of the act would seem to lie in Turkish right-wing ideology and politics, 
some rightists immediately seized the opportunity to locate the origins 
of the plot in the Soviet bloc.Only six days after the assassination 
attempt, the Italian secret-service organization SISMI issued a docu¬ 
ment which claimed that the attack had been announced by a Soviet 
official at a meeting of the Warsaw Pact powers in Bucharest, Romania, 
and that Agca had been trained in the Soviet Union.Subsequently, this 
“information” was shown to have been fabricated by SISMI or one of 
its intelligence sources, but it entered the stream of allegations about 
the plot in a book published in West Germany and via further citations 
and leaks.6 

The Reader's Digest saw the propaganda opportunity presented by 
the assassination attempt quite early, and hired both Paul Henze, a 
longtime CIA officer and propaganda specialist, and Claire Sterling to 
investigate the topic.
