the dominant frame of the mass media, through the great outreach of 
the Reader's Digest and the NBC-TV program (which was repeated in 
revised form in January 1983), and the ready* even eager, acceptance of 
this view by the other mainstream media.7 The mass media in our 
sample— Newsweek, Time, the New York Times, and CBS News—all 
accepted and used the SHK model from the beginning, and retained 
that loyalty to the end of the Rome trial in March 1986.In the process 
they excluded alternative views and a great deal of inconvenient fact.With the Readers Digest, the Wall Street Journal, the Christian Science 
Monitor, and NBC-TV also firmly adhering to the SHK line* it quickly 
established a dominant position throughout the mainstream media.
