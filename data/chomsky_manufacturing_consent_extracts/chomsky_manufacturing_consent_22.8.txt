Before Agca’s 
confession and his identification of Bulgarians in November 1982* the 
evidence on which SHK relied was confined to the fact that Agca had 
stayed in Bulgaria in the summer of 1980, and that Turkish drug traders 
with links to the Gray Wolves did business in Bulgaria.In November 
1982, Agca named three Bulgarians as his alleged accomplices and 
claimed to have been hired by the Bulgarians to do the job.He offered 
no credible evidence and named no witnesses to any dealings with 
Bulgarians, so that the new “evidence" was simply Agca's assertions, 
after seventeen months in an Italian prison.THE KGB -BULGARIAN PLOT TO KILL THE POPE I47 


3 , The ideological assumptions* As the case looked extremely thin* 
especially before Agca’s new confession of November 1982, the gaps 
were filled by ideological assumptions: This is the kind of thing the 
Soviets do.The Soviet Union and Bulgaria have been actively striving 
to “destabilize” Turkey* 8 If there is no hard evidence it is because the 
Soviets are consummate professionals who cover their tracks and main¬ 
tain “plausible deniability.” The KGB hired Agca in Turkey and caused 
him to use a rightist cover to obscure the fact that he was a KGB agent.
