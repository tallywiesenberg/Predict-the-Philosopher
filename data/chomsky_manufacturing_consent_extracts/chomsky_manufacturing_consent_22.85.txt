Although Agca traveled through eleven other countries* his stay in 
Bulgaria was crucial because Bulgaria is a totalitarian state and the 
police know everything; therefore they knew who Agca was, and they 
must have been using him for their own purposes.9 


4.2* PROBLEMS WITH THE 
STERLING-HENZE-KALB 
MODEL 

The basic Sterling-Henze-Kalb model suffered from a complete ab¬ 
sence of credible evidence* a reliance on ideological premises* and 
internal inconsistencies* As problems arose* the grounds were shifted* 
sometimes with a complete reversal of argument* 10 

An initial problem for the model was the Bulgarian-Soviet motive.In this connection* we should note the extreme foolishness of Sterling’s 
original suggestion that the Eastern bloc went to the trouble of locating 
a Turkish Fascist to shoot the pope in order to make Turkey look bad* 
and thereby to loosen its ties to NATO.That such a loosened tie would 
follow from a Turkish Fascist shooting the pope is not sensible* nor is 
it likely that the conservative Soviet leadership would indulge in such 
a fanciful plan even if it had a greater probability of “success.” 11 This 
theory assumed thar Agca would be caught and identified as a Turk, 
but that he wouldn’t reveal that he had been hired by the Bulgarians 
and the Soviets.Subsequently* Sterling suggested that Agca was sup¬ 
posed to have been shot in the square to assure his silence.
