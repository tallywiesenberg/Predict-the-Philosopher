Agca was allegedly recruited in Tur¬ 
key long before Solidarity existed.In a variant Sterling version of the 
timing of his recruitment, Agca was hired by the Bulgarians in July 1980, 
which was still prior to the Gdansk shipyard strike, and thus before 
Solidarity appeared a credible threat to Soviet control.The risks and 
costs of an assassination attempt would seem heavy—and, in fact, the 
costs to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria were severe based merely on the 
widespread belief in their involvement, even in the absence of credible 
evidence.The supposed benefits from the act are also not plausible.The assassination of the pope, especially if blamed on the Soviet Union, 
would infuriate and unify the Poles and strengthen their opposition to 
a Soviet-dominated regime.
