5. Tying the assassination attempt to the Soviet Union and KGB was espe¬ 
cially helpful in discrediting the Soviet leadership in 1982 and early 1983, as 
Yuri Andropov, who had just succeeded Brezhnev as head of state, was at one 
time head of the KGB. The Bulgarian, Sergei Antonov, was arrested in Italy 
within three weeks of Andropov’s assuming power.

8. Both Sterling and Henze asserted this many times, without providing any 
evidence and without attempting to explain how destabilization would serve 
Soviet interests, given the likelihood—eventually realized, in fact—that insta¬ 
bility and internal disorder in Turkey would bring into power a military regime 
even more closely aligned with the United States. Sterling and Henze were 
fortunate that they were never called upon to explain these things to Western 
audiences. 

9. Marvin Kalb expounded this precise sequence, without the benefit of a 
single piece of evidence beyond the fact that Agca had had a brief stay in 
Bulgaria—among twelve countries—asserting that “it seems safe to conclude 
that he had been drawn into the clandestine network of the Bulgarian secret 
police and, by extension, the KGB—perhaps without his even being aware of 
their possible plans for him” (transcript of the Sept. 21,1982, show, pp. 44-45).

11. SHK regularly assume that the Soviet leadership is wild, and regularly 
engages in “Dr. No”-type plots, and the mass media do not challenge this 
image. On the conservative reality, see George Kennan, The Nuclear Delusion: 
Soviet-American Relations in the Nuclear Age (New York: Pantheon, 1982); 
John Lowenhardt, Decision-Making in Soviet Politics (New York: St. Martin’s, 
1981); and Jerry Hough and Merle Fainsod, How the Soviet Union Is Governed 
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1979). 

12. NBC-TV stressed an alleged note sent by the pope to Brezhnev threatening 
that in case of a Soviet invasion, the pope would give up his papal crown and 
return to Poland to lead the Polish resistance. Thus the assassination attempt 
was to get the pope out of the way to clear the ground for a prospective 
invasion. This note has never been produced, and the Vatican has denied its 
authenticity. See page 162. For a further discussion of these issues, see Herman 
and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection , pp. 14-15, 200.
