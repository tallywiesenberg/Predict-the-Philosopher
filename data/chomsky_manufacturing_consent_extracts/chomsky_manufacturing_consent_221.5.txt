also wrote a substantial volume on Agca and his record, Agca Dosyasi (Ankara: 
Tekin Yayinevi, 1984). 

14. After Agca decided to “confess,” he explained to the Italian magistrates 
that he was a killer for hire by anyone who wanted a reliable “international 
terrorist.” He sounded just as Claire Sterling said he ought to sound. This was 
taken quite seriously by the Italian judiciary and Western press. See Herman 
and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection , pp. 113-14. 

15. For a full analysis of this theory, see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian 
Connection , pp. 138-40. 

16. Michael Dobbs, “Child of Turkish Slums ...,” Washington Post y October 
14,1984. Agca’s shooting of the pope may have been motivated in part by his 
quest for notoriety.

paragraph, see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection pp. 71-98.

21. “Behind the Scenes of the ‘Agca Investigation,’ ” Milliye^ November 1984. 
This excellent two-part series by Milliyet' s correspondent in West Germany 
describes the Italian investigation then in process as an extremely biased and 
incompetently managed exercise. Its many inconvenient but highly relevant 
facts may also have contributed to it being entirely ignored in the Western 
press.

tion, see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection , pp. 110-11. 

23. De Zulueta and Godwin, “Face to Face with the Colonel...,” p. 50. Even 
during the investigative phase of the case, it was disclosed that Agca’s sensa¬ 
tional knowledge of the telephone numbers of the Bulgarian embassy in Rome 
was slightly compromised by the disclosure that he had “inadvertently” been 
left alone with a copy of the Rome phone directory. For other illustrations, 
see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection , pp. 112, 118-19.
