366 NOTES TO PAGES 155-159 

24. The first significant departure in the mass media from the SHK model, 
even though no alternative was offered, did not occur till May 12, 1983, on 
ABC-TV’s “20/20.” On the pattern of deviations here and later, see note 26 
below. 

25. Late in this long article, Newsweek does state in passing that “It is difficult 
to believe that the Soviets would expect the murder of the pope to solve their 
Polish problem. To some, it seems odd that the Soviets would put their fate 
in the hands of Bulgarians and Turks, depriving themselves of the control that 
is so essential to a ticklish intelligence operation.” These sentences, unusual 
in the mass media for raising such questions, sit alone and undeveloped, after 
a lengthy discourse that accepts the SHK analysis as valid. 

26. The only programs on national television that challenged the propaganda 
frame were on ABC: one, and the only program in five years of television 
coverage that showed the slightest degree of network enterprise, critical capa¬ 
bility, and honesty, was a program “To Kill the Pope,” aired on “20/20” on 
May 12,1983. Subsequently, ABC also had a program in which Sterling debated 
with Alexander Cockburn, although this was arranged unbeknownst to Ster¬ 
ling, who was enraged at having to have her views contested. (See Herman and 
Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection, pp. 123-24, for the story of this encounter.) 
Among the newspapers, a propaganda conformity prevailed until the time that 
prosecutor Albano’s report was made public in June 1984, when Michael 
Dobbs, of the Washington Post, began to take a more critical view, along with 
Don Schanche, of the Los Angeles Times . While skeptical of Agca’s claims over 
the next several years, Dobbs remained equally skeptical of the idea that Agca 
was coached, which he referred to as “the Bulgarian view.” Dobbs never 
seriously explored the coaching hypothesis. See Herman and Brodhead, Bul¬ 
garian Connection, “The Small Voices of Dissent,” pp. 199-202. 

27. Martella visited Washington, D.C., in October 1982, during which time he 
benefited not only from the insights of Arnauld de Borchgrave, but was also 
given a special viewing of the NBC-TV special on “The Man Who Shot the 
Pope” (see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection, pp. 24-27). Ledeen 
may have had a more direct involvement in the initiation of the case in Italy, 
a charge made by Francesco Pazienza. See Diana Johnstone, “Bulgarian Con¬ 
nection: Finger-pointing in the Pontiff Plot Labyrinth,” In These Times, Janu¬ 
ary 29-February 4, 1986. 

28. For a statistical tabulation of the extent of this bias, see table 7-1, “Sterling- 
Henze-Ledeen Dominance of Media Coverage of the Bulgarian Connection, 
September 1982-May 1985,” in Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection, 
pp. 182-83. 

29. Their coercive tactics were effective because their preestablished promi¬ 
nence and drawing power made them important to program organizers, which 
gave them leverage. This is the basis for “tying agreements,” outlawed under 
section 3 of the Clayton Act.
