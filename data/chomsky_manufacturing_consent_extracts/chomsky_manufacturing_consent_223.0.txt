other view could account for Agca’s knowledge of places he had never visited. 

37. Panorama, May 26, 1985, p. 107. 

38. Ugur Mumcu’s books, cited earlier, are a running commentary on what 
Mumcu repeatedly and explicitly calls Henze’s “lies.” 

39. “... I believe we are past the point where it serves the interests of any party 
except the Soviets to adopt the minimalist, legalistic approach which argues 
that if there is no ‘documentary evidence’ or some other form of incontroverti¬ 
ble proof that the Government of the U.S.S.R. is behind something, we must 
assume that it is not” (Paul Henze, “The Long Effort to Destabilize Turkey,” 
Atlantic Community [Winter 1981-82], p. 468). 

40. Ledeen had three Op-Ed articles in the New York Times in the years 
1984-87.

Why an Italian Spy Got Closely Involved in the Billygate Affair,” Wall Street 
Journal, August 8, 1985. 

43. The comprehensiveness of the Times' s protection of its disinformation 
sources was shown amusingly in February 1987 when Charles Babcock, of the 
Washington Post, revealed that Ledeen had very possibly been dismissed from 
Washington University in St. Louis in 1972 for plagiarism. On the very same 
day, an article by Stephen Engelberg in the Times, on Ledeen, describes 
Ledeen’s history as follows: “After being denied tenure at Washington Univer¬ 
sity in St. Louis in 1972, Mr. Ledeen became. ...” This was all the news fit 
to print about a useful asset.

45. See our reference earlier to its wholly uncritical presentation in the News¬ 
week article of January 3, 1983. 

46. For a discussion of the compromised character of the photo identification 
of the Bulgarians on November 9,1982, as well as the general conduct of the 
case by Investigating Judge Martella, see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian 
Connection, chapter 5. 

47. On the likelihood that this Antonov photo had been “manufactured” as an 
instrument of disinformation, see Howard Friel, “The Antonov Photo and the 
‘Bulgarian Connection/ ” Covert Action Information Bulletin 21 (Spring-Sum¬ 
mer 1984), pp. 20-21. 

48. This was treated outstandingly in the ABC “20/20” program of May 12, 
1983; and Agca’s shifting testimony was also discussed well by Michael Dobbs 
in the Washington Post, beginning in June 1984. These were exceptional, 
however, as pointed out in note 26 above. 

49. Dobbs is an honorable exception, although he remained very cautious in 
generalizing about Martella’s handling of the case, and, as noted, he failed to 
take seriously the obvious alternative model. 

50. Initially, Sterling suggested obliquely that any retracted claims had already 
been “corroborated”—a falsehood. Later, Sterling followed Italian prosecutor 
Albano’s solution to the problem: that Agca really was in Antonov’s apartment 
but was denying it to signal the Bulgarians that they had better break him out 
of jail. 


Chapter 5: The Indochina Wars (I) 

1. Among these, the most comprehensive, to our knowledge, are unpublished 
studies by Howard Elterman: The State, The Mass Media and Ideological He¬ 
gemony: United States Policy Decisions in Indochina, 1945-75—Historical Record, 
Government Pronouncements and Press Coverage (Ph.D. diss., New York Uni¬ 
versity, 1978); and The Circle of Deception: The United States Government, the 
National Press and the Indochina War, 1954-1984 (ms., n.d.). See also Daniel 
C. Hallin, The “Uncensored War": The Media and Vietnam (New York: Oxford 
University Press, 1986). The latter is based on a complete coverage of the New 
York Times from 1961 through mid-1965, and an extensive sample of television 
network news from August 1965 through January 1973. Elterman’s work covers

the New York Times and the newsweeklies, contrasting their coverage with that 
of the “alternative press.” The most extensive analysis of a particular incident 
is Peter Braestrup, Big Story, 2 vols. (Boulder: Westview, 1977), on the Tet 
offensive, published in cooperation with Freedom House. For detailed exami¬ 
nation of this highly influential study, to which we return in “The Tet Offen¬ 
sive,” pp. 211-228, and appendix 3, see Noam Chomsky, “The U.S. Media and 
the Tet Offensive,” Race & Class (London) XX, 1 (1978), and an excerpted
