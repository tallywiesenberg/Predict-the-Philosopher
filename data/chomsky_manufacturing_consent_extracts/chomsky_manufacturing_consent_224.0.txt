4. “Introduction” to Braestrup, Big Story, p. xviii; the latter phrase is the title

7. General Kinnard, now a military historian, was field commander for the 
1970 Cambodia invasion. One of the commentators is the French historian 
Philippe Devillers, elsewhere a critic of the war but appearing here only in 
endorsement of one element of the AIM critique. 

8. In Braestrup, Big Story, I, xix. 

9. Bernard Fall, “Vietnam Blitz,” New Republic, October 9, 1965. A French 
military historian and journalist, Fall was one of the few genuine experts on 
Vietnam writing in the United States at that time. He was also an extreme 
hawk, although he turned against the war when he saw that it was simply 
destroying the country and society of Vietnam.

18. The notion that the United States seeks American-style democracy in areas 
of intervention persists in liberal thought despite obvious and durable U.S.

Guatemala in 1954 and since, among many other examples, some discussed 
earlier. To postulate otherwise would be to acknowledge something other than 
benevolent ends. This would be intolerable.
