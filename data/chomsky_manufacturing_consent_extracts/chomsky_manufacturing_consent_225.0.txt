33. Guenter Lewy, America in Vietnam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 
1978). For detailed discussion of this vulgar propaganda exercise disguised as 
“scholarship,” see our review, reprinted in Chomsky, Towards a New Cold 
War, chapter 5. Lewy tacitly concedes the accuracy of this critique by evasion; 
compare the review with his response to critics, Washington Quarterly (Au¬ 
tumn 1979). For further insight into the commitments and intellectual level of 
a man taken seriously as a scholar, see his discussion of the need for the state 
to take stern action to protect the public from “lies” by subversives, and to 
ensure that the public is not deceived by the “hidden agenda” of such groups 
as Clergy and Laity Concerned, the Coalition for a New Foreign and Military 
Policy, NACLA, and others who seek to conceal “their espousal of Cuban- 
style Communism” and who are engaged in “deception” and “subversion.” As 
he correctly notes, and inadvertently reveals in his discussion, “to totalitarian¬ 
ism, an opponent is by definition subversive” (Lewy, “Does America Need a 
Verfassungsschutzbericht?” Orbis [Fall 1987]—a respected journal with a dis¬ 
tinguished editorial board).

37. U.S. involvement dates back to the export of Diem from the United States 
to Vietnam in 1954, and his forcible imposition as a “leader” of the southern 
part of the country, in a context where U.S. officials readily admitted that the 
great majority of South Vietnamese supported Ho Chi Minh and that Diem 
lacked an indigenous base of support. 

38. We saw in chapter 3 that in El Salvador, too, while it was admitted by the 
media that the population wanted peace above all else, the elections under U.S. 
auspices—again, held only after the ground had been cleared by mass killing 
for reasons that the media never confronted or tried to explain—produced 
governments dedicated to military victory.
