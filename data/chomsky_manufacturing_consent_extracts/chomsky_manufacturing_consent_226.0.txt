44. Paul Quinn-Judge reports that deaths from 1965 on in Vietnam alone may 
have passed three million (Far Eastern Economic Review , Oct. 11, 1984). A 
standard Western estimate is about 500,000 killed in the U.S.-backed French 
war. Hundreds of thousands more were killed in South Vietnam before 1965, 
in Laos, and in Cambodia. 

45. According to congressional sources that cite unpublished studies of the 
Congressional Research Service, which are alleged to give the figure $84.5 
million, in fiscal-year 1987 dollars, from FY 1980 through FY 1986. We return 
to this matter in the next chapter. 

46. See Charles Kadushin, The American Intellectual Elite (Boston: Little, 
Brown, 1974). This study was based on lengthy interviews taken in May 1970, 
after the Cambodia invasion, when public opposition to the war reached its 
highest peak. Virtually all of those interviewed were “doves,” some active in 
opposition to the war. Virtually none opposed the war on the principled 
grounds of opposition to aggression (called “ideological grounds” by the au¬ 
thor) that all would have adopted had they been asked about the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia.

48. Charles Mohr, quoting a “South Vietnamese official” (New York Times , 
Oct. 24,1966). One of the authors (Herman) published in 1971 a compilation 
of quotations, many from Saigon generals and other officials, on the need for 
time because of their lack of indigenous support, which made political compe¬ 
tition intolerable. See “Free Choice or Subjugation,” American Report, May

54. Fall, “Vietcong—The Unseen Enemy,” cites as credible the figure 66,000 
killed between 1957 and 1961. Gabriel Kolko gives the figure of 12,000 killed 
as a “conservative” estimate for 1955-57, with 40,000 political prisoners, reach¬ 
ing 150,000 by 1961—50,000, according to the government (Anatomy of a War, 
p. 89).
