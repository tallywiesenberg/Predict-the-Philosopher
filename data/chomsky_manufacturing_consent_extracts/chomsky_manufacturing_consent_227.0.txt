86. The character of the bombing of North Vietnam is denied by apologists— 
notoriously, the respected “scholar” Guenter Lewy, who proves that it was 
directed solely at military targets on the grounds that the U.S. government says 
so, discounting eyewitness reports from a wide range of sources; see our 
review, cited in note 33, for a few examples.
