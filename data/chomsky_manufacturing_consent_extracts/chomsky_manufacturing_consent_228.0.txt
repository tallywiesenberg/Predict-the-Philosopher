no. Thies, When Governments Collide, p. 201. This analysis, familiar in the 
scholarly literature, is quite different from Braestrup’s conclusions, which, as 
Porter comments, he attributes to a consensus of historians without a single 
reference. Porter adds that “few independent historians” would endorse 
Braestrup’s conclusions or his analysis of Communist objectives, quoting CIA 
analyst Patrick McGarvey and others. See his A Peace Denied, pp. 67f., for 
further discussion of these issues. 

hi. New York Times, February 20, April 4,1968. On internal U.S. government 
assessments, see below, and Kolko, Anatomy of a War, p. 329. Kolko goes on 
to describe how these assessments underestimated the success of U.S. terror 
in decimating the NLF infrastructure in rural areas, and were thus overly 
“pessimistic.” Note that Dy virtue of these conclusions, Kolko counts as “opti¬ 
mistic” by Freedom House logic, that is, supportive of U.S. goals. In fact, quite 
the opposite is true, still another illustration of the absurdity of the Freedom 
House assumptions—or, more accurately, of their blind adherence to the 
doctrines of state propaganda, reaching to the way in which the issues are 
initially framed.

the retreating NLF forces, see our PEHR, 1 ,345ff., and sources cited, particu¬ 
larly Gareth Porter, “The 1968 ‘Hue Massacre,' ” Congressional Record, Febru¬ 
ary 19,1975, PP- S2189-94,” and Porter's review of Big Story . Porter notes that 
Braestrup’s estimate of destruction in Hue is far below that of US AID, which 
estimated in April that 77 percent of Hue’s buildings were “seriously dam¬ 
aged" or totally destroyed.
