to describe how these assessments underestimated the success of U.S. terror 
in decimating the NLF infrastructure in rural areas, and were thus overly 
“pessimistic.” Note that Dy virtue of these conclusions, Kolko counts as “opti¬ 
mistic” by Freedom House logic, that is, supportive of U.S. goals. In fact, quite 
the opposite is true, still another illustration of the absurdity of the Freedom 
House assumptions—or, more accurately, of their blind adherence to the 
doctrines of state propaganda, reaching to the way in which the issues are 
initially framed.

the retreating NLF forces, see our PEHR, 1 ,345ff., and sources cited, particu¬

Braestrup’s estimate of destruction in Hue is far below that of US AID, which 
estimated in April that 77 percent of Hue’s buildings were “seriously dam¬ 
aged" or totally destroyed.
