while Taiwanese soldiers had reached “several hundred" by mid-1964, in 
addition to “a considerable number of soldiers seconded from Chiang Kai- 
shek’s army on Taiwan," possibly as early as 1959 but certainly under the 
Kennedy administration, often disguised as members of the Nung Chinese 
ethnic minority in Vietnam and employed for sabotage missions in the North 
as well as fighting in the South. For McNamara's estimate, see his statement 
before the Senate Armed Services Committee, January 22, 1968; excerpts in 
Big Story, II, I4ff.
