39. On the importance of Racak as a basis for mobilizing U.S. allies and the 
public for war, see Barton Gellman, “The Path to Crisis: How the United 
States and Its Allies Went to War,” Washington Post , April 18,1999; Madeleine 
Albright referred to Racak as a “galvanizing incident” (quoted in Bo Adam, 
Roland Heine, and Claudius Technau, “I Felt fhai Something Was Wrong " 
Berliner Zeitung, April 5, 2000).

Globally,” in Philip Hammond and Edward Herman, eds.. Degraded Capabil¬ 
ity: The Media and the Kosovo Crisis (London: Pluto, 2000), pp + 117-19. More 
recently, three Finnish forensic experts, who were members of a panel that 
examined the forty bodies found at Racak, disclosed that their team found 
no support for the alleged mutilations by the Serbs, and the data presented 
in the article casts further doubt on the claim that all the victims were exe¬ 
cuted. (J. Raino et al., “Independent Forensic Autopsies in Armed Conflict 
Investigation of Victims from Racak, Kosovo,” Forensic Science International^ 
vol. 16 (2001), pp. 171-85.) It is a notable fact that the OSCE has not yet seen 
fit to release the original forensic report from which this article's data is 
drawn.

51. Of the major mainstream media, only the Los Angeles Times addressed its 
findings, with the article “Russia Election Chief Rejects Fraud Claims in 
Presidential Vote” (September 13, 2000); a title that features the rejoinder of 
Russian officials, not the charges themselves. For a discussion of this article 
see Taibbi, “OSCE”. 

52. On the overall atrocious mainstream media reporting on the Russian eco¬ 
nomic and social collapse, as well as on the elections, see Stephen Cohen, 
Failed Crusade , chapter 1. 

53- The Soviet Union did undoubtedly mistreat its own and client-state 
peoples, although the treatment of Russians by the Western-backed “reform¬ 
ers” since 1991 has hardly been an improvement. However the charge of 
sponsorship of international terrorism was inflated and hypocritical given the 
West’s support of its own very impressive terror networks. See Edward Her¬ 
man, The Real Terror Network (Boston: South End Press, 1982); Noam 
Chomsky; Pirates and Emperors: International Terrorism in the Real World (New
