NATO bombs and military actions not aiming to kill civilians. See Jonathan

Over East Timor Washington Posty September 5, 1999.

personnel: Lindsay Murdochs “Horror Lives on for Town of Liquica,” The 
Age (Australia), April 8, 1999; Barry Wain, “Will Justice Be Served in East 
Timor?” Wall Street Journal (Asia edition), April 17, 2000. 

39. On the importance of Racak as a basis for mobilizing U.S. allies and the 
public for war, see Barton Gellman, “The Path to Crisis: How the United 
States and Its Allies Went to War,” Washington Post , April 18,1999; Madeleine 
Albright referred to Racak as a “galvanizing incident” (quoted in Bo Adam, 
Roland Heine, and Claudius Technau, “I Felt fhai Something Was Wrong " 
Berliner Zeitung, April 5, 2000). 

40. See Edward Herman and David Peterson, “CNN: Selling Nato's War 
Globally,” in Philip Hammond and Edward Herman, eds.. Degraded Capabil¬ 
ity: The Media and the Kosovo Crisis (London: Pluto, 2000), pp + 117-19. More 
recently, three Finnish forensic experts, who were members of a panel that 
examined the forty bodies found at Racak, disclosed that their team found 
no support for the alleged mutilations by the Serbs, and the data presented 
in the article casts further doubt on the claim that all the victims were exe¬ 
cuted. (J. Raino et al., “Independent Forensic Autopsies in Armed Conflict 
Investigation of Victims from Racak, Kosovo,” Forensic Science International^ 
vol. 16 (2001), pp. 171-85.) It is a notable fact that the OSCE has not yet seen 
fit to release the original forensic report from which this article's data is 
drawn.
