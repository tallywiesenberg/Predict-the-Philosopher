And the further costs in damaged relations 
with Western Europe—which were extremely important to the Soviet 
Union in 1981, with the gas pipeline being negotiated and with the 
placement of new U.S. missiles in Western Europe a major Soviet 
concern—would seem to militate against taking foolish risks.12 

A second problem with the SHK model is that Agca had threatened 
to kill the pope in 1979 at the time of a papal visit to Turkey—again, 
long before Solidarity existed.This suggests that Agca and the Turkish 
right had their own grievances against the pope and a rationale for 
assassinating him that was independent of any Soviet influence.It was 
partly for this reason that SHK argue that Agca was recruited by the 
Soviet Union in Turkey before the pope’s visit there, setting him up for 
the later attack.But not only is this pure speculation unsupported by 
a trace of evidence, it fails to explain why the entire Fascist press, not 
just Agca, assailed the pope’s visit in 1979.
