Was the entire Fascist right 
serving Soviet ends?The only time this issue was ever raised in the mass 
media, on the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour” of January 5, 1983, Paul 
Henze stated in no uncertain terms that “there was no [press] opposi¬ 
tion” to the pope’s visit in 1979.The Turkish journalist Ugur Mumcu, 
however, assembled a large collection of citations from the Turkish 
rightist press of the time to demonstrate that Henze’s statement was 
false.13 

A third problem for the SHK model was that Agca was a committed 
rightist, and therefore not a likely candidate for service to the Commu¬ 
nist powers (although perhaps amenable to fingering them as co-con¬ 
spirators in a prison context).SHK strove mightily to make Agca out 
to be a rootless mercenary, but the best they could come up with was

the fact that Agca didn't seem to have been registered as a member of 
the Gray Wolves.
