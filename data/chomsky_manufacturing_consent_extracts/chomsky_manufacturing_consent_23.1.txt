14 But all his friends* associates* and affiliations from 
high school days onward were Gray Wolves* and in his travels through 
Europe up to the time of his May 13* 1981, rendezvous* he moved solely 
through the Gray Wolves network.While in prison* Agca addressed a 
letter to Alparslan Turkes* the leader of the Nationalist Action Party 
of Turkey* expressing his continued commitment and loyalty.This 
letter was bothersome to Sterling and Henze as it is inconsistent with 
their depiction of Agca as apolitical, and Sterling dismissed it without 
argument as a “laughably clumsy forgery.” A problem* however* is that 
Agca's letter was introduced as evidence in a trial in Ankara by the 
Turkish military authorities* usually adequate proof for Sterling of 
authenticity.She doesn’t mention this fact or examine their case.Ugur 
Mumcu devotes five pages of his book Agca Dossier to a detailed ac¬ 
count of the Turkes letter* describing the great pains the authorities 
took* including tapping outside experts, to establish its authenticity.
