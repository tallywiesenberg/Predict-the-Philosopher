The conclusion on all sides was that the letter was genuine.A fourth problem with the SHK model is the notion that because of 
the efficiency of the Bulgarian secret police, Agca's presence in Sofia 
must have been known to them* and he must therefore have been on 
their payroll.This assumed efficiency is an ideological assumption un¬ 
supported by any evidence and contradicted by actual Bulgarian and 
Soviet performance.There is no evidence that the Bulgarians ever 
identified Agca, who was using a false passport.Furthermore, the con¬ 
tention that the Bulgarian police know everything was refuted in impor¬ 
tant testimony during the Rome trial on September 22* 1985, when Gray 
Wolves official Abdullah Catli stated that many Gray Wolves preferred 
to traverse Bulgaria because it was easy to hide in the large flow of 
Turkish immigrant traffic through that country.
