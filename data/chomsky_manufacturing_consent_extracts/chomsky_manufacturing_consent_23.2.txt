A fifth problem for the SHK model was the fact that Agca seems to 
have gotten his gun through the Gray Wolves network, not from the 
Bulgarians, who presumably could have slipped it to him quite easily 
in Rome.In her Reader’s Digest article.Sterling traced Agca's gun to 
Horst Grillmaier, an Austrian gun dealer who, according to Sterling, 
had fled behind the Iron Curtain after May 13,1981* to avoid question¬ 
ing in the West.It turned out later, however* that Grillmaier was a 
former Nazi who specialized in supplying right-wing gun buyers; that 
he had not disappeared behind the Iron Curtain at all; and that the gun 
had proceeded through a number of intermediaries, to be transmitted 
to Agca by a Gray Wolves friend- Sterling handles the disintegration 
of the original Grillmaier line by simply shifting to a new conspiratorial

ground: the clever Bulgarians had Agca purchase a gun through a 
known Fascist to strengthen the case that Agca was a right-winger who 
could not possibly be connected to the Communist powers.A final set of problems for the SHK model lies in the extraordinary 
level of incompetence and gross violations of the principles of plausible 
deniability that it attributes to the Bulgarian and Soviet secret police— 
features that coexist uneasily with the superspy image invoked else¬ 
where in the model.
