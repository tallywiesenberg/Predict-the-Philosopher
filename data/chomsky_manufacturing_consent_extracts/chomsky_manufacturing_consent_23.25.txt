At various points* SHK contended that the Soviets 
and Bulgarians were professionals who could afford to go after the pope 
because they would never be implicated themselves.But hiring Agca* 
a wanted criminal and a mentally unbalanced rightist* would appear 
extremely foolish* as the cover would quickly be blown in the likely 
event that he was caught.In Sterling’s initial tale* the KGB wanted him 
to be caught—or at least to have his body identified—to discredit 
Turkey.With the shift to weakening Solidarity as the motive* the threat 
of disclosure of Bulgarian-Soviet involvement would seem very serious* 
Yet the Bulgarians and KGB hired Agca and then failed to kill him* 
Another anomaly was bringing Agca to Sofia for instructions* If he had 
already been recruited in Turkey* wouldn’t bringing him to Sofia be a 
foolish compromising of his carefully prepared “cover 51 ?If so* doesn’t 
his visit to Sofia constitute an argument against Soviet and Bulgarian 
involvement?
