While Agca 5 s November 1982 confession that he had Bulgarian co¬ 
conspirators made the Bulgarian Connection instantly “true” for the 
Western media* it wreaked havoc with the SHK model and with the 
logic of “plausible deniability* 55 If* as Agca confessed* the Bulgarians

involvement, and the press might even have pointed out that a mini¬ 
mally competent CIA would not have brought Agca to Washington for 
instructions in the first place.
