The alternative model would take the same fact that SHK start out 
with—Agca’s stay in Sofia, Bulgaria—but interpret it differently.That 
visit violates principles of plausible deniability and would be especially 
foolish if the KGB had already recruited Agca in Turkey.On the other 
hand, it provides a Western propaganda system with the necessary tie 
between Agca’s terrorist attack m Rome and the Soviet bloc.The 
convenience of Agca’s confession—to Socialist leader Craxi, to the 
Christian Democrats and neo-Fascists in Italy, and to Reagan searching 
for a tie-in between “international terrorism” and the Soviet Union—is 
also crystal dear, and would immediately suggest to an objective press 
the possibility that this “demand” might have elicited an appropriate 
“supply” from the imprisoned Agca.The lag in Agca’s naming of any 
Bulgarians—seventeen months after he entered an Italian prison and 
seven months after he had agreed to “cooperate” with the investigating 
magistrate, Ilario Martella—is also highly suggestive.
