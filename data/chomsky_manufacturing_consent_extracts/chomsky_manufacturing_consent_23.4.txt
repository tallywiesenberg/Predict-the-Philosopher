Why did it take 
him so long to name his co-conspirators?Sterling tried to explain this 
on the ground that Agca had hopes that the Bulgarians would “spring 
him” and gave them time; his successive elaborations of claims and 
subsequent retractions she explained in terms of Agca’s “signaling” to 
his alleged partners.This complex and speculative attempt to rational¬ 
ize inconvenient facts is not necessary; a very straightforward explana¬ 
tion based on Agca’s character and affiliations and the inducements 
known to have been offered to him (described below) does quite 
nicely.15 Furthermore, Sterling’s explanation does not account for the 
fact that Agca failed to provide serious evidence late in the trial, long 
after it was clear that the Bulgarians had not responded to his alleged 
signals.Another suggestive feature of Agca’s confession is that it followed the 
creation and wide media distribution of the SHK model.
