A P-2 scandal broke in Italy in March 1981* and by 
August Santovito had been forced to leave SISMI, but the rightist grip 
on this organization was by no means broken.An important feature of Italian politics in the period from 1966 
through 1981 was the protection given by the intelligence services to 
right-wing terror* under a program designated the “strategy of ten¬ 
sion.5517 One aspect of this strategy was the carrying out of right-wing 
terrorist attacks* which were then attributed to the left* frequently with 
the help of forged documents and planted informers committing per¬ 
jury, The point of the strategy was to polarize society, discredit the left* 
and set the stage for a rightist coup.Many P-2 members in the armed 
forces and intelligence services took part in implementing this program, 
and many others were sympathetic to its aims.In July 1984, an Italian 
parliamentary commission published its final report on the P-2 conspir¬ 
acy* and it and its accompanying volumes of hearings pointed up the 
politicization of the intelligence services* their frequent use of tech¬ 
niques of disinformation* and their connivance with and protection of 
right-wing terror* In July 1985 a Bologna court issued a decision in 
which it named SISMI and its officers as having engaged in numerous 
forgeries, and also in having collaborated in covering up the Bologna 
terrorist bombing of 1980.
