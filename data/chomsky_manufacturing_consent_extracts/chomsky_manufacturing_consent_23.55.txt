SISMI participated in a five-hour interrogation of Agca in December 
1981, exploring his link to “international terrorism* 55 Investigating Judge 
Martella acknowledges in his long investigative report that he had 
spoken to Agca about the possibility of a commuted sentence if he 
“cooperated* 55 and the Italian press quoted Agca’s lawyer's report of the 
terms of proposed deals that had been offered to Agca* 19 There were 
also a variety of reports in the European and dissident media of pres-

sures applied to Agca while in prison* A London Sunday Times team 
pointed out in May 1983 that the secret services “visited Agca and 
warned him that once his solitary confinement was over* ‘the authorities 
could no longer guarantee his safety/ ” 20 According to Orsen Oymen, 
a Turkish expert on the case* the Catholic chaplain in Agca’s prison* 
Father Mariano Santini* had frequent access to Agca and was one of 
those who pressed him to cooperate with the authorities* 21 There is 
some possible confirmation of Santini’s pressure tactics in a letter which 
Agca addressed to the Vatican* dated September 24* 1982* which com¬ 
plained bitterly of threats to his life emanating from a Vatican emissary* 
During the course of the Rome trial* Giovanni Pandico* the principal 
Italian state witness in the trial of Mafia leaders in Naples and an 
associate of Raphael Cutolo, a Mafia leader who had been in Ascoli 
Piceno prison with Agca* claimed in an interview (and subsequently 
before the court) that Agca had been coerced* persuaded and coached 
to implicate the Bulgarians by Cutolo* Santini, and others.Pandico 
claimed that Cutolo himself had been coerced into working on Agca by 
threats to himself* and that former SISMI officials Giuseppi Musumeci 
and Francesco Pazienza were key initiators of the plot.One of the 
important individuals accused by Pandico, Francesco Pazienza* while 
denying the charges, gave his own detailed account of who in SISMI 
had participated in persuading Agca to talk* 

From the inception of the case, there were points suggesting that 
Agca was coached while in prison.After his long (and unexplained) 
silence* Agca identified the Bulgarians in a photo album allegedly 
shown to him for the first time on November 9* 1982* But in a speech 
before the Italian parliament, the minister of defense* Lelio Lagorio, 
stated that Agca had identified the Bulgarians in September of 1982* 
This discrepancy has never been explained, but that Agca saw these 
photos for the first time on November 9 is not believable* 22 A key 
element in Agca’s testimony was his claim to have visited the apartment 
of Sergei Antonov* one of the Bulgarians arrested in the “plot*” and to 
have met his wife and daughter* which was supported by many fine 
details regarding Antonov’s hobbies and the characteristics of his apart¬ 
ment* The defense, however* was able to show that one feature of 
Antonov’s apartment mentioned by Agca was in error, although charac¬ 
teristic of the other apartments in Antonov’s building, which suggests 
that Agca had been supplied information based on observation of other 
apartments* More important, the defense was able to establish that at 
the time of Agca’s visit at which he met Mrs* Antonov, she was out of 
the country* Following newspaper publicity given these defense con¬ 
tentions, on June 28* 1983* Agca retracted his claims that he had visited

the apartment and met Antonov’s family.The details he had given 
about apartment and family then became inexplicable* except on the 
supposition that Agca had been fed information while in prison.
