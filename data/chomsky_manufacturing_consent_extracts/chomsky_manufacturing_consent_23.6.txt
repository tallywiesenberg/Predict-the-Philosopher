In a 
number of other instances Agca provided information that bore strong 
suspicion of having been provided by officials and agents of the court 
or the police.The London Sunday Times reporters* who interviewed 
one of the accused Bulgarians in Sofia* wrote that “When asked by 
Martelia in Bulgaria whether he had any salient physical features, 
Vassilev said that he had a mole on his left cheek.In a subsequent 
confession, as Vassilev points out, *Agca described my mole in the very 
same words which I used in describing it here.5 ” 23 

During the course of the Rome trial in 1985-86, no trace was ever 
found of the money that Agca claimed he had received from the Bul¬ 
garians.The car that Agca indicated the Bulgarians had used to escort 
him around Rome was never located.
