No witness was ever found who 
saw him in his many supposed encounters with Bulgarians.His gun was 
transferred to him through the Turkish Gray Wolves network, and 
there was no shortage of evidence of his meetings with members of the 
Gray Wolves in Western Europe.The note that was found on Agca 5 s 
person on May 13, 1981* did not mention any collaborators, and sug¬ 
gested a loose timetable for the assassination attempt and a planned 
railroad trip to Naples, 

In sum, it is highly probable that Agca was offered a deal to talk, and 
that it was made dear to him that the people with power over his 
well-being wanted him to implicate the Bulgarians and the Soviet 
Union in the assassination attempt.He had access to the SHK model 
even before he confessed.His confession was therefore suspect from 
the start, and an “alternative model 55 of inducement-pressure coaching 
was plausible and relevant, from the Agca 5 s first implication of Bulgari¬ 
ans.
