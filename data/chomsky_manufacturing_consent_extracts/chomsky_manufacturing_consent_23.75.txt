Some members of the mass 
media helped originate the claim of a Bulgarian Connection, while 
others participated only in disseminating the SHK line (and excluding 
alternative views and inconvenient information).The campaign began with Sterling’s Reader’s Digest article of Sep¬ 
tember 1982, which was closely followed by the NBC-TV program of 
September 21, 1982, The outreach of these two statements asserting a 
Bulgarian Connection was great, and they were widely reported upon 
in the rest of the media in the form of a summary of their claims, with 
virtually no questions raised about their validity.With Agca’s Novem¬ 
ber 1982 naming of Bulgarians, the mass media began to report the 
Bulgarian Connection intensively.This reporting was carried out ex¬ 
clusively within the frame of the SHK model, and for most of the mass 
media no serious departures from this model occurred through the 
conclusion of the Rome trial in March 1986.24 

Agca’s naming of the Bulgarians was the key fact that generated news 
coverage, providing the basis for reiterated details about the Bulgarians, 
explanations of the Bulgarian (and Soviet) motive, and speculation 
about the political implications of the charges, if confirmed.
