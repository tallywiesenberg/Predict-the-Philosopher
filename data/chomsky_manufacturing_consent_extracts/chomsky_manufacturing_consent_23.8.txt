A major 
characteristic of these news reports was their sheer superficiality, with 
the charges never seriously examined but merely regurgitated and 
elaborated with odd facts and opinion, and with no departures from the 
SHK frame (and no hints of the possible relevance of an alternative 
frame).The charges constituted a form of vindication of the SHK 
model if taken at face value and presented superficially—i.e., if the 
media presentations never considered political convenience, prison 
conditions, possible deals, plausible deniability, etc* And this proce¬ 
dure—a reiteration of Agca claims, supplemented by extremely super¬ 
ficial pro-plot speculation—was the principal modality by which the 
mass media accepted and pushed the propaganda line, 

Newsweek provides a prototype of news coverage within the SHK 
framework in its article of January 3,1983, “The Plot to Kill Pope John 
Paul II.” The Bulgarian-Soviet motive as portrayed by SHK is reite¬ 
rated through quotes from congenial sources—“a precautionary and 
alternative solution to the invasion of Poland”—while nobody is quoted 
discussing costs and benefits, the nature of the Soviet leadership, or 
Western benefits from Agca’s confession.25 In fact, Newsweek suggests

that this charging of the Soviet bloc with the assassination attempt is 
a painful embarrassment to Western governments (parroting the SHK 
line on this point).Newsweek nowhere discusses the seventeen-month 
lag in Agca’s confession or his prison conditions, nor does it report in 
this (or any later) article the claims and information noted in the 
London Sunday Times and the Italian press about inducements or 
coercive threats that might have been applied to Agca while in custody.Agca J s evidence is given credibility by Newsweek through several 
devices: repeating his claims several times as the core of the story; 
stressing in two separate sequences investigative judge Martella J s al¬ 
leged honesty, integrity, conscientiousness, etc.
