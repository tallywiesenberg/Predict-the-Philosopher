Initially, the other major media performed quite uniformly in the

content whatever but were reports of somebody's opinion or specula¬

carried one news article whose sole content was that President Reagan 
had “no comment 51 on the case.)More typical was the front-page article 
by Henry Kamm, “Bonn is Fearful of Bulgaria Tie with Terrorists” 
(Dec, 12* 1982)* or Bernard Gwertzman's “U.S, Intrigued But Uncertain 
on a Bulgarian Tie” (Dec. 26,1982).In “news report” after news report* 
unnamed individuals are “intrigued*” their interest is “piqued*” evi¬ 
dence is said to be “not wholly convincing*” or “final proof is still 
lacking,” Four of the news articles in the Times were on peripheral 
subjects such as smuggling in Bulgaria or papal-Soviet relations.Of the 
sixteen more direct news items* only one covered a solid news fact— 
namely, Antonov's arrest in Rome.
