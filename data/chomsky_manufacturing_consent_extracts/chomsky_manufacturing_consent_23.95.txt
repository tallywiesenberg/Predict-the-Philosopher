The other fifteen news items were 
trivia* such as Kamm’s “Bulgarians Regret Tarnished Image” (Jan. 27* 
1983)* or another Kamm piece entitled “Italian Judge Inspects Apart¬ 
ment of Suspect in Bulgarian Case 55 (Jan. 12* 1983), All of these expres¬ 
sions of opinion* doubts* interest* suppositions, and minor detail served 
to produce a lot of smoke—which kept the issue of possible Soviet 
involvement before the public.They steered quite clear of substantive 
issues that bore on motives* quality of evidence* and Turkish and Italian 
context.During the years that followed* to the end of the trial in March 1986* 
the mass media, with only minor exceptions, adhered closely and un¬ 
critically to the SHK framework.26 They not only failed to press alter¬ 
native questions* they also refused to examine closely the premises, 
logic* or evidence supporting the SHK case.Part of the reason for this 
was the media's extraordinary reliance on Sterling and Henze as 
sources (and Kalb's position as a news reporter on NBC-TV), and their 
unwillingness to ask these sources probing questions.
