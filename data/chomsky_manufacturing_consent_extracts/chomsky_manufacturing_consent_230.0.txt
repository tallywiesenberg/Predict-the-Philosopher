February 12, 1968, in Gareth Porter, ed., Vietnam: A History in Documents 
(New York: Meridian, 1981), pp. 354f.; PP, IV, 541, 564, 482, 478, 217, 197. 

157. John E. Rielly, Foreign Policy (Spring 1983, Spring 1987). Rielly, ed., 
American Public Opinion and U.S. Foreign Policy 1987, Chicago Council on 
Foreign Relations, p. 33. In the 1986 poll, the percentage of the public that 
regarded the Vietnam War as “fundamentally wrong and immoral” was 66 
percent, as compared with 72 percent in 1978 and 1982. Among “leaders” 
(including representatives of churches, voluntary organizations, and ethnic 
organizations), the percentage was 44 percent, as compared with 45 percent 
in 1982 and 50 percent in 1978. The editor takes this to indicate “some waning 
of the impact of the Vietnam experience with the passage of time”; and, 
perhaps, some impact of the propaganda system, as memories fade and people 
are polled who lack direct experience.
