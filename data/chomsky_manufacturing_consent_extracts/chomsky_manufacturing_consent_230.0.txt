156. Memorandum for the secretary of defense by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
February 12, 1968, in Gareth Porter, ed., Vietnam: A History in Documents 
(New York: Meridian, 1981), pp. 354f.; PP, IV, 541, 564, 482, 478, 217, 197. 

157. John E. Rielly, Foreign Policy (Spring 1983, Spring 1987). Rielly, ed., 
American Public Opinion and U.S. Foreign Policy 1987, Chicago Council on 
Foreign Relations, p. 33. In the 1986 poll, the percentage of the public that 
regarded the Vietnam War as “fundamentally wrong and immoral” was 66 
percent, as compared with 72 percent in 1978 and 1982. Among “leaders” 
(including representatives of churches, voluntary organizations, and ethnic 
organizations), the percentage was 44 percent, as compared with 45 percent 
in 1982 and 50 percent in 1978. The editor takes this to indicate “some waning 
of the impact of the Vietnam experience with the passage of time”; and, 
perhaps, some impact of the propaganda system, as memories fade and people 
are polled who lack direct experience. 

158. New Republic , January 22,1977; see Marilyn Young, “Critical Amnesia,” 
The Nation , April 2, 1977, on this and similar reviews of Emerson’s Winners 
and Losers.

June 26, 1983, p. 15. 

161. New York Times, May 28,1984. A CIA analysis of April 1968 estimated that 
“80,000 enemy troops,” overwhelmingly South Vietnamese, were killed during 
the Tet offensive. See note 44, above. 

162. Arthur Westing, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (February 1981); Colin 
Norman, Science, March 11, 1983, citing the conclusion of an international 
conference in Ho Chi Minh City; Jim Rogers, Indochina Issues, Center for 
International Policy (September 1985). On the effects of U.S. chemical and 
environmental warfare in Vietnam, unprecedented in scale and character, see 
SIPRI, Ecological Consequences of the Second Indochina War (Stockholm: 
Almqvist & Wiksell, 1976).

168. Time, April 15, 1985. The discussion here is in part drawn from Noam 
Chomsky, “Visions of Righteousness,” Cultural Critique (Spring 1986). 

169. Wall Street Journal, April 4, 1985. An exception was Newsweek (Apr. 15, 
1985), which devoted four pages of its thirty-three-page account to a report by 
Tony Clifton and Ron Moreau on the effects of the war on the “wounded 
land.” The New York Times retrospective includes one Vietnamese, a defector 
to the West, who devotes a few paragraphs of his five-page denunciation of 
the enemy to the character of the war, and there are scattered references in 
other retrospectives.

a respected commentator on public affairs and economic historian at the 


University of Texas, The View from the Seventh Floor (New York: Harper & 
Row, 1964), p. 244. Rostow’s account of Mao and North Korea is as fanciful 
as his remarks on Indochina, as serious scholarship shows.
