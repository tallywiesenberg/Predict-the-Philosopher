160. Review of Paul Johnson, Modem Times, in New York Times Book Review , 
June 26, 1983, p. 15. 

161. New York Times, May 28,1984. A CIA analysis of April 1968 estimated that 
“80,000 enemy troops,” overwhelmingly South Vietnamese, were killed during 
the Tet offensive. See note 44, above. 

162. Arthur Westing, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (February 1981); Colin 
Norman, Science, March 11, 1983, citing the conclusion of an international 
conference in Ho Chi Minh City; Jim Rogers, Indochina Issues, Center for 
International Policy (September 1985). On the effects of U.S. chemical and 
environmental warfare in Vietnam, unprecedented in scale and character, see 
SIPRI, Ecological Consequences of the Second Indochina War (Stockholm: 
Almqvist & Wiksell, 1976). 

163. Ton That Thien, Pacific Affairs (Winter 1983-84); Chitra Subramaniam, 
Pacific News Service, November 15, 1985; both writing from Geneva. 

164. News conference, March 24, 1977; New York Times, March 25, 1977. 

165. Bernard Gwertzman, New York Times, March 3, 1985. 

166. Barbara Crossette, New York Times, November 10, 1985, February 28, 
1988; AP, April 7, 1988. 

167. John Corry, New York Times, April 27, 1985. 

168. Time, April 15, 1985. The discussion here is in part drawn from Noam 
Chomsky, “Visions of Righteousness,” Cultural Critique (Spring 1986). 

169. Wall Street Journal, April 4, 1985. An exception was Newsweek (Apr. 15, 
1985), which devoted four pages of its thirty-three-page account to a report by 
Tony Clifton and Ron Moreau on the effects of the war on the “wounded 
land.” The New York Times retrospective includes one Vietnamese, a defector 
to the West, who devotes a few paragraphs of his five-page denunciation of 
the enemy to the character of the war, and there are scattered references in 
other retrospectives. 

170. Presidential adviser Walt W. Rostow, formerly a professor at MIT, now 
a respected commentator on public affairs and economic historian at the 


University of Texas, The View from the Seventh Floor (New York: Harper & 
Row, 1964), p. 244. Rostow’s account of Mao and North Korea is as fanciful 
as his remarks on Indochina, as serious scholarship shows. 

171. Stuart Creighton Miller, “Benevolent Assimilation” (New Haven: Yale 
University Press, 1982), p. 271. 

172. Allan E. Goodman and Seth P. Tillman, New York Times, March 24,1985.
