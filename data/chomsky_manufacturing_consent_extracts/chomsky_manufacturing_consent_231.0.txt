175. It is widely argued that the United States supported France in Indochina 
out of concern for French participation in the U.S.-run European military 
system. This appears to be a minor factor at best, and one can also make a case 
that the reverse was true: that support for France in Europe was motivated by 
concern that France might “abandon Indochina” (see Geoffrey Warner, “The 
USA and the Rearmament of West Germany,” International Affairs [Spring 
1985])- This factor also fails to explain U.S. efforts to keep the French in 
Indochina, and to take up their cause after they withdrew.

that occurred years later, according to Butterfield’s interesting logic.
