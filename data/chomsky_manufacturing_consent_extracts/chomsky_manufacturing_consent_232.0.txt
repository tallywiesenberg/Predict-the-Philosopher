6. A request to the (very cooperative) American embassy in Vientiane to obtain 
their documentation would have quickly revealed to reporters that the claims 
they were relaying on the basis of embassy briefings had little relation to the 
facts, as one of us discovered by carrying out the exercise in Vientiane in early 
1970. For a detailed review of the available facts concerning foreign (North 
Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese Nationalist, and U.S.) involvement through the 
1960s, and their relation to what the media were reporting, see A WWA, pp. 
203-36; and Noam Chomsky, For Reasons of State (New York: Pantheon, 1973;

distinction between the bombing of the civilian society of the North and the

system in terms of “defense of South Vietnam against North Vietnamese 
aggression”), see Noam Chomsky, Towards a New Cold War (New York: 
Pantheon, 1982), p. 402.

10. The report states that “until early this spring, when North Vietnamese 
troops began a series of advances in northeast Laos,” the war had been “lim¬ 
ited,” U.S. bombing had been aimed at “North Vietnamese supply routes” and 
“concentrations of enemy troops,” and “civilian population centers and farm¬ 
land were largely spared.” Extensive refugee reports were soon to show that 
this account was inaccurate, as Decornoy’s eyewitness reports had done fifteen 
months earlier.
