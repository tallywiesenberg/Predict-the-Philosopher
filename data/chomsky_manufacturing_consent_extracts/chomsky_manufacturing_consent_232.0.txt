6. A request to the (very cooperative) American embassy in Vientiane to obtain 
their documentation would have quickly revealed to reporters that the claims 
they were relaying on the basis of embassy briefings had little relation to the 
facts, as one of us discovered by carrying out the exercise in Vientiane in early 
1970. For a detailed review of the available facts concerning foreign (North 
Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese Nationalist, and U.S.) involvement through the 
1960s, and their relation to what the media were reporting, see A WWA, pp. 
203-36; and Noam Chomsky, For Reasons of State (New York: Pantheon, 1973;

away the suppression of the bombing of northern Laos by obscuring the crucial 
distinction between the bombing of the civilian society of the North and the 
bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail in the South (acceptable within the doctrinal 
system in terms of “defense of South Vietnam against North Vietnamese 
aggression”), see Noam Chomsky, Towards a New Cold War (New York: 
Pantheon, 1982), p. 402.

10. The report states that “until early this spring, when North Vietnamese 
troops began a series of advances in northeast Laos,” the war had been “lim¬ 
ited,” U.S. bombing had been aimed at “North Vietnamese supply routes” and 
“concentrations of enemy troops,” and “civilian population centers and farm¬ 
land were largely spared.” Extensive refugee reports were soon to show that 
this account was inaccurate, as Decornoy’s eyewitness reports had done fifteen 
months earlier.

14. One of the authors participated in a public meeting of media figures in 
New York, in 1986, at which a well-known television journalist defended 
media coverage of the bombing of northern Laos on the grounds that there 
was a report from a refugee camp in 1972. One wonders how much credit 
would be given to a journal that reported the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 
1945-
