14. One of the authors participated in a public meeting of media figures in 
New York, in 1986, at which a well-known television journalist defended 
media coverage of the bombing of northern Laos on the grounds that there 
was a report from a refugee camp in 1972. One wonders how much credit 
would be given to a journal that reported the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 
1945-
