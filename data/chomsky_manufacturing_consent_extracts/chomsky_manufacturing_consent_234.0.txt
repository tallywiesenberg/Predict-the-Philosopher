who “may have been executed,” and an estimate of deaths from all causes that 
is meaningless because of misjudgment of postwar population and politically 
motivated assessments throughout; the Far Eastern Economic Review reported 
a substantial increase in the population under DK to 8.2 million, “mostly based 
on CIA estimates” {Asia 1979 and Asia 1980 yearbooks of the FEER, the latter 
reducing the estimate from 8.2 to 4.2 million, the actual figure apparently being 
in the neighborhood of 6.5 million); in the U.S. government journal Problem* 
of Communism (May-June 1981), Australian Indochina specialist Carlyle 
Thayer suggests a figure of deaths from all causes at 500,000, of which 50,000 
to 60,000 were executions. At the high end, estimates range to three million 
or more, but without any available analysis. As all serious observers emphasize, 
the range of error is considerable at every point.

tion (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976), based on U.S. and international 
aid reports, cited by Vickery, Cambodia , p. 79; FEER correspondent Nayan 
Chanda in several articles, cited in PEHR, 1 . 6 , 229f.; Western doctor is Dr. 
Penelope Key, of the World Vision Organization, cited by Hildebrand and 
Porter, along with similar reports from Catholic Relief Services and Red Cross 
observers; Shawcross, Sideshow, pp. 37of. Hildebrand and Porter’s book, the 
only extensive study of the situation at the war’s end, was highly praised by 
Indochina scholar George Kahin but ignored in the media, or vilified. See 
PEHR, II.6, 232f., for a particular egregious example, by William Shawcross 
in the New York Review of Books. When PEHR, II.6 was circulating to Cam¬ 
bodia scholars and journalists in manuscript, we received a letter from Shaw¬ 
cross demanding that references to him be eliminated. We responded that we 
would be glad to consider any specific case that he found wrong or misleading 
and delayed publication of the book awaiting his response, which never ar¬ 
rived. On his public response, see below.
