79. In the only scholarly assessment, Vickery concludes that “very little of [the 
discussion in PEHR, II.6] requires revision in the light of new information 
available since it appeared.” He also comments on the “scurrilous,” “incompe¬ 
tent,” and “dishonest criticism of Chomsky and Herman which has character¬ 
ized media treatment of their work,” noting falsifications by William 
Shawcross, among others ( Cambodia , pp. 308, 310). 

80. Guenter Lewy, Commentary (November 1984), a typical example of a 
substantial literature. To our knowledge, Lewy, like other infuriated critics, 
did not condemn the Khmer Rouge in print as harshly, or as early, as we did. 
Recall that Lewy has experience with these matters, given his record as an 
apologist for war crimes, which reaches levels rarely seen. See chapter 5, notes 
33 , 86 .
