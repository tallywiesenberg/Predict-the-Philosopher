101. It is concocted from a series of phrases that appear in various places in 
the introduction to volume 1 of PEHR, pp. 19-20, with crucial omissions—not 
noted—that would at once demonstrate the absurdity of the argument he 
presents. 

102. Cited by Vickery, Cambodia, pp. s8f., in a discussion of Shawcross’s 
subsequent effort “to efface his earlier good judgment and claim to have been 
a purveyor of a sensationalist STV, when he clearly was not.” 

103. Shawcross may indeed have had other motives; see note 33. 

104. See author’s preface, American edition of Ponchaud’s Cambodia: Year 
Zero . On Ponchaud’s remarkable deception concerning this matter, see PEHR, 
11 . 6 , 2jSf. 

105. For a record based on further inquiry, see PEHR, II.6, 253-84. 

106. See note 79 above. 

107. To be precise, we have found one suggestion, although well after the 
event. In The Times Higher Education Supplement, December 6, 1981, along 
with a series of falsifications of our position of the sort discussed here, Shaw¬ 
cross states that given our “political influence,” we could have played an 
important part in mobilizing world opinion to bring pressure on China to call 
off Khmer Rouge atrocities—as he was no doubt desperately trying to do, but 
failing, because of his lack of outreach comparable to ours. Comment should 
be superfluous. Evidently the editors of the journal so believed, refusing 
publication of a response, despite our awesome “political influence.” It seems 
doubtful that Shawcross would have published such childish absurdities had 
he not been assured that no response would be permitted.

no. See his essay in Chandler and Kiernan, Revolution and Its Aftermath, his 
only attempt to provide evidence for his widely heralded claims,

“Marxist-Leninist”—whatever that is supposed to mean, exactly—see Vick¬ 
ery, Cambodia.
