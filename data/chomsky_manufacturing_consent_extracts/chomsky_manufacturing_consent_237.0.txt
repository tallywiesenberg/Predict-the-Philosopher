101. It is concocted from a series of phrases that appear in various places in 
the introduction to volume 1 of PEHR, pp. 19-20, with crucial omissions—not 
noted—that would at once demonstrate the absurdity of the argument he 
presents. 

102. Cited by Vickery, Cambodia, pp. s8f., in a discussion of Shawcross’s 
subsequent effort “to efface his earlier good judgment and claim to have been 
a purveyor of a sensationalist STV, when he clearly was not.” 

103. Shawcross may indeed have had other motives; see note 33. 

104. See author’s preface, American edition of Ponchaud’s Cambodia: Year 
Zero . On Ponchaud’s remarkable deception concerning this matter, see PEHR, 
11 . 6 , 2jSf. 

105. For a record based on further inquiry, see PEHR, II.6, 253-84. 

106. See note 79 above. 

107. To be precise, we have found one suggestion, although well after the 
event. In The Times Higher Education Supplement, December 6, 1981, along 
with a series of falsifications of our position of the sort discussed here, Shaw¬ 
cross states that given our “political influence,” we could have played an 
important part in mobilizing world opinion to bring pressure on China to call 
off Khmer Rouge atrocities—as he was no doubt desperately trying to do, but 
failing, because of his lack of outreach comparable to ours. Comment should 
be superfluous. Evidently the editors of the journal so believed, refusing 
publication of a response, despite our awesome “political influence.” It seems 
doubtful that Shawcross would have published such childish absurdities had 
he not been assured that no response would be permitted.

no. See his essay in Chandler and Kiernan, Revolution and Its Aftermath, his 
only attempt to provide evidence for his widely heralded claims, 
in. New Statesman, November 2,1984. On the question of whether DK was 
“Marxist-Leninist”—whatever that is supposed to mean, exactly—see Vick¬ 
ery, Cambodia.

emphasize that the correctness of his accusation is not at issue here, but, 
rather, the evidence he uses to support it.

United States bore primary responsibility were suppressed (and still largely 
are), with shameful apologetics when the facts could no longer be denied. 


Chapter 7: Conclusions 

1. Lewis, “Freedom of the Press—Anthony Lewis Distinguishes Between Brit¬ 
ain and America,” London Review of Books, November 26, 1987. Lewis is 
presenting his interpretation of the views of James Madison and Justice Bren¬ 
nan (in the case of The New York Times v. Sullivan that Lewis describes as 
the “greatest legal victory [of the press] in modern times”), with his endorse¬ 
ment. 

2. See, among others, N. Blackstock, ed., COINTELPRO (New York: Vin¬ 
tage, 1976); Frank J. Donner, The Age of Surveillance: The Aims and Methods 
of America’s Political Intelligence System (New York: Knopf, 1980); Robert J. 
Goldstein, Political Repression in America (Cambridge: Schenkman, 1978); 
Morton H. Halperin et al., The Lawless State (New York: Penguin, 1976); 
Christy Macy and Susan Kaplan, eds., Documents (New York: Penguin, 1980). 

3. The diffused-cost cases would include the multi-billion-dollar outlays borne 
by the taxpayers for CIA covert operations and the subsidization of client 
regimes, the overhead costs of empire and the arms race, the enormous ripoffs 
by the military-industrial complex in providing unneeded weapons at inflated 
prices, and the payoffs to campaign contributors in the form of favorable tax 
legislation and other benefits (e.g., the huge tax bonanzas given business 
following Reagan’s election in 1981, and the increase in milk prices given by 
Nixon in 1971 immediately after substantial gifts were given by the milk lobby 
to the Republican party). 

4. In fact, the scandals and illegalities detailed by the Tower Commission and 
congressional inquiries were largely known long before these establishment 
“revelations,” but were suppressible; see Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Ter¬ 
rorism (Boston: South End Press, 1988).
