some of our comments in the article in question, see p. 290, above.

115. Ibid., pp. 358-59; New York Review of Books, September 27, 1984. We 
emphasize that the correctness of his accusation is not at issue here, but, 
rather, the evidence he uses to support it.

117. And, significantly, comparable and ongoing atrocities for which the 
United States bore primary responsibility were suppressed (and still largely 
are), with shameful apologetics when the facts could no longer be denied. 


Chapter 7: Conclusions 

1. Lewis, “Freedom of the Press—Anthony Lewis Distinguishes Between Brit¬ 
ain and America,” London Review of Books, November 26, 1987. Lewis is 
presenting his interpretation of the views of James Madison and Justice Bren¬ 
nan (in the case of The New York Times v. Sullivan that Lewis describes as 
the “greatest legal victory [of the press] in modern times”), with his endorse¬ 
ment. 

2. See, among others, N. Blackstock, ed., COINTELPRO (New York: Vin¬ 
tage, 1976); Frank J. Donner, The Age of Surveillance: The Aims and Methods 
of America’s Political Intelligence System (New York: Knopf, 1980); Robert J. 
Goldstein, Political Repression in America (Cambridge: Schenkman, 1978); 
Morton H. Halperin et al., The Lawless State (New York: Penguin, 1976); 
Christy Macy and Susan Kaplan, eds., Documents (New York: Penguin, 1980). 

3. The diffused-cost cases would include the multi-billion-dollar outlays borne 
by the taxpayers for CIA covert operations and the subsidization of client 
regimes, the overhead costs of empire and the arms race, the enormous ripoffs 
by the military-industrial complex in providing unneeded weapons at inflated 
prices, and the payoffs to campaign contributors in the form of favorable tax 
legislation and other benefits (e.g., the huge tax bonanzas given business 
following Reagan’s election in 1981, and the increase in milk prices given by 
Nixon in 1971 immediately after substantial gifts were given by the milk lobby 
to the Republican party). 

4. In fact, the scandals and illegalities detailed by the Tower Commission and 
congressional inquiries were largely known long before these establishment 
“revelations,” but were suppressible; see Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Ter¬ 
rorism (Boston: South End Press, 1988).
