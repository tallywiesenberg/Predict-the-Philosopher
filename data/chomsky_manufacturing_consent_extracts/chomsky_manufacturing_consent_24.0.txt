Sterling and Henze, and to a lesser extent Michael Ledeen, dominated 
perceptions of the Bulgarian Connection in the U.S. mass media to a 
remarkable degree.Moreover, they affected the course of events in 
Italy, as their version of Bulgarian guilt was aired in the Italian media 
before Agca named the Bulgarians and may have influenced Martella 
as well, 27 Sterling and Henze dominated media coverage by virtue of 
the very wide distribution of their articles and books on the case* and

by their extensive and uncritical use as experts by the elite press* news 
magazines* and television news and talk shows, 28 Sterling* in addition 
to her Reader** Digest article, had three substantial pieces in the Wall 
Street Journal and several articles in the New York Times* Her views 
were given repeated airing on CBS News, without rebuttal, Henze 
accounted for twelve of the fourteen articles on the Bulgarian Connec¬ 
tion case in the Christian Science Monitor between September 1982 and 
May 1985, and his articles were used widely elsewhere.The only opin¬ 
ion piece on the Bulgarian Connection that appeared in the 
Philadelphia Inquirer during that same period was by Michael Ledeen.Sterling* Henze* and Ledeen together accounted for 76 percent of the 
time in three shows on the subject on the “McNeil-Lehrer News 
Hour.” No tough questions were asked of them on these shows, and no 
dissident voices were heard* perhaps because Sterling and Henze 
refused to appear on television shows (or in college debates) with 
people who opposed their views* and Henze insisted on approving in 
advance any questions to be asked.
