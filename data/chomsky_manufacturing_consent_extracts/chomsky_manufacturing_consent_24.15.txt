We discussed earlier Sterling’s dismis¬ 
sal of Agca’s commitment to Turkes and her handling of Agca’s gun, 
and similar cases could be cited in large number.31 Sterling’s Terror 
Network is notable for its gullibility in accepting at face value claims 
fed her by Israeli, South African, and Argentinian secret police, and, 
most notably, the Czech Stalinist defector, Jan Sejna, 32 whose evi¬ 
dence for a Soviet terror network came from a document forged by 
the CIA to test Sejna's integrity!33 A remarkable feature of Sterling’s 
Time of the Assassins and other writings on the Bulgarian Connection 
is her reiterated belief that the Reagan administration and CIA 
dragged their feet in pursuing the Red plot because of their interest in 
detente* 34 And despite her phenomenal sales and uncritical reception 
in the U.S. media.Sterling bemoaned the “accepted position, the so¬ 
cially indispensable position * * * if you care to move in certain circles 
and if you care to be accepted at your job professionally” in the West, 
of doubting the Bulgarian Connection, which she attributed to the 
success of the KGB in pushing a forty-page booklet on the plot by 
Soviet journalist Iona Andronov.35 

These evidences of charlatanry did not impair Sterling's credibility 
with the U.S. mass media—in fact, the New York Times allowed her 
front-page space and a regular role as a reporter of news on the Bul¬ 
garian connection.
