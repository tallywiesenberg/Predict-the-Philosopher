By doing this, the Times guaranteed that editorial 
policy would control the news fit to print.This was displayed fully in 
Sterling’s front-page news story of prosecutor Albano’s report on June 
10,1984* The most important new information in that report—that on 
June 28, 1983, Agca had retracted a substantial part of his evidence 
against the Bulgarians—was omitted from Sterling’s story, although she 
coyly suggested that some undescribed points had been retracted that 
were already “corroborated.” This was seriously misleading.Agca's 
having visited Antonov's apartment and met with his family was never 
corroborated, and the details he gave on these matters had previously 
been cited by Sterling and Henze as crucial corroboration of his general 
claims.His retraction thus led to the important question of how Agca 
had learned details about Antonov’s apartment without having been 
there.This issue was never seriously addressed in the New York 
Times.
