Paul Henze was a longtime CIA official who had been head of the 
CIA station in Turkey and a specialist in propaganda.Former Turkish 
head of state Bulent Ecevit even accused Henze of helping destabilize 
Turkey during his term of operations there.37 Henze never refers in his 
“news” articles to his active participation in Turkish affairs as a CIA 
official.His writings are notable for their consistent apologetics for 
military rule in Turkey, for their dishonesty, 38 and for the fact that 
Henze openly disdains the use of rules of evidence in proving Soviet 
villainy.39

media believe Qaddafi more readily than the U.S. government, and 
focus more heavily on the victims of state terror in U.S. client states 
(Indonesia in East Timor, and Guatemala?)
