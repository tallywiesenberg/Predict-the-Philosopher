than in enemy and radical 
states (Cambodia and Poland?).Again, such absurdities do not reduce 
Ledeen's access to the mass media as an expert on the Bulgarian Con¬ 
nection, or on anything else.40 

The mass media not only allowed these disinformation sources to 
prevail, they protected them against disclosures that would reveal their 
dubious credentials.That Henze was a longtime CIA official was almost 
never mentioned in the press (never, to our knowledge, on television), 
and his consistent apologetics for the Turkish military regime and 
frequent lies were never disclosed.In Sterling's case, her numerous 
errors of fact, foolish arguments, and wilder political opinions were not 
disclosed to readers of the New York Times, Time, or Newsweek, or 
watchers of CBS News or the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour,” and even 
“newsworthy” matters bearing on her qualifications were ignored.
