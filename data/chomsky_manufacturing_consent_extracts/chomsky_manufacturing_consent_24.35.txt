For 
example.Sterling's numerous attacks on the murdered French activist- 
radical Henry Curiel resulted in suits for slander brought against her 
in Paris.The New York Times has never mentioned these slander suits, 
which would put Sterling in a bad light not only because she lost them 
in whole or part, but also because of the insight they provide concerning 
her sources and methods.Sterling had gotten much of her information 
from a French journalist, George Suffert, who was a conduit for French 
and South African intelligence, and who had obligingly placed the 
African National Congress at the top of his list of “terrorist” organiza¬ 
tions.In her Terror Network, Sterling strongly intimates that Curiel was 
a KGB agent, but the French court, on the basis of documents provided 
by French intelligence, found no support for this claim.
