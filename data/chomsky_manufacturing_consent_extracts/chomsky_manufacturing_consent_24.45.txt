The Italian Fascist and head 
of P-2* Licio Gelli, hiding in Uruguay* instructed one of his accom¬ 
plices to convey a manuscript to Ledeen.Pazienza claimed (and SISMI 
head Santovito confirmed) that Ledeen was a member of the Italian 
intelligence agency SISMI, with code number Z-3.Ledeen received 
over $100,000 from SISMI for services rendered* including the supply¬ 
ing of stale U.S. intelligence reports that SISMI then passed off as its 
own.Ledeen funneled this money into a Bermuda bank account.His 
manipulative activities in Italy were on such a scale that in the summer 
of 1984 a newly appointed head of SISMI told the Italian parliament 
that Ledeen was a “meddler” and persona non grata in Italy.
