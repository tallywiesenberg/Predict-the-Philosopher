4.6.THE PROPAGANDA 
AGENDA: QUESTIONS 
UNASKED, SOURCES UNTAPPED 

There is a close linkage among sources used, frames of reference, and 
agendas of the newsworthy.When the mass media chose to use Sterling, 
Henze* and Ledeen heavily, they simultaneously adopted a frame of 
reference in which the Bulgarians and Soviets were presumed guilty, 
Agca was an apolitical mercenary* and justice was being promoted by 
diligent Judge Martella in free-world Italy.In the propaganda cam¬ 
paign that ensued, hard questions about the quality of the SHK model 
were simply not asked, and alternative sources and frames were ig¬ 
nored, 

A distinction between matters on and off the agenda, such as we used 
in the previous chapter, is once again applicable and illuminating, “On 
the agenda” are statements by Agca and Martella about Agca’s latest

claims and proofs of Bulgarian involvement, Brzezinski’s opinion on 
whether the Bulgarians are likely to have engaged in such an escapade 
(they were), or Judy Woodruffs question to Paul Henze as to whether 
the Soviets "‘would have any notion, any desire to try this again” (they 
do this kind of thing all the time—just got a little careless here because 
“they had got away with so much in Italy”).44 As in the Third World 
election cases described in chapter 3, the media prefer to focus on 
superficial detail about the participants and opinions within a narrow 
range of establishment views (plus bluff denials by Bulgarian and Soviet 
officials), along with each development supporting the accepted case (a 
defector’s accusations, a further Agca confession, an investigator’s or 
prosecutor’s report, and leaks of alleged claims or expected new devel¬ 
opments), whatever its credibility, 

“Off the agenda” are arguments and facts that would call into ques¬ 
tion the validity of the basic SHK model, and those relating to the 
“alternative model” (which starts with the question of why Agca con¬ 
fessed so late and the likelihood that he was encouraged and pressed 
to talk).
