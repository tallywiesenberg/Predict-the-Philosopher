66. First use of chemicals is contrary to the Geneva Protocol of 1925, and 
food crop destruction violates numerous international rules of war. The latter 
was even illegal according to the rules laid out in the U.S. Army’s own field 
manual in use during the Vietnam wan See Edward Herman, Atrocities in 
Vietnam (Philadelphia: Pilgrim Press, 1970), pp. 81-S3.

indigenous Kurds in the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush administrations made 
no protests and continued to treat him as a valued ally. It was only after he 
invaded Kuwait in 1990 that he became a menace and his possession of 
“weapons of mass destruction” was deemed intolerable. See citations in note 
29 above.
