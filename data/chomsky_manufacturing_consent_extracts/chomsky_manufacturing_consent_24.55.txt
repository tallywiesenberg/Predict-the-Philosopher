We will run through only a few of the important questions and 
points of evidence that the mass media put off the agenda.The basic SHK model rested its case on the Soviet motive, Agca’s 
stay in Sofia, and the high professionalism of the Soviet and Bulgarian 
secret police, which made it likely that they were manipulating Agca if 
he stopped off in Bulgaria.Only the ABC “20/20” program of May 12, 
1983, explored the Soviet motive in any depth, despite the constant 
mass-media reiteration of the SHK line.ABC went to the trouble of 
asking the Vatican about the validity of Marvin Kalb’s claim that the 
pope had written a note threatening to resign and to return to Poland 
to lead the resistance to any Soviet invasion.Cardinal John Krol, 
speaking for the Vatican, said that “Not only was there not such a letter, 
but such a letter directly from the Pope to Brezhnev would have been 
a total departure from all normal procedures.
