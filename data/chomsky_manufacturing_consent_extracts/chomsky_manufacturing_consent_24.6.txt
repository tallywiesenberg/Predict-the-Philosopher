In no way could you 
conceive of the Holy Father saying, ‘I would resign.1 ” ABC’s informa¬ 
tion from the Vatican too was that the pope’s spoken message to Brezh¬ 
nev was conciliatory.This spectacular repudiation of an important 
element in the SHK case was unreported in the rest of the media, and 
simply died with the ABC broadcast.And any balancing of supposed 
gains against the costs and risks to the Soviet Union in sponsoring Agca 
was simply not undertaken in the mass media.None of them stopped to evaluate Agca’s 1979 letter threatening to 
kill the pope on his earlier visit to Turkey.
