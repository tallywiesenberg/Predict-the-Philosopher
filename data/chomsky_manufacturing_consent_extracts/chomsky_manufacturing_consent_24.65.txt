relation to NATO was never discussed* The question of the authentic¬ 
ity of Agca's letter to Turkes, which bears on Agca's political commit¬ 
ments (and thus another SHK premise), was never discussed in the U.S. 
mass media.During the trial, Abdullah Catli's statement that Bulgaria 
was a preferred Gray Wolves route to Europe because of the relative 
ease of hiding in the heavy Turkish traffic—which directly contradicts 
the SHK claim that the Bulgarian secret police know everything, and 
that Agca's stay in Sofia must therefore have been by Bulgarian official 
plan—was never picked up in the U.S. mass media's coverage of the 
Rome trial.The most striking deficiencies of the mass media's handling of the 
basic SHK claims, however, was their remarkable naivete in the face 
of the pseudoscientific speculations of SHK and the accumulating vio¬ 
lations of elementary principles of plausible deniability.The preposter¬ 
ous SHK claims—without a vestige of evidence—that Agca had been 
recruited by the KGB in Turkey for future work, and that he took on 
the appearance of a right-winger as a “cover," were not ridiculed, and 
were not evaluated when presented as purported truth.45 There was 
never any discussion in the mass media of the fact that the thesis of 
prior recruitment and careful cultivation of Agca's cover in Turkey was 
flatly inconsistent with the claim that he was brought to Sofia for a 
lengthy stay for instructions.
