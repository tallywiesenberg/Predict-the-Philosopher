With regard to Agca's alleged open deal¬ 
ings with Bulgarians in Rome, the mass media simply refused to discuss 
the fact that the alleged professionalism and use of the right-wing Turk 
as a “cover” had disappeared.As regards the alternative model, and the likelihood that Agca had 
been encouraged and coached, here also the mass media refused to 
explore these dissonant possibilities.They simply would not examine 
and discuss the convenience of the newly discovered plot for so many 
Western interests; the huge time Jag in the naming of Bulgarians; Agca's 
prison conditions and prison contacts; reports of meetings, offers, and 
threats to Agca to induce him to talk; and the compromised character 
of the Italian police and intelligence agencies.This involved the media 
in the suppression of important documents.As one important instance, the July 12, 1984, Italian Report of the 
Parliamentary Commission on the Masonic Lodge P -2 describes in great 
detail the penetration of this massive neo-Fascist conspiracy into the 
military establishment, secret services, press, and judiciary, among oth¬ 
ers.
