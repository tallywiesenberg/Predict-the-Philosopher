This report was newsworthy in its own right, but it also had a 
bearing on the Bulgarian Connection case, as it addressed characteris¬ 
tics of Italian institutions that were directly involved in making and 



164 manufacturing consent 


prosecuting the case against the Bulgarians, The New York Times, Time , 
Newsweek, and CBS Evening News never mentioned the publication of 
this report.As a second major illustration, one year later, in July 1985, the Crimi¬ 
nal Court of Rome handed down a Judgment in the Matter of Francesco 
Pazienza et ah , which described repeated corrupt behavior by officials 
of the Italian secret-service agency SISMI, including the forgery and 
planting of documents.These officials were also charged with involve¬ 
ment in a cover-up of the agents carrying out the 1980 Bologna railway- 
station massacre, the kind of terrorist connection that attracts frenetic 
mass-media attention when attributable to suitable villains.As we noted 
earlier, SISMI officials had visited Agca in prison and SISMI had 
issued a forged document implicating the Soviet Union in the shooting 
of the pope on May 19, 1981, only six days after the assassination 
attempt.This forgery was never mentioned in the TimeSy Time, and 
Newsweek, or on CBS News, and the July 1985 court decision was barely 
mentioned in a back-page article of the Times.
