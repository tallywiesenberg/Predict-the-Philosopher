These blackouts are of materials that suggest a corrupt Italian pro¬ 
cess and the possibility that Agca was persuaded and coached to pin the 
plot on the East A propaganda system exploiting the alleged Bulgarian 
Connection will naturally avoid such documents.Agca’s extremely loose prison conditions and the numerous claims 
in the Italian and dissident U.S, press of visits by Italian intelligence 
personnel were also virtually unmentioned by the U.S. mass media 
throughout 1982 and 1983.In June 1983, Diana Johnstone, the foreign 
editor of the newspaper In These Times submitted on Op-Ed column 
to the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer that summarized 
the evidence and claims of intelligence-agency visits, the reported 
threats to Agca that his open and pleasant prison conditions might be 
terminated if he remained uncooperative, and Martella’s proposed deal 
with Agca, This Op-Ed offering was rejected, and no commentary or 
news along these lines was permitted to surface in the Times or the 
Philadelphia Inquirer —or elsewhere, to our knowledge.Several years 
later, in an article in the New York Times of June 17,1985, referring to 
Pandico’s detailed description of how Agca was coached in prison, John 
Tagliabue describes Agca’s prison as “notoriously porous,” But the 
Times had never mentioned this notorious fact before, or considered it 
in any way relevant to the case.When Agca identified the Bulgarians in November 1982, the integrity 
of the Italian investigative-judicial process in pursuing the case was 
already badly compromised for a wide variety of reasons, 46 but the U.S. 
mass media weren’t interested.
