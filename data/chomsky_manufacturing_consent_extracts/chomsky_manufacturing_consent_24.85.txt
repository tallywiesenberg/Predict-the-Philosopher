circumstances of the famous Antonov photo, widely circulated in the 
Western press, which shows Antonov very clearly and in a remarkable 
likeness watching the scene at St, Peter’s Square on May 13,1981, This 
photo, Martella eventually claimed, was not of Antonov but an Ameri¬ 
can tourist.But this tourist, who apparently looked exactly like An¬ 
tonov, has never been located, and the film from which this shot was 
taken has unaccountably disappeared, 47 Agca’s alterations in his claims 
about the Bulgarians, with Martella generously allowing him to change 
his recollections about the timing of events on May 13 whenever Bul¬ 
garian counter-evidence was too strong, failed to attract the media’s 
attention, 48 Agca’s June 28, 1983, retraction of his claim that he had 
visited Antonov’s apartment and met his family was not mentioned in 
the mass media until a full year after the event, and even then suggested 
to the press no very serious problems with the case or with Martella’s 
investigative work.4 * How could Agca know details about Antonov’s 
apartment if he had never been there?An honest press would have 
pursued this relentlessly.The New York Times, with Sterling as its 
reporter, suppressed the issue.
