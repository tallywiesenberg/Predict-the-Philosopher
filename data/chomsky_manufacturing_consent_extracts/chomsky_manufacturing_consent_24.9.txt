50 The rest of the press simply wasn’t 
interested.The media also weren’t interested in Or sen Oy men’s finding that the 
Vatican had gone to some pains to try to implicate the Bulgarians, or 
the trial disclosure that the West German authorities had tried to bribe 
Gray Wolves member Oral Celik to come to West Germany and con¬ 
firm Agca’s claims, Pandico’s and Pazienza’s insider claims of Mafia and 
SISMI involvement in getting Agca to talk were also given only the 
slightest attention, and this accumulating mass of materials on the 
Italian process was never brought together for a reassessment.Perhaps the most blatant case of willful ignorance concerned the 
Italian fixer and former member of SISMI, Francesco Pazienza.Wanted for several crimes, Pazienza had fled Italy, and in 1985 he 
resided in exile in New York City, Eventually he was seized and held 
there by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Pazienza had 
been a partner of Michael Ledeen in the “Billygate” affair in Italy, and 
retained his connection after Ledeen became General Haig’s right- 
hand man in Italy in the early days of the Reagan presidency, Pazienza 
had also been a close associate of SISMI head Giuseppe Santovito.
