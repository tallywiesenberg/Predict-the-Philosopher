ences of chapter 5, note 119; also Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman, 
Political Economy of Human Rights (Boston: South End Press, 1979), I, 5.2.3.

3. As revealed, no doubt, by his book Viet Cong (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT 
Press, 1969), where he contrasts our side, which sympathizes with “the usual 
revolutionary stirrings... around the world,” with the backers of revolutionary 
guerrilla warfare, which “opposes the aspirations of people while apparently 
furthering them,” and expresses his contempt for the “gullible, misled people” 
who were “turning the countryside into a bedlam, toppling one Saigon govern¬ 
ment after another, confounding the Americans,” etc. The fact that Pike was 
an employee of the U.S. government and an “admirer” and avid defender of 
its policies does not suggest to Braestrup that he might be something other than 
“independent-minded”; only Porter’s alleged political preference is relevant to 
“Freedom House objectivity.” 

4. Big Story, I, xxviii; the same is true of Don Oberdorfer’s Tet! (New York: 
Doubleday, 1971) and Stanley Karnow’s Vietnam: A History (New York: 
Viking, 1983), among others.

6. Recall that “whatever losses the DRV/VC forces did suffer in the initial 
assaults were largely offset by the unimpeded recruiting that they conducted 
in the rural areas in the weeks that followed” (Wallace J. Thies, When Govern¬ 
ments Collide: Coercion and Diplomacy in the Vietnam Conflict, 1964-1968 
[Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980], p. 201); see p. 215, above, and 
General Wheeler’s comments, cited above, p. 225.
