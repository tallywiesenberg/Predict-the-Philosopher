INTRODUCTION lv 


80. Both Time and Newsweek, in their twenty-fifth-anniversary retrospectives 
on the war, featured the exit at war’s end and the “desperate South Viet¬ 
namese” seeking escape from “the invading North Vietnamese.” Douglas 
Brinkley, “Of Ladders and Letters,” Time, April 24, 2000; also, Evan 
Thomas, “The Last Days of Saigon,” Newsweek, May 1, 2000- A 1995 Wash¬ 
ington Post editorial speaks of the Vietnam war as a “defeat to the Vietnamese. 
They bled, died and finally fled in great numbers from a Communist regime. 
...” (April 30, 1995), characteristically not allowing the vast majority of peo¬ 
ple in South Vietnam to be “South Vietnamese.”

Decade of the Genocide (London: Zed, 1984). It included the years 1970-74, 
when the United States was heavily bombing the Cambodian countryside, as 
part of the decade of genocide. This study was ignored in the U.S. main¬ 
stream media.
