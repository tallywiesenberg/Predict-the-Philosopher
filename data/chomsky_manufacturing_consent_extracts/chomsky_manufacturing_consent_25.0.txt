The trial in Rome was awkward for the Western media, as Agca 
quickly declared himself to be Jesus and, more important, failed to 
produce any supportive evidence backing up his claims of Bulgarian 
involvement.The diligent and extensive court investigation found nu¬ 
merous Gray Wolves links to Agca in the period just up to his assassina¬ 
tion attempt, but no witness to his (allegedly) numerous meetings with 
Bulgarians in Rome, no money, no car, and, in the end, no conviction.As we have pointed out, in addition to the already available evidence 
of atrocious prison practice in dealing with Agca, and the 1981 meetings 
with intelligence officials and Martella’s offer, there was a steady ac¬ 
cumulation of claims and evidence of pressures on Agca to implicate 
the Bulgarians.But, despite this evidence and the failure to convict the 
Bulgarians after a lengthy investigation and trial, the mass media of the 
West never provided any serious reevaluations of the case.Almost 
uniformly they hid behind the fact that an Italian court dismissed the 
case for lack of evidence rather than demonstrated innocence.
