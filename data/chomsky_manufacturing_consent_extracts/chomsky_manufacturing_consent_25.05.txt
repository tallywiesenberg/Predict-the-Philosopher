They 
never hinted at the possibility that an Italian court and jury might still 
be biased against the Eastern bloc and protective of the powerful 
Western interests that had supported the Bulgarian Connection so 
energetically.The mass media also never looked back at their own earlier claims 
and those of the disinformationists to see how they had stood up to the 
test of accumulated evidence.On January 3,1983, Newsweek had quoted 
an Italian official who said that “we have substantial evidence ... [that] 
Agca operated in close contact with the Bulgarians," and the New York 
Times editorialized on October 20,1984, that “Agca’s accounts of meet¬ 
ings with Bulgarian officials are verifiable in important details."If there 
was “substantial evidence” and “verifiable” details long before the trial, 
why was this evidence not produced in the courtroom?Why, after an 
enormous further investigative effort was there still not enough evi¬ 
dence to sustain a conviction?
