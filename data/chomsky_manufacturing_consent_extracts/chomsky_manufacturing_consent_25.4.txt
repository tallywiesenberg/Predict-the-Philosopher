* had been chastened by 
the failure of America to work its will in Indochina.” 12 But no conflict 
can be perceived between “wishful idealism” and the commitment to 
“work our will” in foreign lands* a comment that holds of “the culture” 
more broadly.As for direct reporting, the major charge of the influential Freedom 
House study of the Tet offensive* echoed by others who condemn the 
media for their overly “adversarial” stance, is that reporting was too 
“pessimistic.” We return to the facts, but consideration of the logic of 
the charge shows that even if accurate, it would be quite consistent with 
a propaganda model.There was, no doubt, increased pessimism within 
the German general staff after Stalingrad.Similarly, Soviet elites 
openly expressed concern over the wisdom of “the defense of Afghanis¬ 
tan” and its costs, and some might have been “overly pessimistic” about 
the likelihood of success in this endeavor.But in neither case do we 
interpret these reactions as a departure from service to the national 
cause as defined by the state authorities.
