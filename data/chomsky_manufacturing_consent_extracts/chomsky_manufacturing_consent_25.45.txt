The Freedom House charge 
tacitly but clearly presupposes that the media must not only accept the 
framework of government propaganda, but must be upbeat and enthu¬ 
siastic about the prospects for success in a cause that is assumed with¬ 
out discussion to be honorable and just.This basic assumption endures throughout, and provides the basic 
framework for discussion and news reports.The harshest critics within 
the mainstream media, as well as what Corry calls “the culture,” held 
that the war began with “blundering efforts to do good,” although “by 
1969” (that is, a year after corporate America had largely concluded that 
this enterprise should be liquidated) it had become “clear to most of 
the world—and most Americans—that the intervention had been a 
disastrous mistake,” and that it was a “delusion” to attempt to build “a 
nation on the American model in South Vietnam”; the argument against 
the war “was that the United States had misunderstood the cultural and 
political forces at work in Indochina—that it was in a position where 
it could not impose a solution except at a price too costly to itself’ 
(Anthony Lewis).13 Stanley Karnow’s highly praised companion vol¬ 
ume to the PBS television series describes the American war as “a failed 
crusade” undertaken for aims that were “noble” although “illusory” 
and “motivated by the loftiest intentions”: specifically, the commitment 
“to defend South Vietnam’s independence.” 14 

Within “the culture,” it would be difficult to find harsher critics of 
U.S. Asia policy than John King Fairbank, the dean of American China

scholarship, or Harvard government professor Stanley Hoffmann, or 
Dissent editor Irving Howe, In his presidential address to the American 
Historical Association in December 1968, Fairbank characterized the 
U.S* involvement, which he termed a “disaster,” as the result of “an 
excess of righteousness and disinterested benevolence,” an “error” 
based on misunderstanding* Howe explained that “we opposed the war 
because we believed, as Stanley Hoffman [sic] has written, that "Wash¬ 
ington could “save” the people of South Vietnam and Cambodia from 
Communism only at a cost that made a mockery of the word “save*” 5 ” 
Hoffmann explains later that our efforts in “supporting the South Viet¬ 
namese” were “undermined” by the way the war was fought, while the 
means adopted to “deter the North Vietnamese from further infiltra¬ 
tion” were “never sufficient”; and sufficient means, “had the United 
States been willing to commit them, would have created for the United 
States real external dangers with potential adversaries and in relations 
with allies.” Again, we find not the slightest recognition that the familiar 
pieties of state propaganda might be subject to some question* 15 
In its 1985 tenth-anniversary retrospective on the Vietnam war.For¬ 
eign Affairs presents both the hawk and the dove positions* Represent¬ 
ing the more dovish view, David Fromkin and James Chace assert 
without argument that “the American decision to intervene in Indo¬ 
china was predicated on the view that the United States has a duty to 
look beyond its purely national interests,” and that, pursuant to its 
“global responsibilities,” the United States must “serve the interests of 
mankind.” “As a moral matter we were right to choose the lesser of two 
evils” and to oppose “communist aggression” by the Vietnamese in 
Vietnam, but on the “practical side” it was “wrong” because “our side 
was likely to lose.” The moral imperatives of our service “to the inter¬ 
ests of mankind” do not, however, require that we intervene to over¬ 
throw governments that are slaughtering their own populations, such 
as the Indonesian government we supported in 1965, or our Guatemalan 
and Salvadoran clients of the 1980s.
