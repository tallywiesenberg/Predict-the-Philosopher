On the contrary, they observe, the 
success of our Indonesian allies in destroying the domestic political 
opposition by violence in 1965 was a respectable achievement that 
should have led us to reconsider our Vietnam policy* They cite Lyndon 
Johnson's national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy, who feels in 
retrospect that “our effort” in Vietnam was “excessive” after 1965, 
when “a new anti-communist government took power in Indonesia and 
destroyed the communist party [the only mass-based political party] in 
that country .* incidentally slaughtering several hundred thousand 
people, mostly landless peasants, and thus “securing” Indonesia in

accord with our “global responsibilities” and “serving the interests of 
mankind,” 16 

Fromkin and Chace define “opponents of the war”—meaning, pre¬ 
sumably, critics whose views merit serious consideration—as those who 
“did not believe that ‘whipping’ the enemy [North Vietnam] was 
enough, so long as the enemy refused to submit or surrender,” The 
media, they say, “brought home to the American people how little 
effective control over the population had been purchased by all of 
General Westmoreland’s victories,” thus strengthening the “opponents 
of the war,” dissatisfied by our inability to gain “effective control over 
the population,” “The media cannot be blamed for pointing out the 
problem, and if General Westmoreland knew the answer to it, perhaps 
he should have revealed it to the public,” 

Outside of those committed to “the cause,” although possibly skepti¬ 
cal about its feasibility or the means employed, there are only those 
whom McGeorge Bundy once described as “wild men in the wings,” 
referring to people who dared to question the decisions of the “first 
team” that was determining U.S. policy in Vietnam, 17 

Quite generally, insofar as the debate over the war could reach the 
mainstream during the war or since, it was bounded on the one side by 
the “hawks,” who felt that with sufficient dedication the United States 
could succeed in “defending South Vietnam,” “controlling the popula¬ 
tion,” and thus establishing “American-style democracy” there, 10 and 
on the other side by the “doves,” who doubted that success could be 
achieved in these noble aims at reasonable cost 19 —later, there arrived 
the “owls,” who observed the proceedings judiciously without suc¬ 
cumbing to the illusions of either extreme of this wrenching contro¬ 
versy.Reporting and interpretation of the facts were framed in 
accordance with these principles.5.2.“THE WILD MEN IN THE 
WINGS“ 

As the elite consensus eroded in the late 1960s, criticism of the “noble 
cause” on grounds of its lack of success became more acceptable, and 
the category of “wild men in the wings” narrowed to those who opposed 
the war on grounds of principle—the same grounds on which they 
opposed the Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and, later, 
Afghanistan* Let us consider how superpower intervention would be
