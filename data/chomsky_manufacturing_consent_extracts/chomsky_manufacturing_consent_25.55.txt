In the case of Soviet intervention, there is no serious controversy.True, the Soviet Union has security concerns in Eastern Europe, in¬ 
cluding states that collaborated with the Nazis in an attack on the 
Soviet Union that practically destroyed it a generation ago and now 
serve as a buffer to a rearmed West Germany that is part of a hostile 
and threatening military alliance.True, Afghanistan borders areas of 
the Soviet Union where the population could be inflamed by a radical 
Islamic fundamentalist revival, and the rebels, openly supported by 
bitter enemies of the Soviet Union, are undoubtedly terrorists commit¬ 
ted to harsh oppression and religious fanaticism who carry out violent 
acts inside the Soviet Union itself and have been attacking Afghanistan 
from Pakistani bases since 1973, six years before the Soviet invasion.20 
But none of these complexities bear on the fact that the Soviet Union 
invaded Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Afghanistan, holds Poland in a 
firm grip, etc.True, the Russians were invited into Afghanistan in 1979, 
but as the London Economist accurately observed, “an invader is an 
invader unless invited in by a government with some claim to legiti¬ 
macy,” 21 and the government that the Soviet Union installed to invite 
it in plainly lacked any such claim.
