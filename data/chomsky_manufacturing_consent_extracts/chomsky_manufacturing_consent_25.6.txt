None of these matters elicit serious controversy, nor should they.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, like earlier cases of Soviet inter¬ 
vention in the region occupied by the Red Army as it drove out the 
Nazis during World War II, are described as aggression, and the facts 
are reported in these terms.The United Nations has repeatedly con¬ 
demned the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan and regularly investigates 
and denounces the crimes they have committed.Western reporters 
cover the war from the standpoint of the rebels defending their country 
from foreign attack, entering Afghanistan with them from their Pakis¬ 
tani sanctuaries.Official Soviet pronouncements are treated not merely 
with skepticism but with disdain.
