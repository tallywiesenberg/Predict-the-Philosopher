To mention only one typical case from the year in which* we are to 
understand* this status had been definitively attained (see p. 170)* in 
March 1970 the media reported a North Vietnamese invasion of Laos 
on the basis of a speech by President Nixon announcing that North 
Vietnamese forces in Laos had suddenly risen from 50*000 to 67*000.Nixon’s comment came immediately after the U.S. military attache in 
Vientiane had presented his standard briefing citing the lower figure—a 
source of much private amusement among the press corps in Vientiane* 
as one of us witnessed at first hand—but the presidential fabrication 
was reported as fact.The lower figure was also fraudulent, although this 
fact was never reported.22 Throughout the Indochina wars, when offi¬ 
cial statements were questioned* it was generally on the basis of U.S. 
military sources in the field* so that reporting and analysis remained 
well within the bounds set by U.S. power- 23 

Only very rarely did U.S. reporters make any effort to see the war 
from the point of view of “the enemy"—the peasants of South Vietnam* 
Laos* or later Cambodia—or to accompany the military forces of “the 
enemy” resisting the U.S. assault.Such evidence as was available was 
ignored or dismissed.
