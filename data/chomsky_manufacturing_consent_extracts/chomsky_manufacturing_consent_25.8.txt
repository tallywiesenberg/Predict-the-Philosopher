In coverage of the 
war, the press corps 5 job narrowed down to three basic tasks— 
reporting what the government said, finding out whether it was 
true, and assessing whether the policy enunciated worked.The 
group did a highly professional job on the first task.But it fell 
down on the second and third, and there is strong evidence the 
reason is too many reporters sought the answers in all three cate¬ 
gories from the same basic source—the government.26 

The search for “opposing viewpoints 55 as things went wrong was also 
extremely narrow, limited to the domain of tactics—that is, limited to 
the question of “whether the policy enunciated worked,” viewed en¬ 
tirely from the standpoint of U.S. interests, and with official premises 
taken as given.Furthermore, the U.S, war was openly supported by U.S. allies, some 
of whom sent combat forces (Australia, Thailand, South Korea), while 
others enriched themselves through their participation in the destruc¬ 
tion of Indochina.
