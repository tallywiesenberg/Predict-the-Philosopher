He has been able to do this, simply and solely 
because of the massive dollar aid he has had from across the 
Pacific, which kept in power a man who, by all the laws of 
human and political affairs, would long ago have fallen.Diem’s 
main supporters are to be found in North America, not in Free

The leading U.S. government specialist on Vietnamese Communism, 
Douglas Pike, whose denunciations of the “Viet Cong” often reached 
the level of hysteria, conceded that the NLF “maintained that its 
contest with the GVN and the United States should be fought out at 
the political level and that the use of massed military might was in itself 
illegitimate,” until forced by the United States and its clients “to use 
counterforce to survive.” 31 

The Kennedy administration escalated the war in South Vietnam, 
engaging U.S. military forces directly in bombing, defoliation, and 
“advising” combat troops from 1961 to 1962 as part of an effort to drive 
several million people into concentration camps (“strategic hamlets”) 
in which they could be “protected” behind barbed wire and armed 
guard from the guerrillas whom, the United States conceded, they were

exception of the Buddhists, thought themselves equal in size and power 
to risk entering a coalition, fearing that if they did the whale [the NLF] 
would swallow the minnow.” As for the Buddhists, the United States

of the early 1960s* which involved “indiscriminate killing 55 and “took 
a heavy toll of essentially innocent men* women and children, 55 in a 
manner that Orwell would have appreciated: villages in “open zones 55 
were “subjected to random bombardment by artillery and aircraft so as 
to drive the inhabitants into the safety of the strategic hamlets/ 533 
It was conceded on all sides that the government imposed by the 
United States lacked any significant popular support.
