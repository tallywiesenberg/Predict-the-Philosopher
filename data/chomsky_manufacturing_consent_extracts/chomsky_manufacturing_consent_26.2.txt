37 Thus the New York Times commented editorially on June 4, 
1966, that “Washington cannot shape the political future in Saigon, but 
it can continue to urge a search for unity among all the South Viet¬ 
namese political factions pending the September elections.55 In fact, the 
rulers at the moment had been imposed by the United States, the 
election was a U.S. idea, and—needless to say—the South Vietnamese 
who constituted the only “truly mass-based political party in South 
Vietnam 15 (Pike, referring to the NLF) were not considered one of the 
“South Vietnamese political factions.” As for the “unity 55 sought by the 
United States, it was intended solely to provide a base for prosecution 
of the U.S. war.As that goal could be accomplished only by suppression 
of all popular movements, later in 1966 the military junta, with U.S. 
approval and direct assistance, crushed by force the largest non-Com- 
munist group, the organized Buddhists, thereby clearing the ground for 
durable rule by Thieu and Ky.Despite all of this, the U.S. media did 
not point out that any basis for a free election had been destroyed, and 
that the unelected government was maintained in power solely because 
its aims were identical to those of the U.S. administration—that is, that 
it was a classic example of a puppet government.38 On the contrary, the 
junta never ceased to be the leaders of free and independent South 
Vietnam, the word “puppet” being reserved for agents of enemy states.
