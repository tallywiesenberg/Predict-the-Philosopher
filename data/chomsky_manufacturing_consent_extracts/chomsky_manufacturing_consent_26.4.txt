The United States attacked 
South Vietnam* arguably by 1962 and unquestionably by 1965* expand¬ 
ing its aggression to all of Indochina with lethal and long-term effects.Media coverage or other commentary on these events that does not 
begin by recognizing these essential facts is mere apologetics for terror¬ 
ism and murderous aggression.The United States was “defending 
South Vietnam” in the same sense in which the Soviet Union is “de¬ 
fending Afghanistan.” 

But from the point of view of the media* or “the culture,” there is 
no such event in history as the U.S, attack against South Vietnam and 
the rest of Indochina.One would be hard put to find even an single 
reference within the mainstream to any such event* or any recognition 
that history could possibly be viewed from this perspective—just as 
Pravda , presumably* records no such event as the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan* only the defense of Afghanistan against “bandits” sup¬ 
ported by the CIA.Even at the peak period of peace-movement activ¬ 
ism there was virtually no opposition to the war within the intellectual 
culture on the grounds that aggression is wrong 46 —the grounds univer¬ 
sally adopted in the case of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 
1968—for a very simple reason: the fact of U.S. aggression was unrecog¬ 
nized.
