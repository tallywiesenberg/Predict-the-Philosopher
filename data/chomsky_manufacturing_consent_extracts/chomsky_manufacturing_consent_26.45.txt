There was much debate during the war over whether the North 
Vietnamese were guilty of aggression m Vietnam* and as we have seen* 
even the South Vietnamese were condemned for “internal aggression” 
(Adlai Stevenson); but there was no discussion of whether the United 
States was guilty of aggression in its direct attack against South Viet¬ 
nam* then all of Indochina.These intriguing facts reflect the over¬ 
whelming dominance of the state propaganda system and its ability to 
set the terms of thought and discussion* even for those who believe

themselves to be taking an "adversarial stance.” As for the media, 
departures from these doctrinal principles were negligible; indeed, they 
may well have been literally zero in the vast coverage and commentary 
on the war, while it was in progress or since.In a revealing article entitled "Lessons of Running Viets* War,” 
published in August 1987, Stanley Karnow, a veteran Asia correspond¬ 
ent and author of a highly regarded liberal history of the Vietnam War, 
argues that the United States erred in Vietnam because it allowed the 
Vietnamese people to depend too heavily on us.47 Reciprocally, the 
South Vietnamese people also "allowed themselves to be lulled into a 
complacent sense of dependency on the United States,” thinking we 
wouldn't back down, not realizing that small clients are expendable.The South Vietnamese people who fought the U.S. invasion are never 
mentioned, or considered to be "South Vietnamese” within Kamow's 
patriotic frame, although they constituted the majority of the popula¬ 
tion and the only serious political force, according to U.S. specialists 
and officials on the scene, and despite the fact that the U.S.-selected 
faction repeatedly stressed that "Frankly, we are not strong enough 
now to compete with the communists on a purely political basis.” 40 A 
Soviet Kamow would no doubt express similar concern in retrospect 
that the Soviet Union allowed the "Afghans” to rely too heavily on 
Soviet power.
