By the standards we rightly apply to the actions of the Soviet Union 
or other official enemies, there is nothing further that need be said 
about the media and Indochina.Any further discussion is on a par with 
the minor question of whether Pravda reports facts accurately about 
“the Soviet defense of Afghanistan.” Adopting the Freedom House— 
Trilateral Commission perspective, a Communist party functionary 
might criticize Pravda for excessive pessimism or for too adversarial a 
stance, contributing to the eventual loss of the war and the takeover of 
Afghanistan by feudalist elements committed to terrorism, horrifying 
repression of women, religious fanaticism, plans to “march on Jerusa¬ 
lem,” etc.Or if he found that the reporting was sufficiently upbeat and 
not too distorted, he might laud Pravda for its accuracy and objectivity.But all of this would be nonsense, whatever is discovered; serious 
evaluation of the media is effectively over when we discover that the 
basic principle of state propaganda—the principle that the USSR is 
defending Afghanistan from terrorist attack—is adopted as the unques¬ 
tioned framework for further reporting and discussion.The same is true 
in the case of U.S. aggression in Indochina.
