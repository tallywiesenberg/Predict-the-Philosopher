The rea¬ 
sons for the resort to violence were simple and have been amply docu¬ 
mented.56 Recourse to violence was the only feasible response to the 
successes of the Viet Minh, reconstituted as the National Liberation 
Front (NLF), in organizing the peasantry, which left the United States 
only one option: to shift the struggle away from the political arena, 
where it was weak, to the arena of violence, where it was strong* Despite 
the U*S.-organized terror, the Communist party continued to advocate 
political action* The outline of strategy for the coming year sent to the 
South in late 1958 still called for political struggle without the use of 
arms* 57 As Jeffrey Race documents, when the Communist party finally 
authorized the use of violence in self-defense in 1959 in response to 
pleas from the southern Viet Minh, the slaughter could no longer 
proceed unimpeded, and government authority quickly collapsed.Nevertheless, .* the government terrorized far more than did the 
revolutionary movement—for example, by liquidations of former Viet- 
minh by artillery and ground attacks on ‘communist villages/ and by 
roundups of ‘communist sympathizers/ ” 

The fundamental source of strength for the revolutionary move¬ 
ment, Race continues, was the appeal of its constructive programs—for 
example, the land-reform program, which “achieved a far broader 
distribution of land than did the government program, and without the 
killing and terror which is associated in the minds of Western readers 
with communist practices in land reform.” On the contrary, “the princi¬ 
pal violence was brought about not by the Party but by the government, 
in its attempts to reinstall the landlords”—the usual pattern, in fact, 
although not “in the minds of Western readers.” The lowest economic 
strata benefited the most from the redistributive policies implemented.Authority was decentralized and placed in the hands of local people, 
in contrast to the rule of the U.S. client regime, perceived as “outside 
forces” by major segments of the local population: “what attracted 
people to the revolutionary movement was that it represented a new 
society in which there would be an individual redistribution of values,

including power and status as well as material possessions,* 5 In Long 
An province, near Saigon, which Race studied intensively, the NLF had 
become dominant in the early 1960s, while the government apparatus 
and its armed forces dissolved without violent conflict, undermined by 
NLF organizing and propaganda.
