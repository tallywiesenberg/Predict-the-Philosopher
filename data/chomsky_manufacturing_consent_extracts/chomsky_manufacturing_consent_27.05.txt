Until the expansion of the war in 1965 began to provoke some con¬ 
cern, the NLF and DRV were "treated almost exclusively as an arm 
of international Communism,” Hallin found in his analysis of the 
Times's coverage."The term civil war began to be used in 1965” and 
"the term aggression began to appear sometimes in quotation marks”— 
referring, of course, to Vietnamese aggression in Vietnam, the concept 
of American aggression being unimaginable, then or since.But concern 
over Vietnamese "aggression” never abated, as when James Reston 
discussed “the main point”: “How, then, is this aggression by subver-

$ion to be stopped?”—referring to aggression by Vietnamese against the 
American invaders and their clients.Similarly* on television, even more 
conformist than the print media, Peter Jennings* showing Pentagon 
films on U.S. air attacks* commented that “This is the shape of things 
to come for Communist aggression in Vietnam*” while NBCs Jack 
Perkins* reporting an air-force attack that wiped out a “village una¬ 
bashedly advertising itself with signs and flags as a Vietcong village*” 
justified the attack as necessary: “The whole village had turned on the 
Americans, so the whole village was being destroyed.” It is taken for 
granted that the Americans had every right to be marauding in a region 
of Vietnam where “Everything in this area for years was Vietcong,” A 
television report on Operation Attleboro described the fighting as rag¬ 
ing “once again to preserve democracy.” 68 

Summarizing* from the late 1940s* the United States supported the 
French war of conquest; overturned the political settlement arranged 
at Geneva in 1954; established a terrorist client regime in the southern 
section of the country divided by foreign (i,e,, U.S.) force; moved on 
to open aggression against South Vietnam by 1962 and worked desper¬ 
ately to prevent the political settlement sought by Vietnamese on all 
sides; and then invaded outright in 1965* initiating an air and ground 
war that devastated Indochina.Throughout this period* the media 
presented the U.S, intervention entirely within the framework pre¬ 
dicted by a propaganda model.
