There are* of course* those who demand still higher standards of 
loyalty to the state* and for them* the fact that critical perceptions of 
American military officers in the field sometimes reached public atten¬ 
tion is an intolerable “adversarial stance” reflecting the left-wing pro¬ 
clivities of “the culture.” Putting this interesting perspective to the side* 
as far as this period is concerned we may dismiss the conception that 
the media “lost the war,” although it would be quite accurate to con¬ 
clude that they encouraged the United States to enter and pursue a war 
of aggression* which they later were to regard as “a tragedy,” or “a 
blunder*” while never acknowledging their fundamental contribution to 
rallying public support for the policies that they were ultimately to 
deplore.Given the conformism and obedience of the media during this 
crucial period* when the basis for U.S. aggression was firmly and irrevo¬ 
cably laid, it is small wonder that public concern was so slight* and that 
opposition was so negligible as to be entirely without significance.Only 
the most ardent researcher could have developed a moderately clear 
understanding of what was taking place in Indochina,

1965* in “reprisal” for an attack on U.S. military installations by the 
“Viet Cong* 15 are therefore hardly surprising.Asked “Who do you think 
is behind the attacks by the Viet Cong?” 53 percent blamed the Chinese 
Communists and 26 percent blamed North Vietnam, while 7 percent 
said, “Civil war,” 69 In no identifiable sector of American opinion would 
it have been possible even to ask the obvious question that would 
receive an easy and accurate answer in the case of the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan: “Why do you think the southern resistance is attacking 
U.S. military installations in South Vietnam?” In fact* even at the peak 
of peace-movement activities—or today, many years later, when it 
should be possible to observe the plain facts with some detachment—it 
would be quite impossible to raise this simple and obvious question, or 
to answer it, within the mainstream media and most of “the culture.” 

In this dismal record we see very clearly the consequences of mind¬ 
less media obedience in a state with enormous resources of violence.5.4.
