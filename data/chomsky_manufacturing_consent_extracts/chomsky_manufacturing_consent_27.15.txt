REPORTING ON THE WAR 

As the U.S. invasion mounted in scale and intensity, Indochina was 
flooded with war correspondents, many of whom reported what they 
saw and heard with honesty and courage.With rare exceptions, how¬ 
ever, they gave an account of the war as perceived by the U.S. military 
on the ground or as offered in press briefings.In the home offices, 
Washington's version prevailed until elite divisions within the United 
States expanded the range of tactical debate.Reporters often did not conceal atrocities committed by the U.S, 
military forces, although they did not appear to perceive them as atroci¬ 
ties and surely did not express the horror and outrage that would have 
been manifest if others were the perpetrators, and the United States or 
its clients the victims.70 Malcolm Browne quotes a U.S. official who 
describes B-52 strikes in the South as “the most lucrative raids made 
at any time during the war”: 

Every single bomb crater is surrounded with bodies, wrecked 
equipment and dazed and bleeding people.
