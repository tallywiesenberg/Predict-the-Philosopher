At one such hole there 
were 40 or 50 men, all in green North Vietnamese uniforms but 
without their weapons, lying around in an obvious state of shock.We sent in helicopter gunships, which quickly put them out of 
their misery.71

The Geneva conventions require that “members of armed forces who 
have laid down their arms and those placed kors de combat by sickness, 
wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in ail circumstances be 
treated humanely”; and there are no limits to the horror expressed, 
until today, over Communist treatment of U.S. pilots captured during 
the air operations that leveled much of North Vietnam.But the victims 
that the New York Times is describing are Vietnamese carrying out 
aggression against Americans in Vietnam, so no such scruples are in 
order, and none were expressed.Similarly, there was little reaction when B-52 raids in “the populous 
[Mekong] delta” were reported in 1965, with unknown numbers of 
civilian casualties and hordes of refugees fleeing to government-con¬ 
trolled areas “because they could no longer bear the continuous bomb¬ 
ings.” 72 The victims fell under the category of “the unfortunate 
accidental loss of life incurred by the efforts of American military forces 
to help the South Vietnamese repel the incursion of North Vietnam and 
its partisans,” as explained by Sidney Hook while condemning Bertrand 
Russell because he “plays up” these meritorious actions “as deliberate 
American atrocities,” 73 No doubt one can find similar remarks today in 
Pravda in commentary on Afghanistan by other commissars who are 
much admired as leading humanitarians because they courageously 
condemn the crimes of the United States and its allies in Soviet 
journals.
