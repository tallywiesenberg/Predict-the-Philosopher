Not only was there no reaction to these and subsequent atrocities, 
but there was also no attempt to place them in the context of what had 
immediately preceded—that is, to make them intelligible.Indeed, there 
was little awareness of the background, because the media were so 
closely wedded to U.S, government goals and perceptions that they 
never sought to learn the facts.As the war progressed, ample evidence 
became available from U.S. government sources to explain why the 
United States had been forced to resort to violence in “the populous 
delta,” as elsewhere, as we described in the preceding section.But such 
materials, inconsistent with the preferred image of the United States 
defending South Vietnam from Communist terror and aggression, had 
little impact on news reporting or commentary, except for occasional 
illustration of the difficulties faced by the United States in pursuing its 
noble cause.The reason for the U.S. resort to violence was overwhelmingly clear 
by the time of the outright U.S. invasion in 1965, and would have been 
no less clear before had any serious effort been made to determine the 
facts.
