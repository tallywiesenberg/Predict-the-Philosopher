In the South* bombing of dikes and virtually limitless destruction 
was an uncontroversial tactic, as in the Batangan Peninsula, where 
12,000 peasants (including, it appears, the remnants of the My Lai 
massacre) were forced from their homes in an American ground sweep 
in January 1969 and shipped off to a waterless camp near Quang Ngai 
over which floated a banner saying: “We thank you for liberating us 
from Communist terror,” The Times reported that the refugees had 
lived “in caves and bunkers for many months” because “heavy Ameri¬ 
can bombing and artillery and naval shelling” had destroyed their 
homes, as well as a dike that was “blasted by American jets to deprive 
the North Vietnamese [sic] of a food supply.” It was left unrepaired, 
so that two years later “the salt water of the South China Sea continues 
to submerge the fields where rice once grew.” The reason, according 
to an American official, is that the people “were written off as commu¬ 
nists,” and for the same reason the region was left in ruins: “the hills 
that overlook the flooded paddies, once scattered with huts, are ...filled with bomb fragments, mines and unexploded artillery shells,” and 
“B-52 craters nearly 20 feet deep pock the hills.” 76 

Bombing of dikes in the North, occasionally reported, 77 was contro¬ 
versial, as was the bombing of North Vietnam generally.The reason is 
that the cost to the United States might be high because of a potential 
Chinese or Soviet response, regarded as a serious and dangerous possi¬ 
bility, or because of the impact on international opinion.
