78 But these 
questions did not arise in the case of U*S, terror against the South 
Vietnamese, which therefore proceeded without notable concern or, it 
seems, much in the way of planning.In the Pentagon Papers, we find 
extensive discussion and debate over the escalation of the bombing 
against the North, while there is virtually nothing about the far more 
destructive bombing, defoliation, destruction of vast areas by Rome 
plows, etc., in South Vietnam, where we were “saving” the population 
from “aggression.” With regard to South Vietnam, the planning record 
is limited to the question of deployment of U.S. troops, which again 
raised potential costs to the United States.7 ® 

The most notable exception to the easy tolerance of atrocities perpe¬ 
trated against South Vietnamese was the My Lai massacre, in March 
1968, reported at once by the NLF among other massacres that are still 
not acknowledged or discussed.Details were disclosed in Paris in June 
1968, but neglected by the media until November 1969 despite extensive 
efforts by helicopter gunner Ronald Ridenhour to publicize the story, 
which finally broke through to the general public, thanks to the persist¬ 
ence of Seymour Hersh, at the time of a massive demonstration in 
Washington, when media attention was focused on antiwar protest.The

massacre was a footnote to the post-Tet accelerated pacification cam¬
