More revealing was the massacre at nearby 
My Khe, with ninety civilians reported dead, discovered by the Peers 
Panel inquiry into the My Lai massacre; proceedings against the officer 
in charge were dismissed on the grounds that this was merely a normal 
operation in which a village was destroyed and its population murdered 
or forcibly relocated, a decision that tells us all we need to know about 
the American war in South Vietnam, but that passed without com¬ 
ment, 80 

While the nation agonized about the sentencing of Lieutenant Wil¬ 
liam Galley for his part in the My Lai massacre, a new ground sweep 
in the same area drove some 16,000 peasants from their homes, and a 
year later the camp where the My Lai remnants were relocated in this 
operation was largely destroyed by air and artillery bombardment, the 
destruction attributed to the Viet Cong.81 These events too passed with 
little notice, and no calls for an inquiry—reasonably enough, since 
these too were normal and routine operations.Medical workers at the nearby Canadian-run hospital reported that 
they knew of the My Lai massacre at once but gave it little attention 
because it was not out of the ordinary in a province (Quang Ngai) that 
had been virtually destroyed by ILS.military operations.The highest- 
ranking officer to have faced court-martial charges for the massacre, 
Colonel Oran Henderson, stated that “every unit of brigade size has its 
Mylai hidden some place, 51 although “every unit doesn't have a Riden- 
hour” to expose what had happened, 82 Knowledgeable elements of the 
peace movement also gave the My Lai massacre no special notice, for 
the same reasons.
