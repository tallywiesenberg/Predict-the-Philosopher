The reasons why this particular massacre became a cause c£l£bre 
were explained by Newsweek'^ Saigon bureau chief Kevin Buckley, 
referring to Operation Wheeler Wallawa, with 10,000 enemy reported 
killed, including the victims of My Lai, who were listed in the official 
body count: 

An examination of that whole operation would have revealed the 
incident at My Lai to be a particularly gruesome application of a 
wider policy which had the same effect in many places at many 
times.Of course, the blame for that could not have been dumped 
on a stumblebum lieutenant.Galley was an aberration, but 
“Wheeler Wallawa 5 * was not.The real issue concerning this operation, Buckley cabled to the U.S. 
office of Newsweek, was not the “indiscriminate use of firepower,” as

is often alleged.Rather* “it is charges of quite discriminating use—as 
a matter of policy* in populated areas*” as in this operation or many 
others* among them Operation Speedy Express* with thousands of 
civilians murdered and many others driven to refugee and prison camps 
by such devices as B-52 raids targeted specifically on villages.
