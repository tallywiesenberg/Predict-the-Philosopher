An experienced U.S. official* cited by Buckley* compared My Lai to 
the exploits of the U.S. Ninth Infantry Division in a range of similar 
operations: 

The actions of the 9th Division in inflicting civilian casualties were 
worse.The sum total of what the 9th did was overwhelming.In 
sum* the horror was worse than My Lai.But with the 9th, the 
civilian casualties came in dribbles and were pieced out over a long 
time.And most of them were inflicted from the air and at night.
