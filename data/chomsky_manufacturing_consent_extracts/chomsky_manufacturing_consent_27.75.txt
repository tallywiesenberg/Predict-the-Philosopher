Also* they were sanctioned by the command’s insistence on high 
body counts....The result was an inevitable outcome of the unit’s 
command policy.83 

In short* the My Lai massacre was ignored when it occurred* and the 
substantial attention given to it later is a more subtle form of cover-up 
of atrocities.An honest accounting* inconceivable in the media or “the 
culture” generally* would have placed the responsibility far higher than 
Lieutenant Galley* but it was more convenient to focus attention on the 
actions of semi-crazed GI’s in a gruesome combat situation with every 
Vietnamese civilian a threatening enemy.My Lai did not prompt the 
media generally—there were some individual exceptions—to take a 
deeper look at the nature of the war* or to display an interest in reports 
of similar events in nearby areas that suggested its unexceptional char¬ 
acter.
