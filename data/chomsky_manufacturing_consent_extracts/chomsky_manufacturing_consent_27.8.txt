This particular massacre was made exceptional by an arbitrary 
cutoff of attention and refusal to investigate beyond narrowly circum¬ 
scribed limits.The limited but dramatized attention to My Lai was even 
used to demonstrate the conscience of America* in the face of enemy 
provocations.Thus a 1973 New York Times report from My Lai de¬ 
scribes the “battered Batangan peninsula*” an area where the inhabi¬ 
tants were “generally supporters of the Vietcong,” now demolished by 
U.S. bombardment and ground operations: “big guns fire into the pe¬ 
ninsula as they have again and again over the eight years that American* 
South Korean and South Vietnamese forces have been trying to make 
it safe.” The report quotes villagers who accuse the Americans of 
having killed many people here: “They are in no position to appreciate 
what the name My Lai means to Americans,” the reporter adds thought¬ 
fully.84 



THE INDOCHINA WARS (l): VIETNAM 199 


The standard critique of the media for having “lost the war” identi¬ 
fies television as the major culprit.Television analyst Edward Jay 
Epstein formulates the standard view as follows: 

Over the past 10 years, almost nightly* Americans have witnessed 
the war in Vietnam* on television* Never before in history has a 
nation allowed its citizens to view uncensored scenes of combat, 
destruction and atrocities in their living rooms, in living color* 
Since television has become the principal—and most believed— 
source of news for most Americans* it is generally assumed that 
the constant exposure of this war on television was instrumental 
in shaping public opinion* It has become almost a truism* and the 
standard rhetoric of television executives, to say that television* by 
showing the terrible truth of the war* caused the disillusionment 
of Americans with the war* * , , This has also been the dominant 
view of those governing the Nation during the war years* * , * 
Depending on whether the appraisal has come from hawk or dove, 
television has thus been either blamed or applauded for the disil¬ 
lusionment of the American public with the war* g5 

There have been several studies of the matter, suggesting a rather 
different picture* We will return to some of these issues in discussing 
the coverage of the Tet offensive, but we should observe that there are 
some rather serious questions about the standard formulations* Sup¬ 
pose that some Soviet investigators were to conduct an inquiry into 
coverage of the war in Afghanistan to determine whether Pravda 
should be blamed or applauded for the disillusionment of the Soviet 
public with the war?
