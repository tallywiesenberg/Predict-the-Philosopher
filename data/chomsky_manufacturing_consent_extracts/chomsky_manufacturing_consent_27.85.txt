Would we consider such an inquiry to be mean¬ 
ingful without consideration of both the costs and the justice of the 
venture?Epstein notes an obvious “logical problem” with the standard view; 
for the first six years of television coverage* from 1962 and increasingly 
through 1967* “the American public did approve of the war in Vietnam” 
according to polls.Furthermore, in a 1967 Harris poll for Newsweek, “64 
per cent of the nation wide sample said that television’s coverage made 
them more supportive of the American effort, and only 26 per cent said 
that it had intensified their opposition,” leading the journal to conclude 
that “TV has encouraged a decisive majority of viewers to support the 
war*” 

Epstein's review of his and other surveys of television newscasts and 
commentary during this period explains why this should have been the 
case* “Up until 1965,” he writes, “the network anchor men seemed

unanimous in support of American objectives in Vietnam/ 1 and most 
described themselves as “hawks” until the end, while the most notable 
“dove,” Walter Cronkite, applauded “the courageous decision that 
Communism's advance must be stopped in Asia” in 1965 and later 
endorsed the initial U.S. commitment “to stop Communist aggression 
wherever it raises its head,” In fact, at no time during the war or since 
has there been any detectable departure from unqualified acceptance 
of the U-S. government propaganda framework; as in the print media, 
controversy was limited to tactical questions and the problem of costs, 
almost exclusively the cost to the United States, 

The network anchormen not only accepted the framework of inter¬ 
pretation formulated by the state authorities, but also were optimistic 
about the successes achieved in the U,S, war of defense against Viet¬ 
namese aggression in Vietnam, Epstein cites work by George Rally, who 
concludes: “The results in this study demonstrate the combat reports 
and the government statements generally gave the impression that the 
Americans were in control, on the offense and holding the initiative, at 
least until Tet of 1968,” a picture accepted by the network anchormen.Television “focused on [the] progress” of the American ground forces, 
supporting this picture with “film, supplied by the Pentagon, that 
showed the bombing of the North” and “suggesting that the Americans 
were also rebuilding South Vietnam”—while they were systematically 
destroying it, as could be deduced inferentially from scattered evidence 
for which no context or interpretation was provided, NBC's “Huntley- 
Brinkley Report” described “the American forces in Vietnam as 
‘builders' rather than destroyers,” a “central truth” that “needs under¬ 
scoring,” 

What made this especially deceptive and hypocritical was the fact, 
noted earlier, that the most advanced and cruel forms of devastation 
and killing—such as the free use of napalm, defoliants, and Rome 
plows—were used with few constraints in the South, because its popu¬ 
lation was voiceless, in contrast with the North, where international 
publicity and political complications threatened, so that at least visible 
areas around the major urban centers were spared, 86 

As for news coverage, “all three networks had definite policies about 
showing graphic film of wounded American soldiers or suffering Viet¬ 
namese civilians,” Epstein observes, “Producers of the NBC and ABC 
evening-news programs said that they ordered editors to delete exces¬ 
sively grisly or detailed shots,” and CBS had similar policies, which, 
according to former CBS News president Fred W. Friendly, “helped 
shield the audience from the true horror of the war,” “The relative 
bloodlessness of the war depicted on television helps to explain why

only a minority in the Lou Hams-Newsweek poll said that television 
increased their dissatisfaction with the war”; such coverage yielded an 
impression, Epstein adds, of “a clean, effective technological war,” 
which was “rudely shaken at Tet in 1968.” As noted earlier, NBC 
withdrew television clips showing harsh treatment of Viet Cong prison¬ 
ers at the request of the Kennedy administration.Throughout this period, furthermore, “television coverage focused 
almost exclusively on the American effort.” There were few interviews 
with GVN military or civilian leaders, “and the Vietcong and North 
Vietnamese were almost nonexistent on American television news¬ 
casts.” 

There was one famous exception to the sanitizing of the war, an 
August 5, 1965, CBS report by Morley Safer showing U.S. Marines 
burning huts in the village of Cam Ne with cigarette lighters, which 
elicited “a semiofficial campaign” by the Pentagon “to discredit the 
television story and vilify the correspondent as 'unpatriotic.
