surveys of television newscasts by Epstein and Wisconsin Professor 
Lawrence Lichty show that “instances shown on TV of American 
brutality toward the South Vietnamese, such as Cam Ne, "could be 
counted on one hand 5 [Lichty],” “even though hundreds of South 
Vietnamese villages were destroyed during this period.” “The Cam Ne 
story is famous for being the exception to the rule.” 

Returning soldiers told a different story, and it became increasingly 
clear, although not through the medium of television, that the war was 
bloody and brutal, leading to “disillusionment”—and among a large 
sector of the general population, increasingly “out of control,” a much 
stronger and more appropriate reaction.But, Epstein continues, “the televised picture of gradual progress in 
the war was abruptly shattered by the Communist [Tet] offensive 55 in 
January-February 1968, when the military lost its “control over the 
movements of the press,” who could step outside their hotels and find 
“themselves willy-nilly in the midst of bloody fighting.” For this brief 
moment, correspondents sent on-the-spot reports that were aired in 
place of “the usual carefully edited view of an orderly, controlled war,” 
and the policy of “shielding] American viewers from the grisly close- 
ups of wounded Americans, body bags and death” briefly collapsed, 
though newscasts continued to be edited in home offices as “too 
strong, 55 in the words of NBC producer Robert Northshield.This cov¬ 
erage convinced Walter Cronkite that the war had become “a bloody 
stalemate,” in a controversial report to which we will return.The Tet offensive convinced U.S. elites that the war was becoming 
too costly to the United States, and the government shifted toward the
