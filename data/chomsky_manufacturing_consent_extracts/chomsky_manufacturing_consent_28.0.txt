lx THIS BOOK, WE SKETCH OUT A “PROPAGANDA MODEL" AND 
apply it to the performance of the mass media of the United States. 
This effort reflects our belief, based on many years of study of the 
workings of the media, that they serve to mobilize support for the 
special interests that dominate the state and private activity, 1 and that 
their choices, emphases, and omissions can often be understood best, 
and sometimes with striking clarity and insight, by analyzing them in 
such terms. 

Perhaps this is an obvious point, but the democratic postulate is that 
the media are independent and committed to discovering and reporting 
the truth, and that they do not merely reflect the world as powerful 
groups wish it to be perceived. Leaders of the media claim that their 
news choices rest on unbiased professional and objective criteria, and 
they have support for this contention in the intellectual community. 2 
If, however, the powerful are able to fix the premises of discourse, to 
decide what the general populace is allowed to see, hear, and think 
about, and to “manage” public opinion by regular propaganda cam¬ 
paigns, the standard view of how the system works is at serious odds 
with reality, 3 

The special importance of propaganda in what Walter Lippmann 
referred to as the “manufacture of consent” has long been recognized 
by writers on public opinion, propaganda, and the political require¬ 
ments of social order. 4 Lippmann himself, writing in the early 1920s, 
claimed that propaganda had already become “a regular organ of popu¬ 
lar government,” and was steadily increasing in sophistication and im¬ 
portance, 5 We do not contend that this is all the mass media do, but 
we believe the propaganda function to be a very important aspect of 
their overall service. In the first chapter we spell out a propaganda 
model, which describes the forces that cause the mass media to play a

propaganda role, the processes whereby they mobilize bias, and the 
patterns of news choices that ensue* In the succeeding chapters we try 
to demonstrate the applicability of the propaganda model to the actual 
performance of the media* 

Institutional critiques such as we present in this book are commonly 
dismissed by establishment commentators as “conspiracy theories,” but 
this is merely an evasion. We do not use any kind of “conspiracy” 
hypothesis to explain mass-media performance* In fact, our treatment 
is much closer to a “free market” analysis, with the results largely an 
outcome of the workings of market forces* Most biased choices in the 
media arise from the preselection of right-thinking people, internalized 
preconceptions, and the adaptation of personnel to the constraints of 
ownership, organization, market, and political power* Censorship is 
largely self-censorship, by reporters and commentators who adjust to 
the realities of source and media organizational requirements, and by 
people at higher levels within media organizations who are chosen to 
implement, and have usually internalized, the constraints imposed by 
proprietary and other market and governmental centers of power* 

There are important actors who do take positive initiatives to define 
and shape the news and to keep the media in line* It is a “guided market 
system” that we describe here, with the guidance provided by the 
government, the leaders of the corporate community, the top media 
owners and executives, and the assorted individuals and groups who are 
assigned or allowed to take constructive initiatives, 6 These initiators are 
sufficiently small in number to be able to act jointly on occasion, as do 
sellers in markets with few rivals* In most cases, however, media leaders 
do similar things because they see the world through the same lenses, 
are subject to similar constraints and incentives, and thus feature stories 
or maintain silence together in tacit collective action and leader- 
follower behavior* 

The mass media are not a solid monolith on all issues* Where the 
powerful are in disagreement, there will be a certain diversity of tactical 
judgments on how to attain generally shared aims, reflected in media 
debate. Bur views that challenge fundamental premises or suggest that 
the observed modes of exercise of state power are based on systemic 
factors will be excluded from the mass media even when elite contro- 
versy over tactics rages fiercely* 

We will study a number of such cases as we proceed, but the pattern 
is, in fact, pervasive* To select an example that happens to be dominat¬ 
ing the news as we write, consider the portrayal of Nicaragua, under 
attack by the United States* In this instance, the division of elite opin¬ 
ion is sufficiently great to allow it to be questioned whether sponsorship

of a terrorist army is effective in making Nicaragua “more democratic” 
and “less of a threat to its neighbors.” The mass media, however, rarely 
if ever entertain opinion, or allow their news columns to present materi¬ 
als suggesting that Nicaragua is more democratic than El Salvador and
