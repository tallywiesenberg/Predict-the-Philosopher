In his survey of network newscasts from 1965 through the January 
1973 peace treaty, Daniel Hallin reaches similar conclusions.Until the 
Tet offensive, television coverage was “lopsidedly favorable to Ameri¬ 
can policy in Vietnam,” well beyond even the ""remarkably docile” print 
media.Like Epstein, he notes the “dramatic” change after Tet, “part 
of a larger change, a response to as well as a cause of the unhappiness 
with the war that was developing at many levels, from the halls of the 
Pentagon, to Main Street, U.S.A. and the fire bases of Quang Tri 
province 55 —and, much more crucially, the unhappiness that had be¬ 
come quite significant by 1968 among business elites, leading to the 
changes in U.S. government policy already discussed.‘"Before Tet,

divisions in the “establishment itself,’’ He quotes New York Times 
editor Max Frankel, who said in an interview that “we’re an establish¬ 
ment institution, and whenever your natural constituency changes, then 
naturally you will too.” The same was true of television, and it is hardly 
surprising—and quite in accord with the propaganda model—that its 
fervent loyalty to the administration changed when “the establishment 
bastards have bailed out,” as Lyndon Johnson put it bitterly after the 
“Wise Men” advised him in March 1968 to abandon hope of military 
victory and to de-escalate the conflict, in the wake of the Tet offen¬ 
sive, 87 

Television typically presented events in terms of “a kind of morality 
play,.., a dramatic contrast between good, represented by the Ameri¬ 
can peace offensive [in 1966], and evil, represented by Hanoi,” Report¬ 
ing was relatively bloodless, focusing on the successes of “the 'good 
guys’: American boys in action,” regularly depicted as “brave men,” 
“the greatest men in the world,” “heroes,” exuding competence, hu¬ 
manity, and high morale as they fight against “Communist aggression” 
in the “battle for democracy,” and “win hearts and minds” by caring 
for sick and injured civilians after a village “was burned and blasted to 
death”—properly, because ammunition had been found there, which 
“was enough proof of its being used by the Vietcong” (Greg Harris, 
NBC-TV, Oct, 27, 1967), The issue of racism “was apparently too 
sensitive to touch,” Hallin adds, noting that he found no “comment on 
the hostility that many American soldiers felt towards all Vietnamese,
