In a follow-up on the Cam Ne 
incident, Dan Rather offers a comment that Hallin cites as an example 
of “a muckraking tone,” the harshest he presents: the marines are 
holding Cam Ne 

by force, not through the pacification program ...[which] hasn’t 
taken hold in Cam Ne.And until it does take hold here and a lot 
of other places in South Vietnam, nobody can feel very good about 
this dirty little war.
