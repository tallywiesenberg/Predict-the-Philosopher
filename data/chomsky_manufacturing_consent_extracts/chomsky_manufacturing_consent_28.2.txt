90 Coiiingwocd was pleased to observe progress in pacification* 
although there was still “Indian country” beyond.“This is almost like 
St. Louis on the move into the frontier*” his companion* a U.S. govern¬

probably knew.91 

In contrast to the heroic and humane image of the American soldiers 
defending democracy* the NLF and North Vietnamese were portrayed 
in “an almost perfectly one-dimensional image ... as cruel, ruthless and 
fanatical.” Of twelve positive comments by journalists that he found 
throughout the war* Hallin remarks* “10 concerned the effectiveness of 
enemy forces: this was the only element of television's image of the 
enemy that changed substantially” in the course of the post-Tet shift* 
mirroring establishment qualms about the prospects for the success of 
American arms.“What did not change was the dark picture of evil.” 
When U.S. forces burned villages* this was a necessity because they 
provided cover and support for the Viet Cong.The results of B-52 
saturation bombing were a “tragedy of war.” But when a North Viet¬ 
namese artillery shell hit an orphanage in An Hoa in October 1970, 
ABCs George Watson commented with horror: “No one was prepared 
for the massacre* the irrational murder that the North Vietnamese 
inflicted on An Hoa.” Although civilian casualties were overwhelmingly 
the result of U.S. firepower, attribution of responsibility by television 
was weighted by a 10 to 7 ratio to the account of the enemy; its 
“calculated policy of terror” contrasted with the unfortunate but legiti¬ 
mate side-effects of U.S. operations.
