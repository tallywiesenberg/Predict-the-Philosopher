By mid-1964, there was a growing consensus among Vietnamese in 
favor of a negotiated political settlement, while the United States was 
maneuvering with increasing desperation to evade what internal docu¬ 
ments describe as "premature negotiations,” The reason, as frankly 
explained, was that the United States was politically isolated, in opposi¬ 
tion to the NLF, the non-Communist opposition, and even the gener¬ 
als.It was therefore regarded as necessary to expand the war to the 
North to “obtain [the DRV's] cooperation in bringing an end to the 
Viet Cong insurgency” and to “persuade or force the DRV to stop its 
aid to the Viet Cong and use its directive powers to make the Viet Cong 
desist” (Ambassador Maxwell Taylor).Intelligence, meanwhile, con¬ 
cluded that “the basic elements of Communist strength in South Viet¬ 
nam remain indigenous*” 94
