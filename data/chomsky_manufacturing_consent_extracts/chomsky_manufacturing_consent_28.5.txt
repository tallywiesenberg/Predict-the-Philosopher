The New York Times had re¬ 
ported sabotage missions against the North as recently as July 23, and 
reported Hanoi’s August 2 protest of an attack on North Vietnamese 
villages by Laotian Air Force planes, but neither the Times nor the 
Washington Post mentioned these facts “either at the time of the inci¬ 
dents or in the weeks that followed, aside from inconspicuous sidebars 
on Hanoi’s 'allegations 5 [which were accurate, but dismissed] and a 
passing reference 55 in a column by James Reston.The reporting was 
“objective 55 in that it correctly reported U.S. government statements, 
raising no question about them, presenting no relevant background, and 
marginally citing Communist denials while proceeding to report the 
events as Washington wished them to be perceived* 93 

In subsequent weeks, the Times published a number of brief refer¬ 
ences to what was “charged 55 or “asserted 55 in the generally accurate 
reports from North Vietnam, which were rejected and dismissed by 
reporters while front-page stories and headlines presented the false 
Washington version as fact, with much speculation about Hanoi’s mo¬ 
tives in sending a few patrol boats to attack the mighty U,S, Seventh 
Fleet* The relevant background continued to be ignored or buried with 
marginal references in back pages* The criticism by Senator Morse was 
barely mentioned, and dismissed* There was no hint of administration 
doubts that the August 4 incident had even taken place."The newsweeklies adhered still more rigidly to the government prop¬ 
aganda line, even providing vivid and dramatic accounts of the August 
4 incident, which apparently never took place* The accurate criticism 
by Senators Gruening and Morse received a few lines, dismissed as 
“predictable” responses by the “irascible 55 Morse.There was no inter¬ 
est in their charge that the Tonkin Gulf resolution had been predated, 
also dismissed by the Times without inquiry.North Vietnamese and 
Chinese reactions were dismissed as “bluster” by Communists who 
“boiled with hatred and hostility toward the U,S*” (Newsweek) and 
“propaganda blasts” (US, News & World Report).
