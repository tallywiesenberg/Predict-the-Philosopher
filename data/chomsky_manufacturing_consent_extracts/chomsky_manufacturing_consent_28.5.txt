dismissed by establishment commentators as “conspiracy theories,” but 
this is merely an evasion. We do not use any kind of “conspiracy” 
hypothesis to explain mass-media performance* In fact, our treatment 
is much closer to a “free market” analysis, with the results largely an 
outcome of the workings of market forces* Most biased choices in the 
media arise from the preselection of right-thinking people, internalized 
preconceptions, and the adaptation of personnel to the constraints of 
ownership, organization, market, and political power* Censorship is 
largely self-censorship, by reporters and commentators who adjust to 
the realities of source and media organizational requirements, and by 
people at higher levels within media organizations who are chosen to 
implement, and have usually internalized, the constraints imposed by 
proprietary and other market and governmental centers of power* 

There are important actors who do take positive initiatives to define 
and shape the news and to keep the media in line* It is a “guided market 
system” that we describe here, with the guidance provided by the 
government, the leaders of the corporate community, the top media 
owners and executives, and the assorted individuals and groups who are 
assigned or allowed to take constructive initiatives, 6 These initiators are 
sufficiently small in number to be able to act jointly on occasion, as do 
sellers in markets with few rivals* In most cases, however, media leaders 
do similar things because they see the world through the same lenses, 
are subject to similar constraints and incentives, and thus feature stories 
or maintain silence together in tacit collective action and leader- 
follower behavior* 

The mass media are not a solid monolith on all issues* Where the 
powerful are in disagreement, there will be a certain diversity of tactical 
judgments on how to attain generally shared aims, reflected in media 
debate. Bur views that challenge fundamental premises or suggest that 
the observed modes of exercise of state power are based on systemic 
factors will be excluded from the mass media even when elite contro- 
versy over tactics rages fiercely* 

We will study a number of such cases as we proceed, but the pattern 
is, in fact, pervasive* To select an example that happens to be dominat¬ 
ing the news as we write, consider the portrayal of Nicaragua, under 
attack by the United States* In this instance, the division of elite opin¬ 
ion is sufficiently great to allow it to be questioned whether sponsorship
