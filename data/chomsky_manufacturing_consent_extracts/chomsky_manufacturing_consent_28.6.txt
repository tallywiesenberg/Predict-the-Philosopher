“Neither the 
Times nor the Post made any such analysis of the record,” simply 
taking the false Washington version to be correct and dismissing the 
accurate Communist “allegations” with a bare mention.101 In London, 
the New Statesman covered the U.S. and Chinese versions, including 
the (accurate) Chinese account of the U.S.-Saigon actions that 
preceded the incidents and the charge that the first was provoked by 
Washington while the second never occurred, and concluding that 
“the incidents in Vietnam do not seem quite as simple as the initial 
headlines indicated” (a substantial understatement).In the United 
States, the left-wing National Guardian, with five major articles, and 
LF.Stone’s Weekly provided the most extensive, careful, and accurate 
account of the events.In contrast to the fevered rhetoric of the main¬ 
stream newsweeklies, the National Guardian simply described the 
facts that were available, asking whether the August 2 “skirmish” had 
been provoked and whether the “alleged” August 4 incident had 
taken place.
