The first component of the thesis is commonly accepted even by 
those who deny the second.Thus* rejecting “the stab-in-the-back the¬ 
sis*” George Herring nevertheless observes: “That the media was hos¬ 
tile to the war and to Johnson seems clear, and much of the reporting 
of Tet was misleading”* these “distortions of the media” may have 
contributed to “growing popular discontent 55 with the war and “public 
anxiety,” Herring adds* but these were not the operative factors in 
Johnson's decision to de-escalate and seek negotiations after Tet.107 

An analysis of the facts and the argument demonstrates that neither 
component of the Freedom House thesis is tenable.The second* as we 
shall see, is conceded in the Freedom House study to be false with 
regard to public opinion, and the straw at which they then grasp will 
plainly not bear the weight.As for the first component* on the narrow 
question of professional competence in reporting the facts available 
under trying and confused circumstances, the performance of the 
media was acceptable if not outstanding, and compares quite favorably 
to the internal reporting of the American military authorities and U.S. 
intelligence* insofar as these are available.
