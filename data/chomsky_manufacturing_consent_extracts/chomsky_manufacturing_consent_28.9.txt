But when we turn to broader 
questions of the sort discussed earlier—that is* if we evaluate the media 
by the standards that we would properly apply to reporting, say, on the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan—we see that indeed they can be faulted 
in precisely the terms anticipated by the propaganda model.The very 
example selected as providing the strongest grounds for their accusa¬ 
tions by Freedom House and other critics from the jingoist right wing 
of the political spectrum actually happens to demonstrate the precise 
opposite of what is alleged—namely, it provides yet another striking 
illustration of the subservience of the media to the state propaganda 
system.108 

The Freedom House study itself provides ample documentation to 
establish these conclusions* and to refute its own specific allegations 
point by point.Given the major role that this study and the thesis it 
allegedly established has played in recent ideology, we will give some 
attention to the chasm that lies between its interpretation and summar¬ 
ies* on the one hand, and the documentary record that it (in part) 
presents, on the other.109 The comments and summaries often seriously 
misrepresent the contents of the documents described or are outright 
falsifications.
