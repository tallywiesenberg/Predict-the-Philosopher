thoroughly undermined when compared with the actual documents* 
When the countless errors and careless and inaccurate comments are 
corrected, nothing remains of the Freedom House case.The sardonic 
reference to “straw man journalism/* “CBS exclusives” and the like* 
referring to alleged misdeeds of the media, is misplaced; case by case, 
we find, instead, “Freedom House exclusives.’* 

Before proceeding to details, we should take careful note of the 
background assumptions that guide this inquiry.As we noted, for Bra- 
estrup and Freedom House, the “allies” are the United States, the 
South Vietnamese client government, and the various South Korean, 
Thai, Australian, Chinese Nationalist, and other forces (largely merce¬ 
nary) mobilized by the United States* The “South Vietnamese 51 include 
our client government and the armed forces organized, supplied, 
trained, and directed by the United States, but exclude the indigenous 
NLF and its supporters, although the U,S.government never had the 
slightest doubt, and its specialists do not hesitate to concede, that the 
client regime had little support while its opponents in South Vietnam 
constituted so powerful a political force that any peaceful settlement 
was unthinkable.That the United States has a right to conduct military 
operations in South Vietnam to uproot the NLF and destroy the peas¬ 
ant society in which it was based, that its goals are democracy and 
self-determination, and that its forces “protect” and “bring security” 
to South Vietnamese peasants are principles taken for granted in the 
Braestrup-Freedom House version, where no patriotic assumption or 
cliche is ever challenged—or even noticed, so deeply rooted are these 
doctrines.
