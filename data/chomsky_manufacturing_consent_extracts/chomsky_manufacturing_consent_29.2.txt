Defense Secretary McNamara had 
privately concluded that military victory was an unreasonable objective 
and that the course of the war should be changed- Clark Clifford, who 
was brought in to replace him after Tet, had long shared such doubts, 
and they were reinforced by the evidence available to him and by the 
conclusions of the “Wise Men” whom Johnson called in to assess the 
situation.114 Dean Acheson, who headed this group of longtime hawks 
drawn from business and political elites, agreed with Clifford's pessi¬ 
mism and “advised Johnson to scale down ground operations, reduce

the bombing* and seek every means of terminating hostilities without 
abandoning South Vietnam* 5 ’ The “Wise Men*” “after full briefings 
from diplomatic and military officials, confirmed Acheson’s findings 
* * , the consensus* as summed up by one of the participants* was that 
‘there are no military conclusions in this war—or any military end in 
the future, 5 55 so that “Johnson should therefore de-escalate the con¬ 
flict” 115 

Notice that at this point some rather serious problems arise concern¬ 
ing the second component of the Freedom House thesis: that the mis¬ 
deeds of the media caused the public to oppose the war, undermining 
government resolve and leading to U*S* failure in its (by definition, 
benevolent) aims.To establish the “stab-in-the-back” component of 
the Freedom House thesis, it is necessary to show that public opinion 
was swayed toward opposition to the war by media coverage, and that 
the media and public opinion were a significant factor in the shift of 
government policy* Neither claim can be sustained* 

With regard to the course of public opinion, the Freedom House 
study decisively refutes its own thesis.It includes a chapter on public 
opinion polls by Burns Roper, which demonstrates, as Braestrup con¬ 
cedes, that “there is no available evidence of a direct relationship 
between the dominant media themes in early 1968 and changes in 
American mass public opinion vis-4-vis the Vietnam war itself,” but 
rather a continuing “slow drift toward the dove side” after an initial 
wave of support for the president and “frustration and anger at the foe” 
during the Tet offensive* A closer examination of their own data under¬ 
mines the Freedom House thesis even more thoroughly* The early 
response to the Tet offensive, during the period when media incompe¬ 
tence and unwarranted pessimism were allegedly at their height, was 
“an increase in the belligerency of the American public 55 ; “the immedi¬ 
ate reaction of the U.S, public was to favor stiffened resistance [that 
is, U.S. resistance to an attack by South Vietnamese in South Vietnam] 
and intensified U*S. effort* 55 The major sentiment aroused was “Bomb 
the hell out of them* 55 In later February and March, when the media, 
in the Freedom House version, were beginning to “whisper 55 the true 
story of American victory, “there developed a decided negative reaction 
to the President’s handling of the war and the war itself, and a distinct 
opposition to more aggressive U*S, military action.” In early February 
1968, when the impact of the alleged media “distortions 55 and “pessi¬ 
mism 55 reached its peak, public opinion shifted toward the “hawks.” 
Public opinion returned to the pre-Tet figures by late February, when 
the media were allegedly correcting their earlier errors* By April, after 
the offensive had ended and the “errors 55 had been overcome (albeit in

a “whisper”)* there was a sharp shift toward the “doves/ 5 By April- 
May~June, measurements had returned to pre-Tet levels* “When 
looked at on this broader time scale, the Tet offensive appears merely 
to have caused a minor ripple in a steadily changing attitude toward our 
involvement in the war, 55 a shift toward the position of the doves after

mism.55 Tet was just “one more incident 55 that “reminded the public 
that the war was not going well—that the confident predictions out of 
Washington had to be taken with a grain of salt—and that helped move 
public opinion in the antiwar direction in which it had been moving for 
nearly three years, * .
