Faced with this thorough refutation of one essential component of 
their thesis, without which the thesis loses all significance even if the 
residue were tenable, the Freedom House analysts retreat to the posi¬ 
tion that although the public was unaffected by the perverse behavior 
of the media, there was an effect “on the nation's 'leadership segment 5 ” 
(Bums)—a safer claim, since, as they concede, no data are available* 
The director of the Freedom House study, Leonard Sussman, con¬ 
cludes that “the Tet offensive, as portrayed in the media, appeared to 
have had a far greater effect on political Washington and the Adminis¬ 
tration itself than on the U.S* population's sentiment on the war 51 (I, 
xxxiv).The media failures, in short, left the public unaffected or even 
more supportive of the war while they misled the government—along 
with presidential adviser Clark Clifford, the “Wise Men” from the 
corporate, political, and military elites including former top-level mili¬ 
tary commanders, and such media addicts as Dean Acheson, Henry 
Cabot Lodge, McGeorge Bundy, Douglas Dillon, Robert Murphy, etc.We are asked to believe that their decision to move toward disengage¬ 
ment in a situation that they perceived as one of stalemate was based 
not on military briefings, intelligence reports, and all the information 
available at the highest level to official Washington, but on watching the 
evening news with Walter Cronkite.u7 

In short, we can dismiss out of hand the second component of the 
Freedom House thesis, the component that had dramatic impact and 
continuing influence within the post-Vietnam “right turn 55 among elites 
and that has set the agenda for subsequent discussion about the “adver¬ 
sarial stance” of the media and its grim consequences* We are left with 
the conclusion that the media were either irrelevant, or that they con¬ 
tinued to operate within the general confines of the approved ideologi¬ 
cal system, thus refuting the first component of the thesis as well* All 
that remains of the Freedom House story is the possibility that the 
media were incompetent (even malevolent), but ineffectual.Notice that

the Freedom House thesis here faces the same “logical problem” noted 
earlier with regard to the charges concerning television: if television 1$ 
as influential as claimed* then the evidence shows that through 1967 it 
“encouraged a decisive majority of viewers to support the war,” 

To evaluate the remaining shreds of the Freedom House thesis, let 
us continue with the record of the Tet offensive, now asking whether 
the media did in fact distort it in their zealous—although utterly inef¬ 
fectual—efforts to undermine authority.
