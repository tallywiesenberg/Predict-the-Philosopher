On the ground, 
American correspondents were able to witness the war at first hand, 
gaining a view rather different from the sanitized and edited version 
presented under the control of the American military command.Media 
commentary at home reflected elite opinion in recognizing that the 
optimistic forecasts that had been relayed from Washington with little 
skepticism were inaccurate, and that a long and bitter war lay ahead.But on-the-scene reporting and domestic commentary never veered 
from the framework of the state propaganda system.In reporting the 
fighting in Ben Tre and My Tho in the Delta, for example, the press 
observed that American infantry participated while the towns were 
blasted by American bombers, helicopter gunships, navy patrol boats, 
and artillery to root out the Viet Cong—that is, the South Vietnamese 
guerrillas who “were probably living with the people,*’ according to an 
American officer quoted by Bernard Weinraub.Nonetheless, the news 
reports speak of the perceived need to “blast the city" with jets and 
helicopter gunships, particularly the poorer and most crowded sections, 
“to save other sections of the city and the lives of thousands of peo¬ 
ple ..(Lee Lescaze)—people whose lives were threatened not by the 
southern NLF guerrillas living among them but by the U.S. forces 
“defending" them from the NLF.
