Because of Tet, Weinraub explains, 
“the protection of Ben Tre was limited," and it was necessary to bring 
in troops from the U.S. Ninth Infantry Division by helicopter, and to 
carry out “bombing raids and fire by helicopter gunships and artillery" 
to “protect" Ben Tre, which “has long been a stronghold of the Viet¬ 
cong” and is “sometimes considered a Vietcong rest and recreation 
area," while surrounding hamlets “thought to be controlled by the 
Vietcong have been razed by allied bombing and artillery attacks and 
fire from armed helicopters."In Ben Tre itself, “the market place is 
rubble and near the gutted homes nearby women in shawls sit in the 
noon heat and mourn with loud groans," while “My Tho still smells of 
death,” with half the homes destroyed—thanks ro the effective “protec¬

Recall that we are now evaluating the remaining component of the 
Freedom House thesis: that the media were suppressing the American 
victory in their antiestablishment zeal.In fact* they were reporting the 
story accurately in a narrow sense* but completely within the frame¬ 
work of the government propaganda system—never questioned, in a 
shameful display of media servility.We may imagine what the reaction 
would be to a comparable performance on the part of the Nazi or Soviet 
press, Braestrup’s final comment that “a free society deserves better” 
of its media (I, 728) is accurate enough* although not quite in the sense 
intended in the Freedom House study.
