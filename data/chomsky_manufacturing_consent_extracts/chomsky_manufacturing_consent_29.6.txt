As in this example, the U.S. government claim that the Tet offensive 
was a military defeat for the Communists was widely reported, although 
the U.S, government official's perception of an initial Viet Cong victory 
goes well beyond the typical media accounts in the crime of “pessi¬ 
mism."“Journalists generally accepted the official claim that Tet was 
a military defeat for the North Vietnamese and NLF," Daniel Halim 
concludes in his review of the press and television; for example, Walter 
Cronkite, who said at once over CBS—on February 14—that “first, and 
simplest, the Vietcong suffered a military defeat," 127 Clear and forth¬ 
right- 

These facts do not comport well with what remains of the Freedom 
House thesis: the charge that until late February, the media portrayed 
the enemy’s defeat as “a defeat for the allies" in “clamourous shouts," 
only conceding from late February in a “whisper” that this was not 
quite accurate, television being the worst offender, with Walter Cron- 
kite the arch-criminal.128 It was this gross incompetence or malevolence 
that illustrates most dramatically the “mindless readiness ... to believe 
the worst of the government or of authority in general."In the real 
world, the facts were quite the opposite, and the last remnants of 
the Freedom House thesis thus disappear, apart from the charge, 
to be evaluated in the appendix, that the reporting was technically in¬ 
competent.Some would contend that the issue of “how they won," which con¬ 
cerned the American official cited earlier, is as important as “who 
won" in evaluating the significance of the Tet offensive.
