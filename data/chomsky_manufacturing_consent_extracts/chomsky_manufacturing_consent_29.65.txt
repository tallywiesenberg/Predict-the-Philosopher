This idea 
never penetrated the minds of Braestrup or his Freedom House as¬ 
sociates, however, at the time or in their study.Consider political 
scientist Milton Sacks, a specialist on Vietnam and a GVN adviser, 
thanked for “providing historical perspective" for the Freedom

THE INDOCHINA WARS (i): VIETNAM 223 


In conventional terms > it now seems clear that the Communists 
have suffered a military defeat in their Tet offensive* They have 
expended the lives of thousands of their soldiers without securing 
a single province or district town of significance* 129 

U.S. officials, in contrast* were impressed with the fact that the NLF 
and NVA occupied vast areas previously thought to be “controlled/ 5 
wreaked havoc with the pacification program, and were dislodged only 
by a further and still more violent U.S. attack on the civil society of 
South Vietnam* It was feared that it might not be an easy task to 
convince the populace that the Communists were to blame for the 
slaughter and destruction by U.S. forces.The problem, as reported 
from Hue by Marc Riboud of Le Monde in April, was that the popula¬ 
tion appeared to compare ARVN behavior unfavorably with that of the 
NVA or NLF* while the deepest bitterness and resentment was directed 
against the Americans, whose “blind and systematic bombardment” 
had turned Hue into “an assassinated city”; this reaction may have also 
been in part a residue of the deep bitterness and resentment left by the 
U.S.-backed ARVN conquest of Hue a few months earlier* 130 An IVS 
worker quoted in Newsweek said: “As difficult as this may be to believe, 
not a single Vietnamese I have met in Saigon or in the Delta blames 
the Viet Cong for the events of the past two weeks/ 5 and in its last issue 
of the Tet period, Newsweek reported from Hue, with the same surprise 
at this inexplicable reaction, that 

Curiously, moreover, few of [the population] point an accusing 
finger at the North Vietnamese* “When the NVA were here,” said 
one student, “they were polite and well-disciplined, totally dif¬ 
ferent from the government troops, the Americans, or even the 
Vietcong.” 

“The hope is that the Vietnamese people will blame the communists 
rather than the Americans for whatever damage is being done/ 5 Don 
Webster reported from Hue on February 12 in the midst of the recon¬ 
quest of the city by the U.S. Marines.Two days earlier, John Lengel 
of AP wrote that 

It is still impossible to gauge the breadth of the damage.
