The media reports that Braestrup derides were rarely as “pessimistic” 
as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff* whose summary of the 
situation led the president to order “the initiation of a complete and 
searching reassessment of the entire U.S. strategy and commitment in 
South Vietnam*” the Pentagon Papers analyst reports.1 ** 

The CIA must also be investigated for contributing to the decline of 
“free institutions” by its pessimism.A CIA paper of March I* presuma¬ 
bly uninfluenced by Walter Cronkite* expressed grave doubts about the 
GVN and ARVN and predicted that they might cease “effective func¬ 
tioning in pans of the country,” so that “virtually the entire burden of 
the war would fall on US forces.” Like Cronkite a few days earlier* they 
expected “no better than a standoff’ in the coming ten months.Penta¬ 
gon systems analysis concluded that the offensive “appears to have 
killed the [pacification] program once and for all*” drawing the conclu¬ 
sion that Braestrup falsely attributes to the media (see appendix 3)* and 
estimated that “our control of the countryside and the defense of the 
urban areas is now at pre-August 1965 levels.” It was because of this 
serious situation—not perceived American successes* as Braestrup inti¬ 
mates—that they recommended what was later to be called “Vietnami- 
zation," 

The civilian analysts in the Pentagon must be charged not only with 
undue pessimism* but also with some of the other crimes of the press.
