And the mainstream media do the 
same, limiting debate to the terms defined by the two parties and exclud¬ 
ing deliberation and expression of the position that large cuts are desir¬ 
able.The alternative presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, called for such 
cuts, but the media denied him a voice on the issues, some of them

grounds that the options afforded by the two parties sufficed.103 

The U.S. corporate community has favored an immense defense 
budget’—currently more than five times the size of that of a steadily weak¬

opening actions of trade agreements and from the supportive operations 
of the WTO, the World Bank, and the IMR But these trade agreements

in a global job market* Furthermore, globalization and trade agreements 
strengthen the political as well as the economic power of the corporate 
community, in part because they shift decision-making authority from 
democratic polities to bankers and technocrats who more reliably serve 
the transnational corporate interest.Here also, as in the case of defense- 
versus civilian-oriented budgets, polls show a sharp dichotomy between 
corporate and public preferences, with the latter generally hostile to the 
agreements and institutional arrangements favored by business.
