The propaganda model fits well the media’s treatment of this range 
of issues.Consider, for example, their coverage of the passage of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the subsequent 
Mexican financial crisis and meltdown of 1994-95.Polls taken before 
its enactment consistently showed substantial majorities opposed to 
NAFTA—and later to the bailout of investors in Mexican securities—but 
the elite in favor* Media editorials, news coverage, and selection of 
“experts” in opinion columns were heavily skewed toward the elite pref¬ 
erence; their judgment was that the benefits of NAFTA were obvious, 
were agreed to by all qualified authorities, and that only demagogues and 
“special interests” were opposed* 106 The “special interests” who might be 
the “losers” included women, minorities, and a majority of the work¬ 
force.107 The media dealt with the awkward fact that polls showed steady 
majority opposition to the agreement mainly by ignoring it, but occasion¬ 
ally they suggested that the public was uninformed and didn’t recognize 
its own true interests.108 The effort of labor to influence the outcome of 
the NAFTA debates was sharply attacked in both the New York Times and 
the Washington Post > with no comparable criticism of corporate or govern¬ 
mental (U*S* and Mexican) lobbying and propaganda.
