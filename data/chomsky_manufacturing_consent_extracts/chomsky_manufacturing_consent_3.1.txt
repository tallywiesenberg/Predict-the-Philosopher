And while labor 
was attacked for its alleged position on these issues, the press refused to 
allow the actual position to be expressed* 109 

In December 1994, only eleven months after NAFTA went into effect, 
Mexico suffered a major financial crisis, including a massive flight of cap¬ 
ital, a devaluation of the currency, and a subsequent bailout by the IMF 
that required Mexico to carry out painful deflationary measures.Despite 
the fact that the meltdown occurred within a year of the introduction of 
NAFTA, which the media had portrayed as ushering in a prospective

golden age of economic advance, they were unanimous that NAFTA 
was not to blame.And in virtual lock-step they supported the Mexican 
(investor) bailout, despite poll reports of general public opposition in the 
United States* Experts and media pundits and editorialists repeatedly 
explained that one great merit of NAFTA was that it had “locked Mexico 
in” so that it couldn’t alter its overall policy direction or resort to controls 
to protect itself from severe deflation and unemployment.They were 
oblivious to the profoundly undemocratic nature of this lock-in, made 
more questionable by the fact that it had been negotiated by a Mexican 
government that ruled as a result of electoral fraud.110 

More recently, when the growing global opposition to the policies of 
the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank led to mass protests at the WTO 
conference in Seattle in November and December 1999, and then at the 
annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D*C*, in 
April 2000, media coverage of these events was derisive and hostile to the 
protesters and almost uniformly failed to deal with the substantive issues 
that drove the protests* The media portrayed the Seattle protesters as “all¬ 
purpose agitators” (U.S. News & World Report) y “terminally aggrieved” 
(Philadelphia Inquirer ) 3 simply “against world trade 55 (ABC News), and 
making “much ado about nothing” (CNN), but the bases of the protest¬ 
ers’ grievances were almost entirely unexplored* 111 Similarly, in the case 
of the Washington, D.C., protests, the media repeatedly reported on 
activists’ attire, looks, body odors, fadism, and claimed a lack of “any¬ 
thing that can coherently be called a cause” (Michael Kelly, journalist, 
Washington Post ), and they continued their refusal to address issues* 112 
There were many informed protesters with coherent agendas at Seattle 
and Washington—including reputable economists, social theorists, and 
veteran organizers from around the world 113 —but the media did not seek 
them out, preferring to stereotype antiglobalization activists as ignorant 
troublemakers* On op-ed pages, there was a major imbalance hostile to 
the protesters.
