TV bias was at least as great, and often misleading on the 
facts* In his November 29,1999, backgrounder on the WTO, Dan Rather 
explained that the organization had ruled on many environmental issues, 
implying that those rulings were protective of the environment when in 
fact they generally privileged trade rights over environmental needs* 

Another notable feature of media reporting on both the Seattle and 
Washington, D.C., protests, and a throwback to their biased treatment 
of the protests of the Vietnam War era (1965-75), 114 was their exaggera¬ 
tion of protester violence, their downplaying of police provocations 
and violence, and their complaisance at illegal police tactics designed to 
limit all protestor actions, peaceable or otherwise* 115 Although the Seattle

police resorted to force and used chemical agents against many nonvio¬ 
lent protesters well before a handful of individuals began breaking win¬ 
dows* both then and later the media reversed this chronology* stating that 
the police violence was a response to protester violence.In fact* the van¬ 
dals were largely ignored by the police* while peaceful protesters were 
targeted for beatings, tear gas* torture with pepper spray* and arrest, 116 
One New York Times article went so far as to claim that the Seattle pro¬ 
testers had thrown excrement* rocks, and Molotov cocktails at delegates 
and police officers; the Times later issued a correction acknowledging that 
these claims were false* 117 Dan Rather, who had falsely alleged that the 
protesters had “brought on today’s crackdown” at Seattle, later suggested 
that the Washington protesters were possibly “hoping for a replay of last 
year’s violence in Seattle* 5 * setting this off against “those charged with 
keeping the peace” who “have other ideas ” 113 

In their eighty-scven-page report* Out of Control: Seattle Flawed Re¬ 
sponse to Protests Against the World Trade Organization^ the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) stated that “demonstrators [in Seattle] were 
overwhelmingly peaceful* Not so the police *” The response of the Seattle 
police to the protests was characterized by “draconian” violations of civil 
liberties* including widespread use of ^chemical weapons* rubber bullets 
and clubs against peaceful protesters and bystanders alike.55 But NBC* 
ABC* CBS, CNN, and the New York Times and Washington Post all ig¬ 
nored the release of the ACLU’s findings, which ran counter to their own 
uniformly pro-police and anti-protester line* 

The media’s reversal of chronology and inflation of the threat of ac¬ 
tivist violence* and their low-keyed treatment of numerous illegal police 
actions designed to instill fear in those wanting to protest peaceably, 119 
provided the enabling ground for both police violence and serious 
restrictions on free speech* These increased in scope and sophistication 
between Seattle and Washington* and were then applied to squelch pro¬ 
test at the Republican and Democratic conventions in Philadelphia and 
Los Angeles in July and August 2000* 120 The corporate media’s hostility 
to the goals of the protests* closely aligned with that of the rest of the cor¬ 
porate establishment* caused their devotion to the First Amendment to 
flag in a way it never has when their own rights and privileges have been 
at stake.As is suggested by the media’s treatment of NAFTA and of labor’s 
right to participate in its debates, as well as the media coverage of Water¬ 
gate* COINTELPRO, and major events in the earlier history of labor- 
management conflict (the Haymarket affair, the Homestead strike, the 
post-World War I “red scare”}* 121 the propaganda model applies to do-

siege in the United States for the past several decades, its condition 
adversely affected by the deflationary policies of the early 1980s, corpo¬ 
rate downsizings globalization, a vigorous business campaign to defeat 
unions, and government support of, or indifference to, the damage being 
inflicted on unions and workers.
