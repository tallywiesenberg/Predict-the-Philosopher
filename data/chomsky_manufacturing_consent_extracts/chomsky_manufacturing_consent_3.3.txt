This, along with the adverse trend of social indicators in the same 
period, 127 suggests that the welfare of the majority declined in this era of 
high employment, a “new economy,” and a spectacular upswing in the 
stock market.In its euphoria phase, which ended abruptly with the col¬ 
lapse of the dot.com market in 1999 and 2000, the mainstream media 
hardly noticed that only a minority had been the beneficiaries; 128 they 
briefly discovered this issue only under the impetus of Pat Buchanan's 
right-wing populist outcries during the 1996 presidential election cam-

paign.In the 2000 electoral campaign, once again the two major party 
candidates said nothing about the failure of the majority to be lifted in 
the supposed “rising tide” that would benefit everybody; only Ralph 
Nader and other marginalized candidates did, and as noted, the domi¬ 
nant media found that the agenda of the major parties was all that they 
could ask for* 

Another striking application of the propaganda model can be seen in 
the media’s treatment of the chemical industry and its regulation* Be¬ 
cause of the industry's power, as well as the media’s receptivity to the 
demands of the business community, the media have normalized a 
system described by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring as “deliberately poi¬ 
soning us, then policing the results ” 12g Industry is permitted to produce 
and sell chemicals (and during the 1990s, bioengineered foods) without 
independent and prior proof of safety, and the “policing” by the Environ¬ 
mental Protection Agency (EPA) has been badly compromised by under- 
funding and political limits on both law enforcement and testing* 130 A 
major National Research Council study of 1984 found that there was no 
health hazard data available for 78 percent of the chemicals in commerce, 
and an Environmental Defense Fund update found little change had 
occurred a dozen years later* The federal government’s National Toxicol¬ 
ogy Program tests about ten to twenty chemicals a year for carcinogenic¬ 
ity (but not for the numerous other possible adverse effects of chemicals); 
but meanwhile five hundred to a thousand new chemicals enter com¬ 
merce annually, so our knowledge base steadily declines* 131 

This system works well for industry, however, as it wants to sell with¬ 
out interference, and leaving virtually all of the research and testing 
for safety in its hands, with its members to decide when the results are 
worthy of transmission to the EPA, is a classic “fox guarding the chick¬ 
ens” arrangement.The system has worked poorly for the public, and its 
inadequacy has been reinforced by the industry's power to influence, 
sometimes even capture, the EPA.132 Nevertheless, the industry often 
contends that the safety of chemicals is assured by EPA (or FDA) regula¬ 
tion, 133 which industry does its best to keep weak and which, as noted, 
has failed to deal in any way with the great majority of chemicals in the 
market* 

With the media's help, the chemical industry has also gained wide 
acceptance of its view that chemicals should be evaluated individually 
on the basis of an analysis of their risks to individuals and individual 
tolerances* But it is very hard to measure such risks and tolerances for 
humans—controlled experiments are not possible, damage may show up 
only after many years, the forms of damage are hard to know in advance, 
chemicals may interact with others in the environment, they may be bio-

accumulative, and the breakdown products of chemicals may have their
