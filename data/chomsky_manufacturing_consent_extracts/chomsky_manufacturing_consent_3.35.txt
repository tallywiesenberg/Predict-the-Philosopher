Furthermore, if thousands of chemicals enter the environ¬ 
ment, many long-lasting, bioaccumulative, and interacting with other 
chemicals, a public policy that ignores their additive and interactive ef¬ 
fects on people and the environment is deeply flawed and irresponsible.Policy based on the “precautionary principle,” bitterly opposed by the 
chemical industry, with the support of the U.S. government, 134 would 
not allow chemicals ro enter the environment without full testing, would 
prohibit the use of chemicals that accumulate in human tissues and 
whose breakdown products are threatening or unknown, and would 
compel The use of nonthreatening alternatives for untested and known- 
to-be-risky chemicals where such alternatives can be found or developed 
at reasonable cost.135 

In successfully avoiding application of the precautionary principle, 
industry spokespersons have argued that the existing system is based on 
“sound science.” Bur science does not tell us that industry has any right 
to put chemicals into the environment that have any risk at all, let alone 
telling us what risks are acceptable—these are political decisions.Fur¬ 
thermore, if the chemicals in the environment have not been tested for all 
the variables that are relevant to social choices, such as their long-term 
effects on immune systems and reproduction as well as any cancer threat, 
and the effects of their breakdown products on the environment—and 
none of them have been so tested—the political, not scientific, basis of 
“sound science 55 is evident.The chemical industry has produced, and long denied any harm from, 
innumerable products—from tetraethyl lead in gasoline and PCBs in 
batteries to asbestos, DDT, and Agent Orange—that are now well estab¬ 
lished as seriously harmful, only withdrawing them (often only from 
domestic use) under overwhelming legal and regulatory pressure.
