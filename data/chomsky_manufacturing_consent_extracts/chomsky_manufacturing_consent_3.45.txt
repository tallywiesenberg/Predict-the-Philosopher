138 In short, the 
media have internalized industry's self-legitimizing usage, just as they 
have normalized a status quo of caveat emptor (buyer beware) rather 
than of safety first.The media have also regularly gotten on board in dismissing concerns 
about chemical threats as unwarranted “scares,” such as the alleged scares 
over dioxin and the danger of Alar on apples.But these and other scares 
often turn out to be based on genuine health hazards.13 ^ Meanwhile, the 
media rarely report and examine in any depth the frequent evidence of 
the inadequacy of regulation and testing and of the real costs of chemical¬ 
ization of the environment.140 For example, the International Joint Com¬ 
mission (IJC), a joint Canadian-U.S. venture dating back to 1978, was 
given the formidable task of trying to halt the flow of toxic chemicals into 
the Great Lakes.
