It reports each year that it is failing, and since 1992 has 
called for the ending of the manufacture of chlorine as essential to fulfill¬ 
ing its task.The national media virtually ignore this appeal, and the IJC’s 
US.cochairman Gordon Durnil has remarked that “we have a societal 
problem about how to deal with this, but 90 percent of the population 
doesn't even know there is anything to worry about” 141 We believe that 
the propaganda model helps understand this lack of knowledge.In the health insurance controversy of 1992-93, the media's refusal 
to take the single-payer option seriously, despite apparent widespread 
public support and the effectiveness of the system in Canada, served well 
the interests of the insurance and medical service complex.142 The un¬ 
critical media reporting and commentary on the alleged urgency of fiscal 
restraint and a balanced budget in the years 1992-96 fit well the business 
community's desire to reduce the social budget and weaken regula¬ 
tion.
