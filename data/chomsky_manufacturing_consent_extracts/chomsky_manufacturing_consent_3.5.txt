ical pressure and financial stringency, “the 90 s have seen a tidal wave of 
commercialism overtake public broadcasting,” with public broadcasters 
“rushing as fast as they can to merge their services with those offered by 
commercial networks And in the process of what Ledbetter calls the 
“mailing” of public broadcasting, its already modest differences from the 
commercial networks have almost disappeared* Most important, in their 
programming “they share either the avoidance or the defanging of con¬ 
temporary political controversy, the kind that would bring trouble from 
powerful patrons .” 10 

Some argue that the Internet and the new communications technolo¬ 
gies are breaking the corporate stranglehold on journalism and opening 
an unprecedented era of interactive democratic media. And it is true 
and important that the Internet has increased the efficiency and scope 
of individual and group networking. This has enabled people to escape 
the mainstream media’s constraints in many and diverse cases. Japanese 
women have been able to tap newly created Web sites devoted to their 
problems, where they can talk and share experiences and information 
with their peers and obtain expert advice on business, financial, and per¬ 
sonal matters , 11 Chiapas resisters against abuse by the Mexican army and 
government were able to mobilize an international support base in 1995 
to help them publicize their grievances and put pressure on the Mexican 
government to change its policies in the region , 12 The enlarged ability of 
Bolivian peasants protesting against World Bank privatization programs 
and user fees for water in 2000 , and Indonesian students taking to the 
streets against the Suharto dictatorship in Indonesia in 1998 , to commu¬ 
nicate through The Internet produced a level of publicity and global 
attention that had important consequences: Bechtel Corporation, owner 
of the newly privatized water system in Bolivia that had quickly doubled 
water rates, backed off and the privatization sale was rescinded; the pro¬ 
tests and associated publicity, along with the 199 S financial crisis , helped 
drive Suharto from office . 13 

Broader protest movements have also benefited from Internet-based 
communication. When the leading members of the World Trade Organi¬ 
zation (WTO) attempted in 1998 to push through in secret a Multilateral 
Agreement on Investment that would have protected further the rights of 
international investors as against the rights of democratic bodies within 
states, the Internet was extremely valuable in alerting opposition forces 
to the threat and helping mobilize an opposition that prevented accept-

ance of this agreement . 14 Similarly, in the protest actions against the 
WTO meetings in Seattle in November 1999 and the IMF and World 
Bank annual gatherings in Washington* D.C.* in April 2000 , communi¬ 
cation via the Internet played an important role both in organizing the
