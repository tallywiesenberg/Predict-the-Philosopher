In our conclusion to the first edition* we emphasized that* as the nega¬ 
tive performance effects of the media result primarily from their struc¬ 
ture and objectives* real change in performance calls for substantial 
changes in underlying media organization and goals.In the years since 
1988* structural changes have not been favorable to improved perform¬ 
ance* but it remains a central truth That democratic politics requires a 
democratization of information sources and a more democratic media.Along with trying to contain and reverse the growing centralization of the 
mainstream media, grassroots movements and intermediate groups that 
represent large numbers of ordinary citizens should put much more 
energy and money into creating and supporting their own media—as 
they did with the Independent Media Centers brought into existence 
during the Seattle and Washington* D.C.* protests of 1999 and 2000.These* and other nonprofit community-based broadcasting stations and 
networks* and a better use of public-access channels, the Internet* and 
independent print media* will be essential for the achievement of major 
democratic social and political successes.Notes to Introduction

denounce the press as unpatriotic; see Bill Keller* “Soviet Official Says Press 
Harms Army,” Ate York Times, January 21, 1988.
