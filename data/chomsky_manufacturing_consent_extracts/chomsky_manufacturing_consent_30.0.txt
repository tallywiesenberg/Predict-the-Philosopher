The logic of the Freedom House brief 
against the media is highly revealing.In their view, the media in a free 
society must not only accept without question the principles of the state 
doctrinal system, as the media did throughout (a fact that Freedom 
House never addresses, and apparently cannot perceive), but must do 
so with a degree of enthusiasm and optimism that exceeds that of ILS.intelligence, the military command, Johnson’s “Wise Men,” and other 
leading figures in the military, political, and corporate world who draw 
their information from a full range of government sources.It is an 
interesting conception of a “free society-” 

We might ask how the Freedom House conception of a free press in 
a free society would be applied by Soviet commissars, let us say, to the 
case of the mass circulation weekly Ogonyok, which published a series 
of long articles that presented a “bleak picture” of the war in Afghanis¬ 
tan, depicting it “in stark terms,” speaking of “poor morale and deser¬ 
tion” among Afghan units and “tough fighting between elite Soviet 
troops and Afghan guerrillas,” and implying that “large areas of Afg¬ 
hanistan are under guerrilla control.” The articles also give “a broad 
hint that drug use is common among Russian troops in Afghanistan,” 
and they include extracts from a helicopter pilot’s journal describing 
“the sight and smell of colleagues’ charred bodies” and implying that 
“helicopter losses are high” after the receipt of sophisticated Western 
weaponry by the guerrillas, terrorists who finance themselves by pro¬ 
ducing drugs for the international market (charges verified by Western 
observers, incidentally).But it would be inhumane for the USSR simply 
to withdraw without guarantees for the population, because “a Soviet

withdrawal would lead to nationwide internecine warfare, 5 * as Afghans 
who are quoted anticipate* The article does not simply mimic standard 
U*S* media fare* as these excerpts indicate* Thus it describes an attack 
on Soviet villages by Afghan guerrillas; one can imagine the U*S* reac¬ 
tion had there been a Viet Cong attack on villages in Texas, But by 
Freedom House standards, it is plain that the editors merit severe 
censure for their “adversarial stance, 5 * “pessimism, 55 and “volatile 
styles, 5 * “always with the dark possibility that, if the managers do not 
themselves take action, then outsiders [in the government] will seek to 
apply remedies of their own” 134 And, in fact, in Januaiy 1988, General 
Dimitri T, Yakov, the Soviet defense minister, applied Freedom House 
and Braestrup principles to the “adversarial 55 Soviet press, sharply 
criticizing articles in Ogonyok and Literatumaya Gazeta for reporting 
on the Afghan war in ways that undermined public confidence in the 
Soviet army and played into the hands of the West* 135 

In the light of the evidence presented in the Freedom House study, 
and of much that is ignored, the following conclusions seem reasonable.
