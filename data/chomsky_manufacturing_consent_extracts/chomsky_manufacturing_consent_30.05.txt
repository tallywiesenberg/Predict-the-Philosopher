During the Tet offensive and its aftermath, media performance was 
creditable, sometimes very highly so, in a narrow sense* More broadly, 
this reporting was highly deceptive in that it was framed within the 
unchallenged and unrecognized doctrines of the state propaganda sys¬ 
tem, which impose a severe distortion.Media reports compare favora¬ 
bly in accuracy with those available to official Washington at the highest 
level from internal sources, although they were regularly less alarmist, 
perhaps because the media tended to give credence to official state¬ 
ments and were unaware of the internal assessments.The repons from 
the scene led media commentators to draw approximately the same 
conclusions as Johnson*s high-level advisers* The manner in which the 
media covered the events had little effect on public opinion, except 
perhaps to enhance its aggressiveness and, of course, to instill ever more 
deeply the basic and unexamined tenets of the propaganda system* 
As we shall see in appendix 3, a closer examination establishes these 
conclusions still more firmly, while demonstrating further the utter 
incompetence—to use the kindest term—of the Freedom House study 
that has been so influential in the subsequent period* 

We have now addressed the argument presented by critics of the 
media for its alleged “adversarial stance 55 on their own chosen grounds, 
the grounds that they select as the strongest for their case.The propa¬ 
ganda model is once again confirmed, thus meeting the most severe test 
that can be posed* The model is also vindicated by the manner in which 
Freedom House fulfills its function as a flak machine, attempting to 
bully the media into a still more thoroughgoing conformity with the

5.5*3- The Paris Peace Agreements 

The Tet offensive convinced large sectors of elite opinion that the costs 
of the U.S. effort were too high- Lyndon Johnson stepped down.In 
what was termed by the government a “bombing halt/ 5 and reported 
as such* the bombers were shifted from North Vietnamese targets to 
Laos, where the defenseless rural society of scattered villages in the 
North was demolished, and later Cambodia, where the same was true 
on an even more horrendous scale.
