As we have seen, opportunities 
for a peaceful diplomatic settlement had long existed, but they had 
never been pursued because they were regarded as inconsistent with the 
essential goal: preservation of an “independent” South Vietnam that 
would be a U.S. client state.By October 1972, the negotiators in Paris had reached the essential 
terms of an agreement: the 9-Poim Plan, President Nixon, however, 
objected to the terms of the agreement, and the Thieu government in

Saigon was completely opposed to them* Nixon's hope was to delay 
further negotiations until after the November presidential elections* 
when he would have more leverage* 137 The delay would also permit a 
vast shipment of arms to the GVN, something that would surely be 
prohibited by the agreements* 

In an effort to pressure Nixon to sign the agreements, the DRV made 
the terms public on October 26 in a radio broadcast* In a Washington 
press conference, Kissinger stated that the Radio Hanoi broadcast gave 
“on the whole a very fair account,” then offering the following para¬ 
phrase: “As was pointed out by Radio Hanoi, the existing authorities 
with respect to both internal and external politics would remain in 
office” in the South* Thus Kissinger sought to insinuate that according 
to the accurate account on Radio Hanoi, the GVN (“the existing au¬ 
thorities”) would remain “in office” as the government of the South, 
and would somehow deal with the other “party,” whose status remained 
mysterious* But “what was pointed out by Radio Hanoi”—correctly, as 
Kissinger conceded—was something quite different, namely, that “the 
two present administrations in South Vietnam will remain in existence 
with their respective domestic and external functions,” these being the 
GVN and the PRG (based upon the NLF)* Having reached agreement, 
these two parties were then to move toward reunification, to be “carried 
out step by step through peaceful means,” with no external—meaning 
U*S.—interference.The differences are crucial* From its earliest days, the war was 
fought over the question of whether “the South Vietnamese people 
shall decide themselves the political future of South Vietnam,” as the 
October 9-Point Plan explicitly stipulated must be the case, or whether 
the United States would enforce the rule of its client regime, the GVN, 
as the sole legitimate government in the South, in accordance with 
Kissinger's version of the terms to which he had theoretically agreed, 
a version that plainly departed radically from the text* 138 

Kissinger's announcement that “peace is at hand,” designed with the 
upcoming U*S. presidential elections in mind, was also blatant decep¬ 
tion* As his distortion of the essential terms of the agreement clearly 
revealed, the United States was backing away from the settlement and 
refusing to implement it* Nixon later explained that “We had to use 
[Kissinger's press conference] to undercut the North Vietnamese prop¬ 
aganda maneuver [namely, making public the terms of the agreement] 
and to make sure that our version of the agreement was the one that 
had great public impact*” 139 This result was substantially achieved; the 
media characteristically accepted Kissinger's version with no recogni¬ 
tion that it was diametrically opposed to the terms of the 9-Point Plan,

though the facts were plain to anyone who troubled to look at the 
readily available public record* 

The United States then proceeded with a vast shipment of arms to 
the GVN while demanding substantial changes in the October agree¬ 
ments.Hanoi* in contrast* publicly insisted that the October agreements 
be signed* The media adopted the version of events relayed regularly 
by Kissinger* depicting him as caught between two irrational adversar¬ 
ies* Hanoi and Saigon* The Christmas bombings of Hanoi and Hai¬ 
phong followed* causing great damage and also the loss of several dozen 
B-52S (the exact numbers are contested* but the losses clearly shocked 
the Pentagon)* as well as a highly adverse world reaction* although the 
media continued to relay the Washington interpretation of what had 
happened.Thus Stanley Karnow wrote that “evidently” the primary 
aim of “Nixon’s bombings of Hanoi” was “to compel the North Viet¬ 
namese to return to negotiations*” a curious version of the readily 
available facts* 140 After the military and political failures of the Christ¬ 
mas bombings* the U.S, government then signed the January peace 
agreements* which were virtually identical to the terms it had rejected 
the preceding October—and* still more significant* were hardly differ¬ 
ent in essentials from the NLF proposals of the early 1960s* which 
caused such dismay in Washington and compelled the U*S. government 
to escalate the war so as to prevent a political settlement* thus virtually 
destroying Indochina* with millions of casualties and three countries 
utterly devastated—a fact considered of little moment in the West.
