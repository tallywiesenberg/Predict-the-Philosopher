foreign interference*” the “military demarcation line” at the 17th paral¬ 
lel is to be regarded as “only provisional and not a political or territorial 
boundary” (article 15).In the South, there are two parallel and equiva¬ 
lent “South Vietnamese parties/’ the GVN and the PRG, This is the 
central element of the agreements* which proceed to specify in detail 
the responsibilities and commitments of the two “South Vietnamese 
parties*” These are to achieve national reconciliation through peaceful 
means, under conditions of full democratic freedoms, while “Foreign 
countries shall not impose any political tendency or personality on the 
South Vietnamese people” and “the United States will not continue its 
military involvement or intervene in the internal affairs of South Viet¬ 
nam” (articles 9c, 4).“The two South Vietnamese parties undertake to 
respect the cease-fire and maintain peace in South Vietnam, settle all 
matters of contention through negotiations, and avoid all armed con¬ 
flict” (article 10)* Furthermore, “the two South Vietnamese parties” 
will proceed to “Achieve national reconciliation and concord* end ha¬ 
tred and enmity, prohibit all acts of reprisal and discrimination against 
individuals or organizations that have collaborated with one side or the 
other,” and* in general, “ensure the democratic liberties of the people,” 
which are outlined, along with procedures to ensure the reconciiation 
undertaken by “the two South Vietnamese parties” (articles 11,12)* The 
agreements committed “the two South Vietnamese parties” not to “ac¬ 
cept the introduction of troops, military advisers* and military person¬ 
nel including technical military personnel, armaments, munitions, and 
war material into South Vietnam” and called for a “total withdrawal” 
of all such personnel within sixty days, while “the two South Viet¬ 
namese parties” will settle “The question of Vietnamese armed forces 
in South Vietnam * * .without foreign interference” (articles 5, 7, 13), 
In his January 24 press conference , Kissinger made it clear that the 
United States maintained the right to provide “civilian technicians 
serving in certain of the military branches,” and as its forces were 
withdrawn after the signing of the agreements, the United States pro¬ 
ceeded to keep or introduce 7,200 “contract civilians” to “handle main¬ 
tenance, logistics* and training jobs formerly performed by the U,S, 
military,” many of them “retired military men*” under the supervision 
of a U*S. major-general, 141 The provisions concerning technical per¬ 
sonnel were thus at once nullified* along with the U*S* pledge to refrain 
from any intervention “in the internal affairs of South Vietnam*” 

In a speech of January 23, Nixon announced that the GVN would 
be recognized as the “sole legitimate government in South Vietnam,” 
nullifying articles 9c and 4 as well as the basic principle of the agree¬ 
ments: that the two parallel and equivalent “South Vietnamese parties”

are to proceed toward a settlement with no U.S. interference or effort
