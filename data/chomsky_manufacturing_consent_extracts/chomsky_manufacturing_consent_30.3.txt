In 
its "‘summary of basic dements of the Vietnam agreements” on January 
24, the White House announced that “the government of the Republic 
of (South) Vietnam continues in existence, recognized by the United 
States, its constitutional structure and leadership intact and un¬ 
changed”—the reason for the parentheses being that this “constitu¬ 
tional structure” identifies the GVN as the government of all Vietnam.This “constitutional structure” also outlawed the second of the two 
parallel and equivalent parties, along with “pro-communist neutralism” 
and any form of expression “aimed at spreading Communist policies, 
slogans and instructions”; and the GVN announced at once that such 
“illegal” actions would be suppressed by force, while President Thieu 
stated that “this is solely a ceasefire agreement, no more no less.” 145 
With these declarations, the United States and its client regime thus 
nullified the central principle of the Paris Agreements, and flatly re¬ 
jected the provisions for “the two South Vietnamese parties” to achieve 
“national reconciliation and concord” by peaceful means without 
forceful measures or repression.In short, the United States announced at once, clearly and without 
equivocation, that it intended to disregard every essential provision of 
the scrap of paper it was compelled to sign in Paris.Kissinger attempted to obfuscate the matter in his January 24 press 
conference, reprinted in full in the New York Times , 143 He claimed, 
falsely, that “we have achieved substantial changes” from the October 
9-Point Plan, thus implicitly offering a justification for the Christmas 
bombings.He stated that “what the civil war has been all about” is 
“who is the legitimate ruler of South Vietnam” and “is there such a 
thing as a South Vietnam even temporarily until unification,” claiming 
that the United States had achieved its objectives on these points by 
virtue of the “specific references to the sovereignty of South Vietnam” 
and “the right of the South Vietnamese people to self-determination”; 
and he claimed that the United States had also achieved its goal with 
regard to the status of the demarcation line.
