Thus Joseph Kraft, a liberal 
dove on these issues, wrote that “Much of the blame goes to the 
Communists 55 for the subsequent breakdown of the cease-fire, because 
“Hanoi has never abandoned the objective of unifying all of Vietnam”; 
that is, Hanoi has never abandoned its objective of living up to the 
terms of the Geneva Accords of 1954, now explicitly reiterated in the 
Paris Agreements of January 1973.145 As a dove, he also added that “just 
as much of the blame goes to President Thieu”—but none, of course, 
can be assigned to Washington, He cites Communist military actions 
in the South and dispatch of equipment as the major reason for the 
breakdown of the cease-fire, citing no evidence; as we shall see, the 
facts reveal quite a different reason.At the liberal extreme of U.S. opinion, Tom Wicker wrote that 

American policy, which never accepted the Geneva agreement, 
came to insist, instead, that South Vietnam was a legally con¬ 
stituted nation being subverted and invaded by another power; 
and that view is implied even in the documents that finally pro¬ 
duced the cease-fire.14 * 

Wicker adopts Kissinger's version, which is in explicit contradiction to 
the actual documents; these simply reiterate the long-held position of 
the NLF and Hanoi with regard to the status of South Vietnam.In the New Republic, Stanley Karnow wrote that “the Vietcong 
considers [the PRG] to be a parallel administration, 5 * failing to observe 
that it is not only “the Vietcong,” but also the Paris Agreements just 
signed by the United States government that assign to the PRG a status 
exactly parallel to that of the GVN.
