Equally vital to the Nixon Ad¬ 
ministration was specific mention of the “sovereignty” of the 
Saigon government, and on this point, too, the U.S* had its way, 
Hanoi finally conceded that, in Kissinger's words, “there is an 
entity called South Vietnam.” In one important sense, the dispute 
over that question was what the war in Vietnam was all about.143 

Again, utterly and transparently false in every respect, as a comparison 
with the text just quoted immediately demonstrates, although in accord 
with Kissinger's deceptive version of the agreements, taken as sac¬ 
rosanct by the loyal media.An honest and independent press would have announced the January 
agreements with headlines reading: “U.S.Announces Intention to Vio¬ 
late the Agreements Signed in Paris.” An informed press would have 
observed further that the Paris Agreements incorporate the principles 
rejected by the United States at Geneva twenty years earlier, as well 
as the essential principles of the NLF program of the early 1960s, which 
were similar to those advocated by Vietnamese quite generally and 
constituted the crucial fact that impelled the United States to escalate 
the war so as to block a political settlement among Vietnamese.The 
actual press simply adopted Washington's version of the agreements, 
never mentioning that this version contradicted them in every essential 
respect and thus guaranteed that the war would go on—as it did.
