As part of its 
immediate efforts to sabotage this agreement, the State Department 
called the Latin American ambassadors to Washington, where they 
were presented with “a copy of the 1973 Paris peace agreement that was 
negotiated to end the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War,” the Wall 
Street Journal reported, adding that “the agreement was subsequently

ignored by North Vietnam*” The Journal explained that this unfortu¬ 
nate “Vietnam experience,” which proved that agreements with Com¬ 
munists are not worth the paper they are printed on, is one factor in 
administration “skepticism” about the Central American agreement.Copies of the 1973 Paris Agreements were distributed to the envoys “as 
a case study of how an agreement with ambiguous provisions could be 
exploited and even ignored by a Communist government,” Neil Lewis 
reported in the lead story in the New York Times> adding: “In violation 
of the 1973 accord, North Vietnam overran South Vietnam and united 
the two parts of Vietnam under its banner in 1975*” 151 The utility of a 
carefully crafted historical record, designed by the loyal media to serve 
the needs of state power, is revealed here with much clarity.Surveying these events, we reach essentially the same conclusions as 
before, although once again the performance of the media—at the peak 
period of their alleged “independence” and “adversarial stance”—goes 
well beyond the predictions of the propaganda model, exceeding the 
expected norm of obedience to the state authorities and reaching the 
level that one finds in totalitarian states* As before, the servility of the 
media made a significant contribution to ensuring that the slaughter in 
Indochina would continue and that the U.S. government would be able 
to exploit its “Vietnam experience,” as filtered through the media, for 
later exercises in international terrorism.The remarkable performance 
of the media also laid the basis for the postwar interpretation of “what 
the war was all about” and why the United States failed to attain its 
ends, a matter to which we turn in the next section.5*6.
