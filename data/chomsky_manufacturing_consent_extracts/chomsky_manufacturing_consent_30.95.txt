Some feel 
that there may once have been a debt but that it has been amply repaid.Under the headline “The Debt to the Indochinese Is Becoming a Fiscal 
Drain,” Bernard Gwertzman quotes a State Department official who 
“said he believed the United States has now paid its moral debt for its 
involvement on the losing side in Indochina,” The remark, which also 
passed without comment, is illuminating: we owe no debt for mass 
slaughter and for leaving three countries in ruins, no debt to the mil¬ 
lions of maimed and orphaned, to the peasants who still die today from 
exploding ordnance left from the U.S. assault- Rather, our moral debt 
results only from the fact that we did not win.By this logic, if the 
Russians win in Afghanistan, they will have no moral debt at all Pro¬ 
ceeding further, how have we paid our moral debt for failing to win?By resettling Vietnamese refugees fleeing the lands we ravaged, “one 
of the largest, most dramatic humanitarian efforts in history” according 
to Roger Winter, director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees.But 
“despite the pride,” Gwertzman continues, “some voices in the Reagan 
Administration and in Congress are once again asking whether the war 
debt has now been paid.
