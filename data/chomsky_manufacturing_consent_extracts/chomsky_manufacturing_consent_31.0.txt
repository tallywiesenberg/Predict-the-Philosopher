the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news 
fit to print, marginalize dissent, and allow the government and domi¬ 
nant private interests to get their messages across to the public* The 
essential ingredients of our propaganda model, or set of news “filters,” 
fall under the following headings: (i) the size, concentrated ownership, 
owner wealth, and profit orientation of the dominant mass-media firms; 
(2) advertising as the primary income source of the mass media; (3) the 
reliance of the media on information provided by government, business, 
and “experts” funded and approved by these primary sources and 
agents of power; (4) “flak” as a means of disciplining the media; and 
(5) “anticommunism” as a national religion and control mechanism. 
These elements interact with and reinforce one another* The raw mate¬ 
rial of news must pass through successive filters, leaving only the 
cleansed residue fit to print* They fix the premises of discourse and 
interpretation, and the definition of what is newsworthy in the first 
place, and they explain the basis and operations of what amount to 
propaganda campaigns* 

The elite domination of the media and marginalization of dissi¬ 
dents that results from the operation of these filters occurs so natu¬ 
rally that media news people, frequently operating with complete 
integrity and goodwill, are able to convince themselves that they 
choose and interpret the news “objectively” and on the basis of pro¬ 
fessional news values. Within the limits of the filter constraints they 
often are objective; the constraints are so powerful, and are built into 
the system in such a fundamental way, that alternative bases of news 
choices are hardly imaginable. In assessing the newsworthiness of the 
U,S* government's urgent claims of a shipment of MIGs to Nicaragua 
on November 5, 1984, the media do not stop to ponder the bias that 
is inherent in the priority assigned to government-supplied raw mate¬ 
rial, or the possibility that the government might be manipulating the 
news, 2 imposing its own agenda, and deliberately diverting attention 
from other material. 3 It requires a macro, alongside a micro- (story- 
by-story), view of media operations, to see the pattern of manipula¬ 
tion and systematic bias. 

Let us turn now to a more detailed examination of the main constitu¬ 
ents of the propaganda model, which will be applied and tested in the 
chapters that follow. 



A PROPAGANDA MODEL 3 


1.1* SIZE, OWNERSHIP, AND 
PROFIT ORIENTATION OF 
THE MASS MEDIA: 

THE FIRST FILTER 

In their analysis of the evolution of the media in Great Britain, James 
Curran and Jean Seaton describe how, in the first half of the nineteenth 
century, a radical press emerged that reached a national working-class 
audience. This alternative press was effective in reinforcing class con¬ 
sciousness: it unified the workers because it fostered an alternative 
value system and framework for looking at the world, and because it 
“promoted a greater collective confidence by repeatedly emphasizing 
the potential power of working people to effect social change through 
the force of ^combination 5 and organized action* 554 This was deemed a 
major threat by the ruling elites* One MP asserted that the working- 
class newspapers “inflame passions and awaken their selfishness, con¬ 
trasting their current condition with what they contend to be their 
future condition—a condition incompatible with human nature, and 
those immutable laws which Providence has established for the regula¬ 
tion of civil society.” 5 The result was an attempt to squelch the work¬ 
ing-class media by libel laws and prosecutions, by requiring an 
expensive security bond as a condition for publication, and by imposing 
various taxes designed to drive out radical media by raising their costs. 
These coercive efforts were not effective, and by mid-century they had 
been abandoned in favor of the liberal view that the market would 
enforce responsibility* 

Curran and Seaton show that the market did successfully accomplish 
what state intervention failed to do. Following the repeal of the punitive 
taxes on newspapers between 1853 and 1869, a new daily local press 
came into existence, but not one new local working-class daily was 
established through the rest of the nineteenth century, Curran and 
Seaton note that 

Indeed, the eclipse of the national radical press was so total that 
when the Labour Party developed out of the working-class move¬ 
ment in the first decade of the twentieth century, it did not obtain 
the exclusive backing of a single national daily or Sunday paper, 6 

One important reason for this was the rise in scale of newspaper enter¬ 
prise and the associated increase in capital costs from the mid- 
nineteenth century onward, which was based on technological

improvements along with the owners* increased stress on reaching large 
audiences. The expansion of the free market was accompanied by an 
“industrialization of the press.” The total cost of establishing a national 
weekly on a profitable basis in 1837 was under a thousand pounds* with 
a break-even circulation of 6*200 copies. By 1867* the estimated start-up
