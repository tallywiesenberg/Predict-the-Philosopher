So profound is 
the U.S. commitment to humanitarian imperatives and moral values 
that it cannot permit these lofty ideals to be tainted by associating them 
with such trivial concerns and indecent requests, 166 It is difficult to 
know how to react to a cultural climate in which such words can be 
spoken, evoking no reaction.According to standard state and media doctrine, South Vietnam (i,e*,

the war at that time and for several years after included few representa¬ 
tives of mainstream liberalism.Corry’s argument for North Vietnamese 
aggression, however* is as impressive as any that have been presented.
