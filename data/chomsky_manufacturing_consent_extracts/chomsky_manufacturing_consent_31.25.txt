In contrast to the war protestors, two commentators explain, 
“decent, patriotic Americans demanded—and in the person of Ronald 
Reagan have apparently achieved—a return to pride and patriotism, a 
reaffirmation of the values and virtues that had been trampled upon by 
the Vietnam-spawned counterculture” 172 —most crucially, the virtues 
of marching in parades chanting praises for their leaders as they con¬ 
duct their necessary chores, as in Indochina and El Salvador, 

The extent of this servility is revealed throughout the tenth-anniver¬ 
sary retrospectives, not only by the omission of the war itself but also 
by the interpretation provided.The New York Times writes sardonically 
of the “ignorance” of the American people* only 60 percent of whom 
are aware that the United States “sided with South Vietnam”—as Nazi 
Germany sided with France, as the USSR now sides with Afghanistan.Given that we were engaged in “a defense of freedom” in South Viet¬ 
nam (Charles Krauthammer), it must be that the critics of this noble 
if flawed enterprise sided with Hanoi, and that is indeed what standard 
doctrine maintains; the fact that opposition to American aggression in 
South Vietnam, or even against the North, entails no such support, just 
as opposition to Soviet aggression entails no support for either the 
feudalist forces of the Afghan resistance or Pakistan or the United 
States, is an elementary point that inevitably escapes the mind of the 
well-indoctrinated intellectual.The Times retrospective alleges that 
North Vietnam was “portrayed by some American intellectuals as the 
repository of moral rectitude,” No examples are given, nor is evidence 
presented to support these charges, and the actual record is, as always, 
scrupulously ignored.Critics of the peace movement are quoted ex-

pounding on its “moral failure of terrifying proportions,” and several 
“former peace activists who had leaped across the ideological divide 5 * 
and now “are taking their stand with conservative Christians” of the 
Reaganite variety are quoted at length* But those who are allegedly 
guilty of these “terrifying” crimes are given no opportunity to explain 
the basis for their opposition to U.S* aggression and massacre.
