land has had a particularly important role in the U.S. regional system 
since 1954, when the National Security Council laid out a plan for 
subversion and eventual aggression throughout Southeast Asia, in re¬ 
sponse to the Geneva Accords, with Thailand serving as its “focal 
point” and, subsequently, as a major base for the U.S* attacks on 
Vietnam and Laos.m In his personal Times retrospective.Pentagon 
Papers director Leslie Gelb observes that ten years after the war ended, 
“the position of the United States in Asia is stronger” than at any time 
since World War II, despite “the defeat of South Vietnam,” quoting 
“policy analysts” from government and scholarship who observe that 
“Thailand and Indonesia , ..were able to get themselves together 
politically, economically and militarily to beat down Communist insur¬ 
gencies,” in the manner just indicated, as were the Philippines and 
South Korea, also graced with a U.S.-backed military coup in 1972* 179 
The business press had drawn the same conclusions years earlier, dur¬

stantial local victory in Indochina, left in ruins.
