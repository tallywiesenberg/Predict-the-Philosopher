The U.S. victory was 
particularly significant within South Vietnam, where the peasant-based 
revolutionary forces were decimated and the rural society was demol¬ 
ished* “One hard-core revolutionary district just outside Saigon, Cu 
Chi,” Paul Quinn-Judge observes, “sent 16,000 men and women to fight 
for the National Liberation Front.Some 9,900 did not return.” Much 
the same was true throughout the South.“The deaths left a major 
political gap for the new regime,” he adds* “The south was stripped of 
the trained, disciplined and presumably committed young cadres who 
would have formed the backbone of the present administration* In 
many areas the losses were near complete- - * * And the casualties put 
further strains on the state’s limited financial and organisation capaci- 
ties.” m The U.S. victory over the overwhelmingly rural society of 
South Vietnam, always the primary enemy, laid the basis for the take¬ 
over by North Vietnam (as anticipated years earlier in the much- 
derided peace-movement literature), 182 allowing American hypocrites 
to “prove” that this predictable consequence of the war they supported 
shows that it was a just “defense of South Vietnam” against northern 
aggressors.In the cities, swollen with millions of refugees, the lucky and 
the more corrupt survived on an American dole at a level that had no 
relation to the now-demolished productive capacity of the country, 
leaving another near-insoluble problem that can conveniently be 
blamed on the Communists.The revolutionary forces had gained vic¬ 
tory in many rural areas by the time of the outright U.S* invasion.
