THE INDOCHINA WARS (i): VIETNAM 247 


largely through their appeal to the peasantry* as documented in the 
more serious scholarly work from sources in or close to the U.S. gov¬ 
ernment (“The Early Stages*” p, 186).But “many of the conclusions [of 
this work] have been invalidated by the events after Tet,” New York 
Times Asia correspondent Fox Butterfield observes* a coy reference to 
the fact that this political success was overturned by the U.S. outburst 
of savagery in the post-Tet mass murder operations.183 

That the United States suffered a “defeat” in Indochina is a natural 
perception on the part of those of limitless ambition* who understand 
“defeat” to mean the achievement only of major goals* while certain 
minor ones remain beyond our grasp.The perception of an unqualified 
U.S. “defeat” in the media retrospectives and similar commentary is 
understandable in part in these terms* in part in terms of the alleged 
goal of “defending freedom” developed in official propaganda and 
relayed by the ideological institutions.Postwar U.S. policy has been designed to ensure that the victory is 
maintained by maximizing suffering and oppression in Indochina, 
which then evokes further gloating here.
