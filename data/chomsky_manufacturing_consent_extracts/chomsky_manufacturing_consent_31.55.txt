Since “the destruction is 
mutual*” as is readily demonstrated by a stroll through New York* 
Boston, Vinh, Quang Ngai Province* and the Plain of Jars* we are 
entitled to deny reparations* aid* and trade, and to block development 
funds.The extent of U.S. sadism is noteworthy, as is the (null) reaction 
to it.In 1977* when India tried to send a hundred buffalo to Vietnam 
ro replenish the herds destroyed by U.S. violence, the United States 
threatened to cancel “food-for-peace” aid, while the press featured 
photographs of peasants in Cambodia pulling plows as proof of Com¬ 
munist barbarity; the photographs in this case were probable fabrica¬ 
tions of Thai intelligence* but authentic ones could* no doubt* have 
been obtained throughout Indochina.The Carter administration even 
denied rice to Laos (despite a cynical pretense to the contrary), where 
the agricultural system was destroyed by U.S. terror bombing.Oxfam 
America was not permitted to send ten solar pumps to Cambodia for 
irrigation in 1983; in 1981, the U.S. government sought to block a ship¬ 
ment of school supplies and educational kits to Cambodia by the Men- 
nonite Church.
