The effort to maintain balance is illustrated, for example, in the narra¬ 
tor’s concluding words to episode 4, covering Johnson’s escalation of 
the war in 1964-65 and the first appearance of North Vietnamese units 
in the South in mid-1965.After presenting Lyndon Johnson and other 
U.S. government spokesmen, the narrator states: 

Johnson called it invasion.Hanoi called it liberation.In the fall 
of 1965, three North Vietnamese regiments massed in the Central 
Highlands.Nearly two years had passed since Johnson renewed 
the U.S. commitment to defend South Vietnam.
