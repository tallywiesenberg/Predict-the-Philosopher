One may believe, with 
Johnson, that North Vietnam is invading the South, or, with Ho, that 
North Vietnam is fighting to liberate the South.We may not believe, 
however, that the United States is invading South Vietnam, which, we 
learn two episodes later, it had been bombing since 1961.Rather, we 
must assume, as a given fact not subject to debate, that the U.S. com¬ 
mitment was “to defend South Vietnam.” 

To evaluate this effort at “balance,” we may observe that during the 
preceding summer (1965), five months after the United States began the 
regular bombing of North Vietnam, the Pentagon estimated that the 
60,000 U.S. troops then deployed faced an enemy combat force of 
48,500, 97 percent of them South Vietnamese guerrillas (“Viet Cong”).A few months after the la Drang Valley battle, in March 1966, the 
Pentagon reported 13,100 North Vietnamese forces in the South, along 
with 225,000 Viet Cong, facing 216,400 U.S. troops and 23,000 third- 
country troops (mostly South Korean), in addition to 690,000 ARVN 
troops.189 Considering these facts, and the earlier history, it would seem 
possible to imagine a point of view that departs from the framework 
established here, one that is, furthermore, plainly accurate: the United 
States was stepping up its attack against South Vietnam.
