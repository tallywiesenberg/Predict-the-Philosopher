beyond “balance,” which is construed similarly throughout, thus con¬ 
signing the series to the familiar system of state propaganda on the most 
crucial and essential point.A position critical of foreign aggression (that 
is, the U.S, aggression that was plainly the central element of the war) 
is excluded as unthinkable, although it may be conceded that “To the 
Communists in Hanoi, America’s presence in the South was yet another 
act of foreign aggression” (episode 4).The NLF in the South is granted 
no opinion on the matter, and the episode ends with a ringing declara¬ 
tion by LBJ.190 

It is not that the facts are entirely hidden.Thus episode 5 (“America 
Takes Charge”) opens with a description by a GI of how “the ARVN 
and the VC are the same people, the same race, the same culture, and 
yet one side seems to be chicken and the other side seems to fight in 
the face of overwhelming disadvantages” in what is clearly “their coun¬ 
try.” A U.S. major discusses the problem in Binh Dinh Province, which 
“had never been really in friendly hands” since 1946 but rather “under 
VC control” throughout, compelling the United States to resort to 
“awesome fire power” that turns heavy jungle into a “moonscape.” But 
the plain truth that such facts entail cannot be expressed, or perceived.
