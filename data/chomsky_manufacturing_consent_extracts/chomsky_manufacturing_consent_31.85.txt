Balance is also preserved in an “account from both sides” of what 
happened in the village of Thuy Bo, in January 1967, where British 
producer Martin Smith had been shown the site of what villagers 
claimed to be a My Lai-style massacre, one of many they alleged, with 
a hundred women and children killed.Fox Butterfield reports that in 
contrast to the “balanced” picture actually presented by PBS, the 
British participants in the series argued that “the Marine attack on 
[Thuy Bo] should be labeled a war crime.” This failure to maintain 
“balance” was in keeping with what a filmmaker involved in the project 
termed their “more moralistic stance, anxious to accentuate the aspects 
of the war that were immoral at the expense of looking at it afresh,” 
which would apparently exclude the “more moralistic stance.” 191 In 
this episode, the marines tell their story of an assault on a VC-defended 
village and then the villagers (given thirty-five lines of the transcript, 
to ninety for the marines) tell their conflicting version of a marine 
massacre of wounded and captured civilians.The sequence ends with 
a marine describing what took place as a “normal procedure,” with 
“burning them hootches down and digging them Vietnamese people out 
of holes [with grenades and rifle fire] and scattering animals, pigs and 
chickens around like we normally do,” especially after three days in the 
field under brutal conditions.The account continues in the same vein.We hear that “American

aircraft dropped six times more bombs on South Vietnam than on the 
Communist North,” and that “most of the enemy troops were native 
southerners” (episode 8)* But no conclusion is suggested, except that 
the purpose of the U.S. bombing of Vietnam, distributed in this curious 
manner and at “twice the tonnage dropped on Germany and Japan in 
World War II,” was to try “to stop North Vietnam from sending 
soldiers and supplies to the South.” Nevertheless, 140,000 made it 
through 1967 according to the U.S, government (episode 7), about half 
the number of South Korean mercenaries and a small fraction of the 
Americans who were destroying South Vietnam.
