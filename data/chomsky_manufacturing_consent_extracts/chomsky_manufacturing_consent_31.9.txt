The Phoenix program of political assassination is justified at length 
by its director, William Colby, who denies that it was what it was, and, 
for balance, some comments are added by critics in the military and by 
a civilian aide worker, describing apparent random killing and torture.The post-Tet military operations are passed over in total silence.After 
Nixon's election in 1968, when these wholesale U-S. massacres began 
in full force, “the war continued,” we learn: “The weapons were Viet- 
cong rockets, the victims were Danang civilians” killed by the Viet 
Cong and North Vietnamese.After the breakdown of negotiations in October 1972, “The North 
was again intransigent,” we learn—namely, in demanding that the 
agreements be signed, a fact ignored; and “In South Vietnam, too, the 
agreement was still unacceptable,” the familiar evasion of U.S. respon¬ 
sibility (see “The Paris Peace Agreements, p. 228).The terms of the 
January 1973 agreement are given, but with no indication that the U.S. 
government announced at once its intent to disregard them, as it did.
