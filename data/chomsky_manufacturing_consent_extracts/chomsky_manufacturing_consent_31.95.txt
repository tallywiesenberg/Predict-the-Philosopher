Rather, we hear that “to the North Vietnamese and Vietcong, the 
struggle had not ended,” because “Vietnam was still divided.” The facts 
are quite different, as we have seen.They are indeed more accurately 
stated, although briefly, two episodes later (episode 12), although the 
U.S. role is suppressed except by implication: “America was still com¬ 
mitted to South Vietnam,” the narrator says, without noting that this 
commitment to the GVN, identified with South Vietnam by the U.S* 
government and by PBS, is in explicit violation of the agreements 
signed in Paris.“Whatever their views of the war,” the narrator adds, “most Ameri¬ 
cans now believed that the cost had been too great,” particularly the 
cost of American lives; “They believed that no more Americans should 
die for Vietnam.” The only other Americans are those who thought it 
proper that “more Americans should die for Vietnam.” Americans were 
dying for Vietnam in the same sense in which Russian boys are dying

for Afghanistan* but those who could perceive this fact* and who op¬ 
posed the war not merely because the cost was too great but because 
aggression is wrong* are excluded from the category of Americans.As in the media retrospectives* the antiwar movement is given short 
shrift* A few activists are quoted* but permitted to discuss only ques¬ 
tions of tactics* Even Eugene McCarthy* plainly the favored antiwar 
figure in this presentation* says nothing except that “I think the case 
is rather clear about what’s wrong about our involvement”—which is 
fair enough* since the media’s favorite dove had never been a serious 
critic of the war and was to disappear quickly from the scene after 
failing to gain political power* thus demonstrating again where his 
commitments lay, James Fallows is permitted to describe “the spirit of 
the times”: “to look for the painless way out* namely* a physical defer¬ 
ment,” In the real world* this was a position that hardly defined “the 
spirit of the times*” although it is a facet of this “spirit” that is far more 
acceptable to mainstream opinion than the principled and courageous 
resistance of many thousands of young people* an intolerable phenome¬ 
non and therefore erased from the record* As Peter Biskind observes, 
for all the attempt at “balance*” and “despite the preference of [the 
PBS series] for doves over hawks, it is the right* not the left, that has 
set this film’s political agenda*” in conformity to elite opinion* 

Biskind concludes his review of the PBS series by stating: “The truth 
is that the war was a crime, not a tragedy.The tragedy is that this film 
lacks the conviction to say so,” The same may be said about the retro¬ 
spective commentary generally* The war was a “tragic error,” but not 
“fundamentally wrong and immoral” (as the overwhelming majority of 
the American people continue to believe)* and surely not criminal 
aggression—the judgment that would be reached at once on similar 
evidence if the responsible agent were not the United States* or an ally 
or client.
