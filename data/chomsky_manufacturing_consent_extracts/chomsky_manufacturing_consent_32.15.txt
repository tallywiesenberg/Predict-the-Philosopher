observers were appalled, civil war broke out, with the USSR and China 
backing a coalition extending over virtually the entire political spec¬ 
trum apart from the extreme right, which was backed by the United 
States, The U.S, government assessment was that “By the spring of 1961 
the NLHS appeared to be in a position to take over the entire country,” 
primarily because of its control of the countryside, where it had “dili¬ 
gently built up an organization covering most of the country's ten 
thousand villages,” as noted ruefully by the bitterly anti-Communist 
Australian journalist Denis Warner.2 The problem was the familiar one: 
the United States and its clients were militarily strong but politically 
weak.Recognizing that its policies were in a shambles, the United States 
agreed to take part in a new Geneva conference, which proposed a new 
settlement in 1962, This too quickly broke down, and the civil war 
resumed with a different line-up and with increasing intervention by the 
United States and its allies, and by North Vietnam, in the context of 
the expanding war in Vietnam, U.S, clandestine military operations 
began in 1961, and the regular U.S, bombing began in early 1964: 
Operation Barrel Roil, directed against northern Laos, was initiated in 
December 1964, several months before the regular bombing of North 
Vietnam.The bombing of northern Laos was intensified in 1966, reach¬ 
ing extraordinary levels from 1968 with the “bombing halt” in North

Vietnam—in reality* a bombing redistribution* the planes being shifted 
to the destruction of Laos, 3 

Media coverage of Laos during the earlier period was sometimes 
extensive—over three times as great as of Vietnam in the New York 
Times in 1961, the Pentagon Papers analyst observes* But its contents 
were often absurd* For example, the aid cut-off that was the essential 
factor in the U*S, subversion of the elected government of Laos in 1958 
“was never even reported in the national press*” which barely men¬ 
tioned the events, and then with misleading commentary reflecting 
Washington deceit.4 Bernard Fall gave a detailed and derisive exposure 
of some of the more ludicrous incidents* including inflammatory fabri¬ 
cations that helped create major crises and led to deeper U*S* involve¬ 
ment in Thailand and Indochina* Joseph Alsop’s fevered reports of 
largely invented Communist military actions were particularly note¬ 
worthy* 5 

As the Vietnam War escalated* Laos became “only the wan on the 
hog of Vietnam*” as Dean Rusk put it* a “sideshow war*” in Walter 
Haney’s phrase, as Cambodia was to be later on.
