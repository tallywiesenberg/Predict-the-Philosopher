From 
this town to a distance of thirty kilometers* “no house in the villages 
and hamlets had been spared.Bridges had been destroyed* fields up to 
the rivers were holed with bomb craters/’ 7 After Decornoy’s reports* 
there could be no doubt that the U.S. Air Force was directing murder¬ 
ous attacks against the civilian society of northern Laos.These reports 
of terrible destruction were repeatedly brought to the attention of the 
media* but ignored or, more accurately, suppressed.Later described as 
“secret bombings” in an “executive war,” the U.S. attack was indeed 
“secret,” not simply because of government duplicity as charged but 
because of press complicity.Not only did the media fail to publish the information about the 
attack against a defenseless civilian society or seek to investigate further 
for themselves* but they proceeded to provide exculpatory accounts 
that they knew to be inaccurate* on the rare occasions when the bomb¬ 
ing was mentioned at all.
