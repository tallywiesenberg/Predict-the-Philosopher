As the bombing of Laos began to be reported 
in 1969* the claim was that it was targeted against North Vietnamese 
infiltration routes to South Vietnam (the “Ho Chi Minh trail”), and* 
later* that U.S. planes were providing tactical support to government 
forces fighting North Vietnamese aggressors* a far cry from what 
Decornoy had witnessed and reported* and a much more tolerable 
version of the unacceptable facts.8 

Keeping just to the New York Times, through 1968 there was no 
mention of the bombing apart from tiny items reporting Pathet Lao 
complaints (Dec, 22,31* 1968).On May 18,1969, the Times reported U.S. 
bombing in Laos, alleging that it was “directed against routes* including 
the so-called Ho Chi Minh Trail* over which the North Vietnamese 
send men and supplies to infiltrate South Vietnam.” A June 14 report 
states that “American planes bomb targets all over Laos* especially 
along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in an effort to harass the Pathet Lao* the 
Communist-led rebel movement in Laos* and to stop the flow of enemy 
supplies to South Vietnam-” Charles Mohr reported on July 16 that 
U.S. bombing “is directed against infiltration routes from North Viet¬ 
nam that pass through Laos en route to the South.” There is a July 28 
reference to “200 American bombing sorties a day over northeastern 
Laos,” directed against North Vietnamese forces, and Hedrick Smith 
adds from Washington on August 2 that the United States “has been 
bombing North Vietnamese concentrations” in Laos, T. D. Allman 
reported bombing sorties “in tactical support” of government forces 
fighting the North Vietnamese and “harassing attacks against Commu¬ 
nist positions all over northeast Laos” on August 25* the latter providing

the first glimpse of something beyond the approved version.Further 
reports of U*S. air power in tactical support and “to cut North Viet¬ 
namese supply routes” appear on September 7* followed by Allman’s 
report of successes of a government offensive with forces “stiffened by 
Thai soldiers,” supported by “the most intense American bombing ever 
seen in Laos” (Sept* 18)* Then followed reports from Washington and 
Vientiane (Sept, 19, 20, 23* 24, 30) confirming that the U,S.Air Force 
was providing tactical support for government combat missions in addi¬ 
tion to bombing North Vietnamese infiltration routes, including a Sep¬ 
tember 23 Agence-France-Presse dispatch reporting “bombing of 
Pathet Lao areas by United States aircraft/ 5 thus implying that the 
bombing went well beyond infiltration routes and combat operations, 
common knowledge in Paris and Vientiane but yet to be reported here.
