In short, the terror bombing of northern Laos, although known, 
remained off the agenda, and reporting in general was slight and highly 
misleading, to say the least.Elterman observes that the war in Laos and 
Cambodia was virtually “invisible” in the media through 1969, apart 
from the leftist National Guardian, which gave substantial coverage to 
what was in fact happening.9 

On October 1, 1969, the New York Times finally ran an account by 
T. D. Allman, whose valuable reporting throughout the war appeared 
primarily overseas, concluding that “the rebel economy and social fab¬ 
ric” were “the main United States targets now,” and that the American 
bombardment had driven the population to caves and tunnels during 
the daylight hours, making it difficult for the Pathet Lao “to fight a 
£ people 5 s war 5 with fewer and fewer people.” Control of territory was 
now of lesser importance, he wrote, “with United States bombers able 
to destroy, almost at will, any given town, bridge, road or concentration 
of enemy soldiers or civilians*” 10 

This confirmation of what had long been known in restricted peace- 
movement circles, and consciously suppressed in the mainstream press, 
passed without particular notice* The CIA clandestine army had swept 
through the Plain of Jars in the preceding months, evacuating all re¬ 
maining civilians to areas near Vientiane, where they and their harrow¬ 
ing stories were largely ignored by the well-represented media, 
although available elsewhere.11 

Walter Haney, a Lao-speaking American who compiled a detailed 
collection of refugee interviews that was described as “serious and 
carefully prepared 55 by U.S.Ambassador to Laos William Sullivan, 
quotes remarks by a UN official in Laos as “the most concise account 
of the bombing”:

By 1968 the intensity of the bombings was such that no organized 
life was possible in the villages* The villages moved to the outskirts 
and then deeper and deeper imo the forest as the bombing reached 
its peak in 1969 when jet planes came daily and destroyed all 
stationary structures* Nothing was left standing.
