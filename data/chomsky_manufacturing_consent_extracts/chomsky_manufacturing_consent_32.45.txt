There were also eyewitness reports of the destruction of northern 
Laos by Western reporters* but published overseas, T. D. Allman flew 
over the Plain of Jars in late 1971* reporting that “it is empty and 
ravaged” by the napalm and B-52 saturation bombing being “used in 
an attempt to extinguish all human life in the target area”; “All vegeta¬ 
tion has been destroyed and the craters* literally, are countless” and 
often impossible to distinguish among the “endless patches of churned 
earth* repeatedly bombed,” At the same time, the Washington Post 
published the statement of Air Force Secretary Robert Seamans* who 
reported from northern Laos that “I have seen no evidence of indis¬ 
criminate bombing”; it is the North Vietnamese who are “rough*” and 
the people are not “against the United States—just the opposite.” The 
Lao-speaking Australian reporter John Everingham traveled in 1970 
“through dying village after dying village” of the Hmong tribesmen 
who had been “naive enough to trust the CIA” and were now being 
offered “a one-way "copter ride to death' ” in the CIA clandestine army, 
in the remains of a country where bombing had “turned more than half 
the total area of Laos to a land of charred ruins where people fear the 
sky” so that “nothing be left standing or alive for the communists to 
inherit*” No U.S. journal, apart from the tiny pacifist press* was inter¬ 
ested enough to run his story* although later the media were to bewail 
the plight of the miserable remnants of the Hmong* put on display as 
“victims of Communism*” In 1970* the Bangkok World (Oct* 7) pub¬ 
lished an AP report on U.S, bombing that was “wiping out” towns, and 
by 1972 such reports sometimes appeared in the U.S* press* 14 Latex*

craters that are a stark testimony to the years of war that denuded the 
area of people and buildings'* during “six years of ‘secret 5 bombing” by 
U,S.aircraft, while “at ground level, the signs of death and destruction 
are even more ubiquitous,” including the provincial capital, “com¬ 
pletely razed,” as had been reported earlier by refugees who were 
ignored.Following the practice of American volunteers during the war, 
American relief workers with long experience in Laos attempted to 
bring information about postwar Laos to the media—with little effect— 
and inform us privately that their accounts were seriously distorted by 
New York Times reporters “by the device of omission and taking the 
negative side of balanced statements we made 5 * and similar means.15 

The ILS, government officially denied all of this, continuing the 
deception even after the facts were exposed and known in some detail 
to those concerned enough to learn them.Many regarded the U.S. war 
in Laos as “a success” (Senators Jacob Javits and Stuart Symington), 
or even “A spectacular success ” (a former CIA officer in Laos, Thomas 
McCoy).
