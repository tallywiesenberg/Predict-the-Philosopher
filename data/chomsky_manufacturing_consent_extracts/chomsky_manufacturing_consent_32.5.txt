young American volunteers in Laos compares very favorably to the 
subsequent studies of refugees from Cambodia that received massive 
publicity in the West after the Khmer Rouge takeover, and the story 
was both gruesome and highly pertinent to ongoing U.S. operations.But there was little interest, and published materials, which appeared 
primarily outside of the mainstream, were virtually ignored and quickly 
forgotten; the agency of terror was inappropriate for the needs of the 
doctrinal system.Media failure to report the facts when they were 
readily available, in 1968, and to investigate further when they were 
undeniable, by late 1969, contributed to the successful deception of the 
public, and to the continuing destruction.When the war ended, ABC News commentator Harry Reasoner 
expressed his hope that Laos and its “gentle folk” could return to 
peaceful ways after “the clowning of the CIA and the vicious invasion 
of the North Vietnamese.5117 The “clowning of the CIA” included the 
destruction of “the rebel economy and social fabric 51 in northern Laos, 
with unknown numbers killed in areas that may never recover, and the 
decimation of the Hmong who were enlisted in the CIA cause and then 
abandoned when no longer useful.
