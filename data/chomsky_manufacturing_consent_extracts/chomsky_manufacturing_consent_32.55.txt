Nothing remotely comparable may

The New York Times reviewed the war in Laos at the war's end, 
concluding that 350,000 people had been killed, over a tenth of the 
population, with another tenth uprooted in this “fratricidal strife that 
was increased to tragic proportions by warring outsiders,” The “fratri¬ 
cidal strife” might well have been terminated by the 1958 coalition 
government had it not been for “outsiders," with the United States 
playing a decisive role throughout, a role completely ignored in this 
purported historical analysis apart from a few misleading comments.At 
this late date, the Times continued to pretend that the U.S. bombing 
was directed against North Vietnamese supply trails—nothing else is 
mentioned.The crucial events of the actual history also disappear, or 
are grossly misrepresented.Subsequent reporting also regularly 
obliterated the U.S, role in creating the devastation and postwar “prob¬ 
lems” attributed to the Communists alone, a shameful evasion in the 
light of the undisputed historical facts, 19 

Once again, the media record, less than glorious, is well explained 
throughout by the propaganda model.
