6.2.1.“The decade of the genocide*’ 

Few countries have suffered more bitterly than did Cambodia during 
the 1970s- The “decade of the genocide,” as the period is termed by the 
Finnish Inquiry Commission that attempted to assess what had taken 
place, 20 consisted of three phases—now extending the time scale to the 
present* which bears a heavy imprint of these terrible years: 

Phase I: From 1969 through April 1975, U.S. bombing at a histori¬ 
cally unprecedented level and a civil war sustained by the United 
States left the country in utter ruins.Though Congress legislated 
an end to the bombing in August 1973, U.S* government participa¬ 
tion in the ongoing slaughter continued until the Khmer Rouge 
victory in April 1975.21 

Phase II: From April 1975 through 1978 Cambodia was subjected 
to the murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge (Democratic Kampu¬ 
chea, DK), overthrown by the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia 
in December 1978, ^

Phase III: Vietnam installed the Heng Samrin regime in power in 
Cambodia* but the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) coalition, based 
primarily on the Khmer Rouge* maintained international recogni¬ 
tion apart from the Soviet bloc* Reconstructed with the aid of 
China and the United States on the Thai-Cambodia border and 
in Thai bases, the Khmer Rouge guerrillas* the only effective DK 
military force, continue to carry out activities in Cambodia of a 
sort called “terrorist” when a friendly government is the target.
