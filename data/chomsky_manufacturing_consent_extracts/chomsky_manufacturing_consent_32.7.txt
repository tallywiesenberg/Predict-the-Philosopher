Meanwhile* the United States backed 
its ally China as it conducted a punitive invasion of Vietnam in Febru¬ 
ary 1979 and reconstructed the defeated Pol Pot forces* 

In the early stages of phase III, it was alleged “that the Vietnamese 
are now conducting a subtle "genocide* in Cambodia,” a charge tacitly 
endorsed in a CIA demographic study* which estimated a population 
drop of 700,000 during “the first year of the Heng Samrin rule,” 22 This 
new “holocaust” was constructed on the basis of serious misinterpreta-

tion of available evidence, as was demonstrated by Michael Vickery in 
a response to William Shawcross’s warnings of “the end of Cam¬ 
bodia, but not before it had left its mark on popular perceptions* and 
many distortions and, indeed, contradictions persist.In his Quality of 
Mercy y Shawcross agrees that, as Vickery had concluded, there was no 
large-scale famine of the character initially reported, 24 but he later 
wrote that the Heng Samrin regime '"was responsible for creating many 
of the conditions that caused the famine'* in Cambodia, These conflict¬ 
ing accounts were noted by Australian Cambodia scholar Ben Kieman, 
who suggested a partial explanation: “There was a threat of famine, as 
the Heng Samrin government proclaimed in mid-1979.But it was offset 
by the small but crucial December-January harvest, which Shawcross 
hardly mentions, and by the massive international aid program, which 
he regularly denigrates."25 

The eagerness to uncover Vietnamese villainy in “ending Cam¬ 
bodia," the easy reliance on sources known ro be unreliable, 26 and the 
subsequent evasions after the accusations dissolve are readily explained 
by U.S, (indeed, general Western-bloc) hostility to Vietnam, which led 
the United States to align itself quietly with Pol Pot and to transform 
its alleged concern over Cambodians to the victims of the Vietnamese 
occupation.Phase III also had 3 domestic US, aspect that is highly relevant to 
our concerns- In an intriguing exercise, characteristic of system-sup¬ 
portive propaganda campaigns, it was charged that the horrors of phase 
II were passed over in “silence” at the time.
