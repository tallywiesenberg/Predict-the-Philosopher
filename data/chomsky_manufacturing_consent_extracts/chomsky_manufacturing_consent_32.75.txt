This alleged fact, devel¬ 
oped in William Shawcross’s influential book Quality ofMercy 3 elicited 
much commentary on “Holocaust and Modem Conscience," the subti¬ 
tle of Shawcross’s book, and on the failure of civilized people to react 
appropriately to ongoing atrocities.In “Phase III at home" (p, 288), we 
will turn to the merits of this charge with regard to phase II.As for 
phase I of “the decade of the genocide," the charge of silence is dis¬ 
tinctly applicable, but it was never raised, then or now, nor is phase I 
designated a period of “holocaust" or “genocide” in mainstream litera¬ 
ture.Phase I elicited no calls for international intervention or trials for 
crimes against humanity, and it has since been largely expunged from 
the record.In retrospect, the harshest critics within the mainstream 
attribute “the destruction of Cambodian society” during phase I to 
“years of warfare” and “careless policies of the White House, 5 * nothing

Thailand, “where there has been no war, foreign invasion* carpet

the sympathy of the most advanced western powers is enjoyed* 55 but 
where conditions in the peasant society were so terrible that “since 1980

shock of foreign aid personnel* were found to be little better than the 
condition of Cambodian refugees,” 2 * No such comparison was under¬

children, many under ten years old* working as “virtual slaves” in Thai 
factories resembling concentration camps, 29 nor over the normal condi¬
