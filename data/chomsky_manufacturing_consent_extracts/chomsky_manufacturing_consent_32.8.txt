The actual scale of the slaughter and destruction during the two 
authentic phases of large-scale killings during the “decade of the geno¬ 
cide 55 (phases I and II) would be difficult to estimate at best, and the 
problems have been compounded by a virtual orgy of falsification serv¬ 
ing political ends that are all too obvious.30 The Finnish Inquiry Com¬ 
mission estimates that about 600*000 people in a population of over 
seven million died during phase I, while two million people became 
refugees.31 For the second phase* they give 75,000 to 150*000 as a 
“realistic estimate 55 for outright executions, and a figure of roughly one 
million dead from killings* hunger, disease, and overwork.Vickery 5 s 
analysis is the most careful attempt to sort out the confused facts to 
date.He accepts as plausible a “war loss 55 of over 500,000 for the first 
phase* calculated from the CIA estimates but lower than their conclu¬ 
sions (see note 31), and about 750*000 “deaths in excess of normal and 
due to the special conditions of f)K,” with perhaps 200,000 to 300,000 
executed and a total population decline for this period of about 
400*ooo.
