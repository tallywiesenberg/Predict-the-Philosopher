Little is known about phase I of “the genocide.” There was little 
interest in ascertaining the facts, at the time or since.The Finnish 
Inquiry Commission Report devotes three cursory pages to the topic, 
because the information available is so meager.The second phase has 
been far more intensively studied, and by now substantial evidence is 
available about what took place.David Chandler and Ben Kieman 
observe that as a result of the intense interest in phase II, “we know 
a great deal more about the texture of daily life in Democratic Kampu¬ 
chea, supposedly a ‘hermit’ regime, than we do about the ostensibly 
open regimes of the Khmer Republic (1970-1975) or the Sihanouk era 
(1954-1970) which preceded it.” 35 Despite this already large imbalance 
in knowledge, the Cambodia Documentation Center in New York City 
concentrates on phase II of the genocide.The dramatic difference in 
the information available for the two phases, and the focus of the 
ongoing research effort, are readily explicable in terms of a propaganda 
model.
