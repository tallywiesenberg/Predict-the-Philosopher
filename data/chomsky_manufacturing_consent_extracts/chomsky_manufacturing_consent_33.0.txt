Outside of marginal Maoist circles, there was virtually no doubt from 
early on that the Khmer Rouge regime under the emerging leader Pol 
Pot was responsible for gruesome atrocities.But there were differing 
assessments of the scale and character of these crimes.State Department Cambodia specialists were skeptical of the allega¬ 
tions that had received wide publicity by 1977—rightly, so subsequent 
inquiry revealed.The Far Eastern Economic Review based its January 
1979 conclusion that the population had actually risen during the Pol 
Pot period on CIA sources, and its very knowledgeable correspondent 
Nay an Chanda, discussing the background for the Vietnamese inva¬ 
sion, reported that “some observers are convinced that had the Cambo¬ 
dian regime got a year’s reprieve, its internal and international image 
would have been improved enough to make any Vietnamese drive 
difficult if not impossible.” 36 

Differing assessments persisted even after the abundant evidence 
provided by the flow of refugees to Thailand in 1979 and visits to 
Cambodia, which also provided the first significant information about 
the years 1977-78.At one extreme, Pol Pot continued to be described 
as having forged new patterns of genocide comparable to the worst 
excesses of Hitler and Stalin.
