Diem’s troops attacked border regions from 1957, 
and there were also Thai provocations, A coup attempt in 1959, proba¬ 
bly backed by the CIA, as generally assumed in Cambodia, was foiled; 
this should be seen in the context of general U.S, subversion in the 
region in the post-Geneva period, including a CIA-backed coup and 
invasion aimed at overthrowing Sukarno in Indonesia in 1958, subver¬ 
sion of the elected government of Laos in the same year, and the efforts 
to destroy the anti-French resistance within South Vietnam and to 
Consolidate the Diem dictatorship while undermining the political ar¬ 
rangements at Geneva.By 1963, CIA-backed Khmer Serei forces fre¬ 
quently attacked Cambodia from South Vietnamese and Thai bases at 
a time when the United States was intensifying its clandestine opera¬ 
tions in Laos and maneuvering, with increasing violence, to block a 
political settlement in South Vietnam.By 1966, the Khmer Serei “de¬ 
clared war on Cambodia and claimed responsibility for incursions 
across the border.” 43 

Attacks by U.S, and Saigon army forces against border posts and 
villages in Cambodia intensified from the early 1960s, causing hundreds 
of casualties a year.Later, Vietnamese peasants and guerrillas fled for 
refuge to border areas in Cambodia, particularly after the murderous 
U.S. military operations in South Vietnam in early 1967, giving rise to 
cynical charges from Washington, echoed in the media, about Commu¬ 
nist encroachment into neutral Cambodia.By the time of the 1970 coup 
that overthrew Sihanouk, Vietnamese were scattered along border areas 
to a maximum depth of about twenty-five kilometers, according to most 
sources.
