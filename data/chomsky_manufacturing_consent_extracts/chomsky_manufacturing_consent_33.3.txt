By April 1969, rubber 
plantations were subjected to defoliation by air attack.In January 1970, 
an official Cambodian government White Paper reported thousands of 
such incidents with many deaths, giving pictures, dates, and other 
details, and also noting that not a single Viet Cong body had ever been 
found after U.S.-Saigon bombardments or ground attacks.Virtually none of this was ever reported in the United States—even 
the official White Paper—although the information was readily availa¬ 
ble in official documents and reputable foreign sources, and in easily 
ignored peace-movement literature.44 The agency of violence was once 
again the wrong one.The occasional media reaction to these incursions was instructive.
