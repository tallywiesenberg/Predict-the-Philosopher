In May 1969, William Beecher reported B-52 raids on “Vietcong and 
North Vietnamese supply dumps and base camps in Cambodia*” citing 
U.S. sources, Beecher stated that “Cambodia has not made any pro¬ 
test*” disregarding Sihanouk’s appeals and his protest against the mur¬ 
der of “Khmer peasants* women and children in particular*” not 
Vietnamese military bases, Beecher also commented that “in the past, 
American and South Vietnamese forces had occasionally fired across 
the border and even called in fighters or helicopter gunships to counter 
fire they received from enemy units there,” ignoring the somewhat 
more important fact that U*S* aircraft and U*S -ARVN-South Korean 
forces had been attacking Cambodian villages, according to the 
“friendly” government of Cambodia, The headline for his article states 
falsely: “Raids in Cambodia by U,S, Unprotested,” Beecher’s article 
caused consternation in Washington* setting off the first stage of what 
later became the Watergate scandal.As we have commented elsewhere* 
“It is remarkable that Beecher’s unique though quite inadequate ac¬ 
count is now held up as evidence that the press maintained its honor 
throughout this period, despite the crimes of Richard Nixon.” 49

coincided with similar efforts in Laos and Vietnam.The general reac¬ 
tion was similar throughout, and remains so- The post-Tet accelerated 
pacification campaign, which thoroughly demolished the civilian base 
of the NLF, was regarded as so uninteresting that it is passed over in 
virtual silence in the popular retrospectives- As for the wars in Laos and 
Cambodia, Elterntan comments, after reviewing the major media cover¬ 
age, that apart from the “alternative press,* 5 they were virtually “invisi¬ 
ble” in the press in 1969 when they were expanding to new heights as 
the U-S, Air Force was shifted from North Vietnam to Laos and Cam¬

In March 1970, Cambodia was drawn irrevocably into the carnage 
sweeping Indochina.On March 18, Sihanouk was overthrown in “an 
upper-class coup, not a revolution,” carried out for “interests of domes¬ 
tic and political expedience,” and with at least “indirect U.S. support,” 
if not more, 51 Two days later, ARVN ground and air operations began 
in Svay Rieng Province, at the Vietnamese border, continuing through 
April and leading to the U.S.-ARVN invasion on April 29, conducted 
with an extreme brutality sometimes vividly depicted in the media, 
which were particularly appalled by the behavior of the ARVN forces.Much of the enormous civilian toll, however, resulted from air power, 
including U.S. bombing strikes that leveled or severely damaged towns 
and villages.
