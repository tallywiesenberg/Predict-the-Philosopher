52 One effect of the invasion was to drive the Vietnamese 
forces away from the border and deeper into Cambodia, where they 
began to support the growing peasant resistance against the coup lead¬ 
ers.A second effect, as described by U.S. correspondent Richard Dud- 
man, who witnessed these events at first hand after his capture by the 
Cambodian resistance, was that “the bombing and shooting was radi¬ 
calizing the people of rural Cambodia and was turning the countryside 
into a massive, dedicated, and effective revolutionary base.” 53 Cam¬ 
bodia was now plunged into civil war, with increasing savagery on both 
sides.U.S. bombing continued at a high level after the withdrawal of U.S. 
forces from Cambodia, By late 1971, an investigating team of the Gen¬ 
eral Accounting Office concluded that U.S. and Saigon army bombing 
is “a very significant cause of refugees and civilian casualties,” estimat¬ 
ing that almost a third of the seven-million population may be refugees.U.S. intelligence reported that “what the villagers feared most was the 
possibility of indiscriminate artillery and air strikes,” and refugee re¬ 
ports and other sources confirm that these were the major cause of 
civilian casualties and the flight of refugees.54 

Information about what was happening in the peasant society of 
Cambodia in the early 1970s was limited but not unavailable.
