THE INDOCHINA WARS (ll): LAOS AND CAMBODIA 2?3 


were* first of all, many refugees with stories to tell, although the media 
were not interested* There was also an eyewitness account by French 
Southeast Asia specialist Serge Thion, who spent two weeks in regions 
controlled by the Cambodian guerrillas* His reports were offered to the 
Washington Post, but rejected* 55 They were of no more interest than the 
reports of life under the bombing in Laos, or similar questions regard¬ 
ing Vietnam throughout the war and in the retrospectives* 

As in Laos, the escalating war remained largely “invisible” in the 
media* Surveying a five-month period in early 1972 in the national 
press, Elterman found that “In terms of war casualties, the focus in 
The New York Times and Time was on military-related deaths and 
almost always only those that occurred in Vietnam, ignoring also the 
civilian deaths and refugees in that country too....During the winter 
and spring of 1972, the war in Cambodia and Laos was ignored more 
than usually with most of the Indo-China news coverage given to the 
North Vietnamese offensive into South Vietnam and the United States 
bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.. * * Time, in fact, had more coverage 
on civilian casualties in Northern Ireland during the first half of 1972 
than it did on the Indo-China War_” 56 

Meanwhile, Cambodia was being systematically demolished, and the 
Khmer Rouge, hitherto a marginal element, were becoming a significant 
force with substantial peasant support in inner Cambodia, increasingly 
victimized by U.S. terror* As for the U.S.-backed Lon Nol regime, 
Michael Vickery points out that their “client mentality” and subse¬ 
quent “dependency led them to acquiesce in, or even encourage, the 
devastation of their own country by one of the worst aggressive on¬ 
slaughts in modern warfare, and therefore to appear as traitors to a 
victorious peasant army which had broken with old patron-client rela¬ 
tionships and had been self-consciously organized and indoctrinated 
for individual, group, and national self-reliance*” 57 

In early 1973, U.S* bombing increased to a scale that might truly 
merit the term “genocidal” used by the Finnish Inquiry Commission* 
In the five-month period after the signing of the Paris peace accords, 
the bombing matched the level of the preceding three years, 58 and it was 
to continue at that level until Congress forced a halt in August— 
although bombing and shelling of the countryside by armies of the 
U.S.-backed regime were to continue on a substantial scale, with U.S. 
guidance and supply, until the waris end.
