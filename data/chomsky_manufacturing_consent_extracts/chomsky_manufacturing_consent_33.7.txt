Phase I in the media 

During this period* there was extensive media coverage of Cambodia, 
and there was no dearth of evidence on what was taking place in the 
regions subjected to U.S. Air Force atrocities.It was not necessary to 
undertake a difficult expedition to the Thai-Cambodia border to find 
refugees who would tell what they knew* but the victims of phase I of 
“the decade of the genocide” who were huddled in the slums of Phnom 
Penh or other towns and villages to which they fled were of no more 
interest than those in the miserable camps on the outskirts of Vien¬

books or articles were written by Father Ponchaud* who lived among 
the peasants and sympathized deeply with their plight* so he informed 
us when the time came to expose atrocities of the Khmer Rouge.The 
same was true of many others who were later to expres^ their heartfelt 
concerns for Cambodians suffering under Khmer Rouge terror* but 
who did not seek to investigate and publicize the plight of the rural 
population during phase I of the genocide* when such efforts might 
have had a crucial impact on the policies that were destroying Cam¬ 
bodia, a fact that might merit some thought.The standard U.S. media picture of phase I is something like this, 
“Until the turning point in 1973,... on the surface* Cambodians smiled 
and were full of pleasantries,” 62 but afterwards the mood of “Cambodi¬ 
ans” became one of “apathy” and “resignation” because “impoverished 
farmers* refugees and soldiers” (most of whom were press-ganged into 
service from among the poor and refugee communities) felt that their 
“leaders seem powerless to defend them against human and natural 
adversities.” 63 There is a “spirit of doom” as the government is “teeter-
