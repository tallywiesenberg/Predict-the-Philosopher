aggressors.The framework is the usual one, although perhaps a shade more 
egregious in the light of what might have been passing through the 
minds of those Cambodians who were not “Cambodians” during phase 
I of the genocide.About that topic, we learn very little from the media.The refugees 
flooding Phnom Penh and other areas where U.S. reporters traveled 
were virtually ignored.To gain a measure of this remarkable fact, let 
us review the reports during these months in the New York Times, most 
of them by its Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent Sydney Schan¬ 
berg, who, more than any other U.S. reporter, came to be regarded as 
the conscience of the media with regard to Cambodia.
