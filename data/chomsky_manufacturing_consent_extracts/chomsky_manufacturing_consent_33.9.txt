Schanberg arrived in Phnom Penh in May 1973, at the height of the 
intensified bombing, which continued until the mid-August halt.Dur¬ 
ing this period, the Times published twenty-seven of his reports from 
Cambodia, many of them long and detailed, along with a column in 
which he expressed his contempt for the “so-called international press 
corps” who spend their time “interviewing each other” in the Hotel Le 
Phnom.67 

From the outset, Schanberg reports “refugees pouring into the city,” 
but there are no interviews with refugees who relate the circumstances 
of life under the bombs.We hear a “well to do Cambodian woman” who 
tells us that “The bombing is terrible”; she is “not frightened, just 
annoyed—because it wakes my baby up every night in the middle of 
the night, and I have to get up” (May 3), But those villagers who want 
to be left alone are not granted the opportunity to relay their accounts 
of somewhat more serious concerns, apart from a few scattered phrases, 
and there is not a word to suggest that refugees might have had any 
attitude, apart from fear, with regard to those “determined” fighters 
who “believe they can change their environment,” although plainly 
they had a solid base in the peasant society that was being torn to shreds 
by saturation bombing.As in Laos a few years earlier, the refugees 
simply had the wrong tale to tell, and the kinds of stories that readily 
flow if one is sufficiently interested to inquire are lacking here.
