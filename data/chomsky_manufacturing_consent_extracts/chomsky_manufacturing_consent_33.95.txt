Running through the columns seriatim for relevant material, number 
5 (May 11) quotes a Western European diplomat who says that “Ameri¬ 
can men in American planes are bombing the hell out of this place,” 
and notes that the U.S. aircraft “do not always receive accurate an¬ 
swers” about civilians in the targeted areas “from the Cambodian com¬ 
manders” who direct the jet fighter-bombers.The Cambodians, then.THE INDOCHINA WARS (ll)l LAOS AND CAMBODIA 277 


are to blame for the civilian casualties that must result* although “no 
reliable figures are available” and refugees are not asked to supplement 
with their personal knowledge* The next two columns (May 24, 27) are 
the only ones concerned directly with the effect of the bombing in the 
countryside- The first reports “extensive” destruction from bombing 
that has wiped out “a whole series of villages” along the main highway, 
with often not even a piece of a house left standing for miles, while “a 
few people wander forlornly through the rubble, stunned by what has 
happened, skirting the craters, picking at the debris.” A group of villag¬ 
ers from Svay Rieng Province, abutting Vietnam, report the destruction 
of seven villages, with many killed, “The frightened villagers uprooted 
by the bombing have a great deal to say,” Schanberg comments, but we 
do not read it here.Rather, he explains that “There is no doubt that 
the Seventh Air Force is making a marked effort to avoid civilian 
casualties—at least outside the eastern third of the country, which is 
solidly held by the enemy”; and if there are casualties it is the fault of 
Cambodian military officials who request air strikes with “almost no 
concern about civilian lives or property.” The second column informs 
us that “the refugees frequently tell about the bombing,” which has 
destroyed villages and “terrified all the rest of the villagers,” a Western 
diplomat reports.But the refugees are granted only two phrases, an 
“incongruously polite” request that “I would be very glad if the Gov¬ 
ernment would stop sending the planes to bomb,” and a plea from a 
monk to ask the United States and other governments: “Don’t destroy 
everything in Cambodia.” 

We hear no more from the refugees until column 15 (July 26), a 
graphic account of “a terror attack on the civilian population”—by 
Communist forces who shelled the outskirts of Phnom Penh.
