In forty-five columns, then, there are three in which victims of U.S. 
bombing are granted a few phrases to describe what is happening in 
Cambodia, Not a single column seeks to explore the reactions of the 
refugees not far from the Hotel Le Phnom, or in Battambang, or in the 
far more miserable refugee camps in the countryside nearby; or to 
attempt to develop some sense of what must have been happening 
under the frenzied bombing of these months* Recall that in Phnom 
Penh alone there were almost 1*5 million refugees who had fled from 
the countryside, some, surely, who must have had some information to 
relate about phase I of the genocide at its peak.The reader could no 
doubt ascertain that terrible things were happening in the Cambodian 
countryside, but what they were remains obscure, and the Americans 
are explicitly exonerated, apart from the error of bombing the wrong 
village* 

The story remained much the same as phase I of the genocide 
continued.The horrors in Phnom Penh itself were sometimes vividly 
described, primarily abroad, 69 but there was little effort to determine 
what was happening in the areas held by the enemy of the U*S. govern¬ 
ment—hence the enemy of the U,S, press; virtually the entire country 
as “the Cambodians” were confined to urban centers swelled by a huge 
flood of refugees who remain as hidden from view as those in the 
teeming slums of Saigon or the camps around Vientiane.Western correspondents evacuated from Phnom Penh after the 
Khmer Rouge victory were able to obtain a fleeting picture of what had 
taken place in the countiyside, British correspondent Jon Swain sum¬ 
marizes his impressions as follows: 

The United States has much to answer for here, not only in terms 
of human lives and massive material destruction; the rigidity and 
nastiness of the un-Cambodian like fellows in black who run this 
country now, or what is left of it, are as much a product of this 
wholesale American bombing which has hardened and honed their 
minds as they are a product of Marx and Mao* * .* [The mass 
evacuation of the cities] does not constitute a deliberate campaign 
of terror, rather it points to poor organisation, lack of vision and 
the brutalisation of a people by a long and savage war.
