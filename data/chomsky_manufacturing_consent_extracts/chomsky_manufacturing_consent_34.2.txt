transmitted narrowly selected fragments of this tale of horror expressed 
their bitterness that Cambodia had been “forgotten,” On the tenth 
anniversary of the Khmer Rouge takeover, Sydney Schanberg wrote

claim that there was no “indiscriminate terror bombing” but only 
“highly accurate 5 * strikes “against enemy military targets.55 Schanberg 
comments that “Anyone who visited the refugee camps in Cambodia 
and talked to the civilian survivors of the bombing learned quickly 
about the substantial casualties.51 He recalls that “the Khmer Rouge 
were a meaningless force when the war was brought to Cambodia in 
1970.
