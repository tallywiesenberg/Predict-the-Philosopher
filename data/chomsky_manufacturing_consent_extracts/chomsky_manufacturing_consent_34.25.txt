...In order to flourish and grow, they needed a war to feed on.And the superpowers—including this country, with the Nixon incur¬ 
sion of 1970 and the massive bombing that followed—provided that war 
and that nurturing material.55 He does not, however, inform us about 
which superpower, apart from “this country, 55 invaded Cambodia and 
subjected it to massive bombing.With comparable even-handedness we 
might deplore the contribution of the superpowers, including the 
USSR, to the destruction of Afghanistan, or the attitude of the great 
powers, including Nazi Germany, toward the victims of the death 
camps, whom Schanberg brings up in a later column the same month 
entitled “Memory is the Answer.” He also does not comment on what 
the reader of his columns might have learned about life in the Cambo¬ 
dian countryside from his reporting during the peak period of the 
bombing.
