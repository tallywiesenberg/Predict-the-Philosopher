The Pol Pot era 

Phase II of “the decade of the genocide” began with the Khmer Rouge 
takeover in April 1975.Within a few weeks* the Khmer Rouge were 
accused in the national press of “barbarous cruelty” and “genocidal 
policies” comparable to the “Soviet extermination of the Kulaks or 
with the Gulag Archipelago.” 74 This was at a time when the death toll 
was perhaps in the thousands; the half million or more killed during 
phase I of the genocide never merited such comment, nor were these 
assessments of the first days of phase II (or later ones* quite generally) 
accompanied by reflection on the consequences of the American war 
that were anticipated by U.S. officials and relief workers on the scene* 
reviewed earlier, or by any recognition of a possible causal link between 
the horrors of phase II and the American war against the rural society 
during phase I.We will not document here the flood of rage and anger directed 
against the Khmer Rouge from the outset and the evidence on which 
it was based, having done so elsewhere in detail.7S Several facts docu¬ 
mented there bear emphasis: (1) the outrage, which was instant and

overwhelming* peaked in early 1977 and, until the overthrow of Pol Pot* 
was based almost exclusively on evidence through 1977, primarily 1975- 
j6f 6 (2) apart from a few knowledgeable journalists, the State Depart¬ 
ment’s Cambodia experts* and probably the majority of the small group 
of Cambodia scholars—that is, most of those with a basis for judg¬ 
ment—the most extreme accusations were adopted and proclaimed 
with a great show of indignation over Communist atrocities, the integ¬ 
rity of which can be measured by comparison to the reaction to phase 
I of the genocide and ILS, responsibility for it; (3) these skeptical 
assessments, almost entirely suppressed in the media, proved fairly 
accurate for the period in question; (4) the evidence that provided the 
crucial basis for the denunciations of Communist genocide was of a 
kind that would have been dismissed with derision had something of 
the sort been offered with regard to phase I of the genocide or other 
U.S. atrocities, including faked interviews and photographs and fab¬ 
ricated statements attributed to Khmer Rouge officials, constantly re¬ 
peated even after they had been conceded to be frauds; fabricated 
casualty estimates based on misquoted studies that became unquestion¬ 
able doctrine even after they were publicly withdrawn as inventions; 
and highly selective refugee reports that ignored much refugee testi¬ 
mony, including detailed studies by Cambodia scholars, that could not 
be exploited for what soon became a propaganda campaign at a level 
of deceit of astonishing proportions, 77 

As we also noted from the first paragraph of our earlier review of this 
material, to which we will simply refer here for specifics, “there is no 
difficulty in documenting major atrocities and oppression, primarily 
from the reports of refugees”; there is little doubt that “the record of 
atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome” and repre¬ 
sents “a fearful toll”; “when the facts are in, it may turn out that the 
more extreme condemnations were in fact correct,” although if so, “it 
will in no way alter the conclusions we have reached on the central 
question addressed here: how the available facts were selected, modi¬ 
fied, or sometimes invented to create a certain image offered to the 
general population.The answer to this question seems clear, and it is 
unaffected by whatever may yet be discovered about Cambodia in the fu¬ 
ture,” As we repeatedly stressed, in this chapter of a two-volume study 
on U.S. policy and ideology, our concern remained the United States, 
not Indochina; our purpose was not to “establish the facts with regard to 
postwar Indochina” on the basis of the evidence available, but rather to 
examine the constructions developed on the basis of this evidence, 
to analyze the way this evidence was refracted “through the prism of 
Western ideology, a very different task.” 78 The conclusions drawn there
