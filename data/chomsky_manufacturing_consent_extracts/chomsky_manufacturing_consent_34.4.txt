This review of an impressive propaganda exercise aroused great 
outrage—not at all surprisingly: the response within Soviet domains is 
similar, as are the reasons, when dissidents expose propaganda fabrica¬ 
tions with regard to the United States, Israel, and other official enemies.Indignant commentators depicted us as “apologists for Khmer Rouge 
crimes” 80 —in a study that denounced Khmer Rouge atrocities (a fact 
always suppressed) and then proceeded to demonstrate the remarkable 
character of Western propaganda, our topic throughout the two-vol¬ 
ume study in which this chapter appeared.There was also a new wave 
of falsification, often unanswerable when journals refused to permit 
response.We will not review these further propaganda exercises here, 
but merely note that they provide an intriguing expression of what, in 
other contexts, is described as the totalitarian mentality: it is not enough 
to denounce official enemies; it is also necessary to guard with vigilance 
the right to lie in the service of power.
