The reaction to our challenge 
to this sacred right again fits neatly within the expectations of a propa¬ 
ganda model, standing alongside the Freedom House attack on the 
media for failure to serve state policy with sufficient vigor and opti¬ 
mism.By early 1977, denunciations of the Khmer Rouge for having caused 
unprecedented “murder in a gentle land” and “autogenocide” extended 
from mass circulation journals such as Reader's Digest (with tens of 
millions of readers) and TV Guide (circulation nineteen million), to the 
New York Review of Books and the media generally, in addition to a 
best-selling book by John Barron and Anthony Paul based on their 
Reader’s Digest article and the widely misquoted study by Francois 
Ponchaud mentioned earlier.Similar material continued to flow in 
abundance in the press and newsweeklies, the New York Times Maga¬ 
zine and elsewhere.Evidence about the 1977-78 period became availa¬ 
ble primarily after the Vietnamese expulsion of the Khmer Rouge 
regime, which brought phase II of the genocide to a close, eliciting new 
outrage over the alleged “genocide” brought about by the “Prussians 
of Asia.” 

The picture created by this chorus of denunciation, from the first 
days of Democratic Kampuchea (DK) in 1975, is described sardonically 
by Michael Vickery as “the standard total view” (STV), According to 
the STV, prior to the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, Cambodia 
had been a “gentle land” (Barron and Paul) of “gentle if emotional 
people” who “wanted only to live in peace in their lush kingdom” (Jack 
Anderson), a land in which hunger was “almost unknown” (Henry

Kamm).But in 1975, the “formerly fun-loving, easy-going Cambodi¬ 
ans” were subjected to the “harsh regime” of the Khmer Rouge, who 
ordered that all those not under their rule before the victory can be 
“disposed of” because they are “no longer required,” even if only one 
million Khmers remain (Donald Wise, citing several of the frequently 
quoted Khmer Rouge statements that were conceded to be fabrica¬ 
tions), 81 

According to the STV, during the pre-1977 period on which the 
conclusions were based, the Khmer Rouge leadership was engaged in 
a policy of systematic extermination and destruction of all organized 
social and cultural life apart from the Gulag run by the “nine men at 
the top,” Paris-trained Communists, without local variation and with 
no cause other than inexplicable sadism and Marxist-Leninist dogma.
