By early 1977, it was alleged that they had “boasted” of having slaugh¬ 
tered some two million people (Jean Lacouture in the New York Re¬ 
view).This figure remained the standard even after Lacouture 
withdrew it a few weeks later, acknowledging that he had misread his 
source (Ponchaud) and that the actual figure might be in the thousands, 
but adding that he saw little significance to a difference between thou¬ 
sands killed and a “boast” of two million killed.This position expresses 
with some clarity the general attitude toward fact during this period and 
since, as does his further statement that it is hardly important to deter¬ 
mine “exactly which person uttered an inhuman phrase”—the case in 
question had to do with inhuman phrases he attributed to Khmer 
Rouge officials but which turned out to be mistranslations of phrases 
that had been fabricated outright by his source (Ponchaud) or that had 
appeared not in a Cambodian journal, as he asserted, but in a Thai 
journal mistranslated by Ponchaud that expressed virtually the oppo¬ 
site of what was claimed.The two-million figure was later upgraded to 
three million or more, often citing Vietnamese wartime propaganda.The examples are quite typical.
