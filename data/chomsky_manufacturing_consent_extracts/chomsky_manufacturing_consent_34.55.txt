Not everyone joined in the chorus.The most striking exceptions 
were those who had the best access to information from Cambodia, 
notably, the State Department Cambodia specialists.Their view, based 
on what evidence was then available (primarily from northwestern 
Cambodia), was that deaths from all causes might have been in the 
“tens if not hundreds of thousands,” largely from disease, malnutrition, 
and “brutal, rapid change,” not “mass genocide.” These tentative con¬ 
clusions were almost entirely ignored by the media—we found one 
important exception in our review—because they were simply not use¬ 
ful for the purpose at the time, just as refugee testimony that did not 
conform to the STV was ignored.Overseas, journalists who had special

knowledge of Indochina also gave Tather nuanced accounts, notably, 
Nay an Chanda, 82 

In his detailed, region-by-region study, Vickery shows that the STV 
was a picture with little merit, and that the few skeptics had been 
essentially accurate for the period in question, although in 1977-78, 
something approaching the STV came to be correct in the context of 
brutal inter-party purges and the expanding war with Vietnam, He also 
makes the obvious logical point that “the evidence for 1977-78,” which 
only became available after the Vietnamese conquest in 1979, “does not 
retrospectively justify the STV,” which reigned on the basis of evidence 
from the 1975-76 period; “and the Vietnamese adoption of some of the 
worst Western propaganda stories as support for their case in 1979 does 
not prove that those stories were valid,” 83 Recent work indicates that 
the worst massacres, including those that left the mass graves and 
horrifying heaps of skulls found by journalists who entered Cambodia 
after the Vietnamese conquest, were in the eastern zone bordering 
Vietnam in mid- to late 1978.84 

The nature of the Western agony over Cambodia during phase II of 
the genocide, as a sociocultural phenomenon, becomes clarified further 
when we compare it to the reaction to comparable and simultaneous 
atrocities in Timor.
