There, as in phase I of the Cambodia genocide, the 
United States bore primary responsibility and could have acted to 
reduce or terminate the atrocities.In contrast, in Cambodia under DK 
rule, where the blame could be placed on the official enemy, nothing 
at all could be done, a point that was stressed by government experts 
when George McGovern called for international intervention in August 
1978, eliciting much media ridicule, 85 Neither McGovern nor anyone 
else recommended such intervention against the United States during 
phase I of the genocide, or against Indonesia and the United States 
during the Timor atrocities, to which the United States (and, to a much 
lesser extent, other powers) lent material and diplomatic support, just 
as there has been no call for intervention as the armies of El Salvador 
and Guatemala proceeded to slaughter their own populations with 
enthusiastic U,S, support in the early 1980s.The comparison between Timor and phase II in Cambodia was 
particularly striking, and was occasionally noted after the fact.The 
excuses now produced for this refusal to report what was happening in 
Timor, or to protest these atrocities or act to stop them, are instructive 
in the present context.Thus, William Shawcross rejects the obvious 
interpretation of the comparative response to Timor and Cambodia in 
favor of a “more structurally serious explanation”: “a comparative lack 
of sources” and lack of access to refugees.
