from London, and even Australia is not notably harder to reach than 
the Thai-Cambodia border, but the many Timorese refugees in Lisbon 
and Australia were ignored by the media, which preferred “facts” 
offered by the State Department and Indonesian generals.Similarly, 
the media ignored readily available refugee studies from sources at least 
as credible as those used as the basis for the ideologically serviceable 
outrage over the Khmer Rouge, and disregarded highly credible wit¬ 
nesses who reached New York and Washington along with additional 
evidence from church sources and others.The coverage of Timor 
actually declined sharply as massacres increased with mounting U.S. 
support.The real and “structurally serious” reason for this difference 
in scope and character of coverage is not difficult to discern (see chapter 
1), although not very comfortable for Western opinion, and becomes 
still more obvious when a broader range of cases is considered that 
illustrate the same conclusions.87
