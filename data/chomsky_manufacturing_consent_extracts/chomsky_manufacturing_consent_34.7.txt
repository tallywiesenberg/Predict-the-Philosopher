Phase III in Indochina: 
Cambodia and the bleeding of 
Vietnam 

As we write in 1987, Western moralists remain silent as their govern¬ 
ments provide the means for Indonesia to continue its campaign of 
terror and repression in Timor.Meanwhile* the United States backs the 
DK coalition, largely based on the Khmer Rouge, because of its “conti¬ 
nuity” with the Pol Pot regime, so the State Department informed 
Congress in 1982.The reason for this differential reaction to the Fretilin 
guerrillas resisting Indonesian aggression in Timor, and the Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas attacking Cambodia from Thai bases, is also explained 
by the State Department: the Khmer Rouge-based coalition is 
“unquestionably” more representative of the people of Cambodia than 
Fretilin is of the Timorese.00 There is, therefore, no need to puzzle over 
the apparent inconsistency during the late 1970s in U.S. attitudes to¬ 
ward Pol Pot and the Indonesian generals: the former, the object of 
hatred and contempt for the massacres in Cambodia under his rule 
during phase II; the latter, our friends whom we cheerfully supplied 
and supported as they conducted comparable massacres in Timor at the 
same rime.This apparent inconsistency , which briefly troubled even the 
editors of the Wall Street Journal in the early 1980s, 39 is now happily 
resolved: we support both the Khmer Rouge and the Indonesian 
generals.
