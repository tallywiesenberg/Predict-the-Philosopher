The current U.S. support for the Khmer Rouge merits little atten¬ 
tion in the media* just as little notice is given to the Vietnamese posi¬ 
tion: a political settlement among Cambodians excluding Khmer Rouge 
leaders Pol Pot and his close associate leng Sary.90 As noted earlier* 
U.S. aid to the Khmer Rouge is reported by congressional sources to 
be extensive.Furthermore* the Reagan administration* following “Chi¬ 
nese rather than Southeast Asian inclinations*” has refused to back the 
efforts of its Southeast Asian allies “to dilute the strength of China’s 
ally, the deposed Pol Pot regime* by giving greater weight to non- 
Communist guerrillas and political groupings/ 191 Nayan Chanda re¬ 
ported in 1984 that the United States had “more than doubled its 
financial assistance to the resistance forces,” mainly through funds 
earmarked for humanitarian assistance that permit U.S. allies to divert 
funds to arms purchases* a familiar ploy 92 While it is claimed that the 
funds are limited to the (generally ineffectual) non-Communist resist¬ 
ance, this is a shallow pretense.“Both Sihanouk’s army and Son Sann’s 
KPNLF,” the two components of the non-Communist resistance* “are 
completely discounted in Phnom Penh*” James Pringle reports from 
Phnom Penh in the Far Eastern Economic Review.“ ‘All they do is stt 
drinking coca-cola on the border/ said one well-informed Soviet bloc 
diplomat.” From the Thai border areas, Barbara Crossette reports that 
“Trucks loaded with men and boys* 150 or 200 at a time, pull away from 
settlements controlled by Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge and rumble into 
Cambodia,” where the supplies are carried “into the Cambodian inte¬ 
rior to stockpile supplies for the Khmer Rouge*” in the expectation that 
they will be able to prevail by military force and terror once the Viet¬ 
namese withdraw as demanded by the United States.
