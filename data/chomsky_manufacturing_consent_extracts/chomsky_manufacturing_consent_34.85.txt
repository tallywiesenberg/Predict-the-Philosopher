As we discussed earlier, the Cambodians were “worthy victims” 
when they were being terrorized by the Khmer Rouge under phase II 
of the genocide, and they achieved this status once again after the 
Vietnamese invasion brought phase II of the genocide to an end, al¬ 
though with a change in the cast of characters, as the United States 
joined China in support of the Khmer Rouge.After early efforts to 
charge the Vietnamese with “genocide,” the condemnation of the offi¬ 
cial enemy shifted to the terrible acts of “the Prussians of Asia,” who 
have “subjugated and impoverished” Cambodia since overthrowing Pol 
Pot, according to the editors of the New York Times.Recall that of ail 
the horrors of the past years, including the atrocities of phase I, “what 
cannot be sponged away” are “the Khmer Rouge's butcheries”—evi¬ 
dently of lesser moment in Washington now that the Pol Pot forces 
qualify as resistance forces under the Reagan doctrine.One would be hard put to find any serious observers of the current 
Cambodian scene who believe that the Vietnamese have reduced Cam¬ 
bodia to a level below that of the DK period, as these comments imply.Rather, among people who are concerned about the people of Cam¬ 
bodia for themselves and not merely because of their value for propa¬ 
ganda exercises, few would question that “it is clear that life for the 
people is far better now than under Democratic Kampuchea,” 95 and 
some Cambodia specialists have suggested that the current regime com¬ 
pares favorably with any of its predecessors- Consistent opponents of 
aggression would have a moral basis for condemning the Vietnamese 
invasion, despite the rapidly escalating atrocities of 1977-78 and the 
murderous raids against Vietnam by Cambodian forces under Pol Pot's 
rule.
