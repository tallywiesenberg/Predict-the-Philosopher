This task having been achieved with 
the customary alacrity, we may now observe with wonder that “The 
West awoke to the suffering of Kampuchea in autumn, 1979” (William 
Shawcross), and then go on to ruminate about the curious inability of 
the West, always consumed with self-flagellation, to perceive the atroci¬ 
ties of its enemies.97 And so matters have proceeded in the latest phase 
of the sad tale of Cambodia.“There was silence in the mid-1970s during the mass murders by the 
Khmer Rouge” (Floyd Abrams), and “The atrocity stories coming out 
of Cambodia after 1975 quite simply were not believed” (David 
Hawk)—at a time when accusations of genocide of the Hitler-Stalin 
variety were resounding from the New York Times and Washington Post 
to the Reader's Digest and TV Guide to the New York Review of Books , 
and the mass media extensively.“The West woke up to the horror of 
what had happened only after the Vietnamese invasion” (Economist), 
and “hardly anyone outside, on Left or Right, had noticed [the horrors 
of the Pol Pot regime] at the time they were actually going on (1975- 
1978)” (Conor Cruise O’Brien)—that is, at the time when Jimmy Carter 
branded Pol Pot “the world’s worst violator of human rights,” and a 
British Foreign Office report condemned the regime for the death of 
“many hundreds of thousands of people.” 98 One might imagine that 
such outlandish claims could not pass without a raised eyebrow at least, 
but that is to underestimate the ability of the ideological institutions to 
rally to a worthy cause: in this case, the cause of suppressing the truth

about the Western response to “the decade of the genocide” and other 
atrocities.That there was “silence” over Pol Pot atrocities was also an insistent 
claim right at the peak of the bitter outrage over Pol Pot genocide.
