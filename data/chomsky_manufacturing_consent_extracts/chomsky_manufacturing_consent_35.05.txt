The facts are radically different, but the idea 
that the West ignores Communist atrocities while agonizing over its

proceeds to adopt Aikman’s second thesis, applying it in an ingenious 
way to explain the mechanism that lies behind this unwillingness of the 
West to face up to Communist atrocities, so notable a feature of West¬ 
ern life.The silence over phase II of the genocide, he argues, resulted 
from “the skepticism (to use a mild term) displayed by the Western left 
toward the stories coming out of Democratic Kampuchea.That skepti¬ 
cism was most fervently and frequently expressed by Noam Chomsky 
..[who] asserted that from the moment of the Khmer Rouge victory 
in 1975 the Western press colluded with Western and anti-Communist 
Asian governments, notably Thailand, to produce a Vast and unprece¬ 
dented 5 campaign of propaganda against the Khmer Rouge/ 5100

under Khmer Rouge rule.
