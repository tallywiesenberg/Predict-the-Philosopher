Second, the source of the manufactured 
quote is a work published in November 1979, almost a year after the 
fall of the Pol Pot regime.To cite the date would have raised the 
question of how this “fervent and frequent” expression of skepticism 
could have intimidated governments and the media from 1975 through 
1978.Furthermore, we made it crystal clear that the record of atrocities 
was “gruesome,” perhaps even at the level of the most outlandish 
fabrications.Note that Shawcross could have cited real examples of “skepticism”; 
for example, the skepticism of State Department analysts at the height 
of the furor over Cambodia, or the retrospective comments of Douglas 
Pike and others cited earlier (pp.265-66), or the comments of journal¬ 
ists during phase II who were willing to conclude only that refugee 
accounts “suggest that the Khmer Rouge is finding it hard to govern 
the country except by coercion” and “even suggest that terror is being 
employed as a system of government,” noting that refugees “did not 
appear to be in a sorry condition” and that if the Khmer Rouge are 
perpetrating an “atrocity,” as claimed, then “the atrocity did not begin 
in April [1975]—it simply entered its sixth year” (William Shaw¬ 
cross).
