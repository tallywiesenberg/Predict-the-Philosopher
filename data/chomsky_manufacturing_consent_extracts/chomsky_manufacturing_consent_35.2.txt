105 It is 
noteworthy that our skepticism about charges against the United 
States, although based merely on suspicion* has elicited no comment , 
while our skepticism about charges against the Khmer Rouge* which 
was based on textual evidence and* as it later turned out, was much 
understated* has aroused great fury in what Vickery describes as “in¬ 
competent* even dishonest” and “often scurrilous” commentary.106 
The differential reaction is easily explained.It is taken for granted that 
U.S. actions must be recounted with scrupulous care and in nuanced 
manner* so our insistence on this is simply what is to be expected, 
meriting no comment.{We agree.)In contrast, the acts of official ene¬ 
mies merit no such scruples* and it is an unforgivable crime to question 
propaganda exercises undertaken in the service of power.
