Notice that even had the “skepticism” of “the Western left” to which 
Shawcross alludes existed to any significant degree, the idea that this 
could have the consequences he describes, coming from people sys¬ 
tematically barred from the media and mainstream discussion* is a 
construction of such audacity that one must admire its creator.Shaw¬ 
cross argues further that this alleged “left-wing skepticism” not only 
silenced Western media and governments but also prevented any mean¬ 
ingful Western response to Khmer Rouge atrocities.This thesis is too 
ludicrous to merit comment* and we can assess Shawcross’s seriousness 
in advancing it by turning to his own proposals at the time as to what 
could be done* recalling that he had easy access to the mainstream 
media throughout.We find not a word suggesting what might be 
done 107 —for the simple reason that neither he nor anyone else could 
think of anything useful.The situation was, of course, quite different 
during phase I of the genocide* or with regard to Timor during phase 
II and since, and in innumerable other cases where Sh aweross's charge 
would indeed be valid* We learn a good deal about “holocaust and the 
modem conscience” by observing this exercise and the reaction it 
elicited* 

Shawcross attributes this “left-wing skepticism,” which had such 
awesome consequences because of the influence of the left on Western
