Vietnam’s “spokesmen 
had undercut the refugee stories about Khmer Rouge conduct,” he 
writes* “thus adding to disbelief in them* particularly on the Western 
left,” 108 which naturally takes its cues from Hanoi and closely parrots 
its doctrines* according to approved dogma—although it is interesting 
that Shawcross also insinuates that the influence of Hanoi extended 
beyond its acolytes.And why not?If we have reached the point of 
claiming that the Western left silenced the media and governments, 
why not proceed to maintain that even outside these dangerous circles* 
Vietnamese propaganda is a powerful force in shaping opinion?Natu¬ 
rally Shawcross does not make even a pretense of providing any evi¬ 
dence for what he knows perfectly well to be the sheerest fantasy* from 
beginning to end.We may place this outlandish explanation of the “silence” of the 
West alongside the similar claims that State Department Communists 
lost China, that the media are threatening the foundations of democ¬ 
racy with their “adversarial stance,” etc.
