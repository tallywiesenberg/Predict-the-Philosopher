The reaction, however* was 
not ridicule, but rather great enthusiasm.To cite just one typical exam¬ 
ple, David Hawk observes that Shawcross “attributes the world's indif¬ 
ference” to “the influence of antiwar academics and activists on the 
American left who obfuscated Khmer Rouge behavior* denigrated the 
post-1975 refugee reports and denounced the journalists who got those 
stories,” 109 He accepts this thesis as valid but cites no evidence either 
for the ^indifference” to the atrocities* which were being denounced 
worldwide as genocidal* or for the alleged behavior of the American 
left, nor does he explain the mechanisms whereby this behavior, had 
it existed, could have controlled the mainstream media, or even margin¬ 
ally influenced them.Convenient mythologies require neither evidence 
nor logic.Nor do they require any attention to Hawk’s own perform¬ 
ance at the time, as an Amnesty International official and specialist on 
Southeast Asia.The AI Annual Report for 1977 noted that the number 
of alleged executions in Cambodia was “fewer than during the preced¬ 
ing year,” and while it summarizes a number of reports of executions 
and disappearances, its account is restrained.
