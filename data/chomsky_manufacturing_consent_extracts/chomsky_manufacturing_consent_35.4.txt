The 1978 Annual Report, 
while stronger in its allegations of violence, pointed out that refugee 
reports, on which it was necessary to rely heavily, “are often imprecise 
or conflicting,” thus leaving AI and Hawk in the Shawcross-Hawk 
category of those who “denigrated the post-1975 refugee reports.” It is 
so easy to moralize in retrospect.Shawcross develops his thesis further in interesting ways.110 To show 
that Western commentators refused to recognize that “the Khmer 
Rouge was a Marxist-Leninist government,” he states that British jour-

nalist John Pilger “constantly compared” the Khmer Rouge with the 
Nazis, suppressing the fact that he explicitly compared their actions 
with “Stalin’s terror,” as Pilger noted in a response to one of the many 
reviews that repeated Shawcross’s inventions.111 Shawcross claims fur¬ 
ther that the present authors “were to believe for years” that “the 
refugees were unreliable, that the CIA was cooking up a bloodbath to 
say, ‘We told you so.’ ” He cites our one article {The Nation, 1977), in 
which there is no hint of any such thesis, as there is none elsewhere.In that article we were clear and explicit, as also subsequently, that 
refugee reports left no doubt that the record of Khmer Rouge atrocities 
was “substantial and often gruesome,” and that “in the case of Cam¬ 
bodia, there is no difficulty in documenting major atrocities and oppres¬ 
sion, primarily from the reports of refugees,” 113 To support his 
contention with regard to our alleged denial of the reliability of re¬ 
fugees, Shawcross cites our comment on the need to exercise care in 
analyzing refugee reports, carefully suppressing the fact that we are 
quoting Ponchaud, his primary source, and that the comment he cites 
is a familiar truism.
