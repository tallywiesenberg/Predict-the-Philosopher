His reference to the CIA cooking up a bloodbath 
is pure fantasy, although we might add that by the time he wrote, 
although after our book appeared, Michael Vickery did present evi¬ 
dence that the Barron-Paul Reader^ Digest account was in part a CIA 
disinformation effort.113 Shawcross states further his view, “contrary to 
Chomsky and Herman,” that the U.S, government was “remarkably 
inactive” in anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda.We proposed no U.S. 
government role whatsoever in orchestrating the deceit we docu¬ 
mented, by William Shawcross and others, and in fact endorsed State 
Department reports as the most plausible then available.And so on, 
throughout.But Shawcross and others who are deeply offended by our challenge 
to the right to lie in the service of one’s favored state understand very 
well that charges against dissident opinion require no evidence and that 
ideologically useful accusations will stand merely on the basis of end¬ 
less repetition, however ludicrous they may be—even the claim that the 
American left silenced the entire West during the Pol Pot period.
