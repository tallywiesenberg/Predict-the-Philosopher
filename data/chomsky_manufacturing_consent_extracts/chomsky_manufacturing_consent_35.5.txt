Shawcross’s charges against other enemies follow the same pattern— 
another factor, presumably, in the appeal of his message.Thus in 
pursuit of his fashionable quest to attribute primary responsibility for 
the continuing tragedy of Cambodia to Vietnam, not to those who were 
responsible for phase I of the genocide with their “careless” policies 
and who are now supporting Pol Pot, Shawcross rationalizes the cur¬ 
rent support for Pol Pot as a natural response to Vietnamese actions.Given Hanoi’s invasion of Cambodia and subsequent conduct, he ex-

plains* China and the ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia (not to speak 
of their ‘‘Western partners”) were bound “to seek to apply all possible 
forms of pressure upon Hanoi” to renounce its intentions, and “the 
Vietnamese could have predicted that such pressures would include 
support for the Khmer Rouge.” Thus the Vietnamese are to blame if 
China and the United States support Pol Pot* along with such dedicated 
advocates of human rights and the strict reliance on peaceful means as 
Indonesia and Thailand* Such analysis is* however* not extended to the 
Vietnamese* who are always carrying out cold-blooded strategies in a 
world without threats from China or the United States* threats that 
might allow us to “predict” (and thus implicitly exonerate) these strate¬ 
gies* According to Shawcross* “Vietnam's conduct since its invasion of 
Cambodia rarely suggested that it wished to see a compromise in which 
the Khmer Rouge were removed as a viable force in Cambodia—which 
was what the ASEAN countries and their Western partners insisted was 
their aim*” “It is impossible to predict whether any such suggestion 
[from Hanoi] would have been accepted by the Chinese or the ASEAN 
countries* but the point is that it was never made*” Shawcross asserts 
without qualification .114 Hanoi has repeatedly offered to withdraw in 
favor of an indigenous regime* the only condition being the exclusion 
of the top Khmer Rouge leadership.Whether these offers were serious 
or not* we do not know* as they have been dismissed by the Deng- 
Reagan alliance and, with more vacillation, the ASEAN countries* 
These rejections* in favor of continued support for Pol Pot* have not 
been featured in the media, which would hardly surprise a rational 
observer.
