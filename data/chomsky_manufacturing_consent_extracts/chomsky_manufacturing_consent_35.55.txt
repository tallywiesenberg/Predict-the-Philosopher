But these facts are hardly supportive of Shawcross’s analysis* 
to say the least.In a further effort to cast the blame on the approved enemy, Shaw¬ 
cross asserts that the Vietnamese “placed more confidence in the tor¬ 
turers than in their victims, that many of those people were actually 
being promoted by the new order into positions of new authority over 
them.” As his sole evidence, he cites a story, told twice in his book, 
about an old woman he met in Cambodia “who described with great 
passion how the Khmer Rouge murderer of her son was living* unpun¬ 
ished, in the neighboring village.” He repeated the same story in the 
New York Review of Books , eliciting a letter from Ben Kieman* who 
accompanied him when this alleged incident took place (and was his 
interpreter), Kiernan cited the tape of the woman's statement, which 
reveals that she had simply said that the murderer had “run away” to 
a neighboring “district*” suggesting* as Kiernan notes, that he feared 
punishment* but not that he had been “promoted” to “new authority.” 
Confronted with this evidence, Shawcross maintained his position

unpleasant,* 3 which suffices to prove the point, according to his logic, 115 
These examples are quite typical.116

Summarizing, prior to “the decade of the genocide, 3 * media treatment 
of Cambodia was as predicted by the propaganda model, and the same 
is true, quite dramatically, during the two phases of this terrible period 
and since.During phase I, refugee testimony was considered uninter¬ 
esting, and little is known today apart from the fact that there was 
obviously vast slaughter and destruction; this phase does not enter the 
record as a “holocaust 3 * or exercise in “genocide,* 3 and the source is 
forgotten.
