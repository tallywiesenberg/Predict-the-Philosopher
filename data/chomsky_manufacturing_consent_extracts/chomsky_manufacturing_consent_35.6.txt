During phase II, the myth of the “gentle land* 3 was extended 
through 1975, and the U.S. role and responsibility for what then took 
place was also quite commonly effaced, although some did not sink to 
this level of vulgarity.Refugee testimony was eagerly sought, although 
only if it lent support to the STV, and evaluations by State Department 
specialists and other knowledgeable commentators that gave a more 
nuanced (and in retrospect, essentially accurate) picture were dismissed 
as lacking utility.There was massive outrage, reaching its peak in early 
1977 when the death toil was still well below that of phase I, with a 
record of deception that is highly illuminating.117 As something like the 
STV came to be realized in 1977—78, its horrors were downplayed in 
official government circles, and subsequent U.S. support for Pol Pot 
arouses little notice.Phase III proceeded along a dual course.
