In a fanciful reconstruction 
that maintains the level of integrity shown throughout, it is alleged that 
“left-wing skepticism 3 * so dominated Western opinion and governments 
that there was “silence 3 * throughout the DK period; the wide accept¬ 
ance of this thesis, despite the quality of the evidence provided and its 
manifest absurdity* counts as yet another example of how readily the 
most implausible contentions can become doctrine, as long as they are 
serviceable.In Indochina, a new phase of Western concern about the 
victimization of Cambodia began, with outrage now directed not 
against Pol Pot but against the new oppressors who overthrew him.The 
United States took a leading role in orchestrating the new concern, 
which combined Chinese and U.S. interest in “bleeding Vietnam* 3 with 
a renewed exhibition of the Western conscience, properly bounded to 
exclude phase I and its long-term effects, and bypassing the U.S. role 
in support of Pol Pot—in part via its Chinese allies, who have been

benevolence succeeded in the goal of keeping the Pol Pot forces active 
and injuring Vietnam and also, incidentally, the suffering people of 
Cambodia who are the objects of our profound concern.The relief 
effort in 1979-80 did succeed in aiding Cambodians in distress, but it 
has also sustained the Pol Pot forces and thereby impeded Cambodia’s 
recovery and, perhaps, its independence, although about this we can 
only speculate.
