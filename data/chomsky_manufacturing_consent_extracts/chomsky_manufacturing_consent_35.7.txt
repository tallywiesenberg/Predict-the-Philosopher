Putting aside the undoubtedly sincere reactions of many people who 
were exposed to evidence of properly selected atrocities that passed 
through the media filter, the only rational conclusion from this il¬ 
luminating record is that the West was consumed with horror over 
Khmer Rouge atrocities during phase II not because of a sudden pas¬ 
sion for the fate of the suffering people of Cambodia—as the record 
during phase I, and elsewhere, makes sufficiently clear—but because 
the Khmer Rouge had a useful role to play: namely, to permit a retro¬ 
spective justification for earlier French and American crimes in Indo¬ 
china, and to facilitate the reconstruction of Western ideology after the 
Vietnam trauma, so as to overcome the dread “Vietnam syndrome” and 
prepare the ground for a “resurgent America” pursuing its historical 
vocation of defending freedom and justice.The actual facts were, and 
remain, of little interest, for the same reason.Conclusions 


D EFENDING THE MEDIA AGAINST THE CHARGE THAT THEY HAVE 
become too independent and too powerful for the public good* Anthony 
Lewis of the New York Times writes that 

The press is protected [by the First Amendment] not for its own 
sake but to enable a free political system to operate* In the end* 
the concern is not for the reporter or the editor but for the 
citizen-critic of government.What is ar stake when we speak about freedom of the press “is the 
freedom to perform a function on behalf of the polity/* 1 Lewis cites 
Supreme Court Justice Powell, who observed: “no individual can obtain 
for himself the information needed for the intelligent discharge of his 
political responsibilities.* * * By enabling the public to assert meaningful 
control over the political process, the press performs a crucial function 
in effecting the societal purpose of the First Amendment.” Therefore, 
as Judge Gurfein ruled in supporting the right of the New York Times 



298 MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


to publish the Pentagon Papers after the government had failed to show 
any threat of a breach of security but only the possibility of embarrass¬ 
ment: “a cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press 
must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve the even 
greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to 
know.” 

We do not accept the view that freedom of expression must be 
defended in instrumental terms, by virtue of its contribution to some 
higher good; rather, it is a value in itself.
