But that apart, these ringing 
declarations express valid aspirations, and beyond that, they surely 
express the self-image of the American media.Our concern in this book 
has been to inquire into the relation between this image and the reality.In contrast to the standard conception of the media as cantankerous, 
obstinate, and ubiquitous in their search for truth and their inde¬ 
pendence of authority, we have spelled out and applied a propaganda 
model that indeed sees the media as serving a “societal purpose,” but 
not that of enabling the public to assert meaningful control over the 
political process by providing them with the information needed for the 
intelligent discharge of political responsibilities.On the contrary, a 
propaganda model suggests that the “societal purpose” of the media is 
to inculcate and defend the economic, social, and political agenda of 
privileged groups that dominate the domestic society and the state.The 
media serve this purpose in many ways: through selection of topics, 
distribution of concerns, framing of issues, filtering of information, 
emphasis and tone, and by keeping debate within the bounds of accept¬ 
able premises.
