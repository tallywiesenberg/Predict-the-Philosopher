We have sought to show that the expectations of this 
model are realized, and often considerably surpassed, in the actual 
practice of the media in a range of crucial cases.We quite agree with 
Chief Justice Hughes, whom Lewis also cites, on “the primary need of 
a vigilant and courageous press” if democratic processes are to function 
in a meaningful way.But the evidence we have reviewed indicates that 
this need is not met or even weakly approximated in actual practice.It is frequently asserted that the media were not always as indepen¬ 
dent, vigilant, and defiant of authority as they allegedly are today; 
rather, the experiences of the past generation are held to have taught 
the media to exercise “the power to root about in our national life, 
exposing what they deem right for exposure,” without regard to exter¬ 
nal pressures or the dictates of authority (Lewis).It is this period, then, 
that poses a challenge to a propaganda model, and we have therefore 
taken it as the focus of our inquiry.
