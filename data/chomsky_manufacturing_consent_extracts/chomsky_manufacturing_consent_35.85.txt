Many of the examples we discuss 
are from the past decade, when the liberal media were allegedly in

have been expected to oppose vigorously* In a further effort to ensure 
that we are not selecting exceptional cases* we have cast the net widely* 
We have selected for close examination cases that pose the most severe 
challenge to our model* namely* those put forth by critics as demon¬ 
strating that the media have gone too far in their exuberant indepen¬ 
dence and challenge to authority* so far that they must be curbed if 
democracy is to survive: for example, the coverage of the Tet offensive* 
the prime illustration of alleged excesses of the media offered in the 
1970s and 1980s* Even these cases demonstrate the subordination of the 
media to the requirements of the state propaganda system* At the peak 
of alleged media independence* as the Vietnam War entered its final 
period and the media were threatening Nixon’s presidency* the subor¬ 
dination to these demands never flagged* as illustrated by the media 
coverage of the Paris peace treaty of 1973* one of the most flagrant 
examples of media misrepresentation based on an uncritical reiteration 
of official claims and adherence to the political agenda of the state* 

We may illustrate the point in yet another case* chosen by those who 
defend the standard version of the media as their strongest ground: the 
Watergate affair.To many critics of the media* this incident illustrates 
their irresponsible excesses; to those who proudly defend the media, it 
illustrates their independence of higher authority and commitment to 
the values of professional journalism.What* then* are the lessons of 
Watergate?The major scandal of Watergate as portrayed in the mainstream 
press was that the Nixon administration sent a collection of petty 
criminals to break into the Democratic party headquarters* for reasons 
that remain obscure.The Democratic party represents powerful do¬ 
mestic interests* solidly based in the business community, Nixon’s ac¬ 
tions were therefore a scandal.
