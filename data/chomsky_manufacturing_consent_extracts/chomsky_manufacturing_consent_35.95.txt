What was true of Con¬ 
gress was also true of the media and their investigative reporting that 
"helped force a President from office” (Lewis) in what is held to be a 
most remarkable display of media independence, or arrogance, depend¬ 
ing on one’s point of view.History has been kind enough to contrive for us a “controlled experi¬ 
ment” to determine just what was at stake during the Watergate period, 
when the confrontational stance of the media reached its peak.The 
answer is clear and precise: powerful groups are capable of defending 
themselves, not surprisingly; and by media standards, it is a scandal 
when their position and rights are threatened.By contrast, as long as 
illegalities and violations of democratic substance are confined to mar¬ 
ginal groups or distant victims of U.S. military attack, or result in a 
diffused cost imposed on the general population, media opposition is 
muted or absent altogether.3 This is why Nixon could go so far, lulled 
into a false sense of security precisely because the watchdog only 
barked when he began to threaten the privileged.
