Only then did elements of the 
media undertake qualified reassessments of the “cost-benefit” trade-off.But during the period of growing involvement that eventually made 
extrication difficult, the watchdog actually encouraged the burglar to 
make himself at home in a distant land* and to bomb and destroy it with 
abandon.In short* the very examples offered in praise of the media for their 
independence* or criticism of their excessive zeal* illustrate exactly the 
opposite.Contrary to the usual image of an “adversary press'* boldly 
attacking a pitiful executive giant* the media's lack of interest, investi¬ 
gative zeal, and basic news reporting on the accumulating illegalities of 
the executive branch have regularly permitted and even encouraged 
ever larger violations of law* whose ultimate exposure when elite inter¬ 
ests were threatened is offered as a demonstration of media service “on 
behalf of the polity*” These observations reinforce the conclusions that 
we have documented throughout.The existing level of media subordination to state authority is often 
deemed unsatisfactory by critics.
