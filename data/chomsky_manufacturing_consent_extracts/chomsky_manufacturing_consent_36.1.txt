We have discussed several examples.Thus, Freedom House and others who are concerned to protect state 
authority from an intrusive public condemn the media for lack of 
sufficient enthusiasm in supporting official crusades* and even the lim¬ 
ited challenge to established authority during the Vietnam War and the 
Watergate period aroused concerns over the excessive power of the 
media* Quite commonly, the slight opening occasionally granted to 
dissent is considered far too dangerous to permit.This perception 
sometimes even takes the form of a paranoid vision of left-wing power 
that sweeps all in its path: for example, the plea of Claire Sterling and 
others who dominated media coverage of the Bulgarian Connection 
that they could barely be heard above the din of Soviet propaganda.A 
still more striking case is the Aikman-Shawcross fantasy, eagerly 
echoed by many others* about the “silencing” of the international 
media and governments by the left during the Pol Pot era.In reality* 
there was a huge chorus of protest over Khmer Rouge atrocities* which 
reached an extraordinary level of fabrication and deceit.
