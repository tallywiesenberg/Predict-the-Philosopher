The signifi¬ 
cance of these facts* and of the pretense of left-imposed “silence,” is 
highlighted by the contrast with the real silence over comparable atroci¬ 
ties in Timor at the same time* and the evasions and suppressions

during the first phase of “the decade of the genocide,” to mention two 
cases where the United States was the responsible agent and protest 
could have been effective in diminishing or terminating large-scale 
atrocities.A propaganda model provides a ready explanation for this quite 
typical dichotomous treatment.Atrocities by the Khmer Rouge could 
be attributed to the Communist enemy and valuable propaganda points 
could be scored, although nothing useful could be done, or was even 
proposed, for the Cambodian victims.The image of Communist mon¬ 
sters would also be useful for subsequent U.S. participation in terror 
and violence, as in its crusades in Central America shortly after.In El 
Salvador, the United States backed the murderous junta in its struggle 
against what was depicted as “the Pol Pot left,” while Jeane Kirkpatrick 
mused darkly about the threat to El Salvador of “well-armed guerrillas 
whose fanaticism and violence remind some observers of Pol Pot”— 
shortly after the archbishop had denounced her junta friends for con¬ 
ducting a “war of extermination and genocide against a defenseless 
civilian population.” 6 Some are more circumspect—for example, Wil¬ 
liam Buckley, who observes that “the Sandinistas have given their 
people genocide” and are clearly heading in the direction of Pol Pot, 
although they have not quite reached that level yet.
