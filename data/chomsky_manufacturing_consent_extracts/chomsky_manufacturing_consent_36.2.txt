7 The utility of the 
show of outrage over Pol Pot atrocities is evident from the way the fate 
of these worthy victims was immediately exploited to justify U.S. orga¬ 
nization of atrocities that, in fact, do merit comparison to Pol Pot.Atrocities in East Timor, however, have no such utilitarian function; 
quite the opposite.These atrocities were carried out by our Indonesian 
client, so that the United States could readily have acted to reduce or 
terminate them.But attention to the Indonesian invasion would have 
embarrassed a loyal ally and quickly disclosed the crucial role of the 
United States in providing military aid and diplomatic support for 
aggression and slaughter.Plainly, news about East Timor would not 
have been useful, and would, in fact, have discomfited important do¬ 
mestic power groups.
