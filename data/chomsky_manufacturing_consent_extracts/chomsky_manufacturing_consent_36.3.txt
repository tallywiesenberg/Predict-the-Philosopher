responsibility for the aggression and 
massacres* In the process* the media provided neither facts nor analyses 
that would have enabled the public to understand the issues or the bases 
of government policies toward Cambodia and Timor* and they thereby 
assured that the public could not exert any meaningful influence on the 
decisions that were made* This is quite typical of the actual “societal 
purpose” of the media on matters that are of significance for established 
power; not “enabling the public to assert meaningful control over the 
political process*” but rather averting any such danger* In these cases* 
as in numerous others, the public was managed and mobilized from 
above, by means of the media’s highly selective messages and evasions* 
As noted by media analyst W, Lance Bennett* 

The public is exposed to powerful persuasive messages from 
above and is unable to communicate meaningfully through the 
media in response to these messages, * * , Leaders have usurped 
enormous amounts of political power and reduced popular control 
over the political system by using the media to generate support* 
compliance* and just plain confusion among the public.9 

More significantly for our particular concerns here, the media typically 
provide their own independent contribution even without being 
“used*” in the manner and for the reasons that we have discussed, 
Another media analyst, Ben Bagdikian, observes that the institutional 
bias of the private mass media “does not merely protect the corporate 
system.It robs the public of a chance to understand the real world,” 10 
That conclusion is well supported by the evidence we have reviewed* 
A propaganda model has a certain initial plausibility on guided free- 
market assumptions that are not particularly controversial* In essence* 
the private media are major corporations selling a product (readers and 
audiences) ro other businesses (advertisers).The national media typi¬ 
cally target and serve elite opinion* groups that, on the one hand* 
provide an optimal “profile” for advertising purposes* and, on the 
other, play a role in decision-making in the private and public spheres* 
The national media would be failing to meet their elite audience’s needs 
if they did not present a tolerably realistic portrayal of the world.But 
their “societal purpose” also requires that the media’s interpretation of 
the world reflect the interests and concerns of the sellers, the buyers, 
and the governmental and private institutions dominated by these 
groups.
