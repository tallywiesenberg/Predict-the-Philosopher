A propaganda model also helps us to understand how media person¬ 
nel adapt, and are adapted, to systemic demands.Given the imperatives 
of corporate organization and the workings of the various filters, con¬ 
formity to the needs and interests of privileged sectors is essential to 
success.In the media, as in other major institutions, those who do not 
display the requisite values and perspectives will be regarded as “irre¬ 
sponsible,“ideological,” or otherwise aberrant, and will tend to fall by 
the wayside- While there may be a small number of exceptions, the 
pattern is pervasive, and expected.Those who adapt, perhaps quite 
honestly, will then be free to express themselves with little managerial 
control, and they will be able to assert, accurately, that they perceive 
no pressures to conform.The media are indeed free—for those who 
adopt the principles required for their “societal purpose.” There may 
be some who are simply corrupt, and who serve as “errand boys” for 
state and other authority, but this is not the norm.
