11 We know from 
personal experience that many journalists are quite aware of the way 
the system operates, and utilize the occasional openings it affords to 
provide information and analysis that departs in some measure from the 
elite consensus, carefully shaping it so as to accommodate to required 
norms in a general way.But this degree of insight is surely not common.Rather, the norm is a belief that freedom prevails, which is true for 
those who have internalized the required values and perspectives.These matters are of some importance.We can readily understand 
why Guatemalan reporters do not report the atrocities of the 1980s; 
some fifty corpses dramatically illustrate the costs of deviance from 
authority on the part of independent journalists.
