The resulting tensions sometimes find 
limited expression, but more often they are suppressed either con¬ 
sciously or unconsciously, with the help of belief systems that permit 
the pursuit of narrow interest, whatever the facts.In the category of supportive factors, we find, first of all, elemental 
patriotism, the overwhelming wish to think well of ourselves, our insti¬ 
tutions, and our leaders.We see ourselves as basically good and decent 
in personal life, so it must be that our institutions function in accord¬ 
ance with the same benevolent intent, an argument that is often persua¬ 
sive even though it is a transparent non sequitur .The patriotic premise 
is reinforced by the belief that u we the people” rule, a central principle 
of the system of indoctrination from early childhood, but also one with 
little merit, as an analysis of the sociahand political system will quickly 
reveal.There are also real advantages in conformity beyond the re¬ 
wards and privilege that it yields.
