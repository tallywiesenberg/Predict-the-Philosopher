If one chooses to denounce Qaddafi, 
or the Sandinistas, or the FLO, or the Soviet Union, no credible evi¬ 
dence is required.The same is true if one repeats conventional doc¬ 
trines about our own society and its behavior—say, that the U.S. 
government is dedicated to our traditional noble commitment to de¬ 
mocracy and human rights.But a critical analysis of American institu¬ 
tions, the way they function domestically and their international 
operations, must meet far higher standards; in fact, standards are often 
imposed that can barely be met in the natural sciences.One has to work 
hard, to produce evidence that is credible, to construct serious argu¬ 
ments, to present extensive documentation—all tasks that are super¬ 
fluous as long as one remains within the presuppositional framework of 
the doctrinal consensus.It is small wonder that few are willing to 
undertake the effort, quite apart from the rewards that accrue to con¬ 
formity and the costs of honest dissidence.
