There are other considerations that tend to induce obedience.A 
journalist or commentator who does not want to have to work too hard 
can survive, even gain respectability, by publishing information (official 
or leaks) from standard sources; 12 these opportunities may well be 
denied to those who are not content to relay the constructions of state 
propaganda as fact.The technical structure of the media virtually 
compels adherence to conventional thoughts; nothing else can be ex¬ 
pressed between two commercials, or in seven hundred words, without 
the appearance of absurdity that is difficult to avoid when one is chal¬

in the narrowness of articulated opinion and analysis* The critic must 
also be prepared to face a defamation apparatus against which there is 
little recourse, an inhibiting factor that is not insubstantial.Many such 
factors exist, related to the essential structural features brought to light 
by a propaganda model but nevertheless worthy of derailed examina- 
tion in themselves.
