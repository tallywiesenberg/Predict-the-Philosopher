The result is a powerful system of induced conform¬ 
ity to the needs of privilege and power.In sum, the mass media of the United States are effective and power¬ 
ful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propa¬ 
ganda function by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, 
and self-censorship, and without significant overt coercion.This propa¬ 
ganda system has become even more efficient in recent decades with the 
rise of the national television networks, greater mass-media concentra¬ 
tion, right-wing pressures on public radio and television, and the 
growth in scope and sophistication of public relations and news man¬ 
agement* 

This system is not all-powerful, however* Government and elite 
domination of the media have not succeeded in overcoming the Viet¬ 
nam syndrome and public hostility to direct U.S. involvement in the 
destabilization and overthrow of foreign governments, A massive Rea- 
gan-era disinformation and propaganda effort, reflecting in large mea¬ 
sure an elite consensus, did succeed in its major aims of mobilizing 
support for the U.S. terror states (the “fledgling democracies”), while 
demonizing the Sandinistas and eliminating from Congress and the 
mass media all controversy beyond tactical debate over the means that 
should be employed to return Nicaragua to the “Central American 
mode” and “contain” its “aggressiveness” in attempting to defend itself 
from a murderous and destructive U.S. assault on al fronts.But it 
failed to win public support even for proxy army warfare against 
Nicaragua, and as the costs to the U*S* mounted, and the proxy war 
accompanied by embargo and other pressures succeeded in restoring 
the “Central American mode” of misery and suffering in Nicaragua and 
aborting the highly successful reforms and prospects for development 
of the early years after the overthrow of Washington's ally Somoza, 
elite opinion too shifted—quite dramatically, in fact—toward resort to 
other, more cost-effective means to attain shared ends* 13 The partial 
failures of the very well organized and extensive state propaganda 
effort, and the simultaneous rise of an active grass-roots oppositional 
movement with very limited media access, was crucial in making an 
outright U*S. invasion of Nicaragua unfeasible and driving the state 
underground, to illegal clandestine operations that could be better

concealed from the domestic population—with* in fact, considerable 
media complicity.14 

Furthermore, while there have been important structural changes 
centralizing and strengthening the propaganda system, there have been 
counterforces at work with a potential for broader access.
