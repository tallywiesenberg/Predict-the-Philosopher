The rise of 
cable and satellite communications, while initially captured and domi¬ 
nated by commercial interests, has weakened the power of the network 
oligopoly and retains a potential for enhanced local-group access.There are already some 3,000 public-access channels in use in the 
United States, offering 20,000 hours of locally produced programs per 
week, and there are even national producers and distributors of pro¬ 
grams for access channels through satellites (e.g., Deep-Dish Televi¬ 
sion), as well as hundreds of local suppliers, although all of them must 
struggle for funding.Grass-roots and public-interest organizations 
need to recognize and try to avail themselves of these media (and 
organizational) opportunities.15 Local nonprofit radio and television 
stations also provide an opportunity for direct media access that has 
been underutilized in the United States.In France, many local groups 
have their own radio stations.
