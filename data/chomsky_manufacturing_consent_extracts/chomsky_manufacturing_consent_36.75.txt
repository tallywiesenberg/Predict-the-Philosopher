In a notable case, the progressive cooper¬ 
ative Longo Mai, in Upper Provence, has its own 24-hour-a-day Radio 
Zinzine, which has become an important community institution that 
has helped inform and activate many previously isolated farmers.The 
potential value of noncommercial radio can be perceived in sections of 
the country where stations such as Pacifica Radio offer a view of the 
world, depth of coverage, and scope of discussion and debate that is 
generally excluded from the major media.Public radio and television, 
despite having suffered serious damage during the Reagan years, also 
represent an alternative media channel whose resuscitation and im¬ 
provement should be of serious concern to those interested in contest¬ 
ing the propaganda system.16 The steady commercialization of the 
publicly owned air waves should be vigorously opposed.In the long 
run, a democratic political order requires far wider control of and 
access to the media.
