Serious discussion of how this can be done, and 
the incorporation of fundamental media reform into political programs, 
should be high on progressive agendas, 17 

The organization and self-education of groups in the community 
and workplace, and their networking and activism, continue to be the 
fundamental elements in steps toward the democratization of our so¬ 
cial life and any meaningful social change.Only to the extent that such 
developments succeed can we hope to see media that are free and 
independent.Appendix i 


THE U.S. OFFICIAL OBSERVERS IN 
GUATEMALA, JULY 1-2, 1984 

For the July i, 1984, elections in Guatemala, the Reagan administration sent 
an observer team, headed by Republican Congressman Ralph Regula, that also 
included Congressmen Jack Hightower (Democrat, Texas) and Mickey Ed¬ 
wards (Republican, Oklahoma); Secretaries of State Jack Brier, of Kansas, and 
Ed Simcox, of Indiana; Father Kenneth Baker, editor of Homiletic and Pastoral 
Review , New York City; John Carbaugh, a Washington attorney; Jesse Fried¬ 
man, of the American Institute of Free Labor Development; Tom Kahn, of 
the AFL-CIO; Max Singer, of the Potomac Organization; and Howard Penni- 
man, the election specialist of the American Enterprise Institute.1 This group, 
in Guatemala for a very brief stay, was transported around the country to 
“observe” on election day by helicopter, and made a brief statement and held 
a press conference on July 2.That statement and the press conference pro¬ 
ceedings were released by the U.S. embassy in Guatemala City on July 18,1984, 
and form the basis for the discussion below.
