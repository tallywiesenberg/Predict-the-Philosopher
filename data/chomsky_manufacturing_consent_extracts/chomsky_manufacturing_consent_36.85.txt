Although Guatemala had been assailed by human-rights organizations for 
years for political murder on a vast scale and record-breaking numbers of 



“disappeared,” the words “murder” and “disappeared” do not appear in the 
remarks of any of the ten observers who spoke at the press conference.Other 
words or phrases never uttered were: “National Security Doctrine,” “Law of 
Illicit Association,” “state terrorism,” “death squad,” “massacre,” “torture,” 
“forced relocations,” “civil-defense patrols,” “freedom of the press,” or “vot¬ 
ing requirement.” None of the observers doubted the authenticity of “posi¬ 
tive” responses by Guatemalan peasants to questions by non-Spanish-speaking 
foreigners flown in by helicopter in a country subject to military occupation.All of the observers felt quite capable of assessing the true feelings of the 
Guatemalan people on the basis of long lines, facial expressions, and a handful 
of responses to visitors under official protection.There was no dissent among 
the observers from the conclusion that the election was fair, inspiring, a 
testimonial to the eagerness of the Guatemalan people to participate and 
express their patriotic sentiments, and a first step toward democracy.No 
demonstration-election cliche was omitted—history was blacked out, and no 
basic condition of a free election was examined by the observers.
