Let us sample a few of the cliches offered by these Guatemalan election 
observers: 

1.People full of hope—very positive start.This was a “dynamic begin¬ 
ning, ... a first step,” according to delegation head Ralph Regula.Father 
Kenneth Baker found a “great sense of hope for the future ... the spirit of 
hopefulness.” Jack Brier also observed “a spirit of hopefulness about the 
future, but not necessarily confidence in whatever actions may come about as 
a result of the elections.” (This is a very nuanced distinction that Brier was 
able to make on the basis of translated brief answers by a few voters.)Tom 
Kahn claimed that “many of the workers whom we spoke to on the voting lines 
told us that they had great hope, that this was a first step.” Kahn was asked 
during the press conference whether he had visited any of the embattled 
Coca-Cola workers.
