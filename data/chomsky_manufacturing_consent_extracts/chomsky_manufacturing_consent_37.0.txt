Howard Penniman 
noted “the extraordinary patience of the people voting.” Ed Simcox pointed 
out that the voters “did go out, they formed lines very early in the morning, 
they waited in some instances two, three, four hours to go up and vote.” 
According to Congressman Hightower, “The thing that impressed us instantly 
was the long lines.” Tom Kahn was impressed with the “calm and order which 
prevailed around the voting tables.” 

Long lines and patient voters are quite compatible with voting by a terror¬ 
ized population desiring mainly to survive.The official observers, who never 
once mention the record of spectacular state terror in Guatemala, merely 
postulate that voters who get in line and wait patiently do so for reasons that 
are benign.3 .The patriotic imperative .The main theme of this observer team is that 
the voters are eager to vote as good patriots, loyal to the militarized terrorist 


state that Ronald Reagan and the State Department find acceptable.
