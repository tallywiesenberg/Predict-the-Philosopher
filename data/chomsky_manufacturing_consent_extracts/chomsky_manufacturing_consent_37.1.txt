Jack Brier saw “absolutely no violence.I saw no evidence of direct 
military involvement.” A problem that Brier doesn’t discuss is that if pacifica¬ 
tion is thorough, no violence or substantial military presence will be necessary 
to confirm military choices.There is absolutely no violence or evidence of 
direct military involvement in elections in the Soviet Union.Brier plays dumb, 
pretending that violence on election day is really relevant, and ignoring the 
long-term violence that strips away institutional protections and produces a 
terrorized population.2 Congressman Mickey Edwards did find a military pres¬ 
ence in Guatemala, but it was not “oppressive”: “We did not find anything to 
indicate that the people in those areas were under any pressure or intimida¬ 
tion,” How hard Edwards looked must remain in doubt.
