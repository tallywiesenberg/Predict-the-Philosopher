Human rights improving.Congressman Mickey Edwards found that 
“by all objective observations, the human-rights record in this country has 
improved tremendously over the last two or three years.” He does not say what 
objective observations he is referring to.Max Singer also found that “the 
human-rights record is improving in Guatemala, as near as I can tell,” partly 
because the guerrilla movement has weakened, and that movement has been 
a serious threat to the human rights of the Guatemalan people.Singer was 
asked in the press conference how he determined this improvement.His 
answer was “From the statements of people living in the countryside.”
