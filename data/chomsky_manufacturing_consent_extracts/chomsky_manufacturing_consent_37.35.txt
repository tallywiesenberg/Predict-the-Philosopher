In sum, this was a caricature of observation, but a fairly typical performance 
of U.S. “official observers.” The report of this group was cited by Stephen 
Kinzer in the New York Times and elsewhere in the U.S. press as a serious 
source of information on the Guatemalan election.The official report of the 
Latin American Studies Association on the Nicaraguan election, written by 
specialists in the region after an intensive eight-day investigation, Kinzer and 
his mass-media colleagues never mentioned.Appendix 2 


TAGLIABUE’S FINALE ON THE 
BULGARIAN CONNECTION: 

A Case Study in Bias 

To show in another way the propagandistic quality of the mass media’s cover¬ 
age of the Bulgarian Connection, we will examine in detail the article by John 
Tagliabue, “Verdict on Papal Plot, But No Answer,” published in the New 
York Times on March 31,1986.This piece, which provides a final wrap-up that 
enters “history” as the mature judgment of the veteran Times newsman as¬ 
signed to the Rome trial, is a model illustration of the systematic bias that we 
believe characterized mass-media reporting of the Bulgarian Connection, with 
only minor exceptions, A close examination shows how Tagliabue incorporates 
all of the elements of the Sterling-Henze-Kalb (SHK) model of the connec¬ 
tion, selects facts in accordance with the requirements of that model, and 
bypasses conflicting facts and interpretations.1 


The Framing of the Issue: The Case 
Still “Unresolved” 

The court dismissal of the case against the Bulgarians in Rome confronted the 
Times with a problem of framing.
