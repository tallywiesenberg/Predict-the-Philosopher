The Times had presented the case as plausi¬ 
ble for years, and now had to confront the rejection of the case in a court 
decision.The solution was to latch on to the peculiar feature of the Italian 
judicial system whereby a party found not guilty can be declared positively 
innocent or not guilty for reason of lack of evidence.Thus, as the title of 
Tagliabue’s article suggests, there was a verdict, but “no answer,” and Taglia¬ 
bue’s first paragraph focuses on the “unresolved” nature of the case.It would 
have been possible to stress the fact that the Bulgarians were found not guilty 
for lack of evidence, and to emphasize that Western law requires positive proof 
of guilt.But the Times was not about to acknowledge defeat after five years 
of finding the Bulgarians guilty.
