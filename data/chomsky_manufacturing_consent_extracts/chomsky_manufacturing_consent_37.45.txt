Tagliabue also downplays the court decision by making it an unsurprising 
event.“Few people were surprised by the verdict,” states Tagliabue.But the 
failure to find the Bulgarians guilty should have been quite surprising, given 
the earlier assurances by Sterling and associates that the Bulgarians were 
clearly behind the plot, and that, as Paul Henze stated, the “evidence” has 
“steadily accumulated to the point where little real doubt is now possible.” 2 

An alternative frame would have been as follows: After a three-year investi¬ 
gation and lengthy trial, backed by the resources of the Italian state, and 
despite the powerful interests in Italy and the West with a stake in finding the 
Bulgarians guilty, the prosecution still failed to persuade an Italian jury of 
Bulgarian guilt.These vested interests and their propaganda vehicles were 
given a bone to chew on, however, in the form of a decision to dismiss the 
charge for “lack of evidence,” rather than complete exoneration.This then 
allowed the propaganda agencies to frame the case in the Tagliabue manner.
