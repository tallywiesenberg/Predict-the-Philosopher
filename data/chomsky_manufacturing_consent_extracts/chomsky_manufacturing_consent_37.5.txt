Protection of the Italian Judicial 
Process 

Throughout the history of the case, the U.S. mass media blacked out evidence 
of the compromised quality of the Italian institutions involved in pursuing the 
connection.Investigating Judge Martella was always treated as a model of 
probity, and conflicting facts were ignored.3 Operating in this tradition, Taglia¬ 
bue wastes space on a gratuitous and irrelevant accolade to Martella (which 
is also given a subheading for emphasis).His statement that “Few people stood 
up to assail the magistrate” is absurd, as the trial witnesses were asked to give 
concrete evidence on the facts of the case; they were not in a position to assail 
the pretrial investigating magistrate, and any such attempts would have been 
impermissible in the courtroom.Only the Bulgarian defense was well qualified 
and able to assail Martella, and they did so, in effective statements on March 
4-8, 1986, that were unreported in the Times and the rest of the mass media.
