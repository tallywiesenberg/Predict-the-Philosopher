Tagliabue points out that although the trial was supposed merely to verify the 


findings of the preliminary investigation, in fact the prosecution did a great 
deal of new investigative work.This suggests that the trial court may have 
found Martella’s investigation sadly lacking, but Tagliabue never addresses the 
point.Agca’s Desertion of the Case 

An important part of the apologetic framework is the claim that Agca, who had 
presented an allegedly coherent version of a connection up to the trial, sud¬ 
denly did an about face and refused to testify altogether.Tagliabue devotes 
several paragraphs to this theme, eventually suggesting that Agca’s increas¬ 
ingly erratic behavior “may have been designed to torpedo the efforts of the 
court.” He suggests that the prosecutor couldn’t overcome this difficulty, so 
that the loss of the case is lodged in Agca’s behavior rather than in any inherent 
deficiencies in the prosecution’s case.In reality, Agca’s claims emerged very slowly and contradictorily, with 
dozens of retractions that, taken together, are best explained by coaching, 
outside information, and guesses by Agca as to what Martella and the press 
would like to hear.
