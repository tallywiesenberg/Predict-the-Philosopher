There is no reason to believe that Agca ever offered or 
settled upon a coherent version of a Bulgarian connection.On the contrary, 
it appears that his version changed continually, and that the final result in 
Martella’s report was Martella’s own arbitrary synthesis.4 

The claim that Agca became more erratic during the trial is also not based 
on evidence.Agca’s persistently erratic behavior was obscured by the secrecy 
of his earlier testimony, but it is clear from the Martella report that he was 
already claiming to be Jesus and displaying other symptoms of irrationality.Furthermore, Tagliabue’s statement that Agca refused to cooperate during the 
trial is false—Agca periodically withdrew from the proceedings when his 
testimony became too incoherent, but he always returned to the stand, and he 
answered a vast number of questions.
