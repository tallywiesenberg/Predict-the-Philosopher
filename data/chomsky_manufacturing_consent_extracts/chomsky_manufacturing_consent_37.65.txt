One hypothesis that Tagliabue never 
entertains is that if Agca’s claims were based on coaching and/or imagination, 
in an open court he would be vulnerable and quickly pushed to the wall.Tagliabue also never asks this further question: Even if Agca had clammed 
up (which was not true), given the extensive Martella investigation and report, 
why would the court not be able to follow the already established leads to a 
successful outcome?Why was not a single witness produced to confirm Agca’s 
allegations of numerous meetings and trips with Bulgarians in Rome?Why was 
the car allegedly rented by the Bulgarians never found?Where is the money 
supposedly given to Agca?
