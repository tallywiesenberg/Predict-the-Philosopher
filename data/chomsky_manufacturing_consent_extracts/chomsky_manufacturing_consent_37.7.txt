Tagliabue fails to address these questions.“Partial Confirmation” of Agca’s 

Tale 

Tagliabue describes some alleged partial confirmations of Agca’s claims.The 
first is that “Mr.Ozbey said the Bulgarians had indeed wanted to use Mr. Agca 



to shoot the Pope, but did not trust him.” But this is not a partial confirmation 
if the net result was that the Bulgarians failed to hire Agca.Furthermore, 
another reporter present when Ozbey testified in Rome claims that Ozbey did 
not tell the court that the Bulgarians “wanted to use” Agca.
