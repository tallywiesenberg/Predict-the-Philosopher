According to 
Wolfgang Achtner, of ABC-TV News, in Rome, the only thing Ozbey said was 
that the Bulgarians “listened with interest, but behaved with indifference” (the 
translation by the Turkish interpreter in court), or “listened with interest but 
didn’t take it seriously” (Achtner’s own translation).In short, it would appear 
that Tagliabue has doctored the evidence.The other “partial confirmation” is that “Catli hinted at obscure secret 
service contacts with West German intelligence, and of payments for unspeci¬ 
fied purposes to Turks involved in the investigations.” This vague statement 
does not even mention the plot against the pope and is partial confirmation 
of nothing.The most important Catli evidence bearing on this point was his 
description of the attempt by the West German police to bribe Agca’s supposed 
co-conspirator Oral Celik to come to West Germany and confirm Agca’s 
claims.This supports the coaching hypothesis: accordingly, Tagliabue blacks 
it out.
