The only other testimony by Catli mentioning the secret services in¬ 
volved Gray Wolves leader Ali Batman, who told Catli he had heard from the 
German secret police that at a meeting in Romania, the Warsaw Pact powers 
had decided to kill the pope.This was apparently a leak of the forged SISMI 
document of May 19, 1981, which had made this claim.Thus the hearsay 
recounting of the substance of a forgery is Tagliabue’s “partial confirmation” 
of Agca’s claims of a plot.We should also note that while he cites these alleged “partial confirma¬ 
tions,” nowhere does Tagliabue list the contentions of Agca that remained 
unconfirmed.The Soviet-Bulgarian Motive 

Two of Tagliabue’s thirty-two paragraphs were devoted to expounding the 
Soviet motive in allegedly sponsoring Agca’s assassination attempt: “to crack 
religiously inspired resistance to Communist rule in Poland.” Tagliabue here 
follows a long-standing Times tradition of absolutely refusing to allow a coun¬ 
terargument to be voiced on this issue.
