He fails to note here, and the Times suppressed throughout, Catli’s 
testimony in Rome that the Gray Wolves liked to go through Bulgaria to reach 
Western Europe because the heavy Turkish traffic made it easy to hide.Taglia¬ 
bue fails to mention that bringing Agca for a long stay in Sofia would have been 
a violation of the rule of plausible deniability.Even more so would be using 
Bulgarians to help Agca in Rome.Tagliabue does not discuss the question of 
plausible deniability.He also fails to note that if Agca had stayed in Sofia for 
a while, this would allow a prima facie case to be made by a Western propagan¬ 
dist that the East was behind the shooting, and could provide the basic materi¬ 
als for working Agca over for the desired confession.
