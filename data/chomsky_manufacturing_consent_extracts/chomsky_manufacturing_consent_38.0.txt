Bulgarian Involvement in Turkey 

Tagliabue asserts that the Bulgarians were “purportedly” supporting both the 
extreme left and right in Turkey “to promote instability” in a conflict “that 
pitted violent leftist terrorists against their counterparts on the right.” This is 
a Sterling myth, with Tagliabue hiding behind “purportedly” to allow him to 
pass off myth as purported evidence.The equating of left and right in the 
Turkish violence of the 1970s is false: the great majority of violent attacks were 
launched by the Gray Wolves, under the protection of the police and military.Tagliabue also fails to discuss the fact that the extreme right actually par¬ 
ticipated in the government in 1977 and had extensive links to the army and 
intelligence services.The claim of Bulgarian support for both the right and left 
has never been supported by evidence.Tagliabue never mentions that the 
United States had more than “purported” links with the Turkish army, the 
secret services, and the Fascist Nationalist Action party, and that the terrorist 
events of the late 1970s eventually served U.S. interests well.
