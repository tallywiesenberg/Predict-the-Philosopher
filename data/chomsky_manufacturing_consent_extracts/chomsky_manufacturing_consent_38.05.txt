Key Question: How Agca Knew So 

Much 

The “key question” for Tagliabue is “how Agca knew what he knew and when 
he knew it.” This is an important issue, but there are others that he might have 


raised if he had worked outside the SHK format.Why did it take Agca so long 
to name Bulgarians?Was he subject to any coercion or offered any positive 
inducements to make him talk.Why did he have to make major retractions?Is it not suspicious that when Agca finally talked, he said just what his inter¬ 
rogators wanted him to say?
