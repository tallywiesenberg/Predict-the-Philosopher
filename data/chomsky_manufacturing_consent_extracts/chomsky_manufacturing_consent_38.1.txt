How are we to evaluate a judicial process where 
the witness (Agca) was in regular contact with outside sources of information 
and where he could lie and retract evidence without penalty?“Even the Attorneys for the 
Bulgarians...,” 

In assessing how Agca knew so much, Tagliabue allocates only one paragraph 
to the possibility that Agca was coached.On the other hand, he goes to great 
pains to stress that Agca knew an awful lot—telephone numbers, personal 
habits, nicknames.Tagliabue gives as the “simplest explanation” of Agca’s 
knowledge that he had access to books, newspapers, magazines, and other 
materials from the outside.Interestingly, he fails to mention the numerous 
prison contacts between Agca and secret service, Mafia, and Vatican agents 
and emissaries.
