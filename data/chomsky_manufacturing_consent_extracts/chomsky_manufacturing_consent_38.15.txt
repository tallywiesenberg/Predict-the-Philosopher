Agca even wrote a letter to the Vatican complaining of the 
pressure from its representative in prison (also linked to the Mafia), a fact long 
blacked out by the Times.These visits would point to the ease with which Agca 
could have been fed information while in prison.Tagliabue will not admit facts 
that get into this dangerous territory.A major question is how Agca knew details about Antonov’s apartment when 
he later admitted to Martella that he had never been there .The Bulgarians and 
Antonov’s defense went to great pains to prove that the information Agca 
provided about Antonov’s apartment had never been divulged in the media 
before Agca enumerated the details.
