This implied coaching, as did a mistake 
in identification where Agca described a characteristic of Antonov’s apartment 
that fitted other apartments in the building, but not Antonov’s.Tagliabue says 
that “Even the attorneys for the Bulgarians acknowledge” that Agca named 
things not available through reading the papers, as if they were conceding a 
point, not making a devastating case for coaching.Newspaper work couldn’t 
be more dishonest than this.reports, had mentioned Mafia official Giovanni Pandico’s statement in Italy 
outlining a scenario of coaching at which he claimed to be present, but Taglia¬ 
bue doesn’t even cite this or any other documents or facts that lend support 
to the coaching hypothesis.He sticks to the ingredients that fit the SHK 
format—good Martella, Agca the betrayer of the case, the Soviet motive, 
Agca’s visit to Bulgaria, and his knowledge of details.
