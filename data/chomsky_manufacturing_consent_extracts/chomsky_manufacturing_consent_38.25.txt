Tagliabue closes his article with a quote from Agca’s attorney that the Bulgari¬ 
ans “should be thankful” to Agca.This reiterates one of Tagliabue’s preferred 
themes—that Agca deliberately blew the case.This is derived from Sterling’s 
theory that Agca’s vacillations were really “signals” to the Bulgarians, alter¬ 
nately threatening and rewarding them, but aiming at getting them to help him 
out of jail.In his earlier articles Tagliabue followed this line, and it is implicit 
in this summing-up article, although it is a wholly unproven Sterling gimmick.
