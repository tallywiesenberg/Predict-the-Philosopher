What was Agca bargaining for in the trial?Did he expect the Bulgarians to 
spring him?To admit their own involvement in the case by arranging a deal 
for his release?And if he was sabotaging the case in order to win favor with 
the Bulgarians, and since the Bulgarians obviously refused to respond, why did 
he not finally decide to do them injury?Tagliabue never addresses these points.
