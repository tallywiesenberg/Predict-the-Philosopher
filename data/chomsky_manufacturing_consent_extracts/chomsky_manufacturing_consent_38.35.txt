In sum, this is a model case of propaganda under the guise of “news” or 
“news analysis.” In this instance there are a number of lies, but these are less 
important than the other systematic distortions.Tagliabue and the Times 
frame the issue in terms of probable Bulgarian guilt and the factors that caused 
the case to be lost—exclusive of those suggesting that there was no case to 
begin with.They refuse to discuss the failure to obtain confirmation of any 
factual claims of meetings or deals with Bulgarians.They fail to discuss—or 
even to mention—problems of plausible deniability.They reiterate the ele¬ 
ments of the preferred SHK model without noting the illogic or the incompati¬ 
ble facts.
