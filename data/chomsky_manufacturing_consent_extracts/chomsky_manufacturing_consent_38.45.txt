As we saw, in this 
case too the behavior of the media conforms to the expectations of the propa¬ 
ganda model, and the major theses advanced in the Freedom House study are 
refuted even by their own evidence.What remains of their charge is the 
possibility that media coverage of the Tet offensive was technically incompe¬ 
tent, although subordinated to elite requirements.Turning to a closer exami¬ 
nation of this charge, we find that the shoe is on the other foot: when “Freedom 
House exclusives” are corrected, the performance of the media appears quite 
creditable, while the incompetence of the Freedom House study is seen to 
transcend even the level already demonstrated.That this study has been taken 
seriously, and permitted to set much of the agenda for subsequent discussion, 
is a most intriguing fact.According to Freedom House, television commentary and Newsweek are the 




worst offenders in this ‘‘extreme case” of journalistic incompetence, so let us 
begin by reviewing some of their sins.
