One example to which Braestrup reverts 
several times is Walter Cronkite’s “much publicized half-hour CBS ‘special 5 
on the war 55 on February 27 {Big Story, I, 158).According to Braestrup, 
Cronkite 5 s “assessment” here is “that U.S. troops would have to garrison the 
countryside” (I, 645).In his foreword, Leonard Sussman properly observes 
that “We do not expect the reader to accept on faith our various analyses or 
judgments,” and so “the complete texts of many of the reports discussed 55 are 
presented, primarily in volume II (I, x).Following his advice, we turn to 
volume II, where we find the complete text of Cronkite’s “special 55 (i8off.).There is not even a remote hint of the “assessment 55 that Braestrup attributes 
to him.
