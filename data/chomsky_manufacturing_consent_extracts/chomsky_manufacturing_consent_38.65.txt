Note the typical reiteration of government propaganda concerning American 
aims, unsullied by the factual record—enormous in scale, by this time—of U.S. 
government efforts to undermine democracy and to destroy all popular 
forces—the NLF, the Buddhist “third force, 55 etc.—in South Vietnam, on the 
assumption, openly admitted, that the forces placed in power by U.S. violence 
could not survive political competition.Recall also that in these comments that 
Freedom House derides, Cronkite reaches essentially the same conclusion as 
did the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Wheeler, in his summary 
to the president on the same day as Cronkite’s broadcast, and the president’s 
advisers a month later.We may note also that two weeks earlier, Cronkite had “assessed 55 the 
impact of the Communist offensive, on the basis of U.S. and Vietnamese 
sources, reporting that “first, and simplest, the Vietcong suffered a military 
defeat” ( 1 ,158).Similarly, on an NBC-TV special of March 10 that Braestrup 
repeatedly condemns, Howard Tuckner stated that “Militarily the allies won 55 
(I, 159), as did others repeatedly.Cronkite’s “special” is exhibit A in the Freedom House indictment.
