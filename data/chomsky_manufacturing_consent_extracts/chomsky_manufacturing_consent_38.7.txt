The 
example is typical of the relation between their conclusions and the evidence 
they cite.Braestrup refers to a television comment by Robert Schakne on February 
28 for which he gives the following paraphrase: “In short, the United States 
would now have to take over the whole war, including the permanently dam¬ 
aged pacification program, because of Saigon’s failures” ( 1 ,562-63).Braestrup 
claims further that Schackne attributed “this argument” to Robert Komer.This he calls “a CBS exclusive,” his standard term of derision.In fact, “this 
argument” is yet another “Freedom House exclusive.” What Schackne said, 
according to Braestrup, is that it was “likely” that Komer was in Washington 
with General Wheeler to ask for more troops “to help get the Vietnam pacifi¬ 
cation program back on the road.” The preceding day, Wheeler had requested 
that the troop level be raised from 525,000 to 731,756, one primary concern 
being that “There is no doubt that the RD Program [pacification] has suffered 
a severe set back,” that “To a large extent the VC now control the country¬ 
side,” and that “US forces will be required in a number of places to assist and 
encourage the Vietnamese Army to leave the cities and towns and reenter the 
country.” 1 While Braestrup’s version of Schackne’s “argument” has little re¬ 
semblance to the actual words he attributes to Schackne, these words were, 
if anything, understated.
