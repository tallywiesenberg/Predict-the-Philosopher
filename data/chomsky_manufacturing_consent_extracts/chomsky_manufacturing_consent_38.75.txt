Braestrup then goes on to claim that Cronkite “used the same argument 
almost verbatim, but with an even stronger conclusion” in a February 28 radio 
broadcast.There is no hint in the actual broadcast of Braestrup’s “argument.” 
The closest Cronkite came to this “argument” is his statement that “presuma¬ 
bly, Ambassador Komer told a sad tale to President Johnson” (Braestrup’s empha¬ 
sis).Cronkite then repeated accurately the basic facts presented by Komer in 
a briefing four days earlier.He concluded that “it seems likely that today 
Ambassador Komer asked President Johnson for more American troops so that 
we can permanently occupy the hamlets and fulfill the promise of security [«c] 
to their residents, a promise the Vietnamese alone apparently cannot honor,” 
the NLF not being Vietnamese, as usual.Apart from the tacit assumption of 
the propaganda system that the villagers yearn for the fulfillment of this 
“promise of security” from the NLF, Cronkite’s speculation that U.S. troops 
would have to fulfill a promise that ARVN alone apparently could not honor 
hardly seems unreasonable, three days after General Westmoreland had stated 
that “additional U.S. forces would probably be required” (II, 159), and that 
with them “we could more effectively deny the enemy his objectives”; four 
days after Komer had described the Tet offensive as a “considerable setback” 
to pacification; a day after Cronkite had presented a television interview with 
Captain Donald Jones, deputy pacification adviser for the district regarded as 
“the bowl of pacification,” who said that “for most of the District, pacification 
does not exist,” and travel there is impossible (CBS-TV “special” of February 
27, cited above); and one day after General Wheeler had asked for a huge troop 
increase justified in part by the need to overcome the fact that “To a large 
extent the VC now control the countryside.” 

Television and radio are not alone in being subjected to “Freedom House 
exclusives.” Here are a few examples.
