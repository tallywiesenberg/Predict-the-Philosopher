Exuding contempt and derision, the study informs us that “no one” except 
for George McArthur (AP) and Don Oberdorfer (Knight) “reported ... on 
what happened to Hue’s civilians under Vietcong rule” ( 1 ,299).Again demon- 




strating his considerable gift for self-refutation, Braestrup cites reports on 
Vietcong executions, kidnappings, burial of executed civilians in mass graves, 
etc., in Hue under Viet Cong rule by Newsweek, UPI, Washington Post, William 
Ryan, Reuters, New York Times, Time, London Times, and the NBC “Today” 
show ( 1 ,277, 281-84,472).On page 283, Braestrup writes that “The television 
networks, as far as our records show, made no mention of the executions at 
all”; on page 472, he refutes this claim, noting that on February 28, in an 
“aftermath film report from Hue ... at battle’s end,” the NBC “Today” show 
“hinted at the Hue massacre with this statement: ‘Hundreds of government 
workers were killed and thrown into temporary graves.’ ” A rather broad 
“hint,” it would seem.The example is typical of the Freedom House style of 
handling evidence.In this connection, we should observe that the numerous stories on the Hu6 
massacre cited by Braestrup in self-refutation referred to the official allega¬ 
tions that 300 to 400 government officials were killed in Hu6, a considerable 
massacre but “only one-tenth of the civilian toll in the fighting,” so that “it 
did not seem like a major story,” Gareth Porter comments; he adds that “What 
made the ‘Hue massacre’ a major story was the publicizing by U.S. embassy 
propagandist Douglas Pike, who wrote a pamphlet on the subject in late 1969 
at the request of the American ambassador to Saigon, Ellsworth Bunker.” 
Pike’s account was given wide coverage when it appeared and has become the 
basis for the standard versions since, despite the dubious source: “given the 
fact that Pike was relying on the Saigon political warfare department for most 
of his data, which was otherwise unverified, one might have asked for more 
skepticism and reserve from the press,” Porter observes—rather plausibly, it 
would seem.
