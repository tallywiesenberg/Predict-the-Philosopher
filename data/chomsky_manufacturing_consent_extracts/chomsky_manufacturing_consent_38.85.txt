Porter adds that the documents made available by the U.S. 
mission in 1971 “contradicted Pike on every major point.” According to former 
CIA analyst Frank Snepp, “The whole idea of a bloodbath was conjured out 
of thin air,” and the stories were planted in the press by American officials “to 
generate sympathy for the South Vietnamese abroad”—in short, the “careful 
psychological warfare program pinning the blame on the communists” urged 
by “seasoned observers,” as John Lengel of AP reported from Hu6.2 

Presenting no evidence or argument, Braestrup accepts Pike’s analysis and 
the U.S. government position as correct.In a footnote, he remarks that “Pike’s 
account was challenged by D. Gareth Porter, a Cornell University graduate 
student, admirer of the National Liberation Front, and, briefly, a Saigon 
resident,” but dismisses this as part of “a minor point of political contention” 
( 1 ,285-86).He describes Pike, in contrast, as “the independent-minded USIA 
specialist on the Vietcong” ( 1 ,196), 3 and makes no reference to the detailed 
analysis of Pike’s allegations that had been presented by Porter, one of the few 
American scholars concerned with Vietnam.Similarly, Leonard Sussman takes 
it as obvious, without argument, that the government position must be correct, 
and that “the war’s largest systematic execution of civilians” is the responsi¬ 
bility of the Viet Cong—thus excluding the systematic slaughter of thousands 
of civilians in Hu6 by U.S. firepower, possibly including many of those at¬ 
tributed to the Viet Cong massacre.
