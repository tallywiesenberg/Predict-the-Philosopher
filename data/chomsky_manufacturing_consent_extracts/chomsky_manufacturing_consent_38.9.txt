4 Also unmentioned here is the curious 
timing of the exposures that have since become the standard version of the 
Hue massacre, a few days after the belated exposure of the My Lai massacre 
in late November 1969, when 


Army officers in Saigon made available “newly found” captured Viet 
Cong documents showing that Communist troops killed nearly 2,900 
Vietnamese during the Hue offensive in February, 1968.Officers said the 
documents went unnoticed in U.S. military files for nineteen months 
until a correspondent’s questions about Hue brought them to light.“I 
know it sounds incredible, but that’s the truth,” one official said.5 

We will not attempt to explore in this review what is not so much as attempted 
in the Freedom House study, but merely note, once again, that we have here 
not a work of scholarship but rather a government propaganda tract.Max Frankel commented in the New York Times (Feb. 11,1968) that pres¬ 
sures at home and in Vietnam “are thought to have raised once again the 
temptation of further military escalation” (I, 584, italicized by Braestrup for 
emphasis as an example of raising “straw men”).
