Frankel was quite accurate 
in this measured statement.As Braestrup points out, “Wheeler and Westmore¬ 
land agreed that it was also a good time to urge a bolder Vietnam strategy, with 
more troops to gain quicker results: i.e., forays into Laos, Cambodia, and 
possibly that part of North Vietnam just above the DMZ.” Why then the 
“straw man” charge?Because, Braestrup objects, escalation “was hardly a 
tempting prospect for Johnson” (his emphasis), hardly Frankel’s point.Brae¬ 
strup claims further that Frankel, in this article, suggested “that escalation— 
notably a reserve call-up—was probable” (I, 586).Frankel’s article does not 
appear in the accompanying volume of documents; turning to it, we discover 
that Braestrup’s claim is another Freedom House exclusive, suggested no¬ 
where in Frankel’s article, which is noteworthy only for its standard reiteration 
of government propaganda about the goal of bringing “security” to “the people 
of South Vietnam”—by B-52 bombing of villages, the exploits of Task Force 
Barker at and around My Lai at just that time as part of the general ravaging 
of Quang Ngai Province, etc.
