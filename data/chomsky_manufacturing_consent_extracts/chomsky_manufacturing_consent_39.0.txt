After television, Newsweek is the worst offender.Let us therefore inquire 
further into its misdeeds.In what Braestrup describes as “Newsweek*^ major 
statement on the Thieu-Ky regime,” a March 18 feature entitled “Vietnam: A 
Reappraisal,” the journal commented accurately in an editorial entitled “The 
Political Morass” that “land reform, a vital element in any effort to win the 
loyalty of the peasantry, has not been tackled seriously” (I, 534-36), a truism 
familiar to everyone from the American high command to officials in Washing¬ 
ton.Braestrup comments: “It is difficult, once again, to fathom Newsweek* s 
logic.Surely, neither Newsweek nor the Vietnamese peasant expected the 
regime to tackle land reform seriously in the aftermath of Tet.” It is perfectly 
obvious that in this “reappraisal,” Newsweek is referring to the general picture, 
not specifically to the post-Tet period of one month.
