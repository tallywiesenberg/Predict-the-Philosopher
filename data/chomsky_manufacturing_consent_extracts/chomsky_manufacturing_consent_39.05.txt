According to Braestrup, “Newsweek, throughout the February-March 1968 
period, was to refer, in passing, to the ‘wily’ Giap, ‘tough’ North Vietnamese 
regulars, ‘ominous’ enemy activity, and in general, to a foe without setbacks 
or flaws” (I, 229).Turning to the facts, on March 11, Newsweek presented an 
analysis in which it reported that the Communists “were still plagued by the 
confusion that is characteristic of all military operations.” The report (II, 2i6f.)goes on to describe “inexplicable” failure to blow up a crucial bridge, failure 
to use main forces adequately to maintain momentum, misassessment of popu- 



lar moods and U.S.-ARVN tactics, inadequate preparation of troops, etc., 
concluding that “the communists did not achieve most of their objectives.” 
The following week’s article on Khe Sanh reports a marine view that “Charlie 
missed his golden opportunity” by bad tactics.Newsweek ’s picture of “a foe 
without setbacks or flaws” is another Freedom House exclusive.What of the other sins?
