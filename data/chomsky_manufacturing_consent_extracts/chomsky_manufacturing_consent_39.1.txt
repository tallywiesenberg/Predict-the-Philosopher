As for the reference to the “wily” Giap, compare 
Newsweek with what Braestrup regards as the outstanding analysis by Douglas 
Pike, who describes Giap as a “master tactician,” “one of the best tactical 
commanders of the 20th century,” etc.(I, i96f.).On the “toughness” of the 
North Vietnamese and their “ominous” activity, see the regular reports of the 
U.S. military command, and an extensive literature by Vietnam veterans.Braestrup claims that “one searches in vain through most of the media 
descriptions of the foe, even well into March 1968, for indications that the 
enemy’s planning, tactics, execution, zeal, and weaponry were less than flaw¬ 
less”; “there were few hints in Times analyses or battlefield reporting that the 
foe was anything but shrewd, tenacious, ascetic, infallible and menacing, and 
in this case the paper had plenty of company” (I, 186, 216).Apart from 
“flawless” and “infallible,” further Freedom House exclusives, the adjectives 
can be taken from the military reports and seem unexceptionable.
