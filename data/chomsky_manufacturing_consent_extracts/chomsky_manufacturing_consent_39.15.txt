The claim 
that the media regarded the enemy as infallible is defended through pages 186 
to 231, along with typical Freedom House self-refutation: example after exam¬ 
ple to the contrary is cited, in addition to those just mentioned.The media 
reported that the VC “undoubtedly” alienated the population, as they caused 
“indiscriminate slaughter” and “totally misjudged the mood of the South 
Vietnamese.” They may be suffering “a severe manpower problem” and “hurt¬ 
ing badly.” 6 They “failed to achieve their main objectives.” Captured VC got 
lost in Saigon and were falsely told that they would be welcomed.(This 
appears under Braestrup’s heading “Television: in praise of the VC.”) They 
did not “get—or heed” important information.And so on.All in all, hardly 
the picture of an “infallible” and “flawless” enemy.
