Note also the Freedom House assumption that a free press, militantly 
guarding its objectivity, should not only consider those who are resisting the 
U.S. attack as “the enemy,” “the foe,” etc., but must also refrain from accu¬ 
rately describing “the enemy” as tough, resolute, and courageous.To play its 
proper role in a free society by Freedom House standards, the media should 
never veer a moment from the kind of service to the state demanded and 
secured by force in totalitarian states, so it appears.The impact of the Freedom House study comes from the impression of 
massive documentation and the huge resources that were employed to obtain 
and analyze it.Case by case, the examples collapse on inspection.Here are a 
few more examples, far from exhaustive.
