On pacification, “TV and radio commentators went far beyond the available 
information to imply the dramatic worst.” Three examples are cited to prove 
the point ( 1 ,565).Howard Tuckner, of NBC-TV, reported from New York the 
views of “U.S.intelligence officials” and “Some U.S. officials in Vietnam”— 
correctly, as Braestrup concedes in a footnote, adding that these were the views 
of “CIA in Washington” and “Disheartened junior CORDS officials in Viet¬ 
nam.” By Freedom House standards, it is improper to cite such sources accu¬ 
rately.The second example is a CBS radio report criticized only for being 


“depressed”—as were pacification officials on the ground.The third example 
is from an NBC-TV “special,” in which Dean Brelis says that we don’t know 
what is happening in the rural areas but “can only imagine,” and that “the 
cities are no longer secure; perhaps they never were.” 8 Hardly remarkable, and 
far from the fevered conclusion drawn in Braestrup’s paraphrase.
