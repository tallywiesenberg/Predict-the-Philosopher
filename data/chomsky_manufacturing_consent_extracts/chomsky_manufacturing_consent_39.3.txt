Examples of what Braestrup calls “straw man journalism” abound in his 
own presentation.Thus he faults the media for claiming that the pacification 
program had been destroyed, whereas his own conclusion is that “pacification, 
although hit hard, was not ‘dead’... it was a mixed picture, but clearly neither 
a military nor a psychological ‘disaster’ ” ( 1 ,716).The media regularly reported 
that pacification was hit hard, not dead, as his own evidence clearly shows—in 
contrast to the Pentagon, which took a more pessimistic view, as we shall see 
directly.Braestrup’s “straw man journalism” may impress careless readers 
cifinuning the text for dramatic conclusions, but it presents no evidence and 
amounts to no argument.Braestrup refers sarcastically to “insights into Vietnamese psychology,” as 
when Morley Safer, watching marines burning down huts in Cam Ne, con¬ 
cluded that a peasant whose home was destroyed would find it hard to believe 
“that we are on his side” (I, 43).
