How does Safer know?Perhaps the peasant 
enjoyed watching the flames.Not all such “psychoanalyzing” is derided, how¬ 
ever, as when General Westmoreland explains that “the people in the cities 
are largely indignant at the Vietcong for violating the sanctity of the Tet period 
and for their tactics which brought about damage to the cities” (II, 164), or 
when he expounds on the peasant “state of mind” (I, 78).Note that Safer is 
not criticized for accepting the tacit assumption that the press is an agency of 
the invading army (“we are on his side”).Braestrup states that “the embassy fight became the whole Tet offensive on 
TV and in the newspapers during that offensive’s second day” (his emphasis; 
1,126); this illustration of the incompetence of the media is thoroughly refuted 
by his story index.
