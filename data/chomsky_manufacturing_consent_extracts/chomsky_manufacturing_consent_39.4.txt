He also claims that the media exaggerated VC success in 
the early confusion by claiming that the embassy had been entered—failing, 
however, to compare these accounts with the reports by military police that 
they were taking fire from inside the embassy, or the message log of the 716th 
MP Battalion, which reads: “General Westmoreland calls; orders first priority 
effort to recapture U.S. Embassy” ( 1 ,92; our emphasis).It is intriguing to read 
Braestrup’s outrage over quite accurate press reporting of what was said by 
Westmoreland, military police involved in the fight, and others, and in particu¬ 
lar over the fact that the press did not simply rely on Westmoreland’s later 
account (his apparent belief that the embassy had been “captured” goes be¬ 
yond any reporter’s error that Braestrup cites).A careful reading shows that 
media reports were surprisingly accurate, given the confusion of the moment, 
although one cannot fault Braestrup’s profound conclusion that “first reports 
are always partly wrong,” which will come as a startling insight to the working 
journalist.Repeatedly, the study claims that the media were “vengeful” or bent on 
“retribution” in reacting skeptically to government claims.An alternative 
possibility is that this reaction reflected a newfound realism.
