.commanded their units effectively,” whereas, as a journalist 
learned, one “had gone into a state of shock during the Tet attacks” ( 1 ,454-55).Or consider Westmoreland’s claim that allegations about inaccuracy and in¬ 
flation of body counts were “one of the great distortions of the war” by the 
media—there were at most “relatively small inaccuracies” (II, 163).His own 
generals had a rather different view.In his study of the opinions of the 
generals, General Douglas Kinnard reports that 61 percent of those responding 
describe the body count as “often inflated,” and only 26 percent “within reason 
accurate.” The responses include: “a fake—totally worthless,” “often blatant 
lies,” “a blot on the honor of the Army,” and “grossly exaggerated by many 
units primarily because of the incredible interest shown by people like 
McNamara and Westmoreland.” Perhaps journalists had some reason for 
skepticism, apart from “vengefulness.” 9 

To demonstrate the absurd extent of press efforts to find shock value, 
Braestrup cites a story in Time on enemy tunneling at Khe Sanh, “as occurred 
around Dienbienphu” ( 1 ,435; his emphasis), in general ridiculing the analogy— 
but forgetting to ridicule the remark by Marine Commander General Cush¬ 
man, who said that “He is digging trenches and doing other tricks of the trade 
which he learned to do at Dienbienphu” (I, 403).
