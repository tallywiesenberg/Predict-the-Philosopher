“All Vietnam, it appeared on film at home, was in flames or being battered 
into ruins, and all Vietnamese civilians were homeless refugees,” Braestrup 
alleges (1,234), in typically fanciful rhetoric, adding that “there were virtually 
no films shown or photographs published during this period of undamaged 
portions of Saigon, Hue, or other cities” (his emphasis).This shows that 
coverage was unbalanced, supportive of the enemy.One wonders how many 
films and photographs of peaceful English villages or Hawaiian towns ap¬ 
peared on the days that Coventry and Pearl Harbor were bombed, to balance 
the picture.Braestrup seeks the causes for the “exoneration of the Vietcong” for “killing 
noncombatants or causing the exodus of refugees” (I, 234), overlooking the 
fact that before seeking the cause of x it is necessary to show that x is true.In this case, it is not.
