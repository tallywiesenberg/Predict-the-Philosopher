The accounts he cites regularly blame the Viet Cong for 
civilian suffering and emphasize Viet Cong atrocities.In fact, he himself points 
out that “both Time and Newsweek put the onus on the Vietcong” in Saigon 
( 1 ,246)—as elsewhere.Newsweek titled an article “The VC’s Week of Terror 
(Feb. 12) and described VC terror squads executing civilians in Saigon ( 1 , 49 °)- 
Typically, the media blamed the Viet Cong for having “brought bullets and 
bombs into the very midst of heavily populated areas, causing indiscriminate 
slaughter of civilians caught in the cross fire and making homeless twice oyer 
the refugees who had fled to the cities for safety...” (Time, [ 1 ,246]), adopting 
the position of U.S. government propaganda that the enemy is to blame if the 
United States kills and destroys, and failing to add that the refugees had fled 


to the cities for safety from massive U.S. violence and that such refugee 
generation was explicit policy.10 In the New York Times, Charles Mohr wrote 
that “In one sense the Vietcong have been responsible for civilian deaths by 
launching the urban attacks,” citing American officials who are “sure that the 
population will be bitter about the guerrillas because of their ‘callous disregard 
for human life’ ” (I, 243).Meanwhile, AP, the Washington Post, NBC, and 
others reported Viet Cong causing destruction, using civilians as shields, pre¬ 
venting civilians from fleeing attack, murdering civilians, etc., often on the 
basis of flimsy evidence that would elicit much Freedom House derision if used 
to support accounts of American atrocities.
