In a typical misrepresentation, 
Braestrup claims that NBC-TV “attributed Saigon’s losses solely to an allied 
military decision to ‘kill or maim some of the people’ to protect the rest” (our 
emphasis), citing Howard Tuckner’s statement that there was a decision “that 
in order to protect most of the ...people, they had to kill or maim some of 
the people”—a statement that is quite different from the paraphrase and is 
noteworthy only for its standard reference to “protecting” the victims (1,249).In general, far from “exonerating the Vietcong,” the media bent over back¬ 
wards to blame them for the casualties and destruction caused by the U.S. 
forces who were “protecting” and “defending” South Vietnam and its popula¬ 
tion, according to unquestioned dogma.
