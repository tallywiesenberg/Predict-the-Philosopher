We have already cited enough to show how much merit there is in these 
characterizations.Furthermore, as already indicated, the media reports gener¬ 
ally conformed to those of the U.S. military, although they were often less 
extreme in suggesting enemy success, as we have seen.Braestrup is not un¬ 
aware of this.He writes, for example, that “MACV spokesmen in Saigon 
themselves contributed in February to a general journalistic perception that 
no logistics, organizational, or manpower limitations inhibited the NVA’s ca¬ 
pacity, even after the ‘first wave,’ to strike anywhere at will (‘No place was safe 
any more’)” (I, 190).Furthermore, “most eyewitness combat reporting, rare 
and restricted as it was, showed up better in February than the MACV com¬ 
muniques or the communique rewrites in Saigon” ( 1 ,334).
