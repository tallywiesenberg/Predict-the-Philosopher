Only one group did not merit this appellation: corpora¬ 
tions, and their owners and managers.They are not “special interests,” they 
represent the “national interest.” This terminology represents the reality of 
domination and the operational usage of “national interest” for the two major 
political parties.For a similar view, with evidence of the relevance of this usage 
to both major political parties, see Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers, Right 
Turn: The Decline of the Democrats and the Future of American Politics (New 
York: Hill and Wang, 1986), pp.37-39 and passim.2.
