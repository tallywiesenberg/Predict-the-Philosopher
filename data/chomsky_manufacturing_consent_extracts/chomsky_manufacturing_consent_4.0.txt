protests and in disseminating information on the events themselves that 
countered the mainstream media’s hostile portrayal of these protests . 15 

However, although the Internet has been a valuable addition to the 
communications arsenal of dissidents and protesters, it has limitations as 
a critical tool. For one thing* those whose information needs are most 
acme are not well served by the Internet—many lack access, its databases 
are not designed to meet their needs* and the use of databases (and effec¬ 
tive use of the Internet in general) presupposes knowledge and organiza¬ 
tion. The Internet is not an instrument of mass communication for those 
lacking brand names, an already existing large audience* and/or large re¬ 
sources. Only sizable commercial organizations have been able to make 
large numbers aware of the existence of their Internet offerings. The 
privatization of the Internet’s hardware* the rapid commercialization 
and concentration of Internet portals and servers and their integration 
into non-Internet conglomerates—the AOL-Time Warner merger was a 
giant step in that direction—and the private and concentrated control 
of the new broadband technology* together threaten to limit any future 
prospects of the Internet as a democratic media vehicle. 

The past few years have witnessed a rapid penetration of the Internet 
by the leading newspapers and media conglomerates, all fearful of being 
outflanked by small pioneer users of the new technology* and willing 
(and able) to accept losses for years while testing out these new waters. 
Anxious to reduce these losses* however* and with advertisers leery of the 
value of spending in a medium characterized by excessive audience con¬ 
trol and rapid surfing* the large media entrants into the Internet have 
gravitated to making familiar compromises—more attention to selling 
goods* cutting back on news, and providing features immediately attrac¬ 
tive to audiences and advertisers. The Boston Globe (a subsidiary of the 
New York Times ) and the Washington Post are offering e-commerce goods 
and services; and Ledbetter notes that "it’s troubling that none of the 
newspaper portals feels that quality journalism is at the center of its strat¬ 
egy . , , because journalism doesn’t help you sell things .” 16 Former New 
York Times editor Max Frankel says that the more newspapers pursue 
Internet audiences, “the more will sex* sports* violence* and comedy 
appear on their menus, slighting* if not altogether ignoring* the news of 
foreign wars or welfare reform .” 17 

New technologies are mainly introduced to meet corporate needs* and
