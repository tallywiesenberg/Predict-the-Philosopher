31.Former US.Ambassador to the United Nations Patrick Moynihan brags 
in his autobiography of how back in 1975 he protected Indonesia from any 
effective international action that might have interfered writh its aggression: 
“The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly inef¬ 
fective in whatever measures it took [regarding the Indonesian invasion of 
East Timor].This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no in¬ 
considerable success.” He added, without the slightest expression of regret, 
that within a few weeks 60,000 people had been killed in this aggression that 
he was protecting.A Dangerous Place (New York: Little, Brown, 1978), p. 19.
