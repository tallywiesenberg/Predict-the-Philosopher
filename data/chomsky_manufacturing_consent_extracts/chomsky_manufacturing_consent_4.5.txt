‘"interaction” facilitated by advancing interactive capabilities mainly help 
audience members to shop* but they also allow media firms to collect 
detailed information on their audiences* and thus to fine-tune program 
features and ads to individual characteristics as well as to sell by a click 
during programs* Along with reducing privacy* this should intensify com¬ 
mercialization. 

In short* the changes in politics and communication over the past 
dozen years have tended on balance to enhance the applicability of the 
propaganda model. The increase in corporate power and global reach* 
the mergers and further centralization of the media* and the decline of 
public broadcasting* have made bottom-line considerations more influ¬ 
ential both in the United States and abroad. The competition for adver¬ 
tising has become more intense and the boundaries between editorial 
and advertising departments have weakened further. Newsrooms have 
been more thoroughly incorporated into transnational corporate em¬ 
pires* with budget cuts and a further diminution of management enthusi¬ 
asm for investigative journalism that would challenge the structures of 
power. 

Over the past dozen years* sourcing and flak have also strengthened as 
mechanisms of elite influence* Media centralization and the reduction in 
the resources devoted to journalism have made the media more depend¬ 
ent than ever on the primary definers who both make the news and subsi¬ 
dize the media by providing accessible and cheap copy. They now have 
greater leverage over the media* and the public relations firms working 
for these and other powerful interests also bulk larger as media sources* 
Alex Carey, Stuart Ewen* John Stauber, and Sheldon Rampton have 
helped us see how the public relations industry has been able to utilize 
journalistic conventions to serve its—and its corporate clients 1 —ends* 18 
Studies of news sources reveal that a significant proportion of news origi¬ 
nates in public relations releases. There are* by one count, 20*000 more 
public relations agents working to doctor the news today than there are 
j ourn al ists wr i ting it. 19 

The force of anti-communist ideology has possibly weakened with the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the virtual disappearance of socialist 
movements across the globe* but this is easily offset by the greater ideo¬ 
logical force of the belief in the '"miracle of the market” (Reagan)* The 
triumph of capitalism and the increasing power of those with an interest 
in privatization and market rule have strengthened the grip of market
