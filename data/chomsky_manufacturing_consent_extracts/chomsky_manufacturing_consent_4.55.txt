More 
recently, three Finnish forensic experts, who were members of a panel that 
examined the forty bodies found at Racak, disclosed that their team found 
no support for the alleged mutilations by the Serbs, and the data presented 
in the article casts further doubt on the claim that all the victims were exe¬ 
cuted.(J. Raino et al., “Independent Forensic Autopsies in Armed Conflict 
Investigation of Victims from Racak, Kosovo,” Forensic Science International^ 
vol.16 (2001), pp.171-85.)It is a notable fact that the OSCE has not yet seen 
fit to release the original forensic report from which this article's data is 
drawn.
