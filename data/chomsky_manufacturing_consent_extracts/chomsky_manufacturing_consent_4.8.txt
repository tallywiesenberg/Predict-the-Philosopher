On the overall atrocious mainstream media reporting on the Russian eco¬ 
nomic and social collapse, as well as on the elections, see Stephen Cohen, 
Failed Crusade , chapter 1.53- The Soviet Union did undoubtedly mistreat its own and client-state 
peoples, although the treatment of Russians by the Western-backed “reform¬ 
ers” since 1991 has hardly been an improvement.However the charge of 
sponsorship of international terrorism was inflated and hypocritical given the 
West’s support of its own very impressive terror networks.See Edward Her¬ 
man, The Real Terror Network (Boston: South End Press, 1982); Noam 
Chomsky; Pirates and Emperors: International Terrorism in the Real World (New 
York: Claremont Research, 1986).54.
