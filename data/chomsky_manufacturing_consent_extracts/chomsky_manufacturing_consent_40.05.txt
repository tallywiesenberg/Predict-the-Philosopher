They ignore the 
fact that the mass media are large business corporations controlled by very 
wealthy individuals or other corporations, and that the members of what the 
neoconservatives describe as the “liberal culture” of the media are hired 
employees.They also disregard the fact that the members of this liberal culture 
generally accept the basic premises of the system and differ with other mem¬ 
bers of the establishment largely on the tactics appropriate to achieving com¬ 
mon ends.The neoconservatives are simply not prepared to allow deviations 
from their own views.In our analysis in chapter 1, we describe them as playing 
the important role of “enforcers,” attempting to browbeat the media into 
excluding from a hearing even the limited dissent now tolerated.For an 
analysis of the neoconservative view of the media, see Edward S. Herman and 
Frank Brodhead, “Ledeen on the Media,” in The Rise and Fall of the Bulgarian 
Connection (New York: Sheridan Square Publications, 1986), pp.
