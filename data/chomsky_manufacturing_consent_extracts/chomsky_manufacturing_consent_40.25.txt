to whom they can 
turn to satisfy doctrinal needs.See Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Terrorism 
(Boston: South End Press, 1988), for examples.On the process of creating 
experts to meet system demands, see our chapter 1 under “Sourcing Mass- 
Media News.” 

7.Like other terms of political discourse, the word “democracy” has a techni¬ 
cal Orwellian sense when used in rhetorical flights, or in regular “news report¬ 
ing,” to refer to U.S. efforts to establish “democracy.” The term refers to 
systems in which control over resources and the means of violence ensures the 
rule of elements that will serve the needs of U.S. power.Thus the terror states 
of El Salvador and Guatemala are “democratic,” as is Honduras under the rule 
of the military and oligarchy, and the collection of wealthy businessmen, 
bankers, etc., organized by the United States as a front for the Somocista-led 
mercenary army created by the United States is entitled “the democratic 
resistance.” See further, chapter 3.
