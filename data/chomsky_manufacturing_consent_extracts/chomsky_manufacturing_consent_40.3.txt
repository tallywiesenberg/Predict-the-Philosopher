8.In the eighty-five opinion columns on Nicaragua that appeared in the New 
York Times and the Washington Post in the first three months of 1986, during 
the “national debate” preceding the congressional votes on contra aid, not a 
single one mentioned this elementary fact.For a detailed review, see Noam 
Chomsky, “Introduction,” in Morris Morley and James Petras, The Reagan 
Administration and Nicaragua, Monograph 1 (New York: Institute for Media 
Analysis, 1987).9.Only two phrases in the eighty-five opinion columns cited in the previous 
footnote mentioned that the Nicaraguan government had carried out reforms; 
none of them compared Nicaragua with El Salvador and Guatemala on this 
important question.
