In early October 1986, memos were leaked to the press indicating that the 
Reagan administration had carried out a deliberate campaign of disinformation 
to influence events in Libya.The mass media, which had passed along this 
material without question, expressed a great deal of righteous indignation that 
they had been misled.To compound the absurdity, five years earlier the press 
had reported a CIA-run “disinformation program designed to embarrass Qad- 
dafi and his government,” along with terrorist operations to overthrow Quad- 
dafi and perhaps assassinate him {Newsweek, Aug. 3,1981; P. Edward Haley, 
Qaddafi and the United States since 1969 [New York: Praeger, 1984], p. 272).But no lessons were learned.In fact, the mass media are gulled on an almost 
daily basis, but rarely have to suffer the indignity of government documents 
revealing their gullibility.
