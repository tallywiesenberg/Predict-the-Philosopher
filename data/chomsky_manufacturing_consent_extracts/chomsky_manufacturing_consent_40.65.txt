With regard to Libya, the media have fallen into line 
for each propaganda ploy, from the 1981 “hit squads” through the Berlin 
discotheque bombing, swallowing each implausible claim, failing to admit 
error in retrospect, and apparently unable to learn from successive entrap¬ 
ment—which suggests willing error.See Noam Chomsky, Pirates & Emperors 
(New York: Claremont, 1986), chapter 3.As we show throughout the present 
book, a series of lies by the government, successively exposed, never seems to 
arouse skepticism in the media regarding the next government claim.3.For a description of the government’s strategy of deflecting attention away 
from the Nicaraguan election by the fabricated MIG story, and the media’s 
service in this government program, see chapter 3, under “The MIG Crisis 
Staged during the Nicaraguan Election Week.”
