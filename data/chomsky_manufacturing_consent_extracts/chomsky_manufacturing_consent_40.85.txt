Note that we are speaking of media with substantial outreach—mass 
media.It has always been possible to start small-circulation journals and to 
produce mimeographed or photocopied news letters sent around to a tiny 
audience.But even small journals in the United States today typically survive 
only by virtue of contributions from wealthy financial angels.11.In 1987, the Times-Mirror Company, for example, owned newspapers in 
Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, and Hartford, Connecticut, had book pub¬ 
lishing and magazine subsidiaries, and owned cable systems and seven televi¬ 
sion stations.
