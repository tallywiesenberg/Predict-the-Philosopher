AP is owned by 
member newspapers; UPI is privately owned; Reuters was owned mainly by 
the British media until it went public in 1984, but control was retained by the 
original owners by giving lesser voting rights to the new stockholders; Agence- 
France-Presse is heavily subsidized by the French government.As is pointed 
out by Jonathan Fenby, the wire services “exist to serve markets,” and their 
prime concern, accordingly, “is with the rich media markets of the United 
States, Western Europe, and Japan, and increasingly with the business com¬ 
munity....” They compete fiercely, but AP and UPI “are really U.S. enter¬ 
prises that operate on an international scale....Without their domestic base, 
the AP and UPI could not operate as international agencies.With it, they must 
be American organizations, subject to American pressures and requirements”
