A split among the the heirs of James E. Scripps eventually resulted in the 
sale of the Detroit Evening News .According to one news article, “Daniel 
Marentette, a Scripps family member and a self described ‘angry shareholder/ 
says family members want a better return on their money.‘We get better yields 
investing in a New York checking account/ says Mr. Marentette, who sells 
race horses” (Damon Darlin, “Takeover Rumors Hit Detroit News Parent,” 
Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1985).The Bingham family division on these 
matters led to the sale of the Louisville Courier-Journal', the New Haven papers 
of the Jackson family were sold after years of squabbling, and “the sale price 
[of the New Haven papers], $185 million, has only served to publicize the 
potential value of family holdings of family newspapers elsewhere” (Geraldine 
Fabrikant, “Newspaper Properties, Hotter Than Ever,” New York Times, Aug. 
17, 1986).20.
