The Reagan administration strengthened the control of existing holders of 
television-station licenses by increasing their term from three to five years, and 
its FCC made renewals essentially automatic.The FCC also greatly facilitated 
speculation and trading in television properties by a rule change reducing the 
required holding period before sale of a newly acquired property from three 
years to one year.The Reagan era FCC and Department of Justice also refused to challenge 
mergers and takeover bids that would significantly increase the concentration 
of power (GE-RCA) or media concentration (Capital Cities-ABC).Further¬ 
more, beginning April 2, 1985, media owners could own as many as twelve 
television stations, as long as their total audience didn’t exceed 25 percent of 
the nation’s television households; and they could also hold twelve AM and 
twelve FM stations, as the 1953 “7-7-7 rule” was replaced with a “12-12-12 
rule.” See Herbert H. Howard, “Group and Cross-Media Ownership of Tele¬ 
vision Stations: 1985” (Washington: National Association of Broadcasters,
