CBS increased its debt by about $1 billion in 1985 to finance the purchase 
of 21 percent of its own stock, in order to fend off a takeover attempt by Ted 
Turner.The Wall Street Journal noted that “With debt now standing at 60% 
of capital, it needs to keep advertising revenue up to repay borrowings and 
interest” (Peter Barnes, “CBS Profit Hinges on Better TV Ratings,” June 6, 
1986).With the slowed-up growth of advertising revenues, CBS embarked on 
an employment cutback of as many as six hundred broadcast division em¬ 
ployees, the most extensive for CBS since the loss of cigarette advertising in 
1971 (Peter Barnes, “CBS Will Cut up to 600 Posts in Broadcasting,” Wall 
Street Journal, July 1,1986).In June 1986, Time, Inc., embarked on a program 
to buy back as much as 10 million shares, or 16 percent of its common stock, 
at an expected cost of some $900 million, again to reduce the threat of a hostile 
takeover (Laura Landro, “Time Will Buy as Much as 16% of Its Common,” 
Wall Street Journal, June 20, 1986).23.
