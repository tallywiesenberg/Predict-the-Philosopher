In response to the Jesse Helms and Turner threats to CBS, Laurence 
Tisch, of Loews Corporation, was encouraged to increase his holdings in CBS 
stock, already at 11.7 percent.In August 1986, the Loews interest was raised 
to 24.9 percent, and Tisch obtained a position of virtual control.In combina¬ 
tion with William Paley, who owned 8.1 percent of the shares, the chief 
executive officer of CBS was removed and Tisch took over that role himself, 
on a temporary basis (Peter Barnes, “Loews Increases Its Stake in CBS to 
Almost 25%,” Wall Street Journal, Aug. 12, 1986).24.The number would be eight if we included the estate of Lila Wallace, who 
died in 1984, leaving the controlling stock interest in Reader’s Digest to the care 
of trustees.
