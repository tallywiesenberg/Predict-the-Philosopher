25.As we noted in the preface, the neoconservatives speak regularly of “lib¬ 
eral” domination of the media, assuming or pretending that the underlings call 
the shots, not the people who own or control the media.These data, showing 
the wealth position of media owners, are understandably something they prefer 
to ignore.Sometimes, however, the neoconservatives go “populist,” and— 
while financed by Mobil Oil Corporation and Richard Mellon Scaife—pretend 
to be speaking for the “masses” in opposition to a monied elite dominating the 
media.For further discussion, see Edward S. Herman’s review of The Spirit 
of Democratic Capitalism, “Michael Novak’s Promised Land: Unfettered Cor¬ 
porate Capitalism,” Monthly Review (October 1983), and the works cited in the 
preface, note 3.
