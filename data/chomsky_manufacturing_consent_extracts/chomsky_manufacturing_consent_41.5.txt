weapons production and nuclear power. It may be recalled that from 
1965 to 1967, an attempt by International Telephone and Telegraph 
(ITT) to acquire ABC was frustrated following a huge outcry that 
focused on the dangers of allowing a great multinational corporation 
with extensive foreign investments and business activities to control a 
major media outlet, 31 The fear was that ITT control “could compro¬ 
mise the independence of ABC’s news coverage of political events in 
countries where ITT has interests/ 532 The soundness of the decision 
disallowing the acquisition seemed to have been vindicated by the later 
revelations of ITT’s political bribery and involvement in attempts to 
overthrow the government of Chile, RCA and Westinghouse, however, 
had been permitted to control media companies long before the ITT 
case, although some of the objections applicable to ITT would seem to 
apply to them as well, GE is a more powerful company than ITT, with 
an extensive international reach, deeply involved in the nuclear power 
business, and far more important than ITT in the arms industry. It is 
a highly centralized and quite secretive organization, but one with a

of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank that sup¬

The non-media interests of most of the media giants are not large* 
and, excluding the GE and Westinghouse systems* they account for 
only a small fraction of their total revenue. Their multinational out¬ 
reach, however* is more significant. The television networks, television 
syndicators, major news magazines, and motion-picture studios all do 
extensive business abroad* and they derive a substantial fraction of their 
revenues from foreign sales and the operation of foreign affiliates.
