The long-term trend in advertising time/programming 
time is dramatically revealed by the fact that in 1929 the National Association 
of Broadcasting adopted as a standard of commercial practice on radio the 
following: “Commercial announcements ... shall not be broadcast between 7 
and 11 p.m.” William Paley testified before the Senate Commerce Committee 
in 1930 that only 22 percent of CBS’s time was allocated to commercially 
sponsored programs, with the other 78 percent sustaining; and he noted that 
advertising took up only “seven-tenths of 1 percent of all our time” (quoted 
in Public Service Responsibility of Broadcast Licensees, FCC [Washington: GPO, 
Mar.7,1946], p. 42).Frank Wolf states in reference to public-affairs program¬ 
ming: “That such programs were even shown at all on commercial television 
may have been the result of FCC regulation” {Television Programming for News 
and Public Affairs [New York: Praeger, 1972], p. 138; see also pp.99-139).59.
