(and revenue) share* The crunch is often fatal* and it helps explain the 
death of many large-circulation papers and magazines and the attrition 
in the number of newspapers* 45 

From the time of the introduction of press advertising* therefore, 
working-class and radical papers have been at a serious disadvantage. 
Their readers have tended to be of modest means, a factor that has 
always affected advertiser interest. One advertising executive stated in 
1856 that some journals are poor vehicles because “their readers are not 
purchasers* and any money thrown upon them is so much thrown 
away*” 46 The same force took a heavy toll of the post-World War II 
social-democratic press in Great Britain, with the Daily Herald, News 
Chronicle , and Sunday Citizen failing or absorbed into establishment 
systems between i960 and 1967* despite a collective average daily read¬ 
ership of 9.3 million* As James Curran points out* with 4*7 million 
readers in its last year, “the Daily Herald actually had almost double 
the readership of The Times, the Financial Times and the Guardian 
combined*” What is more, surveys showed that its readers “thought 
more highly of their paper than the regular readers of any other popular 
newspaper,” and “they also read more in their paper than the readers 
of other popular papers despite being overwhelmingly working 
class. *. *” 47 The death of the Herald, as well as of the News Chronicle 
and Sunday Citizen, was in large measure a result of progressive stran¬ 
gulation by lack of advertising support* The Herald, with 8*1 percent 
of national daily circulation, got 3*5 percent of net advertising revenue; 
the Sunday Citizen got one-tenth of the net advertising revenue of the 
Sunday Times and one-seventh that of the Observer (on a per-thou- 
sand-copies basis). Curran argues persuasively that the loss of these 
three papers was an important contribution to the declining fortunes 
of the Labor party* in the case of the Herald specifically removing a 
mass-circularion institution that provided “an alternative framework of 
analysis and understanding that contested the dominant systems of 
representation in both broadcasting and the mainstream press*” 48 A
