82.On January 16, 1986, the American Friends Service Committee issued a 
news release, based on extended Freedom of Information Act inquiries, which

The mass media did not cover this hot story directly but through the filter of 
the navy’s reply, which downplayed the significance of the new findings and 
eliminated or relegated to the background the AFSC’s full range of facts and 
interpretation of the meaning of what they had uncovered.A typical heading: 
“Navy Lists Nuclear Mishaps: None of 630 Imperilled Public, Service Says,” 
Washington Post, January 16,1986.83.
