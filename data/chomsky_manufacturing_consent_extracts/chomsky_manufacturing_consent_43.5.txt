while it “continuously seeks to maximize audience delivery,” it has 
developed a new “sales tool” with which it approaches advertisers: 
“Client Audience Profile, or CAP, will help advertisers optimize the 
effectiveness of their network television schedules by evaluating audi¬ 
ence segments in proportion to usage levels of advertisers 5 products and 
services.” 49 In short, the mass media are interested in attracting audi¬ 
ences with buying power, not audiences per se; it is affluent audiences 
that spark advertiser interest today, as in the nineteenth century. The 
idea that the drive for large audiences makes the mass media “demo¬ 
cratic” thus suffers from the initial weakness that its political analogue 
is a voting system weighted by income! 

The power of advertisers over television programming stems from 
the simple fact that they buy and pay for the programs—they are the 
“patrons” who provide the media subsidy. As such, the media compete 
for their patronage, developing specialized staff to solicit advertisers 
and necessarily having to explain how their programs serve advertisers 5 
needs. The choices of these patrons greatly affect the welfare of the 
media, and the patrons become what William Evan calls “normative 
reference organizations,” 50 whose requirements and demands the 
media must accommodate if they are to succeed. 51 

For a television network, an audience gain or loss of one percentage 
point in the Nielsen ratings translates into a change in advertising 
revenue of from $80 to $100 million a year, with some variation depend¬ 
ing on measures of audience “quality, 55 The stakes in audience size and 
affluence are thus extremely large, and in a market system there is a 
strong tendency for such considerations to affect policy profoundly. 
This is partly a matter of institutional pressures to focus on the bottom 
line, partly a matter of the continuous interaction of the media or¬ 
ganization with patrons who supply the revenue dollars. As Grant 
Tinker, then head of NBC-TV, observed, television “is an advertising- 
supported medium, and to the extent that support falls out, program¬ 
ming will change.” 52 

Working-class and radical media also suffer from the political dis¬ 
crimination of advertisers. Political discrimination is structured into 
advertising allocations by the stress on people with money to buy. But 
many firms will always refuse to patronize ideological enemies and 
those whom they perceive as damaging their interests, and cases of

overt discrimination add to the force of the voting system weighted by 
income. Public-television station WNET lost its corporate funding 
from Gulf + Western in 1985 after the station showed the documentary 
“Hungry for Profit/* which contains material critical of multinational 
corporate activities in the Third World, Even before the program was
