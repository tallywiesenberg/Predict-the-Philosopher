97.Then and now, former dissidents are portrayed as especially valuable 
experts for the seeming authenticity they can bring to the mistakes of their 


former associates.The fact that their claims are often fraudulent is not a 
problem because the mass media refuse to point this out.Thus Jean Lacouture 
lent credence to his criticisms of the Khmer Rouge by claiming to have been 
a former sympathizer—not only a falsehood, as he was pro-Sihanouk, but an 
absurdity, as nothing had been known about the Khmer Rouge.David Horo¬ 
witz added to his value as a born-again patriot by claiming that along with 
protesters against the Vietnam War generally, he came “to acquire a new 
appreciation for foreign tyrants like Kim II Sung of North Korea” (Peter 
Collier and David Horowitz, “Confessions of Two New-Left Radicals: Why 
We Voted for Reagan,” Washington Post National Weekly Edition, April 8, 
1985).
