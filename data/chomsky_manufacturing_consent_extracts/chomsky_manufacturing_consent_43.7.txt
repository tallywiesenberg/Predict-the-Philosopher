Robert Leiken became more potent as a critic of the Sandinistas as an 
alleged former peace-movement activist and early supporter of the Sandinis¬ 
tas.Each of these claims was a fabrication, but this fact went unmentioned in 
the mass media.On Leiken’s claims, and the “special force” his anti-Sandinista 
writings gained by his alleged conversion from “fan of the Sandinistas,” see 
Michael Massing, “Contra Aides,” Mother Jones (October 1987).While dis¬ 
missing this pretense, Massing credits Leiken’s claim that he “was active in the 
antiwar movement,” but that is highly misleading.Activists in the Boston area, 
where he claims to have been an antiwar organizer, recall no participation by 
Leiken until about 1970—at which time McGeorge Bundy could also have 
been described as an activist leader.
