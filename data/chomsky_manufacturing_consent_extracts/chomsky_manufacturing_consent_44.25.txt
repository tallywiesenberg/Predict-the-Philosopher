“The Stalinists of Anti-Communism,” in Ralph Miliband, John Saville, 
and Marcel Liebman, Socialist Register, 1984: The Uses of Anticommunism (Lon¬ 
don: Merlin Press, 1984), p. 337.115.Daix, in 1949, referred to the Stalin concentration camps as “one of the 
Soviet Union’s most glorious achievements,” displaying “the complete sup¬ 
pression of man’s exploitation of man” (quoted in Miliband et al., Socialist 
Register, p. 337).Kriegel, formerly a hard-line Communist party functionary, 
was the author of a 1982 book explaining that the KGB organized the Sabra- 
Shatila massacres, employing German terrorists associated with the PLO and 
with the tacit cooperation of the CIA, in order to defame Israel as part of the 
Soviet program of international terrorism.For more on this profound study, 
and its influence, see Noam Chomsky, Fateful Triangle (Boston: South End 
Press, 1983), pp.
