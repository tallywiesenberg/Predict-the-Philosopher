We believe that the same dichotomization applies in the domestic sphere.For example, both British and American analysts have noted the periodic 
intense focus on—and indignation over—“welfare chiselers” by the mass 
media, and the parallel de-emphasis of and benign attitudes toward the far 
more important fraud and tax abuses of business and the affluent.There is also 
a deep-seated reluctance on the part of the mass media to examine the struc¬ 
tural causes of inequality and poverty.Peter Golding and Sue Middleton, after 
an extensive discussion of the long-standing “criminalization of poverty” and 
incessant attacks on welfare scroungers in Britain, point out that tax evasion, 
by contrast, is “acceptable, even laudable,” in the press, that the tax evader 
“is not merely a victim but a hero.” They note, also, that “The supreme 
achievement of welfare capitalism” has been to render the causes and condi¬ 
tion of poverty almost invisible (Images of Welfare: Press and Public Attitudes 
to Poverty [Oxford: Martin Robertson, 1982], pp.66-67, 98-100, 186, 193).
