In a chapter entitled “The Deserving Rich,” A. J. Liebling pointed out that 
in the United States as well, “The crusade against the destitute is the favorite 
crusade of the newspaper publisher,” and that “There is no concept more 
generally cherished by publishers than that of the Undeserving Poor” (The 
Press [New York: Ballantine, 1964], pp.78-79).Liebling went into great detail 
on various efforts of the media to keep welfare expenses and taxes down “by 
saying that they [the poor] have concealed assets, or bad character, or both” 
(p. 79).These strategies not only divert, they also help split the employed 
working class from the unemployed and marginalized, and make these all 
exceedingly uncomfortable about participating in a degraded system of 
scrounging.See Peter Golding and Sue Middleton, “Attitudes to Claimants: 
A Culture of Contempt,” in Images of Welfare, pp.
