On issues where the elite is seriously divided, there will be dissenting 
voices allowed in the mass media, and the inflation of claims and suspension of 
critical judgment will be subject to some constraint.See the discussion of this

given the close ties of the Readerâ€™s Digest to the CIA and the fact that Paul 
Henze, one of the primary sources and movers in the Bulgarian Connection 
campaign, was a longtime CIA official.
