In a speech of July 19,1986, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, in answer¬ 
ing charges of religious persecution, asserted that of 138 religious persons 
murdered and 278 kidnapped or disappeared in Central America since 1979 (a 
figure that includes Lay Delegates of the Word), none had been victimized by 
the Nicaraguan government.( Central America News Update , Aug. 4, 1986).Many had been killed by the contras, however, in an ongoing tradition of 
Somocista violence.See Andrew Reding, “The Church in Nicaragua,” 
Monthly Review (July-August 1987), pp.34-36.
