newsworthy. These bureaucracies turn out a large volume of material 
that meets the demands of news organizations for reliable* scheduled 
flows. Mart Fishman calls rhis “the principle of bureaucratic affinity; 
only other bureaucracies can satisfy the input needs of a news bureauc¬ 
racy,” 62 

Government and corporate sources also have the great merit of being 
recognizable and credible by their status and prestige. This is important 
to the mass media. As Fishman notes, 

Newsworkers are predisposed to treat bureaucratic accounts as 
factual because news personnel participate in upholding a norma¬ 
tive order of authorized knowers in the society. Reporters operate 
with the attitude that officials ought to know what it is their job 
to know,,,. In particular, a newsworker will recognize an officials 
claim to knowledge not merely as a claim* but as a credible, 
competent piece of knowledge. This amounts to a moral division 
of labor; officials have and give the facts; reporters merely get 
them, 63 

Another reason for the heavy weight given to official sources is that the 
mass media claim to be “objective” dispensers of the news. Partly to 
maintain the image of objectivity, but also to protect themselves from 
criticisms of bias and the threat of libel suits* they need material that 
can be portrayed as presumptively accurate. 64 This is also partly a 
matter of cost; taking information from sources that may be presumed 
credible reduces investigative expense, whereas material from sources 
that are not prima facie credible, or that will elicit criticism and threats, 
requires careful checking and costly research. 

The magnitude of the public-information operations of large govern¬ 
ment and corporate bureaucracies that constitute the primary news 
sources is vast and ensures special access to the media. The Pentagon, 
for example, has a public-information service that involves many thou¬ 
sands of employees, spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year 
and dwarfing not only the public-information resources of any dissent¬ 
ing individual or group but the aggregate of such groups. In 1979 and 
1980* during a brief interlude of relative openness (since closed down).
