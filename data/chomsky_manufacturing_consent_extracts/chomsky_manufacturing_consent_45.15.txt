at least four other Times articles that repeated such information, and similar

the martyred priest’s body reported that he had been savagely beaten.A rope 
had been tied around his neck, wrists and ankles so that he would strangle 
himself if he struggled to get free.Three fingers of Popieluszko’s left hand 
were sliced through to the bone, and there were deep gouges on his arms.
