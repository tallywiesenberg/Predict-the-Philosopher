On May 29 she was again abducted and tortured, and shortly 
thereafter twelve members of her group were detained by the police.The 
British New Statesman expressed surprise that this kind of terror could take 
place, given the fact that Laura Pinto had previously traveled to Europe and 
made Western Europeans aware of her existence (Jane Dibblin, “El Salvador’s 
Death Squads Defy European Opinion,” June 13, 1986).Western Europeans 
did, in fact, protest these abuses.What made this terror feasible, however, was 
the fact that the power directly involved in El Salvador, the United States, has 
media well attuned to state policy.The two assaults on Laura Pinto and the 
detention of the twelve members of the Mothers were totally suppressed by 
the New York Times and its confreres.
