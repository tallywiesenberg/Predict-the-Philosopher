This excludes vast areas of the air force’s public-information effort. 
Writing back in 1970, Senator J. W. Fulbright had found that the air 
force public-relations effort in 1968 involved 1,305 full-time employees, 
exclusive of additional thousands that “have public functions collateral 
to other duties.” 66 The air force at that time offered a weekly film-clip 
service for TV and a taped features program for use three times a week, 
sent to 1,139 radio stations; it also produced 148 motion pictures, of 
which 24 were released for public consumption. 67 There is no reason 
to believe that the air force public-relations effort has diminished since 
the 1960s. 68 

Note that this is just the air force. There are three other branches with 
massive programs, and there is a separate, overall public-information 
program under an assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the 
Pentagon. In 1971, an Armed Forces Journal survey revealed that the 
Pentagon was publishing a total of 371 magazines at an annual cost of 
some $57 million, an operation sixteen times larger than the nation’s 
biggest publisher. In an update in 1982, the Air Force Journal Interna¬ 
tional indicated that the Pentagon was publishing 1,203 periodicals. 69 
To put this into perspective, we may note the scope of public-informa¬ 
tion operations of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) 
and the National Council of the Churches of Christ (NCC), two of the 
largest of the nonprofit organizations that offer a consistently challeng¬ 
ing voice to the views of the Pentagon. The AFSC’s main office infor¬ 
mation-services budget in 1984-85 was under $500,000, with eleven 
staff people. 70 Its institution-wide press releases run at about two hun¬ 
dred per year, its press conferences thirty a year, and it produces about 
one him and two or three slide shows a year. It does not offer film dips.
