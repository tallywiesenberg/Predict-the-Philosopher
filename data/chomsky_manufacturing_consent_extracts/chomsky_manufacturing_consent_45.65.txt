Riding had an article on March 23,1980, entitled 
“El Salvador’s Junta Unable to Halt the Killing.” On media coverage of El 
Salvador during 1980, including gross falsification and cover-up of even con¬ 
gressional reports, see Noam Chomsky, Towards A New Cold War , pp.35ff., 
reprinted in James Peck, ed., The Chomsky Reader (New York: Pantheon, 
1987).19.Church estimates were that the government was responsible for some nine 
hundred civilian deaths in the first three months of 1980, exceeding the total 
for all of 1979; a report of Amnesty International dated March 21, 1980, 
contains seven pages of incidents in which security forces, army units, or 
paramilitary groups under general military control or guidance killed unarmed 
civilians, usually peasants (quoted in Bonner, Weakness and Deceit , p. 172).20.
