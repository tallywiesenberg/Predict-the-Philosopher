photos, or taped radio programs to the media* The NCC Office of 
Information has an annual budget of some $350,000, issues about a 
hundred news releases per year, and holds four press conferences annu¬ 
ally, 71 The ratio of air force news releases and press conferences to 
those of the AFSC and NCC taken together are 150 to 1 (or 2,200 to 
1 if we count hometown news releases of the air force), and 94 to 1 
respectively. Aggregating the other services would increase the differ¬ 
ential by a large factor. 

Only the corporate sector has the resources to produce public infor¬ 
mation and propaganda on the scale of the Pentagon and other govern¬ 
ment bodies. The AFSC and NCC cannot duplicate the Mobil Oil 
company’s multimillion-dollar purchase of newspaper space and other 
corporate investments to get its viewpoint across. 72 The number of 
individual corporations with budgets for public information and lobby¬ 
ing in excess of those of the AFSC and NCC runs into the hundreds, 
perhaps even the thousands. A corporate collective like the U.S, Cham¬ 
ber of Commerce had a 1983 budget for research, communications, and 
political activities of $65 million. 73 By 1980, the chamber was publishing 
a business magazine {Nation’s Business) with a circulation of 1.3 million 
and a weekly newspaper with 740,000 subscribers, and it was producing 
a weekly panel show distributed to 400 radio stations, as well as its own 
weekly panel-discussion programs carried by 128 commercial television 
stations* 74 

Besides the U.S* Chamber, there are thousands of state and local 
chambers of commerce and trade associations also engaged in public- 
relations and lobbying activities* The corporate and trade-association 
lobbying network community is “a network of well over 150,000 profes¬ 
sionals,” 75 and its resources are related to corporate income, profits, 
and the protective value of public-relations and lobbying outlays. Cor¬ 
porate profits before taxes in 1985 were $295*5 billion. When the corpo¬ 
rate community gets agitated about the political environment, as it did in 
the 1970s, it obviously has the wherewithal to meet the perceived threat. 
Corporate and trade-association image and issues advertising increased 
from $305 million in 1975 to $650 million in 1980. 76 So did direct-mail 
campaigns through dividend and other mail stuffers, the distribution of 
educational films, booklets and pamphlets, and outlays on initiatives 
and refe rend urns, lobbying, and political and think-tank contributions* 
Aggregate corporate and trade-association political advertising and 
grass-roots outlays were estimated to have reached the billion-dollar-a- 
year level by 1978, and to have grown to $1,6 billion by 1984. 77
