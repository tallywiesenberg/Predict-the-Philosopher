business-news promoters go to great pains to make things easy for news 
organizations. They provide the media organizations with facilities in 
which to gather; they give journalists advance copies of speeches and 
forthcoming reports; they schedule press conferences at hours well- 
geared to news deadlines; 78 they write press releases in usable language; 
and they carefully organize their press conferences and “photo oppor¬ 
tunity” sessions, 79 It is the job of news officers “to meet the journalist's 
scheduled needs with material that their beat agency has generated at 
its own pace, 1 * 80 

In effect* the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize the mass 
media, and gain special access by their contribution to reducing the 
media’s costs of acquiring the raw materials of, and producing, news. 
The large entities that provide this subsidy become “routine” news 
sources and have privileged access to the gates. Non-routine sources 
must struggle for access, and may be ignored by the arbitrary decision 
of the gatekeepers. It should also be noted that in the case of the 
largesse of the Pentagon and the State Department’s Office of Public 
Diplomacy, 81 the subsidy is at the taxpayers 5 expense, so that, in effect, 
the citizenry pays to be propagandized in the interest of power¬ 
ful groups such as military contractors and other sponsors of state 
terrorism. 

Because of their services, continuous contact on the beat, and mutual 
dependency, the powerful can use personal relationships, threats, and 
rewards to further influence and coerce the media- The media may feel 
obligated to carry extremely dubious stories and mute criticism in order 
not to offend their sources and disturb a close relationship, 83 It is very 
difficult to call authorities on whom one depends for daily news liars, 
even if they tell whoppers. Critical sources may be avoided not only 
because of their lesser availability and higher cost of establishing credi¬ 
bility, but also because the primary sources may be offended and may 
even threaten the media using them. 

Powerful sources may also use their prestige and importance to the 
media as a lever to deny critics access to the media: the Defense 
Department, for example, refused to participate in National Public 
Radio discussions of defense issues if experts from the Center for 
Defense Information were on the program; Elliott Abrams refused 
to appear on a program on human rights in Central America at 
the Kennedy School of Government, at Harvard University, unless 
the former ambassador, Robert White, was excluded as a partici¬ 
pant; 83 Claire Sterling refused to participate in television-network 
shows on the Bulgarian Connection where her critics would appear. 84 
In the last two of these cases, the authorities and brand-name ex-
