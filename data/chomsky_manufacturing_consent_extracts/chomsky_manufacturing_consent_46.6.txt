They were political activists on behalf of the Frente and somebody who is 
using violence to oppose the Frente killed these women” (interview in Tampa 
Tribune, Dec. 16,1980, quoted in Carrigan, Salvador Witness, p.279.)Former 
ambassador Robert White pointed out that remarks like these by Kirkpatrick, 
in the context of El Salvador, were “an incitement to murder” (T. D. Allman, 
Unmanifest Destiny [New York: Doubleday, 1984], p. 17).Jean Donovan asked Ambassador Robert White, “What do you do when 
even to help the poor, to take care of the orphans, is considered an act of 
subversion by the government?” (quoted in Allman, p. 3).Helping orphans in 
the Salvadoran countryside was also regarded as an act of subversion by 
officials of the Reagan administration.
