A PROPAGANDA MODEL 23 


pens were successful in monopolizing access by coercive threats* 
Perhaps more important* powerful sources regularly take advantage 
of media routines and dependency to “manage” the media* to manipu¬ 
late them into following a special agenda and framework (as we will 
show in detail in the chapters that follow}* 85 Pan of this management 
process consists of inundating the media with stories* which serve 
sometimes to foist a particular line and frame on the media (e.g.* 
Nicaragua as illicitly supplying arms to the Salvadoran rebels)* and at 
other times to help chase unwanted stories off the front page or out of 
the media altogether (the alleged delivery of MIGs to Nicaragua during 
the week of the 1984 Nicaraguan election)* This strategy can be traced 
back at least as far as the Committee on Public Information* established 
to coordinate propaganda during World War I* which “discovered in 
1917-18 that one of the best means of controlling news was flooding 
news channels with ‘facts/ or what amounted to official information.” 86 

The relation between power and sourcing extends beyond official 
and corporate provision of day-to-day news to shaping the supply of 
“experts*” The dominance of official sources is weakened by the exis¬ 
tence of highly respectable unofficial sources that give dissident views 
with great authority. This problem is alleviated by “co-opting the ex¬ 
perts” 07 —i*e** putting them on the payroll as consultants* funding their 
research* and organizing think tanks that will hire them directly and 
help disseminate their messages* In this way bias may be structured* and 
the supply of experts may be skewed in the direction desired by the 
government and “the market*” 88 As Henry Kissinger has pointed out* 
in this “age of the expert*” the “constituency” of the expert is “those 
who have a vested interest in commonly held opinions; elaborating and 
defining its consensus at a high level has* after all* made him an ex¬ 
pert*” 89 It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken 
place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are 
functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail* 

This process of creating the needed body of experts has been carried 
out on a deliberate basis and a massive scale* Back in 1972* Judge Lewis 
Powell (later elevated to the Supreme Court) wrote a memo to the U*S* 
Chamber of Commerce urging business “to buy the top academic repu¬ 
tations in the country to add credibility to corporate studies and give 
business a stronger voice on the campuses*” 90 One buys them* and 
assures that—in the words of Dr* Edwin Feulner, of the Heritage 
Foundation—the pub lie-policy area “is awash with in-depth academic 
studies” that have the proper conclusions* Using the analogy of Procter 
& Gamble selling toothpaste* Feulner explained that “They sell it and 
resell it every day by keeping the product fresh in the consumer's

mind.” By the sales effort* including the dissemination of the correct 
ideas to “thousands of newspapers*” it is possible to keep debate 
“within its proper perspective.” 91 

In accordance with this formula* during the 1970s and early 1980s a 
string of institutions was created and old ones were activated to the end 
of propagandizing the corporate viewpoint. Many hundreds of intellec¬ 
tuals were brought to these institutions* where their work was funded 
and their outputs were disseminated to the media by a sophisticated 
propaganda effort. 92 The corporate funding and dear ideological pur¬ 
pose in the overall effort had no discernible effect on the credibility of 
the intellectuals so mobilized; on the contrary* the funding and pushing 
of Their ideas catapaulted them into the press. 

As an illustration of how the funded experts preempt space in the 
media* table 1-4 describes the “experts” on terrorism and defense issues 
who appeared on the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour” in the course of a 
year in the mid-1980s. We can see that, excluding journalists* a majority 
of the participants (54 percent) were present or former government 
officials* and that the next highest category (15.7 percent) was drawn 
from conservative think tanks* The largest number of appearances in 
the latter category was supplied by the Georgetown Center for Strate¬ 
gic and International Studies (CSIS)* an organization funded by con¬ 
servative foundations and corporations* and providing a revolving door 
between the State Department and CIA and a nominally private organi¬ 
zation* 93 On such issues as terrorism and the Bulgarian Connection* the 
CSIS has occupied space in the media that otherwise might have been 
filled by independent voices. 94 

The mass media themselves also provide “experts” who regularly 
echo the official view* John Barron and Claire Sterling are household 
names as authorities on the KGB and terrorism because the Reader’s 
Digest has funded* published* and publicized their work; the Soviet 
defector Arkady Shevchenko became an expert on Soviet arms and 
intelligence because Time> ABC-TV* and the New York Times chose to 
feature him (despite his badly tarnished credentials). 95 By giving these 
purveyors of the preferred view a great deal of exposure* the media 
confer status and make them the obvious candidates for opinion and 
analysis. 

Another class of experts whose prominence is largely a function of 
serviceability to power is former radicals who have come to “see the 
light.” The motives that cause these individuals to switch gods* from 
Stalin (or Mao) to Reagan and free enterprise, is varied, but for the 
establishment media the reason for the change is simply that the ex-
