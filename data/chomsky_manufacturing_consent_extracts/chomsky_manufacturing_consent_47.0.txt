A PROPAGANDA MODEL 23 


pens were successful in monopolizing access by coercive threats* 
Perhaps more important* powerful sources regularly take advantage 
of media routines and dependency to “manage” the media* to manipu¬ 
late them into following a special agenda and framework (as we will 
show in detail in the chapters that follow}* 85 Pan of this management 
process consists of inundating the media with stories* which serve 
sometimes to foist a particular line and frame on the media (e.g.* 
Nicaragua as illicitly supplying arms to the Salvadoran rebels)* and at 
other times to help chase unwanted stories off the front page or out of 
the media altogether (the alleged delivery of MIGs to Nicaragua during 
the week of the 1984 Nicaraguan election)* This strategy can be traced 
back at least as far as the Committee on Public Information* established 
to coordinate propaganda during World War I* which “discovered in 
1917-18 that one of the best means of controlling news was flooding 
news channels with ‘facts/ or what amounted to official information.” 86 

The relation between power and sourcing extends beyond official 
and corporate provision of day-to-day news to shaping the supply of 
“experts*” The dominance of official sources is weakened by the exis¬ 
tence of highly respectable unofficial sources that give dissident views 
with great authority. This problem is alleviated by “co-opting the ex¬ 
perts” 07 —i*e** putting them on the payroll as consultants* funding their 
research* and organizing think tanks that will hire them directly and 
help disseminate their messages* In this way bias may be structured* and 
the supply of experts may be skewed in the direction desired by the 
government and “the market*” 88 As Henry Kissinger has pointed out* 
in this “age of the expert*” the “constituency” of the expert is “those 
who have a vested interest in commonly held opinions; elaborating and 
defining its consensus at a high level has* after all* made him an ex¬ 
pert*” 89 It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken 
place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are 
functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail* 

This process of creating the needed body of experts has been carried 
out on a deliberate basis and a massive scale* Back in 1972* Judge Lewis 
Powell (later elevated to the Supreme Court) wrote a memo to the U*S* 
Chamber of Commerce urging business “to buy the top academic repu¬ 
tations in the country to add credibility to corporate studies and give 
business a stronger voice on the campuses*” 90 One buys them* and 
assures that—in the words of Dr* Edwin Feulner, of the Heritage 
Foundation—the pub lie-policy area “is awash with in-depth academic 
studies” that have the proper conclusions* Using the analogy of Procter 
& Gamble selling toothpaste* Feulner explained that “They sell it and 
resell it every day by keeping the product fresh in the consumer's
