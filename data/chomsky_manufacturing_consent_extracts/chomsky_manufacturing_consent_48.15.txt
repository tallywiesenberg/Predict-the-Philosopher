hi.As we pointed out earlier, the U.S. press entirely ignored the administra¬ 
tion’s refusal to allow one of the El Salvador “Mothers of the Disappeared” 
to come to speak in the United States.See note 10, above.112.This press release was featured in an “Urgent Action” memo of the 
Guatemala Human Rights Commission/USA, dated October 3, 1986.
