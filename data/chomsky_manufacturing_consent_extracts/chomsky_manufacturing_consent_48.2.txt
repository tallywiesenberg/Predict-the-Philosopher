Chapter 3: Legitimizing versus 
Meaningless Third World Elections 

1.See Edward S. Herman and Frank Brodhead, Demonstration Elections: U.S.- 
Staged Elections in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and El Salvador (Boston: 
South End Press, 1984), passim.2.In the case of the Salvadoran elections of 1982 and 1984, the government 
relied on the media to play down not only this plan, but also the fact that the 
rebels were driven into rebellion by decades of refusal of the army to allow 
any democratic option, and that the rebels could not have participated in the 
election anyway because they would run heavy risks of being murderedâ€”the 
five leaders of the political opposition in El Salvador were tortured, murdered, 
and mutilated in San Salvador in November 1980.3.
