48.“In a meeting several months ago with the ultra-rightist organization 
Amigos del Pais, which allegedly has strong death squad connections, PDCG 
deputies to the Constituent Assembly pledged that if the party came to power, 
they would refrain from agrarian and banking reforms, investigation into 
human rights abuses by the armed forces, and any interference in the coun¬ 
terinsurgency program” (“Guatemala Votes,” Washington Report on the Hemi¬ 
sphere, Nov. 27, 1985).Stephen Kinzer also reports on a private meeting 
between Cerezo and right-wing landowners, in which “he said we all needed 
each other at this moment...” (“When a Landslide Is Not a Mandate,” New 
York Times, Dec. 15, 1985).49.Allen Nairn and Jean-Marie Simon, in their “The Bureaucracy of Death,” 
New Republic, (June 30,1986), describe the “tactical alliance” between Cerezo 
and the army, which protected them against any accountability for past ac¬ 
tions, in exchange for which the army would allow Cerezo to occupy office.
