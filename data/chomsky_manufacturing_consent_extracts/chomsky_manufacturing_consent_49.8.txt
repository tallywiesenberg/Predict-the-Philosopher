Rev.Daniel Long and seven other ecumenical group observers, “March 
25, 1984, Elections in El Salvador” (1984, mimeographed), p. 4.61.Based on conversations with voters, the Long group states that “most 
people waited these long hours because of their desire to have their cedula 
stamped and their finger inked to avoid fines for not voting and/or possible 
reprisals from the government and military....” They note that at many places 
voting officials stamped the cedulas of those unable to vote because of crowding 
just so they could leave (ibid., p. 6).62.
