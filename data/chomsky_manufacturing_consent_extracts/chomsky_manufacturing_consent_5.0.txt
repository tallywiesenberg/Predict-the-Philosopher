though exceptions are allowed when private firms need subsidies, bail¬ 
outs, and government help in doing business abroad. When the Soviet 
economy stagnated in the 1980 s, it was attributed to the absence of mar¬ 
kets; when capitalist Russia disintegrated in the 1990 s, this was blamed 
not on the now ruling market but on politicians' and workers' failure to 
let markets work their magic . 20 Journalism has internalized this ideology. 
Adding it to the residual power of anticommunism in a world in which 
the global power of market institutions makes nonmarket options seem 
utopian gives us an ideological package of immense strength. 

These changes, which have strengthened the applicability of the prop¬ 
aganda model, have seriously weakened the “public sphere,” which refers 
to the array of places and forums in which matters important to a demo¬ 
cratic community are debated and information relevant to intelligent cit¬ 
izen participation is provided. The steady advance, and cultural power, of 
marketing and advertising has caused “the displacement of a political 
public sphere by a depoliticized consumer culture And it has had 
the effect of creating a world of virtual communities built by advertisers 
and based on demographics and taste differences of consumers. These 
consumption- and style-based clusters are at odds with physical commu¬ 
nities that share a social life and common concerns and which participate 
in a democratic order , 22 These virtual communities are organized to buy 
and sell goods, not to create or service a public sphere. 

Advertisers don't like the public sphere, where audiences are relatively 
small, upsetting controversy takes place, and the settings are not ideal 
for selling goods. Their preference for entertainment underlies the grad¬ 
ual erosion of the public sphere under systems of commercial media, 
well exemplified in the history of broadcasting in the United States over 
the past seventy-five years , 23 But entertainment has the merit not only 
of being better suited to helping sell goods; it is an effective vehicle for 
hidden ideological messages , 24 Furthermore, in a system of high and 
growing inequality, entertainment is the contemporary equivalent of 
the Roman “games of the circus” that diverts the public from politics 
and generates a political apathy that is helpful to preservation of the sta¬ 
tus quo. 

It would be a mistake to conclude from the fact that the public buys - 
and watches the offerings of the increasingly commercialized media 
that the gradual erosion of the public sphere reflects the preferences and 
free choices of the public either as citizens or consumers. The citizenry

was never given the opportunity to approve or disapprove the wholesale 
transfer of broadcasting rights to commercial interests back in 1934, 25 
and the pledge made by those interests, and subsequently by the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) itself, that public service offerings
