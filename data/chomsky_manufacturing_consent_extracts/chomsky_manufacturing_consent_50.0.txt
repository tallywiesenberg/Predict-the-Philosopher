specific purpose of producing flak. Another and older flak-producing 
machine with a broader design is Freedom House. The American Legal 
Foundation, organized in 1980, has specialized in Fairness Doctrine 
complaints and libel suits to aid “media victims.” The Capital Legal 
Foundation, incorporated in 1977, was the Scaife vehicle for Westmore¬ 
land's $i20-million libel suit against CBS. 100 

The Media Institute* organized in 1972 and funded by corporate- 
wealthy patrons, sponsors monitoring projects, conferences, and stud¬ 
ies of the media. It has focused less heavily on media failings in foreign 
policy, concentrating more on media portrayals of economic issues and 
the business community, but its range of interests is broad. The main 
theme of its sponsored studies and conferences has been the failure of 
the media to portray business accurately and to give adequate weight 
to the business point of view, 101 but it underwrites works such as John 
Corry J s expose of the alleged left-wing bias of the mass media. 102 The 
chairman of the board of trustees of the institute in 1985 was Steven V. 
Seekins* the top public-relations officer of the American Medical Asso¬ 
ciation; chairman of the National Advisory Council was Herbert 
Schmertz, of the Mobil Oil Corporation. 

The Center for Media and Public Affairs, run by Linda and Robert 
Lichter, came into existence in the mid-1980s as a “non-profit* non- 
partisan” research institute, with warm accolades from Patrick Bu¬ 
chanan* Faith Whittlesey* and Ronald Reagan himself, who recognized 
the need for an objective and fair press. Their Media Monitor and 
research studies continue their earlier efforts to demonstrate the liberal 
bias and anti-business propensities of the mass media. 103 

AIM was formed in 1969, and it grew spectacularly in the 1970s. Its 
annual income rose from $5,000 in 1971 to $1.5 million in the early 1980s, 
with funding mainly from large corporations and the wealthy heirs and 
foundations of the corporate system. At least eight separate oil compa¬ 
nies were contributors to AIM in the early 1980s, but the wide represen¬ 
tation in sponsors from the corporate community is impressive. 104 The 
function of AIM is to harass the media and put pressure on them to 
follow the corporate agenda and a hard-line* right-wing foreign policy. 
It presses the media to join more enthusiastically in Red-scare band¬ 
wagons, and attacks them for alleged deficiencies whenever they fail to 
toe the line on foreign policy. It conditions the media to expect trou-

Freedom House, which dates back to the early 1940s, has had inter¬
