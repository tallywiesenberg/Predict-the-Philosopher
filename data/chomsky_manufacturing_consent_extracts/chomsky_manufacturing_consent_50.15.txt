the Salvadoran election of May 1984 is entitled “El Salvador: A Miracle of 
Moderation.” For a discussion of some of the ways in which the media use the 
word “moderate,” see Noam Chomsky, The Culture of Terrorism , (Boston: 
South End Press, 1988), chapter 2.8.74.The Guatemalan extreme right-wing leader, Mario Sandoval Alarcon, 
often described as the godfather of the death squads in Central America, was

advisers, and claimed that “verbal agreements” were entered into at that time 
to cut back on criticism of Guatemalan human-rights abuses and to renew 
military aid.See Marlise Simons, “Guatemala: The Coming Danger,” Foreign 
Policy (Summer 1981), p. 101; Scott Anderson and John Lee Anderson, Inside
