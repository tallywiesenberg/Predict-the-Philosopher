The thrust of the article was to suggest observer bias favorable to the 
Sandinistas, a subject the Times never addresses in regard to official observers.In later discussion of the elections, the 450 observers, including even the 
professional society of Latin American scholars, were entirely ignored by the 
Times.An excellent study by Lucinda Broadbent, “Nicaragua’s Elections: A 
Cruz Around the Issues; Comparative Analysis of Media Coverage of the 1984 
Elections,” as yet unpublished, parallels our findings in detail, based on an 
analysis of a wide sample, including U.S. network TV and the British as well 
as U.S. press.Broadbent points out that in her sample, the opposition to the 
Nicaraguan government is given more than twice the space accorded the 
government, “an unusual priority for media usually so wedded to ‘official 
sources’ in whichever country they find themselves” (p. 77).Broadbent 
stresses, as we do, the domination of the Reaganite frame, even in Britain and 
in the liberal press, and the massive distortion of reality that resulted from this 
biased framing.
