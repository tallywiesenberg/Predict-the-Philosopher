She notes also that the media never addressed the programs 
of the contesting parties in Nicaragua, which allowed Reaganite cliches about 
Sandinista intentions and policies to prevail.The media portrayals were 
“roughly the opposite of what was witnessed by international observers of the 
election” (p. 99), which is why, in our view, these observers had to be ignored.87.For further details, see Noam Chomsky, “Introduction,” in Morris Morley 
and James Petras, The Reagan Administration and Nicaragua , Institute for 
Media Analysis, Monograph 1 (New York: 1987), note 32, which also discusses 
the distortion of the Dutch observers’ report by Robert Leiken in the New York 
Review of Books, December 5,1985.Leiken dismisses the LASA report without 
comment as pro-Sandinista, i.e., as coming to the wrong conclusions.
