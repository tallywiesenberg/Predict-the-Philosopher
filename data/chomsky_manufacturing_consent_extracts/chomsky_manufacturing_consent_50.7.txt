As we have noted, the stress on superficialities like long lines is part of the 
propaganda agenda for a demonstration election.So is blacking out the fact 
that the length of the lines might be a function of the restricted number of 
voting booths, as was the case in El Salvador.Time provides both the emphasis 
on long lines and the suppression of relevant evidence on why the lines were 
so long.See Herman and Brodhead, Demonstration Elections , pp.126-27.
