A final filter is the ideology of anticommunism* Communism as the 
ultimate evil has always been the specter haunting property owners, as 
it threatens the very root of their class position and superior status* The 
Soviet, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions were traumas to Western elites, 
and the ongoing conflicts and the well-publicized abuses of Communist 
states have contributed to elevating opposition to communism to a first 
principle of Western ideology and politics* This ideology helps mobilize 
the populace against an enemy, and because the concept is fuzzy it can 
be used against anybody advocating policies that threaten property 
interests or support accommodation with Communist states and radi¬ 
calism* It therefore helps fragment the left and labor movements and 
serves as a political-control mechanism* If the triumph of communism 
is the worst imaginable result, the support of fascism abroad is justified 
as a lesser evil* Opposition to social democrats who are too soft on 
Communists and “play into their hands” is rationalized in similar terms* 
Liberals at home, often accused of being pro-Communist or insuffi¬ 
ciently anti-Communist, are kept continuously on the defensive in a 
cultural milieu in which anticommunism is the dominant religion* If 
they allow communism, or something that can be labeled communism, 
to triumph in the provinces while they are in office, the political costs 
are heavy. Most of them have fully internalized the religion anyway, 
but they are all under great pressure to demonstrate their anti-Commu¬ 
nist credentials* This causes them to behave very much like reactionar¬ 
ies* Their occasional support of social democrats often breaks down 
where the latter are insufficiently harsh on their own indigenous radi¬ 
cals or on popular groups that are organizing among generally margin¬ 
alized sectors* In his brief tenure in the Dominican Republic, Juan 
Bosch attacked corruption in the armed forces and government, began 
a land-reform program, undertook a major project for mass education 
of the populace, and maintained a remarkably open government and 
system of effective civil liberties* These policies threatened powerful 
internal vested interests, and the United States resented his indepen¬ 
dence and the extension of civil liberties to Communists and radicals. 
This was carrying democracy and pluralism too far* Kennedy was 
“extremely disappointed” in Bosch's rule, and the State Department 
“quickly soured on the first democratically elected Dominican Presi¬ 
dent in over thirty years.” Bosch’s overthrow by the military after nine 
months in office had at least the tacit support of the United States* 111 
Two years later, by contrast, the Johnson administration invaded the

Dominican Republic to make sure that Bosch did not resume power. 
The Kennedy liberals were enthusiastic about the military coup and 
displacement of a populist government in Brazil in 1964, 112 A major 
spurt in the growth of neo-Fascist national-security stares rook place 
under Kennedy and Johnson, In the cases of the U,S. subversion of 
Guatemala* 1947-54, an ^ the military attacks on Nicaragua, 1981-87, 
allegations of Communist links and a Communist threat caused many 
liberals to support counterrevolutionary intervention, while others 
lapsed into silence, paralyzed by the fear of being tarred with charges 
of infidelity to the national religion. 

It should be noted that when anti-Communist fervor is aroused, the 
demand for serious evidence in support of claims of “communist” 
abuses is suspended, and charlatans can thrive as evidential sources. 
Defectors, informers, and assorted other opportunists move to center 
stage as “experts,” and they remain there even after exposure as highly 
unreliable, if not downright liars, 113 Pascal Delwit and Jean-Michel 
Dewaele point out that in France, too, the ideologues of anticommu¬ 
nism “can do and say anything,” 114 Analyzing the new status of Annie 
Kriegel and Pierre Daix, two former passionate Stalinists now pos¬ 
sessed of a large and uncritical audience in France, 115 Delwit and 
Dewaele note; 

If we analyse their writings, we find all the classic reactions of 
people who have been disappointed in love. But no one dreams of 
criticising them for their past, even though it has marked them 
forever. They may well have been converted, but they have not 
changed, , , , no one notices the constants, even though they are 
glaringly obvious. Their best sellers prove, thanks to the support 
of the most indulgent and slothful critics anyone could hope for, 
that the public can be fooled. No one denounces or even notices 
the arrogance of both yesterday's eulogies and today's diatribes; 
no one cares that there is never any proof and that invective is 
used in place of analysis. Their inverted hyper-Stalinism—which 
takes the usual form of total manicheanism—is whitewashed sim¬ 
ply because it is directed against Communism. The hysteria has 
not changed, but it gets a better welcome in its present guise, 116 

The anti-Communist control mechanism reaches through the system 
to exercise a profound influence on the mass media. In normal times 
as well as in periods of Red scares, issues tend to be framed in terms 
of a dichotomized world of Communist and anti-Communist powers, 
with gains and losses allocated to contesting sides, and rooting for “our 



A PROPAGANDA MODEL 31 


side” considered an entirely legitimate news practice. It is the mass 
media that identify, create, and push into the limelight a Joe McCarthy, 
Arkady Shevchenko, and Claire Sterling and Robert Leiken, or an 
Annie Kriegel and Pierre Daix. The ideology and religion of anticom¬ 
munism is a potent filter.
