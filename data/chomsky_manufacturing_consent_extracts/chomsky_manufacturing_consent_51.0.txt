A final filter is the ideology of anticommunism* Communism as the 
ultimate evil has always been the specter haunting property owners, as 
it threatens the very root of their class position and superior status* The 
Soviet, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions were traumas to Western elites, 
and the ongoing conflicts and the well-publicized abuses of Communist 
states have contributed to elevating opposition to communism to a first 
principle of Western ideology and politics* This ideology helps mobilize 
the populace against an enemy, and because the concept is fuzzy it can 
be used against anybody advocating policies that threaten property 
interests or support accommodation with Communist states and radi¬ 
calism* It therefore helps fragment the left and labor movements and 
serves as a political-control mechanism* If the triumph of communism 
is the worst imaginable result, the support of fascism abroad is justified 
as a lesser evil* Opposition to social democrats who are too soft on 
Communists and “play into their hands” is rationalized in similar terms* 
Liberals at home, often accused of being pro-Communist or insuffi¬ 
ciently anti-Communist, are kept continuously on the defensive in a 
cultural milieu in which anticommunism is the dominant religion* If 
they allow communism, or something that can be labeled communism, 
to triumph in the provinces while they are in office, the political costs 
are heavy. Most of them have fully internalized the religion anyway, 
but they are all under great pressure to demonstrate their anti-Commu¬ 
nist credentials* This causes them to behave very much like reactionar¬ 
ies* Their occasional support of social democrats often breaks down 
where the latter are insufficiently harsh on their own indigenous radi¬ 
cals or on popular groups that are organizing among generally margin¬ 
alized sectors* In his brief tenure in the Dominican Republic, Juan 
Bosch attacked corruption in the armed forces and government, began 
a land-reform program, undertook a major project for mass education 
of the populace, and maintained a remarkably open government and 
system of effective civil liberties* These policies threatened powerful 
internal vested interests, and the United States resented his indepen¬ 
dence and the extension of civil liberties to Communists and radicals. 
This was carrying democracy and pluralism too far* Kennedy was 
“extremely disappointed” in Bosch's rule, and the State Department 
“quickly soured on the first democratically elected Dominican Presi¬ 
dent in over thirty years.” Bosch’s overthrow by the military after nine 
months in office had at least the tacit support of the United States* 111
