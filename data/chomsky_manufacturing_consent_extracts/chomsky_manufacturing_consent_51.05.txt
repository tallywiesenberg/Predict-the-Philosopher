Lord Chitnis, a veteran British election observer who attended the Sal¬ 
vadoran election on behalf of the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group, 


noted that “First, and crucial to the whole standing of the exercise, was the 
fact that no politicians to the left of the Christian Democrats [PDC], and not 
all of them, were free to contest the election.... [Exclusion of the FDR made 
the election] a contest of vague promises and inferences by two candidates who 
already bore a heavy responsibility for the situation in which El Salvador finds 
itself today.” The 1984 elections in El Salvador, he continued, were held in an 
“atmosphere of terror and despair, of macabre rumour and grisly reality” 
(Pratap C. Chitnis, “Observing El Salvador: The 1984 Elections,” Third World 
Quarterly [October 1984], pp.971 - 73 ).Chitnis was never cited as a source 
anywhere in the U.S. mass media.105.Stephen Kinzer, “Ortega: Can He Be Trusted?” New York Times Maga¬
