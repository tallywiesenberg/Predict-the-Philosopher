The possibility that the administration wants to constrain 
Nicaraguan arms imports to reduce its capacity to defend itself against ongoing 
aggression against it also never arises for the press.Note that unlike guerrilla 
forces, the contras can survive only with regular airdrops, reaching the level 
of thirty to forty a month by mid-1987, and two or three times that amount 
after August, as the U.S. sought to undermine the Guatemala accords.Hence 
Nicaragua would have good reason to obtain vintage 1950s jet planes to defend 
itself from the U.S. proxy army.no.For an account of the performance of U.S. official and semi-official obÂ¬
