Tying the assassination attempt to the Soviet Union and KGB was espe¬ 
cially helpful in discrediting the Soviet leadership in 1982 and early 1983, as 
Yuri Andropov, who had just succeeded Brezhnev as head of state, was at one 
time head of the KGB.The Bulgarian, Sergei Antonov, was arrested in Italy 
within three weeks of Andropov’s assuming power.6.See Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection pp.102-3, 206-7.
