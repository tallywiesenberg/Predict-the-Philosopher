PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGNS 

The five filters narrow the range of news that passes through the gates, 
and even more sharply limit what can become “big news,” subject to 
sustained news campaigns. By definition, news from primary establish¬ 
ment sources meets one major filter requirement and is readily accom¬ 
modated by the mass media. Messages from and about dissidents and 
weak, unorganized individuals and groups, domestic and foreign, are at 
an initial disadvantage in sourcing costs and credibility, and they often 
do not comport with the ideology or interests of the gatekeepers and 
other powerful parties that influence the filtering process. 117 

Thus, for example, the torture of political prisoners and the attack 
on trade unions in Turkey will be pressed on the media only by human- 
rights activists and groups that have little political leverage. The U.S. 
government supported the Turkish martial-law government from its 
inception in 1980, and the U-S, business community has been warm 
toward regimes that profess fervent anticommunism, encourage foreign 
investment, repress unions, and loyally support U.S. foreign policy (a 
set of virtues that are frequently closely linked). Media that chose to 
feature Turkish violence against their own citizenry would have had to 
go to extra expense to find and check out information sources; they 
would elicit flak from government, business, and organized right-wing 
flak machines, and they might be looked upon with disfavor by the 
corporate community (including advertisers) for indulging in such a 
quixotic interest and crusade. They would tend to stand alone in focus¬ 
ing on victims that from the standpoint of dominant American interests 
were unworthy . 118 

In marked contrast, protest over political prisoners and the violation 
of the rights of trade unions in Poland was seen by the Reagan adminis¬ 
tration and business elites in 1981 as a noble cause, and, not coinciden¬ 
tally, as an opportunity to score political points. Many media leaders 
and syndicated columnists felt the same way. Thus information and

strong opinions on human-rights violations in Poland could be obtained 
from official sources in Washington* and reliance on Polish dissidents 
would not elicit flak from the U.S. government or the flak machines. 
These victims would be generally acknowledged by the managers of the 
filters to be wonky .„ The mass media never explain why Andrei Sa¬ 
kharov is worthy and Jose Luis Massera* in Uruguay* is unworthy—the 
attention and general dichotomization occur “naturally” as a result of
