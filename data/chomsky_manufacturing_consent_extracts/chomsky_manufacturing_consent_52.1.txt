366 NOTES TO PAGES 155-159 

24.The first significant departure in the mass media from the SHK model, 
even though no alternative was offered, did not occur till May 12, 1983, on 
ABC-TV’s “20/20.” On the pattern of deviations here and later, see note 26 
below.25.Late in this long article, Newsweek does state in passing that “It is difficult 
to believe that the Soviets would expect the murder of the pope to solve their 
Polish problem.To some, it seems odd that the Soviets would put their fate 
in the hands of Bulgarians and Turks, depriving themselves of the control that 
is so essential to a ticklish intelligence operation.” These sentences, unusual 
in the mass media for raising such questions, sit alone and undeveloped, after 
a lengthy discourse that accepts the SHK analysis as valid.
