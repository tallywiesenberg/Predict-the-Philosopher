Among the newspapers, a propaganda conformity prevailed until the time that 
prosecutor Albano’s report was made public in June 1984, when Michael 
Dobbs, of the Washington Post, began to take a more critical view, along with 
Don Schanche, of the Los Angeles Times .While skeptical of Agca’s claims over 
the next several years, Dobbs remained equally skeptical of the idea that Agca 
was coached, which he referred to as “the Bulgarian view.” Dobbs never 
seriously explored the coaching hypothesis.See Herman and Brodhead, Bul¬
