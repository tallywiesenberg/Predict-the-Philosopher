Martella visited Washington, D.C., in October 1982, during which time he 
benefited not only from the insights of Arnauld de Borchgrave, but was also 
given a special viewing of the NBC-TV special on “The Man Who Shot the 
Pope” (see Herman and Brodhead, Bulgarian Connection, pp.24-27).Ledeen 
may have had a more direct involvement in the initiation of the case in Italy, 
a charge made by Francesco Pazienza.See Diana Johnstone, “Bulgarian Con¬ 
nection: Finger-pointing in the Pontiff Plot Labyrinth,” In These Times, Janu¬
