See Leslie Gelb, “Soviet-Terror Ties Called Outdated,” New York 
Times, October 18, 1981.In his book Veil, Bob Woodward notes that CIA 
analysts had at once dismissed Sterling’s concoctions as “preposterous,” giving 
some examples, including her reliance on Italian press stories that had been 
planted in CIA disinformation operations ([New York: Simon & Schuster, 
i 987], pp.124-29).For detailed refutation, see Edward S. Herman, The Real 
Terror Network (Boston: South End Press, 1982).33.
