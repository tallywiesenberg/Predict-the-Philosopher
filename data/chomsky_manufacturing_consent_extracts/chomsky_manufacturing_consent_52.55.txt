The booklet by 
Andronov to which she attributes such great influence was, to our knowledge, 
never mentioned in the U.S. mass media except by Sterling and Henze.36.Even Michael Dobbs failed to deal with the fact that the Bulgarian defense 
claimed that no publicly available sources—i.e., newspapers, or radio and 
television programs—had ever had details on Antonov’s apartment before Agca 
provided those details to the investigating magistrate.This would seem to 
imply that Agca got the details by some form of coaching while in prison.Dobbs dismisses coaching as the “Bulgarian view,” but never explains what 
other view could account for Agca’s knowledge of places he had never visited.
