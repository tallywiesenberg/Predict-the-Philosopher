in the Pol Pot era (and thereafter) was exceedingly serviceable, as 
Cambodia had fallen to the Communists and useful lessons could be 
drawn by attention to their victims, the numerous victims of the U.S, 
bombing before the Communist takeover were scrupulously ignored by 
the U.S. elite press. After Pol Pot’s ouster by the Vietnamese, the 
United States quietly shifted support to this “worse than Hitler” villain, 
with little notice in the press, which adjusted once again to the national 
political agenda, 124 Attention to the Indonesian massacres of 1965-66, 
or the victims of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor from 1975 
onward, would also be distinctly unhelpful as bases of media cam¬ 
paigns, because Indonesia is a U.S. ally and client that maintains an 
open door to Western investment, and because, in the case of East 
Timor, the United States bears major responsibility for the slaughter. 
The same is true of the victims of stare terror in Chile and Guatemala, 
U.S. clients whose basic institutional structures, including the state 
terror system, were put in place and maintained by, or with crucial 
assistance from, U,S. power, and who remain U.S. client states. Propa¬ 
ganda campaigns on behalf of these victims would conflict with govern¬ 
ment-business-military interests and, in our model, would not be able 
to pass through the filtering system. 125 

Propaganda campaigns may be instituted either by the government 
or by one or more of the top media firms. The campaigns to discredit 
the government of Nicaragua, to support the Salvadoran elections as 
an exercise in legitimizing democracy, and to use the Soviet shooting 
down of the Korean airliner KAL 007 as a means of mobilizing public 
support for the arms buildup, were instituted and propelled by the 
government. The campaigns to publicize the crimes of Pol Pot and the 
alleged KGB plot to assassinate the pope were initiated by the Reader’s 
Digest, with strong follow-up support from NBC-TV, the New York 
Times, and other major media companies, 126 Some propaganda cam¬ 
paigns are jointly initiated by government and media; all of them re¬ 
quire the collaboration of the mass media. The secret of the 
unidirectionality of the politics of media propaganda campaigns is the 
multiple filter system discussed above: the mass media will allow any 
stories that are hurtful to large interests to peter out quickly, if they 
surface at all. 127

For stories that are useful^ the process will get under way with a series 
of government leaks, press conferences, white papers, etc., or with one 
or more of the mass media starting the ball rolling with such articles 
as Barron and Paul’s “Murder of a Gentle Land” (Cambodia), or Claire 
Sterling’s “The Plot to Kill the Pope,” both in the Reader** Digest . If 
the other major media like the story, they will follow it up with their 
own versions, and the matter quickly becomes newsworthy by familiar¬
