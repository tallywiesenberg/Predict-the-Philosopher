mobilizing interest and outrage* In the opinion columns, we would 
anticipate sharp restraints on the range of opinion allowed expression. 
Our hypothesis is that worthy victims will be featured prominently and 
dramatically, that they will be humanized, and that their victimization 
will receive the detail and context in story construction that will gener¬ 
ate reader interest and sympathetic emotion. In contrast, unworthy 
victims will merit only slight detail, minimal humanization, and little 
context that will excite and enrage* 

Meanwhile, because of the power of establishment sources, the flak 
machines, and anti-Communist ideology, we would anticipate outcries 
that the worthy victims are being sorely neglected, that the unworthy 
are treated with excessive and uncritical generosity, 132 that the media’s 
liberal, adversarial (if not subversive) hostility to government explains 
Our difficulties in mustering support for the latest national venture in 
counterrevolutionary intervention. 

In sum, a propaganda approach to media coverage suggests a system¬ 
atic and highly political dichotomization in news coverage based on 
serviceability to important domestic power interests. This should be 
observable in dichotomized choices of story and in the volume and 
quality of coverage. In the chapters that follow we will see that such 
dichotomization in the mass media is massive and systematic: not only 
are choices for publicity and suppression comprehensible in terms of 
system advantage, but the modes of handling favored and inconvenient 
materials (placement, tone, context, fullness of treatment) differ in ways 
that serve political ends. 





Worthy and 
Unworthy Victims 


A PROPAGANDA SYSTEM WILL CONSISTENTLY PORTRAY PEOPLE 

abused in enemy states as worthy victims, whereas those treated with 
equal or greater severity by its own government or clients will be 
unworthy . The evidence of worth may be read from the extent and 
character of attention and indignation. We will show in this chapter that 
the U,S* mass media's practical definitions of worth are political in the 
extreme and fit well the expectations of a propaganda model. While this 
differential treatment occurs on a large scale, the media, intellectuals, 
and public are able to remain unconscious of the fact and maintain a 
high moral and self-righteous tone. This is evidence of an extremely 
effective propaganda system.
