For further insight into the commitments and intellectual level of 
a man taken seriously as a scholar, see his discussion of the need for the state 
to take stern action to protect the public from “lies” by subversives, and to 
ensure that the public is not deceived by the “hidden agenda” of such groups 
as Clergy and Laity Concerned, the Coalition for a New Foreign and Military 
Policy, NACLA, and others who seek to conceal “their espousal of Cuban- 
style Communism” and who are engaged in “deception” and “subversion.” As 
he correctly notes, and inadvertently reveals in his discussion, “to totalitarian¬ 
ism, an opponent is by definition subversive” (Lewy, “Does America Need a 
Verfassungsschutzbericht?” Orbis [Fall 1987]—a respected journal with a dis¬ 
tinguished editorial board).34.Unpublished memorandum on pacification problems circulated within the 
military in 1965, a copy of which was given by Vann to Professor Alex Carey,
