46.See Charles Kadushin, The American Intellectual Elite (Boston: Little, 
Brown, 1974).This study was based on lengthy interviews taken in May 1970, 
after the Cambodia invasion, when public opposition to the war reached its 
highest peak.Virtually all of those interviewed were “doves,” some active in 
opposition to the war.Virtually none opposed the war on the principled 
grounds of opposition to aggression (called “ideological grounds” by the au¬ 
thor) that all would have adopted had they been asked about the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
