For additional evidence and discussion, see the review in Race & Class 
and More, from which we will draw extensively, particularly in appendix 3, and 
Porter’s review, both cited in note 1, above.no.Thies, When Governments Collide, p. 201.This analysis, familiar in the 
scholarly literature, is quite different from Braestrup’s conclusions, which, as 
Porter comments, he attributes to a consensus of historians without a single 
reference.Porter adds that “few independent historians” would endorse 
Braestrup’s conclusions or his analysis of Communist objectives, quoting CIA 
analyst Patrick McGarvey and others.
