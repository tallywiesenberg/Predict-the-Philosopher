On this forgotten massa¬ 
cre, and the various attempts to shift attention to the massacre carried out by 
the retreating NLF forces, see our PEHR, 1 ,345ff., and sources cited, particu¬ 
larly Gareth Porter, “The 1968 ‘Hue Massacre,' ” Congressional Record, Febru¬ 
ary 19,1975, PP- S2189-94,” and Porter's review of Big Story .Porter notes that 
Braestrup’s estimate of destruction in Hue is far below that of US AID, which 
estimated in April that 77 percent of Hue’s buildings were “seriously dam¬ 
aged" or totally destroyed.120.Kolko, Anatomy of a War, p. 309.121.
