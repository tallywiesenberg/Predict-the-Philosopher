the police officers were described time and again, interspersed with the 
description of how Popieluszko pleaded for his life, and evidence of the 


worthy and unworthy victims 43 


brutality of the act* Numerous unflattering photos of the policemen on 
trial were presented, adding dramatic detail in support of the image of 
police viciousness. In the courtroom, the guilty police sit, one with "a 
nervous tic on the right side of his face [that] caused his dark mustache 
to twitch uncontrollably,” with “tear-filled testimony [that] gave the 
trial some of its most dramatic moments” (Time, Feb, r8, 1985), The 
police weep openly or bow their heads in the face of the grisly evidence. 
Popieluszko himself was humanized, with descriptions of his physical 
characteristics and personality that made him into something more than 
a distant victim. 7 In sum, the act of violence and its effects on Popie¬ 
luszko were presented in such a way as to generate the maximum 
emotional impact on readers. The act was vicious and deserved the 
presentation it received- The acts against the unworthy victims were 
also vicious, but they were treated very differently* 

2.1.2(b)* Stress on indignation, shock, and demands for justice. In 

a large proportion of the articles on the Popieluszko murder there are 
quotations or assertions of outrage, indignation, profound shock, and 
mourning, and demands that justice be done. Steady and wholly sympa¬ 
thetic attention is given to demonstrators, mourners, weeping people, 
work stoppages, masses held in honor of the victim, and expressions of 
outrage, mainly by nonofificial sources. The population “continues to 
mourn,” “public outrage mounted,” the pope is deeply shaken, and 
even Jaruzelski condemns the action. The net effect of this day^in-day- 
out repetition of outrage and indignation was to call very forcible 
attention to a terrible injustice, to put the Polish government on the 
defensive, and, probably, to contribute to remedial action, 

2*l*2(c). The search for responsibility at the top. In article after 
article, the U.S. media raised the question: how high up was the act 
known and approved? By our count, eighteen articles in the New York 
Times stressed the question of higher responsibility, often with aggres¬ 
sive headlines addressed to that point* 5 A number of articles bring in 
a Soviet link (“Lawyer Seemingly [sic] Implies a Soviet Link in Slaying 
of Priest” [Jan. 31, 1985]), and Michael Kaufman, of the Timesy twice 
manages to drag in the plot to kill the pope, which the U*S. press, led 
by the New York Times , had been trying to tie in with the Soviets and 
Bulgarians. 9 These links to the Soviet Union and the Bulgarian Con¬ 
nection are established by finding someone who says what the reporter 
and his paper want to dredge up—in no case was there a trace of 
supportive evidence*
