This appears to be a minor factor at best, and one can also make a case 
that the reverse was true: that support for France in Europe was motivated by 
concern that France might “abandon Indochina” (see Geoffrey Warner, “The 
USA and the Rearmament of West Germany,” International Affairs [Spring 
1985])- This factor also fails to explain U.S. efforts to keep the French in 
Indochina, and to take up their cause after they withdrew.176.Cited by Porter,^ Peace Denied, p. 36, from 1966 congressional hearings.177.See, inter alia, essays in PP, V, by John Dower, Richard DuBoff, and
