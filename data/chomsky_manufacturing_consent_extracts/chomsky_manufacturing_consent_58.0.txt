WORTHY VICTIMS 

Jerzy Popieluszko, a Polish priest* murdered on October 19, 1994, 

(1) Account at finding of body: “The sources who saw the priest’s body on Tuesday, 
said it was badly bruised, indicating he had been beaten after he was kidnapped on a 
highway near the town of Torun. The autopsy also showed that Father Popieluszko 
had been gagged at the mouth and apparently tied with a rope from neck to feet so 
that if he struggled he would strangle himself, they said. The sources said they could 
not confirm reports quoting members of the slain priest’s family as saying he had 
suffered injuries to his jaw and skull’ 1 (Dec. 29, 1984). 

(2) Account at trial of murderers: “The film showed clearly that the priest's bent legs 
were tied to a noose around his neck in such a way that if he straightened them he would 
be strangled. The rope binding his hands had evidently come loose in the water. Several 
gags had also worked free and lay covering his clerical collar and the front of his 
cassock. From his legs hung a sack of rocks that, according to earlier testimony, had 
been carried all over Poland for the week that the three assailants were pursuing the 
priest. When the cameras were trained on the priest’s face, the narration by a police 
officer at the reservoir declared that £ there are clear signs of beating.’ This was con¬ 
firmed by medical evidence offered Thursday by Dr. Maria Byrdy, a pathologist, who 
said Father Popieluszko had been struck more than a dozen times with a club” (Jan. 
26, 1985),
