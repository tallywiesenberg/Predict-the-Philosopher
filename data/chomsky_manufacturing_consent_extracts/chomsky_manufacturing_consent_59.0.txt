an important landmark in the escalation of violence in El Salvador and 
in its effect on the newly appointed conservative archbishop of San 
Salvador, Oscar Romero. Rutilio Grande was a Jesuit, the pastor of 
Aguilares, and a progressive who helped organize peasants in self-help 
groups. He was strongly opposed by the local landlords, police, and 
military commanders, but he was a national figure in the Salvadoran 
church and was a friend of the archbishop. Rutilio Grande was shot to 
death, along with a teenager and a seventy-two-year-old peasant, while 
on his way to Mass on March 12,1977. According to a church autopsy, 
the bullets that riddled the priest were of the same caliber as the

Manzer guns used by the police. "By ‘coincidence, 1 all telephone com¬ 
munications in the area were cut off within an hour of the triple assassi¬ 
nation. Police patrols normally active in the region mysteriously 
disappeared/* 13 Archbishop Romero wrote to the president of El Salva¬ 
dor, Arturo Armando Molina, urging a thorough investigation, which 
was promised. A week later, the church having established that it was 
probably police bullets that had killed the three victims, Romero wrote 
a harsher letter to Molina, noting the absence of a promised official 
report and pointing out that comments, "many of them unfavorable to 
your government/* have been made. With continued inaction, Romero 
threatened to refuse church participation in any official government 
event unless the murders were investigated and the killers brought to 
justice. Romero’s biographer writes: 

Six weeks later, the lawyer chosen by Romero to follow the case 
reported “an embarrassing and clear indifference toward the in¬ 
vestigation on the part of state organizations.” A suspect ordered 
arrested by a judge was living unconcernedly in El Paisnal, and 
no one had ordered the bodies exhumed and examined. The bul¬ 
lets are still in the graves. 14 

Rutilio Grande’s murder followed a series of forcible expulsions of 
foreign clergy by the Molina government and several earlier murders 
of church personnel. Romero and the clergy deliberated at great length 
on their course of action in response to this escalation of the violence 
against them. They tried to get out their messages of concern, but many 
were not heard because of newspaper censorship. They finally decided 
to take dramatic action: temporary school closings, and implementation 
of the previously mentioned threat to refuse to support the government 
and other power groups on official occasions. 

This entire package of murder and church response was hardly 
lacking in drama and newsworthiness. Yet murder, the confrontation of 
the desperate church with a repressive state, and the dramatic acts
