PEHR, II.6, on the record of falsification based on this book, and on Pon- 
chaud’s own remarkable record, further analyzed by Michael Vickery in his 
Cambodia: i^~ i 982 (Boston: South End Press, 1984).CIA Research Paper, 
Kampuchea: A Demographic Catastrophe (Washington: CIA, May 1980).For a 
critique of this study revealing extensive falsification conditioned by U.S. 
government priorities—specifically, suppression of the worst Pol Pot atrocities 
during the later period—see Michael Vickery, “Democratic Kampuchea— 
CIA to the Rescue,” Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 14.4 (1982), and 
his Cambodia .The latter is the major study of the Khmer Rouge period, 
by one of the few authentic Cambodia scholars, widely and favorably re¬ 
viewed abroad by mainstream Indochina scholars and others but virtually 
ignored in the United States, as was the Finnish Inquiry Commission 
report.See Noam Chomsky, “Decade of Genocide in Review,” Inside Asia 
(London, February 1985, reprinted in James Peck, ed., The Chomsky Reader 
[New York: Pantheon, 1987]), on several serious studies of the period, in¬ 
cluding these.
