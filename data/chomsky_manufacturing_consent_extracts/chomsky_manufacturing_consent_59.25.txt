Shawcross, Quality of Mercy, pp.49-50.He observes that “those years of 
warfare saw the destruction of Cambodian society and the rise of the Khmer 
Rouge from its ashes, in good part as a result of White House policies”; “with 
the forces of nationalism unleashed by the war at their command, the Khmer 
Rouge became an increasingly formidable army,” while in the “massive Ameri¬ 
can bombing campaign” to which the Khmer Rouge were subjected through 
August 1973, “their casualties are thought to have been huge.” The phrase 
“their casualties” presumably refers to Khmer Rouge military forces; there is 
no mention of civilian casualties.On the limited scope of Shawcross’s “quality 
of mercy,” see “Phase III at home” (p. 288), below.28.
