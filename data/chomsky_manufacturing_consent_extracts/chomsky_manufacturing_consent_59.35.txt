On the treatment of women 
in “the brothel of Asia,” with its estimated 500,000 prostitutes, masseuses, and 
bar-waitresses, 20 percent of them under fourteen years of age, drawn to 
Bangkok (and sometimes sold off to Europe) from the impoverished rural areas 
through “a huge underground network of brothels and workshops feeding on 
child flesh and labor,” see several articles in Beyond Stereotypes: Asian Women 
in Development, Southeast Asia Chronicle (January 1985).30.For extensive evidence on this matter, see PEHR, II.6, and Vickery, 
Cambodia, extending the story to phase III.31.Others give higher estimates.
