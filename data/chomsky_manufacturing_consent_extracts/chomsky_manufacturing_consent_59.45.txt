who “may have been executed,” and an estimate of deaths from all causes that 
is meaningless because of misjudgment of postwar population and politically 
motivated assessments throughout; the Far Eastern Economic Review reported 
a substantial increase in the population under DK to 8.2 million, “mostly based 
on CIA estimates” {Asia 1979 and Asia 1980 yearbooks of the FEER, the latter 
reducing the estimate from 8.2 to 4.2 million, the actual figure apparently being 
in the neighborhood of 6.5 million); in the U.S. government journal Problem* 
of Communism (May-June 1981), Australian Indochina specialist Carlyle 
Thayer suggests a figure of deaths from all causes at 500,000, of which 50,000 
to 60,000 were executions.At the high end, estimates range to three million 
or more, but without any available analysis.As all serious observers emphasize, 
the range of error is considerable at every point.33.George Hildebrand and Gareth Porter, Cambodia: Starvation and Revolu¬
