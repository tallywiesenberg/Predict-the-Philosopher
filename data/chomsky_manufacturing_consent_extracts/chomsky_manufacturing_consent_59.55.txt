When PEHR, II.6 was circulating to Cam¬ 
bodia scholars and journalists in manuscript, we received a letter from Shaw¬ 
cross demanding that references to him be eliminated.We responded that we 
would be glad to consider any specific case that he found wrong or misleading 
and delayed publication of the book awaiting his response, which never ar¬ 
rived.On his public response, see below.34.Milton Osborne, Before Kampuchea (London: Allen & Unwin, 1980), p. 191;
