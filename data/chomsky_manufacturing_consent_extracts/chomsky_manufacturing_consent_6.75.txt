Preface 


lx THIS BOOK, WE SKETCH OUT A “PROPAGANDA MODEL" AND 
apply it to the performance of the mass media of the United States.This effort reflects our belief, based on many years of study of the 
workings of the media, that they serve to mobilize support for the 
special interests that dominate the state and private activity, 1 and that 
their choices, emphases, and omissions can often be understood best, 
and sometimes with striking clarity and insight, by analyzing them in 
such terms.
