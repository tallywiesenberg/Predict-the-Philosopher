These practices have 
not only distorted public perceptions of Central American realities, 
they have also seriously misrepresented U.S. policy objectives, an esÂ¬ 
sential feature of propaganda, as Jacques Ellul stresses: 

The propagandist naturally cannot reveal the true intentions of 
the principal for whom he acts....That would be to submit the 
projects to public discussion, to the scrutiny of public opinion, and 
thus to prevent their success.
