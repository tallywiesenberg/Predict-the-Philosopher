Ixii PREFACE 


The power of the government to fix frames of reference and agendas, 
and to exclude inconvenient facts from public inspection, is also imÂ¬ 
pressively displayed in the coverage of elections in Genual America, 
discussed in chapter 3, and throughout the analysis of particular cases 
in the chapters that follow* 

When there is little or no elite dissent from a government policy, 
there may still be some slippage in the mass media, and facts that tend 
to undermine the government line, if they are properly understood, can 
be found, usually on the back pages of the newspapers.
