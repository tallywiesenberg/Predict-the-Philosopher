and brought to justice. The New York Times had no editorial condemn¬ 
ing* or even mentioning* the murder. It was quickly placed in the larger 
framework of alleged killings by both the left and the right that were 
deeply regretted by Salvadoran and US. officials. 



WORTHY AND UNWORTHY VICTIMS 49 


2.3.2. The propaganda line: a 
reformist junta trying to contain 
the violence of right and left 

The Salvadoran and U,S. governments contended at the time of 
Romero’s murder that the killing going on in El Salvador was being 
done by extremists of the right and the left, not by the Salvadoran 
armed forces and their agents; and that the government was trying its 
best to contain the killings and carry out reforms. John Bushnell, of the 
State Department* stated before a House appropriations committee 
that “there is some misperception by those who follow the press that 
the government is itself repressive in El Salvador*” when in fact the 
violence is “from the extreme right and the extreme left” and “the 
smallest part” of the killings come from the army and security forces* 17 
This statement was a knowing lie, 18 contradicted by all independent 
evidence coming out of El Salvador and refuted by Archbishop Romero 
on an almost daily basis. 19 In his letter to Carter sent on February 17, 
1980* the archbishop pointed out that aid to the junta had resulted in 
increasing repressive violence by the government, “amassing a total 
dead and wounded far higher than in the previous military regimes,” 
And Romero explained to Carter that the idea that the junta was 
reformist was a myth, that “neither the junta nor the Christian Demo¬ 
crats govern the country,” but, rather, power is in the hands of the 
army, serving itself and the oligarchy. 20 

What gave Bushnell’s statement a certain credibility was the fact that 
there had been a “reformist coup” by young army officers in October 
1979, an d liberals and progressives entered the early junta. However, as 
Raymond Bonner points out. 

The young, progressive officers who carefully plotted the coup 
lost control of it as swiftly as they had executed it. Their ideals 
and objectives were subverted by senior, more conservative of¬ 
ficers who had the backing of [ITS. Ambassador) Devine and the 
U.S. Embassy in El Salvador and key Carter administration offi¬ 
cials in Washington. 21 

The progressive elements on the junta found themselves entirely with¬ 
out power, and gradually exited or were forced out, along with large 
numbers from the cabinet and administration. Jose Napoleon Duane
