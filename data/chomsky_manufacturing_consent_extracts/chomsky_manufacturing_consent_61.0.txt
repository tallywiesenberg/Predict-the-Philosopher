The U.S. mass media, however, followed the Bushnell formula virtu¬ 
ally without deviation: there was a “civil war between extreme right and 
leftist groups” (New York Times, Feb. 25, 1980); the “seemingly well 
meaning but weak junta” was engaging in reforms but was unable to 
check the terror (Time, Apr. 7, 1980). The U.S. mass media had fea-

tured heavily the reformist character of the revolutionary junta* but 
they uniformly suppressed evidence of the powerlessness* frustrations* 
and early resignation of the progressives* and their replacement by 
civilians willing to serve as “front men” for state terror* Roman 
Mayorga, an engineer and university professor who had been the unani¬ 
mous choice of the original coup plotters, resigned on January 3,1980* 
along with Guillermo Manuel Ungo “and at least 37 of the highest 
ranking government officials, including the heads of all government 
agencies.” 26 But for the media, these events never happened, and the 
junta was still a “weak centrist government * * * beset by implacable 
extremes” (New York Times editorial* Apr* 28* 1980)* not a right-wing 
government of massacre* Robin K. Andersen points out that 

None of the networks reported . * * the final resignation of the 
junta members* Even CBS* which had reported at length on the 
appointment of Roman Mayorga* failed to report his resignation, 
or any of the others. For television news viewers, these political 
developments never happened. Television news coverage omitted 
every reference to this all-important political power struggle that 
could have accounted for the abuses that continued* * * * The 
civilian lack of control, and even their resignation, had no effect 
on the way in which the news characterized the junta; it continued 
to be labeled moderate. 27 

And the Salvadoran government has continued to be “moderate” and 
“centrist” up to today. 

Other media suppressions aided in bolstering the myth of the neutral 
junta standing between the extreme right and the extreme left. On 
March 29,1980, the New York Times carried a Reuters dispatch noting 
the resignation of three high Salvadoran officials, who* according to the 
article, “resigned last night in protest against the juntas inability to halt 
violence by leftist and rightist forces*” 3 ® The preceding day, an AP 
dispatch recorded the same resignations, but without any explanation 
of the reasons for this. One of the resigning officials. Undersecretary 
of Agriculture Jorge Alberto Villacorta* issued a public statement say¬ 
ing that
