government not only incapable of putting an end to the violence, 
but a government which itself is generating the political violence 
through repression*, *, Recently, in one of the large estates taken

It can be seen from the statement that the reference in the Reuter’s 
dispatch to protest “against the junta’s inability to halt violence by 
leftist and rightist forces” is a gross misrepresentation* and it is evident 
that an honest transmission of Villacorta’s statement would have con¬ 
tradicted the propaganda line* 

At Archbishop Romero’s funeral, on March 30, 1980, where many 
thousands gathered to pay tribute, bomb explosions and gunfire killed 
some forty people and injured hundreds more* The version of the event 
provided by U.S. Ambassador Robert White and the Salvadoran gov¬ 
ernment was that “armed terrorists of the ultra left sowed panic among 
the masses and did all they could to provoke the security forces into 
returning fire. But the discipline of the armed forces held.” 30 Joseph 
Treaster’s account in the New York Times quotes Duarte that the 
violence was from the left It also quotes a junta statement that the army 
was strictly confined to its barracks, and Treaster says, “There was no 
sign of uniformed government forces in the plaza before or during the 
shooting.” No other version of the facts is mentioned. However, a 
mimeographed statement on March 30, signed by twenty-two church 
leaders present at the funeral, claimed that the panic had been started 
by a bomb thrown from the national palace, followed by machine-gun 
and other shots coming from its second floor. 31 This account was sup¬ 
pressed by Treaster and was never mentioned in the New York Times. 

In a follow-up article of April 7,1980, Treaster repeats that on March 
30 the junta ordered all military forces into their barracks, and that they 
obeyed “even though they knew leftists with weapons were pouring into 
the central plaza.” Treaster asserts this government claim as fact, and 
he continues to suppress sources and evidence that contradict this 
government allegation. He also fails to explain why the leftists would 
indiscriminately shoot their own people paying homage to the arch¬ 
bishop. 32 

The title of Treaster’s article of April 7,1980, is “Slaying in Salvador 
Backfires on Rebels.” The article reads as follows:
