To be precise, we have found one suggestion, although well after the 
event.In The Times Higher Education Supplement, December 6, 1981, along 
with a series of falsifications of our position of the sort discussed here, Shaw¬ 
cross states that given our “political influence,” we could have played an 
important part in mobilizing world opinion to bring pressure on China to call 
off Khmer Rouge atrocities—as he was no doubt desperately trying to do, but 
failing, because of his lack of outreach comparable to ours.Comment should 
be superfluous.Evidently the editors of the journal so believed, refusing 
publication of a response, despite our awesome “political influence.” It seems 
doubtful that Shawcross would have published such childish absurdities had 
he not been assured that no response would be permitted.108.
