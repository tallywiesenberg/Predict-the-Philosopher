The murder of Archbishop Oscar Amulfo Romero two weeks ago 
and the killing of 30 at his funeral may have benefited, rather than 
hurt, the ruling civilian-military junta, in the view of many diplo¬ 
mats, businessmen and Government officials. 

The extreme right is being blamed for the killing of the Arch-

bishop and the extreme left is being blamed for the shooting and 
bombing that turned the crowded central plaza into chaos as 
Archbishop Romero was being eulogized, 

“It’s not so much that the junta gained/* said Robert E* White* 
the United States Ambassador to El Salvador* “but that its oppo¬ 
nents on the extreme right and left have lost prestige. The net 
result is a boost in prestige for the junta/' 

We may note how the title of the article transforms the murder of the 
leader of the dissident forces (and then of his followers at the funeral) 
from a moral issue deserving outrage into a question of political advan¬ 
tage, and turns that against the rebels. It would be hard to imagine the 
New York Times publishing an article on Popieluszko headed “Slaying 
in Poland Backfires on Solidarity Movement,* 5 featuring perhaps the 
playing up by the official press of demonstrator aggressiveness or vio¬ 
lence. Note also how the question of identifying the killer of Romero, 
and the governments obligation to seek justice, has been pushed into 
the background. Finally, there is the statement that “the extreme left 
is being blamed 5 * for the deaths in the plaza* Use of the passive voice 
allows Treaster to avoid specification of just who is blaming the ex¬ 
treme left* He mentions as his sources for the article as a whole “many 
diplomats, businessmen and Government officials”~he doesn*t even 
pretend to have talked to ordinary Salvadorans or church representa¬ 
tives—but his only citation near the statement that “the extreme left 
is being blamed" is the then-U.S* ambassador, Robert White. By relying 
only on government handouts and carefully avoiding readily available 
conflicting evidence and alternative views, the Times once again found 
the means of applying the usual formula of a deadly right offsetting a 
deadly left, with the junta favored by the U.S. government once more 
placed in the middle—with enhanced prestige! 


2.3.3. Misrepresentation of 
Romero’s views 

As we noted earlier, Romero was unequivocal in laying the blame for 
the violence in El Salvador on the army and security forces, and he 
viewed the left and popular groupings as victims provoked into self-
