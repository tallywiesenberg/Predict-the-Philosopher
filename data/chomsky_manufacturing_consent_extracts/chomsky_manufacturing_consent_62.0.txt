Kirkpatrick, “U.S.Security and Latin America,” Commentary (January 1981).7.Washington Post, May 21,1987.The “genocide” to which Buckley refers is 
“of the Miskito Indians,” of whom perhaps several dozen were killed by the 
Sandinistas in the context of attacks by U.S. mercenary forces, at a time when 
the U.S.-backed Guatemalan military were in the process of slaughtering tens 
of thousands of Indians, but not committing “genocide” by Buckley’s lights.
