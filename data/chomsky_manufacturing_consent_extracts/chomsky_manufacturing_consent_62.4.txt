2.In a letter of December 20, 1984, to one of his constituents who had 
complained of his gullibility as an observer, Brier asserted that his obligation 
was to report “observed election fraud, coercion of the voters, or denials of 
the right to vote....” On fundamental conditions, Brier wrote: “I made and 
make no statements concerning pre-election day freedom of speech, although 
the election I just witnessed in Guatemala would lead me to believe it existed 


because of the 14 to 16 different political parties and based on press accounts, 
we have been led to believe it does not exist in Nicaragua as they prepare for 
elections.” Actually, the occasional press accounts in the United States about 
state-organized murder in Guatemala might have alerted Brier to the possibil¬ 
ity of some constraints on freedom there, but he apparently asked no questions 
and did no reading up on the subject.
