His inference from numerous parties to 
freedom of speech is a non sequitur â€”an authoritarian and terror-ridden state 
can easily allow, and may even encourage, a proliferation of candidates within 
a prescribed political spectrum.Brier cites press accounts on constraints on 
freedom of speech in Nicaragua as if this is a relevant subject, but he failed 
to pursue the matter with regard to Guatemala.He also makes the patriotic 
assumption that press accounts in the United States about conditions in client 
and disfavored states are objective.Brier wears blinders in U.S.-sponsored 
elections that he is prepared to set aside in talking about the integrity of an 
election in an enemy state.This dichotomization is openly employed by the 
State Department, and was followed by Hedrick Smith, of the Times, and the 
media more generally, as we have seen.
