Brier distinguished himself as a member of the official delegation to the 
Philippines election of February 1986 won by Ferdinand Marcos by attacking 
the media’s focus on negatives like “violence, vote-buying and fraud,” with the 
result that “they missed entirely the fact that 20 million people conscientiously 
went to the polls without intimidation and wrote down their choice for Presi¬ 
dent” (Robert Pear, quoting Jack Brier, “U.S.Observers Disagree on Extent 
of Philippines Fraud,” New York Times, Feb. 12, 1986).Brier was so accus¬ 
tomed to focusing on the superficial in his apologies for client-state elections 
that he failed to grasp the fact that the administration’s line was in the process 
of shifting—which caused him some embarrassment a few days later, when the 
freedom-loving Marcos was escorted out of the country.3.He did not mention or attempt to evaluate actual institutions in Guatemala, 
such as the civil-defense patrols, nor did he or any other member of the 
observer team even mention the pacification program and killings of peasants, 
which had been the subject of innumerable reports.
