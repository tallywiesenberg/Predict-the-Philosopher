New England, 1977), pp.75,47.In fact, the “body count” was unknown, since 
much of the air and artillery barrage was directed against targets where casual¬

M. Kahin, Intervention: How America Became Involved in Vietnam (New York: 
Knopf, 1986), p. 536, on his falsification of the record concerning the suppres¬ 
sion of the Buddhist movement in Danang and Hue in 1966.
