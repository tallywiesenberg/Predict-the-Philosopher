As revealed, no doubt, by his book Viet Cong (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT 
Press, 1969), where he contrasts our side, which sympathizes with “the usual 
revolutionary stirrings... around the world,” with the backers of revolutionary 
guerrilla warfare, which “opposes the aspirations of people while apparently 
furthering them,” and expresses his contempt for the “gullible, misled people” 
who were “turning the countryside into a bedlam, toppling one Saigon govern¬ 
ment after another, confounding the Americans,” etc.The fact that Pike was 
an employee of the U.S. government and an “admirer” and avid defender of 
its policies does not suggest to Braestrup that he might be something other than 
“independent-minded”; only Porter’s alleged political preference is relevant to 
“Freedom House objectivity.”

Doubleday, 1971) and Stanley Karnow’s Vietnam: A History (New York: 
Viking, 1983), among others.
