Recall that “whatever losses the DRV/VC forces did suffer in the initial 
assaults were largely offset by the unimpeded recruiting that they conducted 
in the rural areas in the weeks that followed” (Wallace J. Thies, When Govern¬ 
ments Collide: Coercion and Diplomacy in the Vietnam Conflict, 1964-1968 
[Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980], p. 201); see p. 215, above, and 
General Wheeler’s comments, cited above, p. 225.7.See the reviews cited in chapter 5, note 1, for many further examples.
