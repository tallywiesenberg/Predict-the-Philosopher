office, also stated before a congressional committee in February 1984 
that “beyond any reasonable doubt” D’Aubuisson had “planned and 
ordered the assassination” of Archbishop Romero, and White gave 
details on the planning meeting and the subsequent execution of the 
trigger man to keep him quiet, 42 Further evidence of D’Aubuisson’s 
involvement in the murder came to light with the confession of Roberto 
Santivanez, a former high official in Salvadoran intelligence. According 
to Santivanez, the murder of Romero was planned and carried out by 
D’Aubuisson with the aid of former national guardsmen of Somoza, but 
“under the protection of General Garcia and Colonel Carranza.” 43 
Pyes’s and Becktund’s informants also indicated that D’Aubuisson was 
a subordinate and political ally of Carranza, who was the number two 
man in the Salvadoran military until his ouster under U.S. pressure in 
December 1980, Carranza then moved over to head the Treasury Police. 
D’Aubuisson also worked with the National Guard’s G-2 central intelli¬ 
gence office while the guard was headed by General Eugenio Vides 
Casanova, Pyes and Becklund write that “During the time Vides com¬ 
manded the Guard, active-duty military officers working with the G-2 
were linked in State Department cables to the March 1980 assassination 
of Archbishop Oscar Amulfo Romero... .’ >44 Note that Vides Casanova 
became minister of defense, the post he still holds, under the Duarte 
government. 

In short, there was substantial evidence concerning the identity of 
Romero’s murderers, and there were significant links of the murders to 
the highest officials of the Salvadoran military establishment. In fact, 
a judicial investigation in El Salvador headed by Judge Atilio Ramirez 
quickly pointed a finger at D’Aubuisson and General Medrano, a U.S. 
protege in El Salvador. But Ramirez soon fled the country after several 
threats and an attempt on his life, and active pursuit of the case in El 
Salvador ended. In exile. Judge Ramirez claimed that the criminal- 
investigation group of the police didn’t arrive at the scene of the crime 
till four days after it was committed, and that neither the police nor the 
attorney general provided his court with any evidence. He concluded 
that there was “undoubtedly” a “kind of conspiracy to cover up the 
murder” from the very beginning. 45 

Needless to say, Judge Ramirez’s testimony was not featured in the 
U.S. media, nor was the accumulating evidence of D’Aubuisson’s in¬ 
volvement given significant play. It was back-page material at best, 
treated matter-of-factly and never put in a framework of indignation 
and outrage by the use of emotive language or by asking allies of 
Romero to comment on the evidence, and it never elicited strident
