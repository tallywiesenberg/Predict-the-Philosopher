media did not focus on his record as the probable organizer of the 
murder of Archbishop Romero and as the acknowledged leader of the 
death squads and a mass murderer. Even the open anti-Semitism of this

Semite and professional assassin, who was suspected of having orga¬ 
nized the murder of Popieluszko in Poland, ran for office and became 
head of the Polish legislature, there might have been a raised eyebrow 
or two in the U.S. media. 

Throughout this period, media coverage adopted a central myth 
contrived by the government, and confined its reporting and interpreta¬ 
tion to its basic premises: the “moderate government” that we support 
is plagued by the terrorism of the extremists of the left and right, and 
is unable to bring it under control. The U.S. government and the media 
understood very well that the violence was overwhelmingly the respon¬ 
sibility of both the U.S.-backed security forces, which were, and re¬ 
main, the real power in the country, and the paramilitary network they 
created to terrorize the population. But this truth was inexpressible. To 
this day the media maintain the central myth of earlier years, long after 
having conceded quietly that it was a complete fabrication. Reporting 
on the prospects for peace in El Salvador, Lindsey Gruson comments 
that “Today, death squads of the right and left no longer terrorize the 
population into submission and silence,” thanks to the success of Presi¬ 
dent Duarte and his U.S. supporters in moving the country toward 
democracy—exactly as a propaganda model would predict. 48

SALVADORAN NATIONAL 
GUARDS’ MURDER OF THE 
FOUR U.S. 

CHURCHWOMEN AND 
ITS FOLLOW-UP 

On December 2, 1980, four U.S. churchwomen working in El Salva¬ 
dor—Maura Clarke, Jean Donovan, Ita Ford, and Dorothy Kazel— 
were seized, raped, and murdered by members of the Salvadoran 
National Guard. This crime was extremely inconvenient to the Carter 
administration, which was supporting the Salvadoran junta as an al¬ 
leged “reformist” government and trying to convince the public and 
Congress that that government was worthy of aid. While temporarily 
suspending military aid to El Salvador, the Carter administration 
sought a quick and low-keyed resolution of the case. It resumed aid at
