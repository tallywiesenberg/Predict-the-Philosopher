The difference between the murder of the four women and the 



worthy and unworthy victims 6i 


thousands of others uninvestigated and unresolved in El Salvador was 
that the families of these victims were Americans and pressed the case* 
eventually succeeding in getting Congress to focus on these particular 
murders as a test case and political symbol. This forced these killings 
onto the political agenda. A trial and convictions were ultimately re¬ 
quired as a condition for certification and aid to the military govern¬ 
ment of El Salvador. Both the Reagan administration and the 
Salvadoran military were thus obligated to “see justice done”—in this 
one instance. It took three-and-a-half years for justice to triumph in 
this one case* with a lid still kept on top-level involvement. It was a 
challenge to the mass media to present these murders* and the delayed 
and aborted outcome* in such a way as to keep indignation low and to 
downplay the quality of a system that murdered the women and had 
to be forced to find a set of low-level personnel guilty of the crime 
(which it took them years to do). The media met this challenge with 
flying colors. 


2,4,1* Details of the savagery 

The finding of Popieluszko's body was front-page news for the New 
York Times —in fact* the initial fa ilure to find his body made the front 
page—and in all the media publications analyzed here* the details of 
his seizure* the disposition of his body, and the nature of his wounds 
were recounted extensively and with barely concealed relish (see table 
2-2). These details were also repeated at every opportunity (and, most 
notably* at the trial). The finding of the bodies of the four women* by 
contrast, was a back-page item in the Times, and in all four of the media 
institutions in our sample the accounts of the violence done to the four 
murdered women were very succinct, omitted many details, and were 
not repeated after the initial disclosures. No attempt was made to 
reconstruct the scene with its agony and brutal violence* so that the 
drama conveyed in the accounts of Popieluszko’s murder was entirely 
missing. The murder of the four churchwomen was made remote and 
impersonal. 

The Time account, for example* after giving the names of the vic¬ 
tims* says, “Two of the women had been raped before being shot in the 
back of the head.” The New York Times account, shown in table 2-2, 
is also quite succinct. The Rogers Commission report pointed out that 
one of the victims had been shot through the back of the head with a 
weapon “that left exit wounds that destroyed her face.” The Rogers
