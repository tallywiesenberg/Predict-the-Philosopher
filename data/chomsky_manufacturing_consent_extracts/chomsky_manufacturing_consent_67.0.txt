2.4.2. Lack of indignation and 
insistent demands for justice 

In the Popieluszko case, the press conveyed the impression of intoler¬ 
able outrage that demanded immediate rectification. In the case of the 
murder of the four American women, while the media asserted and 
quoted government officials that this was a brutal and terrible act, it was 
not declared intolerable, and the media did not insist on (or quote 
people who demanded) justice. The media relied heavily r on "senior 
officials” of the U*S* and Salvadoran governments, who expressed a 
more resigned view of the situation and were prepared to allow the 
Salvadoran system of justice to work things out* Correspondingly, the 
media also moved into a philosophical vein—the women, as Time 
points out, were “victims of the mindless, increasing violence” of El 
Salvador (Dec, 15, 1980)* With Popieluszko, it was live government 
officials who committed the crime, not blind forces (that are hard to 
bring to book)* 

Even the funeral and memorial services for the women in the United 
Stares were not allowed to serve as an occasion for outrage and a 
demand for justice* For the most part, they were ignored and sup¬ 
pressed* The New York Times (Dec* 8,1981) gave a tiny, back-page, UPI 
account of the memorial service for Sister Dorothy Kazel, featuring the 
apolitical statement by Bishop Anthony M* Pilla that “The life of a 
missionary has never been easy or glamorous*” 

We must consider, too, that as Ambassador Kirkpatrick indicated, 
the victims may have been asking for it. As Newsweek observed (Dec, 
15,1980), “The violence in El Salvador is likely to focus with increasing 
ferocity on the Roman Catholic Church* Many priests and nuns advo¬ 
cate reform, and some of them are militant leftists* Such sentiments 
mean trouble, even for more moderate members of the clergy, 5 * (Note 
here also the impersonality of “the violence”—nowhere in the article 
is there a suggestion that the U*S.-backed government initiated, and 
was doing the bulk of, the murdering*) In the case of Popieluszko, by 
contrast, the media never once suggested that he was a regrettable 
victim of escalating conflict between the state and rebellious forces (or 
between East and West)* That situation was much simpler than the one 
in El Salvador: Popieluszko was murdered by officials of the state, and
