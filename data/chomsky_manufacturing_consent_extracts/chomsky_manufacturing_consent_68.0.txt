were part of the Polish government. In the case of the four American 
women, it was barely evident in the mass media that the killers had any 
connection with the Salvadoran government. This was in keeping with 
the basic myth, also consistently followed by the media, that the Sal¬ 
vadoran government was reformist and centrist, trying to control kill¬ 
ings by extremists of the right and left, 57 This fabrication allowed a 
two-track system of massive killing by the army and its affiliates and 
simultaneous claims of regret by the reformers unable to control the 
extremists. This was reminiscent of the heyday of mass murder in 
Argentina, when the New York Times regularly portrayed the junta and 
people like the recently convicted General Videla as moderates “unable 
to control the right-wing extremists" who were killing people. 58 

The most important goal of the immediate damage-containment 
process was to stifle any serious investigation of the responsibility of the 
officials of the Salvadoran government. The Salvadoran strategy was 
foot-dragging from beginning to end, as the idea of convicting soldiers 
for killing anybody was contrary to Salvadoran practice, and, moreover, 
there is little doubt that the responsibility for the crime went high. The 
U.S. official strategy, once it was clear that the National Guard was 
responsible for the killing, was to get the low-levei killers tried and 
convicted—necessary to vindicate the system of justice in El Salvador, 
at least to the extent of keeping the dollars flowing from Congress— 
while protecting the “reformers” at the top. On September 30, 1981, 
Ambassador Deane Hinton stated with assurance that the local national 
guardsmen “were acting on their own," although internal State Depart¬ 
ment documents of the time recognized that the Salvadoran investiga¬ 
tion had been a joke, and other evidence existed suggesting top-level 
involvement, 59 Nonetheless, the official position was clear. To go along 
with the official line, the mass media had to stop investigating high-level 
involvement and even to suppress evidence emerging from other 
sources. And so they proceeded to do this. 

After a two-month investigation of the murders, the reporter John 
Dinges filed a story through Pacific News Service that showed the 
murders to have been preplanned in some detail, 60 First, there were 
intercepted radio communications indicating military discussions of the 
arrival of the women at the airport, and other evidence of close surveil¬ 
lance of their flight plans, all suggesting a coordinated and extensive 
military operation. Second, a former deputy minister of planning de¬ 
scribed to Dinges a half-hour presentation by Salvadoran Defense 
Minister Guillermo Garcia in the national palace, denouncing the nuns 
and priests in the very area of the murders and stating that something 
must be done, only two weeks prior to the murders.
