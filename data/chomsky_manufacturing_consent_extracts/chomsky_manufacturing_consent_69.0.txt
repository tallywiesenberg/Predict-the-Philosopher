WORTHY AND UNWORTHY VICTIMS 67 


and they generally transmitted Salvadoran and U.S. government claims 
about the state of the process without sarcasm or expressions of out¬ 
rage, If they had given full details, the Salvadoran government would 
have been thoroughly discredited. Thus, the extensive evidence con¬ 
cerning official Salvadoran refusals to take action or to interrogate 
relevant witnesses, and concerning threats to witnesses, lawyers, and 
judges—which would have been aired with delight if applicable to a 
Polish investigation—were ignored. 

A few illustrations of the Salvadoran proceedings will have to suffice 
here* Two years after the crime, for example, 

. * . the prosecutors expressed ignorance of the testimony [in the 
court record] of former guardsman Cesar Valle Espinoza, dated 
August 9, 1982, which quotes Subsergeant Colindres Aleman as 
stating on December 2,1980, that there were “superior orders” to 
apprehend the women. They were also ignorant of the statement 
of former National Guard Sergeant Dagoberto Martinez, taken by 
the FBI in Los Angeles, California, which establishes the exis¬ 
tence of a cover-up of the crime as early as December 1980. 64 

A second illustration of the process: two of three judges assigned to the 
case resigned for fear of their lives. As we noted, Judge Ramirez, who 
was investigating the Romero murder, fled for the same reason. This 
line of evidence has cumulative weight, but it was never treated as a 
whole by the press (and was barely mentioned as individual items of 
back-page news). A third illustration: according to former ambassador 
Robert White, two national guardsmen who might have been able to 
link higher-ranking officers to the murders of the women were killed 
by military death squads, then listed as missing in action. 65 A final 
illustration: when the Salvadoran triggermen were finally assigned at¬ 
torneys, one of the three, Salvador Antonio Ibarra, was prepared to 
defend the men seriously. His colleagues pressed Ibarra to abide by the 
statement that “the possibility of a cover-up had been thoroughly 
investigated” and rejected. He refused to go along with this request, 
with the consequence that on October 30,1983, Ibarra was seized by the 
National Guard and tortured at its headquarters. 66 Released only under 
U.S. pressure, Ibarra fled the country, leaving the way clear for a lawyer 
team that would accept the notion that there had been a “thorough 
investigation” of top-level involvement. This last incident alone made 
it into the mass media in isolated and fleeting treatment; the others, and 
the package, were not featured in the free press. 

The U.S. government also engaged in a systematic cover-up—of
