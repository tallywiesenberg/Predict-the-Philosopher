I* Mainstream media used in this tabulation* based on a Nexus database 
searchj were the Los Angeles Times y the New York Times, Washington Post , 
Newsweek, and Time.

which also includes letters* “World Briefings*” and summary items. 


The table shows that the five major print media surveyed engage in a 
similar biased usage, frequently using “genocide” to describe victimiza¬ 
tion in the enemy states, but applying the word far less frequently to 
equally severe victimization carried out by the United States or its allies 
and clients. We can even read who are U.S. friends and enemies from the 
media’s use of the word* Thus, with the United States and its NATO 
allies warring against Yugoslavia in 1999 , allegedly in response to that 
country’s mistreatment of the Kosovo Albanians, official denunciations 
of that mistreatment flowed through the media, along with the repeated 
designation ofthe abuses as “genocidal . 55 The same pattern applies to the 
Iraqi regime's abuse of its Kurdish population—after it had ceased to be a 
U*S* ally 29 —an enemy state, official denunciations, harsh sanctions, and 
parallel media treatment.
