This is one of 
the strengths of the tLS* system.It is possible that the volume of 
inconvenient facts can expand, as it did during the Vietnam War, in 
response to the growth of a critical constituency (which included elite 
elements from 1968)* Even in this exceptional case, however, it was very 
rare for news and commentary to find their way into the mass media 
if they failed to conform to the framework of established dogma (post¬ 
ulating benevolent U.S* aims, the United States responding to aggres¬ 
sion and terror, etc,), as we discuss in chapter 5* During and after the 
Vietnam War, apologists for state policy commonly pointed to the 
inconvenient facts, the periodic “pessimism” of media pundits, and the 
debates over tactics as showing that the media were “adversarial” and 
even “lost” the war.These allegations are ludicrous, as we show in 
detail in chapter 5 and appendix 3, but they did have the dual advantage 
of disguising the actual role of the mass media and, at the same time, 
pressing the media to keep even more tenaciously to the propaganda 
assumptions of state policy.We have long argued that the “naturalness” 
of these processes, with inconvenient facts allowed sparingly and within 
the proper framework of assumptions, and fundamental dissent virtu¬ 
ally excluded from the mass media (but permitted in a marginalized 
press), makes for a propaganda system that is far more credible and 
effective in putting over a patriotic agenda than one with official censor¬ 
ship.In criticizing media priorities and biases we often draw on the media 
themselves for at least some of the facts.
