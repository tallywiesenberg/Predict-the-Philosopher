One of our central themes in this book is that the observable pattern 
of indignant campaigns and suppressions, of shading and emphasis, and 
of selection of context, premises, and general agenda, is highly func¬ 
tional for established power and responsive to the needs of the govern¬ 
ment and major power groups.A constant focus on victims of 
communism helps convince the public of enemy evil and sets the stage 
for intervention, subversion, support for terrorist states, an endless 
arms race, and military conflict—all in a noble cause.At the same time, 
the devotion of our leaders and media to this narrow set of victims 
raises public self-esteem and patriotism, as it demonstrates the essential 
humanity of country and people.The public does not notice the silence on victims in client states, 
which is as important in supporting state policy as the concentrated 
focus on enemy victims.It would have been very difficult for the 
Guatemalan government to murder tens of thousands over the past 
decade if the U.S. press had provided the kind of coverage they gave 
to the difficulties of Andrei Sakharov or the murder of Jerzy Popie- 
luszko in Poland (see chapter 2).
