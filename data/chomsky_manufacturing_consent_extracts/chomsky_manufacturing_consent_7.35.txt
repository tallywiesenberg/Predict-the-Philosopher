What is not evident (and remains

undiscussed in the media) is the limited nature of such critiques, as well 
as the huge inequality in command of resources, and its effect both on 
access to a private media system and on its behavior and performance* 

A propaganda model focuses on this inequality of wealth and power 
and its multilevel effects on mass-media interests and choices* It traces 
the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news 
fit to print, marginalize dissent, and allow the government and domi¬ 
nant private interests to get their messages across to the public* The 
essential ingredients of our propaganda model, or set of news “filters,” 
fall under the following headings: (i) the size, concentrated ownership, 
owner wealth, and profit orientation of the dominant mass-media firms; 
(2) advertising as the primary income source of the mass media; (3) the 
reliance of the media on information provided by government, business, 
and “experts” funded and approved by these primary sources and 
agents of power; (4) “flak” as a means of disciplining the media; and 
(5) “anticommunism” as a national religion and control mechanism.These elements interact with and reinforce one another* The raw mate¬ 
rial of news must pass through successive filters, leaving only the 
cleansed residue fit to print* They fix the premises of discourse and 
interpretation, and the definition of what is newsworthy in the first 
place, and they explain the basis and operations of what amount to 
propaganda campaigns* 

The elite domination of the media and marginalization of dissi¬ 
dents that results from the operation of these filters occurs so natu¬ 
rally that media news people, frequently operating with complete 
integrity and goodwill, are able to convince themselves that they 
choose and interpret the news “objectively” and on the basis of pro¬ 
fessional news values.Within the limits of the filter constraints they 
often are objective; the constraints are so powerful, and are built into 
the system in such a fundamental way, that alternative bases of news 
choices are hardly imaginable.In assessing the newsworthiness of the 
U,S* government's urgent claims of a shipment of MIGs to Nicaragua 
on November 5, 1984, the media do not stop to ponder the bias that 
is inherent in the priority assigned to government-supplied raw mate¬ 
rial, or the possibility that the government might be manipulating the 
news, 2 imposing its own agenda, and deliberately diverting attention 
from other material.3 It requires a macro, alongside a micro- (story- 
by-story), view of media operations, to see the pattern of manipula¬ 
tion and systematic bias.
