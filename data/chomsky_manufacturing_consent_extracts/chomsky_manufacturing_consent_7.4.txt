Let us turn now to a more detailed examination of the main constitu¬ 
ents of the propaganda model, which will be applied and tested in the 
chapters that follow.A PROPAGANDA MODEL 3

PROFIT ORIENTATION OF 
THE MASS MEDIA: 

THE FIRST FILTER 

In their analysis of the evolution of the media in Great Britain, James 
Curran and Jean Seaton describe how, in the first half of the nineteenth 
century, a radical press emerged that reached a national working-class 
audience.This alternative press was effective in reinforcing class con¬ 
sciousness: it unified the workers because it fostered an alternative 
value system and framework for looking at the world, and because it 
“promoted a greater collective confidence by repeatedly emphasizing 
the potential power of working people to effect social change through 
the force of ^combination 5 and organized action* 554 This was deemed a 
major threat by the ruling elites* One MP asserted that the working- 
class newspapers “inflame passions and awaken their selfishness, con¬ 
trasting their current condition with what they contend to be their 
future condition—a condition incompatible with human nature, and 
those immutable laws which Providence has established for the regula¬ 
tion of civil society.” 5 The result was an attempt to squelch the work¬ 
ing-class media by libel laws and prosecutions, by requiring an 
expensive security bond as a condition for publication, and by imposing 
various taxes designed to drive out radical media by raising their costs.These coercive efforts were not effective, and by mid-century they had 
been abandoned in favor of the liberal view that the market would 
enforce responsibility* 

Curran and Seaton show that the market did successfully accomplish 
what state intervention failed to do.Following the repeal of the punitive 
taxes on newspapers between 1853 and 1869, a new daily local press 
came into existence, but not one new local working-class daily was 
established through the rest of the nineteenth century, Curran and 
Seaton note that 

Indeed, the eclipse of the national radical press was so total that 
when the Labour Party developed out of the working-class move¬ 
ment in the first decade of the twentieth century, it did not obtain 
the exclusive backing of a single national daily or Sunday paper, 6 

One important reason for this was the rise in scale of newspaper enter¬ 
prise and the associated increase in capital costs from the mid- 
nineteenth century onward, which was based on technological
