The expansion of the free market was accompanied by an 
“industrialization of the press.” The total cost of establishing a national 
weekly on a profitable basis in 1837 was under a thousand pounds* with 
a break-even circulation of 6*200 copies.By 1867* the estimated start-up 
cost of a new London daily was 50*000 pounds.The Sunday Express, 
launched in 1918* spent over two million pounds before it broke even 
with a circulation of over 250,0007 

Similar processes were at work in the United States* where the 
start-up cost of a new paper in New York City in 1851 was $69*000; the 
public sale of the Sr. Louis Democrat in 1872 yielded $456*000; and city 
newspapers were selling at from $6 to $18 million in the 1920s.8 The cost 
of machinery alone* of even very small newspapers* has for many 
decades run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars; in 1945 it could 
be said that “Even small-newspaper publishing is big business ... [and] 
is no longer a trade one takes up lightly even if he has substantial 
cash—or takes up at all if he doesn't.” 9 

Thus the first filter—the limitation on ownership of media with any 
substantial outreach by the requisite large size of investment—was 
applicable a century or more ago* and it has become increasingly effec¬ 
tive over time.10 In 1986 there were some 1*500 daily newspapers, 11*000 
magazines* 9,000 radio and 1*500 TV stations, 2*400 book publishers, 
and seven movie studios in the United States—over 25,000 media 
entities in all.
