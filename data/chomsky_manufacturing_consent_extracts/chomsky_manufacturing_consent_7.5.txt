But a large proportion of those among this set who were 
news dispensers were very small and local, dependent on the large 
national companies and wire services for all but local news.Many more 
were subject to common ownership* sometimes extending through vir¬ 
tually the entire set of media variants.11 

Ben Bagdikian stresses the fact that despite the large media numbers, 
the twenty-nine largest media systems account for over half of the 
output of newspapers* and most of the sales and audiences in maga¬ 
zines, broadcasting* books, and movies.He contends that these “consti¬ 
tute a new Private Ministry of Information and Culture” that can set 
the national agenda.12 

Actually* while suggesting a media autonomy from corporate and 
government power that we believe to be incompatible with structural 
facts (as we describe below), Bagdikian also may be understating the 
degree of effective concentration in news manufacture.
