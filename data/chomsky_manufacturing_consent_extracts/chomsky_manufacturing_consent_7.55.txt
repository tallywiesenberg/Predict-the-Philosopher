It has long been 
noted that the media are tiered, with the top tier—as measured by 
prestige* resources* and outreach—comprising somewhere between ten 
and twenty-four systems, 13 It is this top tier* along with the government 
and wire services* that defines the news agenda and supplies much of

the national and international news to the lower tiers of the media* and 
thus for the general public, 14 Centralization within the top tier was 
substantially increased by the post-World War II rise of television and 
the national networking of this important medium.Pre-television news 
markets were local* even if heavily dependent on the higher tiers and 
a narrow set of sources for national and international news; the net¬ 
works provide national and international news from three national 
sources* and television is now the principal source of news for the 
public.15 The maturing of cable, however* has resulted in a fragmenta¬ 
tion of television audiences and a slow erosion of the market share and 
power of the networks.Table 1-1 provides some basic financial data for the twenty-four 
media giants (or their controlling parent companies) that make up the 
top tier of media companies in the United States.16 This compilation 
includes: (i) the three television networks: ABC (through its parent, 
Capital Cities), CBS* and NBC (through its ultimate parent, General 
Electric [GE]); (2) the leading newspaper empires: New York Time$> 
Washington Pasty Los Angeles Times (Times-Mirror)* Wall Street Journal 
(Dow Jones)* Kmght-Ridder, Gannett, Hearst* Scripps-Howard, New- 
house (Advance Publications), and the Tribune Company; (3) the major 
news and general-interest magazines: Time, Newsweek (subsumed 
under Washington Post), Reader^ Digest, TV Guide (Triangle)* and U.S, 
News 6 s World Report ; (4) a major book publisher (McGraw-Hill); and 
(5) other cable-TV systems of large and growing importance: those of 
Murdoch* Turner, Cox, General Corp., Taft, Storer* 17 and Group W
