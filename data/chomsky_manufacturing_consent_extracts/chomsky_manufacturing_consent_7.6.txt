Many of these systems are prominent in more than one 
field and are only arbitrarily placed in a particular category (Time, Inc.* 
is very important in cable as well as magazines; McGraw-Hill is a major 
publisher of magazines; the Tribune Company has become a large force 
in television as well as newspapers; Hearst is important in magazines 
as well as newspapers; and Murdoch has significant newspaper interests 
as well as television and movie holdings).These twenty-four companies are large, profit-seeking corporations, 
owned and controlled by quite wealthy people.It can be seen in table 
i-i that all but one of the top companies for whom data are available 
have assets in excess of $1 billion, and the median size (middle item by 
size) is $2,6 billion.It can also be seen in the table that approximately 
three-quarters of these media giants had after-tax profits in excess of 
$100 million, with the median at $183 million.Many of the large media companies are fully integrated into the 
market, and for the others, too, the pressures of stockholders, directors, 
and bankers to focus on the bottom line are powerful.
