The larger the firm and the more widely 
distributed the stock, the larger the number and proportion of outside 
directors.The composition of the outside directors of the media giants 
is very similar to that of large non-media corporations.Table 1-3 shows 
that active corporate executives and bankers together account for a 
little over half the total of the outside directors of ten media giants; and 
the lawyers and corporate-banker retirees (who account for nine of the 
thirteen under “Retired”) push the corporate total to about two-thirds 
of the outside-director aggregate.These 95 outside directors had direc¬ 
torships in an additional 36 banks and 255 other companies (aside from 
the media company and their own firm of primary affiliation).26 

In addition to these board linkages, the large media companies all do 
business with commercial and investment bankers, obtaining lines of 
credit and loans, and receiving advice and service in selling stock and 
bond issues and in dealing with acquisition opportunities and takeover 
threats.
