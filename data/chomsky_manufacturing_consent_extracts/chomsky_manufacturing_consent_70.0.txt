both the Salvadoran cover-up and the facts of the case. The U.S. mass 
media, while briefly noting the Salvadoran stonewalling, failed to call 
attention to the equally important lies and suppressions of their own 
government As we have pointed out, both the Carter and Reagan 
administrations put protection of its client above the quest for justice 
for four U.S. citizens murdered by agents of that government. The U.S. 
government’s stonewalling to protect its client took many forms. One 
was an active collaboration in the Salvadoran cover-up. Former Na¬ 
tional Guard sergeant Dagoberto Martinez was allowed to emigrate to 
the United States in December 1980, and although a subsequent inter¬ 
view by the FBI indicated that Martinez admitted knowledge of the 
perpetrators of the crime and a failure to report that information—in 
violation of Salvadoran law—no action was taken against him. U.S. 
officials also reiterated that there was no reason to believe that higher- 
level officials knew about the crime or participated in it, when they had 
clear knowledge of a cover-up and a refusal to investigate. 67 The State 
Department also regularly lied about the thoroughness of the investiga¬ 
tion. Ambassador Hinton stated in public that national guardsman 
Perez Nieto “was thoroughly interrogated and repeatedly denied that 
anyone superior to him had ordered him to watch the women.” A State 
Department cable, however, describes Nieto’s testimony as “incom¬ 
plete, evasive, and uncooperative.” 68 

A second form of official U.S. participation in the cover-up was a 
refusal to make public information on the Salvadoran investigation and 
evidence uncovered by the United States itself. The Rogers report was 
released belatedly, in a version that edited out the original report’s 
statement about the sad state of the Salvadoran system of justice. In 
response to a growing chorus of criticism of the delays, Judge Harold 
R. Tyler was appointed by the U.S. government to carry out a further 
investigation. His report was kept under wraps for a long time, again 
apparently because it had some serious criticism of the Salvadoran 
judicial process that would have interfered with Reagan administration 
plans to claim progress every time such certification was required. 69 
The families of the victims and their attorneys regularly found the U.S. 
government unwilling to release information on the case. The argument 
given was that the information was sensitive, and that releasing it would 
interfere with the legal process in El Salvador. As the Salvadoran 
process was a sick joke, moving only in response to U.S. threats, the 
official rationale was transparently fraudulent. Furthermore, Duarte 
was regularly making statements that the arrested guardsmen were 
surely guilty, and that nobody higher than them was involved, which
