assistance since that time, has been permanent state terror. With 
Guatemala, the United States invented the “counterinsurgency state. 55 

The special role of the army in the counterinsurgency state gradually 
elevated its status and power, and evenrually gave it the institutional 
capacity to rule Guatemala. As in many U.S. client states, the military 
used its power to carve out economic opportunities and to steal, directly 
or indirectly, 80 The terrorism, thievery, and autonomy of the Guatema¬ 
lan military reached a temporary peak—later surpassed by Rios 
Montt—during the reign of Lucas Garcia (1978-82), This overlapped 
the brief interlude of the Carter human-rights policy, during which 
there was open criticism of the Guatemalan government and a brief and 
partial cutoff of arms supply from the United States under congressio¬ 
nal pressure. 31 Even during the Carter years, however, relations with 
Guatemala were not hostile—it was as if a child in the family were 
naughty and briefly put in the comer. Part of the reason for the willing¬ 
ness of the Carter government to provide no new arms supplies was that 
the bad boy was in no danger. In El Salvador in 1980, by contrast, where 
the Carter administration saw the possibility of a left-wing victory, 
support was quickly forthcoming to a right-wing terror regime. 

During the Reagan years, the number of civilians murdered in 
Guatemala ran into the tens of thousands, and disappearances and 
mutilated bodies were a daily occurrence. 82 Studies by Amnesty Inter¬ 
national (AI), Americas Watch (AW), and other human-rights monitors 
have documented a military machine run amok, with the indiscriminate 
killing of peasants (including vast numbers of women and children), the 
forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of farmers and villagers 
into virtual concentration camps, and the enlistment of many hundreds 
of thousands in compulsory civil patrols, 83 Reagan, however, visiting 
Guatemala in December 1982, commented that head of state Rios 
Montt was “totally committed to democracy” and was receiving a “bum 
rap” on hum an-rights abuses. Two months earlier, AI released its re¬ 
port describing sixty different Indian villages in which massacres of 
civilians took place in a three-month period, with the total killed ex¬ 
ceeding 2,5 oo, 84 

The Reagan policy toward Guatemala was, as with South Africa, 
“constructive engagement.” 85 From the beginning, the administration 
strove to embrace and provide arms to the military governments. Ongo¬ 
ing mass murder was merely an inconvenience. One method by which 
the administration sought to rehabilitate our relations with the
