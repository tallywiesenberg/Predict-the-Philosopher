deteriorates ex post facto and looks most unfavorable compared with 
the humanistic and sensitive one now in power! This droll pattern of 
identical apologetics for each successor terrorist, and ex post denigra¬ 
tion of the one ousted, is an Orwellian process that the Western press 
associates with totalitarian states, but it happens here. And it can only 
occur if the mass media are cooperative. They must be willing to 
downplay or ignore the large-scale murders going on in Guatemala in 
the first place. In that context, the serial apologetics, the lies defending 
each murderer, and the mind-boggling hypocrisy will hardly be news¬ 
worthy. 

Given the U,S. role in originating and sustaining the Guatemalan 
counterinsurgency state, and the fact that that state is dedicated to 
blocking the growth of popular organizations (i.e., “anti-Communist” 
in Orwellian rhetoric) and has a strong U.S. business presence, a propa¬ 
ganda model would anticipate a lack of media interest in its “unworthy” 
victims and an evasion of the U.S. role in its evolution and practices. 
We would expect reports on Guatemala put out by Amnesty Interna¬ 
tional and other human-rights groups to be downplayed or ignored, 
despite their spectacular data and horrifying stories. This is a strong test 
of the model, as the number of civilians murdered between 1978 and 
1985 may have approached 100,000, with a style of killing reminiscent 
of Pol Pot. As AI pointed out in 1981: 

The bodies of the victims have been found piled up in ravines, 
dumped at roadsides or buried in mass graves. Thousands bore the 
scars of torture, and death had come to most by strangling with 
a garrotte, by being suffocated in rubber hoods or by being shot 
in the head, 90 

The expectations of a propaganda model are fully realized in this case. 
Referring to our table 2-1 comparison of media treatment of twenty- 
three religious victims in Guatemala with the coverage accorded Fopie- 
luszko, only four of the twenty-three were ever mentioned by name in 
our media sample, and the twenty-three taken together had approxi¬ 
mately one-twentieth of the space in the New York Times that the 
newspaper of record gave to Popieluszko. In the case ^f the murder in 
Guatemala of the American priest Rev. Stanley Rothcr, the New York 
Times reported on August 5,1981, in a tiny back-page article, that three 
men had been arrested for questioning in the shooting. What was the 
outcome of the arrests? Were the arrested persons tried? Readers of the 
Times will never know, and the Guatemalan government did not have

to suffer the embarrassment and pressure of the press raising questions 
in this or any of the remaining twenty-two Guatemalan cases.
