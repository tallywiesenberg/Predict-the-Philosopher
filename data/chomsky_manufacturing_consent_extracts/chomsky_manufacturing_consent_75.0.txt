As we discussed in chapter i, the government is a primary flak 
producer as well as information source. This Guatemala episode is an 
important illustration of the government’s efforts to silence competing 
sources of information. It is interesting that the New York Times never 
mentioned or criticized this sinister campaign, even though it was 
carried out in the context of a policy protecting mass murderers. We 
will see in the next chapter that Time magazine cooperated with the 
campaign, citing Americas Watch only once on Guatemala, but with the 
qualifying explanation that it is “a controversial group that is often 
accused of being too sympathetic to the left 5 * (the State Department, 
on which Time relies very heavily, is never subject to any adjective 
suggesting any bias). The Washington Post (Dec. 4, 1982) had one 
back-page article by Terri Shaw, on the Enders letter, which features 
the State Department charges in the title—“Embassy Sees ‘Disinfor¬ 
mation’ on Guatemala: U.S, Report Says Rights Groups are Used”— 
and in the text. The author allows the embassy claim that “the report 
never was meant to be made public” to stand unchallenged, and never 
refers to the threat posed to human-rights monitors by the release of 
such State Department charges. The human-rights groups are allowed 
to suggest a State Department intent to discredit, but the word “disin¬ 
formation” is never applied to State Department allegations, and no 
serious examination of the content of those charges is provided. This 
superficial piece exhausts the sample media’s coverage of this State 
Department campaign. The AW report Human Rights in Guatemala: No 
Neutrab Allowed, which discusses this campaign and the Enders letter, 
was never mentioned. 


2*6* THE MUTUAL SUPPORT 
GROUP MURDERS IN 
GUATEMALA 

Human-rights monitoring and protective agencies have had a very 
difficult time organizing and surviving in the “death-squad democ¬ 
racies” of El Salvador and Guatemala. Between October 1980 and 
March 1983, five officials of the Human Rights Commission of El Salva¬ 
dor were seized and murdered by the security forces. In accord with

a propaganda models these murders should have been of little interest 
to the U.S. mass media, and this expectation is borne out by evidence. 
As an illustrative comparison, the New York Times had a grand total of 
four back-page articles on these five murders, 96 whereas, during the 
same period, the Times had thirty-five articles on the Soviet human- 
rights activist Natan Sharansky, not all of them on the back pages. The
