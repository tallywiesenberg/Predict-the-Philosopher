Guatemala has been even more inhospitable to human-rights organi¬ 
zations than El Salvador, Guatemalan Archbishop Monsignor Prospero 
Penados del Barrio asserted in 1984 that “It is impossible for a human 
rights office to exist in Guatemala at the present time.” 97 “Disappear¬ 
ances” as an institutional form began in Guatemala in the mid-1960s 
and eventually reached levels unique in the Western Hemisphere, with 
the total estimated to be some 40,ooo. 9S Protest groups that have 
formed to seek information and legal redress have been consistently 
driven out of business by state-organized murder. The Association of 
University Students (AEU) sought information on the disappeared 
through the courts in the course of a brief opening in 1966, but after 
one sensational expose of the police murder of twenty-eight leftists, the 
system closed down again. As McClintock points out, “In the next few 
years many AEU leaders and member law students were hunted down 
and killed.” 99 In the 1970s, a Committee of the Relatives of the Disap¬ 
peared was organized by the AEU, with headquarters in San Carlos 
National University. As Americas Watch points out, “It disbanded after 
plainsclothesmen walked into the University's legal aid center on 
March 10, 1974, and shot and killed i:z principal organizer, lawyer 
Edmundo Guerra Theilheimer, the center's director.” 100 Another 
human-rights group, the National Commission for Human Rights, was 
created in the late 1970s by psychologist and journalist Irma Flaquer. 
Her son was murdered, and she herself “disappeared” on October 16, 
1980. 

According to the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group, in 
1984 alone there were an average of one hundred political murders and 
over forty disappearances per month in Guatemala. 101 These figures are 
almost surely an underestimate, as only the disappearances that took 
place in and around Guatemala City received any publicity. The greater 
number of murders and disappearances occur among rural and Indian 
families who do not have the resources to complain and are more 
exposed to retaliation. 

In this context of murder, fear, and the prior failure of all human- 
rights organizations, the Mutual Support Group, or GAM, was formed

in June 1984. It was a product of the desperation felt by people seeking 
information on the whereabouts of disappeared relatives and willing to 
take serious risks to that end. Many of them had suffered enormous 
pain in frustrating searches and inquiries that never bore fruit* There 
is no legal redress in Guatemala, and nothing useful can be obtained 
by appeals to the police or courts of law. Mr. Hicho, looking for his
