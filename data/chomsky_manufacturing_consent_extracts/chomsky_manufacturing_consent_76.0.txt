disappeared daughter, saw some one hundred bodies in the months he 
spent at the morgue, and “seventy to seventy-five percent of them had 
been tortured. 15102 Others took different painful routes in their search* 
In early 1985, one woman was told by an army officer that her husband

The intention of the organizers of GAM was to seek strength by 
collective action, and to use it to gather data and seek redress by 
petition and publicity* Their hope for survival and success rested, in 
part, on the fact that the chief of state, Mejia Victores, was being built 
up by the Reagan administration as another “reformer, 11 and the Rea¬ 
gan—Mejia Victores ream was trying to establish the appropriate

support within Guatemala from Archbishop Penados del Barrio and 
other church groups and lay persons, although few felt able to speak

Thirty members of the newly organized GAM held a press confer¬

the disappeared at the cathedral—the first mass demonstration in 
Guatemala since May 1,1980 (at which time protestors were seized on 
the streets and an estimated one hundred were assassinated, or disap¬
