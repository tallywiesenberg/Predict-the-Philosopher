was unassailable; and the crimes they suffered were more savage than 
those undergone by Popieluszko. Most important of all, these were 
crimes for which we bear considerable responsibility, since they were 
perpetrated by clients who depend on our support, so that exposure and 
pressure could have a significant effect in safeguarding human rights. 
On the other hand, the Reagan administration was busily trying to enter 
into warmer and more supportive relations with the Guatemalan mili¬ 
tary regime and, as we described earlier, was going to great pains to put 
the regime in a favorable light. A propaganda model would anticipate 
that even these dramatic and horrifying murders would be treated in 
a low-key manner and quickly dropped by the mass media—that, unlike 
Popieluszko, there would be no sustained interest, no indignation capa¬ 
ble of rousing the public (and disturbing the administration’s plans). 
These expectations are fully vindicated by the record. 

Table 2-3 compares media coverage of the Popieluszko case with that 
of the murders of the GAM leaders. It is immediately obvious that the 
treatment is radically different in the two cases. The GAM murders 
couldn’t even make “the news” at Time, Newsweek, or CBS News, The 
New York Times never found these murders worthy of the front page 
or editorial comment, and we can see that the intensity of its coverage 
was slight. The first report of the quadruple murder was on April 7, 
1985, in a tiny item on page 5 of the paper in which it is mentioned that 
the body of Maria Rosario Godoy de Cuevas was found in her car in 
a ravine, along with the bodies of her brother and her young son. In 
neither this item nor any succeeding article does the Times provide 
details on the condition of the bodies, or mention that the two-year-old 
child had his fingernails tom out. 109 

In other respects, too, the Times articles, all written by Stephen 
Kinzer, generally employ an apologetic framework. That is, they don’t 
focus on the murders—who the victims were, the details of the vio¬ 
lence, who did it, why, and the institutional structures and roots of 
organized murder of which these are an obvious part. With Popie¬ 
luszko, these were the issues. Kinzer has little or nothing on the details 
of the GAM murders and very little on the victims and the experiences 
that brought them to GAM, and the question of who did it and what 
was being done (or not done) to bring the murderers to justice he hardly 
considers. Kinzer takes it for granted that the murders were committed 
by agents of the state, but he doesn’t say this explicitly, or discuss the
