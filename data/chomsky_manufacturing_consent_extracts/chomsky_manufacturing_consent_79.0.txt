destabilize and overthrow. The U.S. government therefore went to 
great pains to cast the Nicaraguan election in an unfavorable light, 

A propaganda model would anticipate mass-media support of the 
state perspective and agenda. That is* the favored elections will be 
found to legitimize* no matter what the facts; the disfavored election 
will be found deficient, farcical* and failing to legitimize—again* irre¬ 
spective of facts. What makes this another strong test of a propaganda 
model is that the Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections of 1982 and 
1984—85 were held under conditions of severe* ongoing state terror 
against the civilian population, whereas in Nicaragua this was not the 
case. To find the former elections legitimizing and the Nicaraguan 
election a farce* the media would have had to use different standards 
of evaluation in the two sets of cases* and, more specifically* it would 
have been necessary for them to avoid discussing state terror and other 
basic electoral conditions in the Salvadoran and Guatemalan elections. 
As we will see* the media fulfilled these requirements and met the needs 
of the state to a remarkable degree. 

In order to demonstrate the applicability of a propaganda model in 
these cases* we will first describe the election-propaganda framework 
that the U.S. government tried to foist on the media; we will then 
review the basic electoral conditions under which elections were held 
in the three countries; and finally* we will examine how the U.S. mass 
media treated each of the three elections. 


3*1. ELECTION-PROPAGANDA 
FRAMEWORKS 

The U.S. government has employed a number of devices in its spon¬ 
sored elections to put them in a favorable light- It has also had an 
identifiable agenda of issues that it wants stressed, as well as others it 
wants ignored or downplayed- Central to demonstration-election man¬ 
agement has been the manipulation of symbols and agenda to give the 
favored election a positive image. The sponsor government tries to 
associate the election with the happy word “democracy” and the mili¬ 
tary regime it backs with support of the elections (and hence democ¬ 
racy). It emphasizes what a wonderful thing it is to be able to hold any 
election at all under conditions of internal conflict, and it makes it
