The refusal of the rebel opposition to participate in the election is 
portrayed as a rejection of democracy and proof of its antidemocratic 
tendencies, although the ver y plan of the election involves the rebels* 
exclusion from the ballot* 2 The sponsor government also seizes upon 
any rebel statements urging nonparticipation or threatening to disrupt 
the election* These are used to transform the election into a dramatic 
struggle between, on the one side, the “born-again” democratic army 
and people struggling to vote for “peace,” and, on the other, the rebels 
opposing democracy, peace, and the right to vote* Thus the dramatic 
denouement of the election is voter turnout, which measures the ability 
of the forces of democracy and peace (the army) to overcome rebel 
threats* 

Official observers are dispatched to the election scene to assure its 
public-relations success. Nominally, their role is to see that the election 
is “fair,” Their real function, however, is to provide the appearance of 
fairness by focusing on the government's agenda and by channeling 
press attention to a reliable source* 3 They testify to fairness on the basis 
of long lines, smiling faces, no beatings in their presence, and the 
assurances and enthusiasm of U.S* and client-state officials* 4 But these 
superficialities are entirely consistent with a staged fraud* Fairness 
depends on fundamental conditions established in advance, which are 
virtually impossible to ascertain under the brief, guided-tour conditions 
of official observers. Furthermore, official observers in sponsored elec¬ 
tions rarely ask the relevant questions* 5 They are able to perform their 
public-relations function because the government chooses observers 
who are reliable supporters of its aims and publicizes their role, and the 
press gives them respectful attention* 6 

“Off the agenda” for the government in its own sponsored elections 
are all of the basic parameters that make an election meaningful or 
meaningless prior to the election-day proceedings. These include: (i) 
freedom of speech and assembly; (2) freedom of the press; (3) freedom 
to organize and maintain intermediate economic, social, and political 
groups (unions, peasant organizations, political clubs, student and 
teacher associations, etc.); (4) freedom to form political parties, orga¬ 
nize members, put forward candidates, and campaign without fear of 
extreme violence; and (5) the absence of state terror and a climate of 
fear among the public. Also off the agenda is the election-day “coercion 
package” that may explain turnout in terms other than devotion to the 
army and its plans, including any legal requirement to vote, and explicit 
or implicit threats for not voting* Other issues that must be downplayed
