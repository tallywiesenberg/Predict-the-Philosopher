Many of them have diversified out of particular media fields 
into others that seemed like growth areas.Many older newspaper-based 
media companies, fearful of the power of television and its effects on 
advertising revenue, moved as rapidly as they could into broadcasting 
and cable TV, Time, Inc,, also, made a major diversification move into 
cable TV, which now accounts for more than half its profits.Only a 
small minority of the twenty-four largest media giants remain in a single 
media sector, 30 

The large media companies have also diversified beyond the media 
field, and non-media companies have established a strong presence in 
the mass media.The most important cases of the latter are GE, owning 
RCA, which owns the NBC network, and Westinghouse, which owns 
major television-broadcasting stations, a cable network, and a radio¬ 
station network, GE and Westinghouse are both huge, diversified mul¬ 
tinational companies heavily involved in the controversial areas of 
weapons production and nuclear power.It may be recalled that from 
1965 to 1967, an attempt by International Telephone and Telegraph 
(ITT) to acquire ABC was frustrated following a huge outcry that 
focused on the dangers of allowing a great multinational corporation 
with extensive foreign investments and business activities to control a 
major media outlet, 31 The fear was that ITT control “could compro¬ 
mise the independence of ABC’s news coverage of political events in 
countries where ITT has interests/ 532 The soundness of the decision 
disallowing the acquisition seemed to have been vindicated by the later 
revelations of ITT’s political bribery and involvement in attempts to 
overthrow the government of Chile, RCA and Westinghouse, however, 
had been permitted to control media companies long before the ITT 
case, although some of the objections applicable to ITT would seem to 
apply to them as well, GE is a more powerful company than ITT, with 
an extensive international reach, deeply involved in the nuclear power 
business, and far more important than ITT in the arms industry.
