36 The media protect themselves 
from this contingency by lobbying and other political expenditures, the 
cultivation of political relationships, and care in policy.The political 
ties of the media have been impressive.Table 1-3 shows that fifteen of 
ninety-five outside directors of ten of the media giants are former 
government officials, and Peter Dreier gives a similar proportion in his 
study of large newspapers.37 In television* the revolving-door flow of 
personnel between regulators and the regulated firms was massive durÂ¬ 
ing the years when the oligopolistic structure of the media and networks 
was being established.38 

The great media also depend on the government for more general 
policy support.
