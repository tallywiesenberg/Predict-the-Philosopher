1.2.THE ADVERTISING 
LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS: 

THE SECOND FILTER 

In arguing for the benefits of the free market as a means of controlling 
dissident opinion in the mid-nineteenth century, the Liberal chancellor 
of the British exchequer, Sir George Lewis, noted that the market 
would promote those papers “enjoying the preference of the advertising 
public.” 41 Advertising did, in fact, serve as a powerful mechanism 
weakening the working-class press.Curran and Seaton give the growth 
of advertising a status comparable with the increase in capital costs as 
a factor allowing the market to accomplish what state taxes and harass¬ 
ment failed to do, noting that these “advertisers thus acquired a de facto 
licensing authority since, without their support, newspapers ceased to 
be economically viable,” 42 

Before advertising became prominent, the price of a newspaper had 
to cover the costs of doing business.With the growth of advertising, 
papers that attracted ads could afford a copy price well below produc¬ 
tion costs.This put papers lacking in advertising at a serious disadvan¬ 
tage: their prices would tend to be higher, curtailing sales, and they 
would have less surplus to invest in improving the salability of the paper 
(features, attractive format, promotion, etc.).
