great deal of active press hostility, suffers a serious disability, and 
struggles against grave odds.The successful media today are fully attuned to the crucial impor¬ 
tance of audience “quality”: CBS proudly tells its shareholders that 
while it “continuously seeks to maximize audience delivery,” it has 
developed a new “sales tool” with which it approaches advertisers: 
“Client Audience Profile, or CAP, will help advertisers optimize the 
effectiveness of their network television schedules by evaluating audi¬ 
ence segments in proportion to usage levels of advertisers 5 products and 
services.” 49 In short, the mass media are interested in attracting audi¬ 
ences with buying power, not audiences per se; it is affluent audiences 
that spark advertiser interest today, as in the nineteenth century.The 
idea that the drive for large audiences makes the mass media “demo¬ 
cratic” thus suffers from the initial weakness that its political analogue 
is a voting system weighted by income!The power of advertisers over television programming stems from 
the simple fact that they buy and pay for the programs—they are the 
“patrons” who provide the media subsidy.As such, the media compete 
for their patronage, developing specialized staff to solicit advertisers 
and necessarily having to explain how their programs serve advertisers 5 
needs.
