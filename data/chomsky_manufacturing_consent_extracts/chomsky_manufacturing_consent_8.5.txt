The choices of these patrons greatly affect the welfare of the 
media, and the patrons become what William Evan calls “normative 
reference organizations,” 50 whose requirements and demands the 
media must accommodate if they are to succeed.51 

For a television network, an audience gain or loss of one percentage 
point in the Nielsen ratings translates into a change in advertising 
revenue of from $80 to $100 million a year, with some variation depend¬ 
ing on measures of audience “quality, 55 The stakes in audience size and 
affluence are thus extremely large, and in a market system there is a 
strong tendency for such considerations to affect policy profoundly.This is partly a matter of institutional pressures to focus on the bottom 
line, partly a matter of the continuous interaction of the media or¬ 
ganization with patrons who supply the revenue dollars.As Grant 
Tinker, then head of NBC-TV, observed, television “is an advertising- 
supported medium, and to the extent that support falls out, program¬ 
ming will change.” 52 

Working-class and radical media also suffer from the political dis¬ 
crimination of advertisers.Political discrimination is structured into 
advertising allocations by the stress on people with money to buy.
