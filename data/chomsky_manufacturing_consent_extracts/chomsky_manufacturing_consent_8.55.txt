overt discrimination add to the force of the voting system weighted by 
income.Public-television station WNET lost its corporate funding 
from Gulf + Western in 1985 after the station showed the documentary 
“Hungry for Profit/* which contains material critical of multinational 
corporate activities in the Third World, Even before the program was 
shown, in anticipation of negative corporate reaction, station officials 
“did all we could to get the program sanitized” {according to one station 
source), 53 The chief executive of Gulf + Western complained to the 
station that the program was “virulently anti-business if not anti- 
American,” and that the station's carrying the program was not the 
behavior “of a friend” of the corporation.The London Economist says 
that “Most people believe that WNET would not make the same mis¬ 
take again,” 54 

In addition to discrimination against unfriendly media institutions, 
advertisers also choose selectively among programs on the basis of their 
own principles.With rare exceptions these are culturally and politically 
conservative, 55 Large corporate advertisers on television will rarely 
sponsor programs that engage in serious criticisms of corporate activi¬ 
ties, such as the problem of environmental degradation, the workings 
of the military-industrial complex, or corporate support of and benefits 
from Third World tyrannies* Erik Bamouw recounts the history of a 
proposed documentary series on environmental problems by NBC at a 
time of great interest in these issues.Barnouw notes that although at 
that time a great many large companies were spending money on com¬ 
mercials and other publicity regarding environmental problems, the 
documentary series failed for want of sponsors.
