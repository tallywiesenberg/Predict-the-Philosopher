The problem was one 
of excessive objectivity in the series, which included suggestions of 
corporate or systemic failure, whereas the corporate message “was one 
of reassurance,” 56 

Television networks learn over time that such programs will not sell 
and would have to be carried at a financial sacrifice, and that, in 
addition, they may offend powerful advertisers.57 With the rise in the 
price of advertising spots, the forgone revenue increases; and with 
increasing market pressure for financial performance and the diminish¬ 
ing constraints from regulation, an advertising-based media system will 
gradually increase advertising time and marginalize or eliminate alto¬ 
gether programming that has significant public-affairs content.58 

Advertisers will want, more generally, to avoid programs with serious 
complexities and disturbing controversies that interfere with the “buy¬ 
ing mood.” They seek programs that will lightly entertain and thus fit 
in with the spirit of the primary purpose of program purchases—the

dissemination of a selling message.Thus over time, instead of programs 
like “The Selling of the Pentagon,” it is a natural evolution of a market 
seeking sponsor dollars to offer programs such as “A Bird's-Eye View 
of Scotland/' “Barry Goldwater's Arizona,” “An Essay on Hotels/ 3 and 
“Mr.Rooney Goes to Dinner”—a CBS program on “how Americans 
eat when they dine out, where they go and why.” 5 * There are excep¬ 
tional cases of companies willing to sponsor serious programs, some¬ 
times a result of recent embarrassments that call for a public-relations 
offset.
