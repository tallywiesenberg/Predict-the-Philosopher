This is important 
to the mass media.As Fishman notes, 

Newsworkers are predisposed to treat bureaucratic accounts as 
factual because news personnel participate in upholding a norma¬ 
tive order of authorized knowers in the society.Reporters operate 
with the attitude that officials ought to know what it is their job 
to know,,,.In particular, a newsworker will recognize an officials 
claim to knowledge not merely as a claim* but as a credible, 
competent piece of knowledge.This amounts to a moral division 
of labor; officials have and give the facts; reporters merely get 
them, 63 

Another reason for the heavy weight given to official sources is that the 
mass media claim to be “objective” dispensers of the news.
