20 MANUFACTURING CONSENT 


the U.S. Air Force revealed that its public-information outreach in¬ 
cluded the following: 

140 newspapers, 690,000 copies per week 

Airman magazine, monthly circulation 125,000 

34 radio and 17 TV stations, primarily overseas 

45,000 headquarters and unit news releases 

615,000 hometown news releases 

6,600 interviews with news media 

3,200 news conferences 

500 news media orientation flights 

50 meetings with editorial boards 

11,000 speeches 65 

This excludes vast areas of the air force’s public-information effort.Writing back in 1970, Senator J. W. Fulbright had found that the air 
force public-relations effort in 1968 involved 1,305 full-time employees, 
exclusive of additional thousands that “have public functions collateral 
to other duties.” 66 The air force at that time offered a weekly film-clip 
service for TV and a taped features program for use three times a week, 
sent to 1,139 radio stations; it also produced 148 motion pictures, of 
which 24 were released for public consumption.67 There is no reason 
to believe that the air force public-relations effort has diminished since 
the 1960s.68 

Note that this is just the air force.There are three other branches with 
massive programs, and there is a separate, overall public-information 
program under an assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the 
Pentagon.
