In 1971, an Armed Forces Journal survey revealed that the 
Pentagon was publishing a total of 371 magazines at an annual cost of 
some $57 million, an operation sixteen times larger than the nation’s 
biggest publisher.In an update in 1982, the Air Force Journal Interna¬ 
tional indicated that the Pentagon was publishing 1,203 periodicals.69 
To put this into perspective, we may note the scope of public-informa¬ 
tion operations of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) 
and the National Council of the Churches of Christ (NCC), two of the 
largest of the nonprofit organizations that offer a consistently challeng¬ 
ing voice to the views of the Pentagon.The AFSC’s main office infor¬ 
mation-services budget in 1984-85 was under $500,000, with eleven 
staff people.70 Its institution-wide press releases run at about two hun¬ 
dred per year, its press conferences thirty a year, and it produces about 
one him and two or three slide shows a year.
