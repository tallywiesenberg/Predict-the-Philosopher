for 180 days. Under these rulings* in the thirty months before the March 
198a election* and prior to the 1984 elections* many thousands of civil¬ 
ians were seized* imprisoned* tortured* raped* and murdered outside of 
legal processes for alleged “subversive” actions and thoughts. The state 
of siege was lifted in early 1982 solely for the six parties contesting the 
election* and it was lifted entirely ten days before the election for all 
Salvadorans—although* unfortunately* the citizenry was not informed 
of this fact until after the election was over and state-of-siege condi¬ 
tions were reimposed. 15 The practice of exposing mutilated bodies for 
the edification of the citizenry became institutionalized in the early 
1980s in El Salvador. We described in chapter 2 the difficulty the U.S. 
government had in getting underlings jailed* tried* and convicted for 
the murder of four American citizens* even under intense U.S. pressure. 
The people of El Salvador had no protection whatsoever from the state 
terrorists* apart from that afforded by the guerrilla army in the regions 
under their control. The threat of extreme violence by the state against 
dissident speech was acute in El Salvador in 1982 and 1984, and was 
incompatible with a free election. 

In Guatemala, similarly* during 1984 and 1985* and for many years 
before* the actions of the armed forces against alleged subversives was 
entirely outside the rule of law. Thousands were seized* tortured* and 
killed without warrant and without any individual right to hearing or 
trial. As in El Salvador* mutilation and exposure of the tortured bodies 
became commonplace in the late 1970s and the 1980s. 16 The courts were 
dominated by the military* as the latter would simply not execute or 
obey a court order of which they disapproved, and the judges were not 
inclined to challenge the military for reasons of dependency or fear. 
Even Viscount Colville of Culross* the special rapporteur of the UN 
General Assembly who has been a notorious apologist for the Guatema¬ 
lan regime, after pointing out that over eighty members of the judiciary, 
court staff, and legal profession had been murdered in the early 1980s 
and that many others were threatened, says that “Such events make 
their mark and cannot quickly be mitigated.” 17 Two illustrations of the 
lack of court autonomy may be noted here: in May 1983* Ricardo 
Sagastume Vidaure* then president of the supreme court* was simply 
removed by military order for attempting to bring military personnel 
under the jurisdiction of the legal system. 18 On July 19, 1984* Colonel 
Djalmi Dominguez* head of public relations for the army, told the 
newspaper Prensa Libre that the army wouldn’t tolerate its members 
being taken to court on any charges. 19

In the early 1980s, following the mass killings and village destruction 
of 1980-83, vast numbers of peasants were resettled in “model villages” 
and other places under army control, and over 800,000 males were
