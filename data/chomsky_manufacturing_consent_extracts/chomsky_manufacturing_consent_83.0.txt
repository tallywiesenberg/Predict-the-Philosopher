One local observer said that years of terror and oppression against 
local organizations had demobilized the whole rural population: 
“Four CUC [peasant league] members were killed in this village 
alone* Now it would be very difficult to organize any kind of 
group.” Civil patrols, police and army checkpoints on highways, 
and the need for travel permits for residents of the model villages 
impeded free movement* In the rural areas the civil patrols dis¬ 
couraged gatherings because people feared being reported* 23 

It was noted by many observers of the Guatemalan elections that 
although the big issues in that country were land distribution and 
reform and human rights, no political candidates discussed or ad¬ 
vocated either land reform, or restructuring the military and forcing an 
accounting of tens of thousands of “disappearances*” One Christian 
Democratic adviser explained to the law group that “We Christian 
Democrats haven't raised such issues because this isn*t the moment to 
start a confrontation with either the army or the private sector.” 24 

In short, despite the “momentary improvement in the conditions of 
free speech” that occurred during the election campaign, Guatemala 
did not meet the first condition of a free election* The rural masses were 
under army discipline and traumatized by mass killings and the absence 
of any vestige of rule of law, and the candidates were unable to raise 
openly the fundamental issues of the society* 

Free speech and rights of assembly were constrained in Nicaragua 
in 1984 by social pressures and threats and by a state of siege that had 
been terminated some six months prior to the November 1984 election. 
Very important differences existed, however, between the Nicaraguan 
constraints and those prevailing in El Salvador and Guatemala, Most 
important, in Nicaragua the army and police did not regularly seize 
alleged subversives, and torture and murder them. Mutilated bodies 
have not been put on public display as a part of the system of public 
education* What the law group called the “constant, overt political 
terror” in Guatemala, based on “numerous documented massacres of 
whole villages,” and what the former Salvadoran official Leonel Gomez 
called the state of “fearful passivity” prevalent in El Salvador, did not 
apply to Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, in 1984, dissidents were able to speak

freely without fear of murder, and the LASA group noted that “Every 
member of our delegation was approached at least once by an irate 
citizen as we walked around Managua and other cities. Several of these 
encounters turned into heated arguments between the individual who 

had approached us and passers-by who joined the discussion-These
