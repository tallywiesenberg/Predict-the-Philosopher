classes in general, “At most, the variants reflect shades of strictly con¬ 
servative thinking/* 29 Given the extreme climate of fear* and threats for 
stepping out of line, even the conservative press is cautious and engages 
in continuous self-censorship. All the central topics that should be 
debated in this terrorized society are carefully avoided. 30 

In Nicaragua, once again, there have been no reported deaths of 
journalists by state terrorists, nor even threats of personal violence. In 
1984, the majority of the fifty-odd radio stations were privately owned, 
and some of them provided their own news programs; four other inde¬ 
pendent producers supplied radio news programs without prior censor¬ 
ship. Foreign radio and television from commercial and U,S, 
propaganda sources broadcasting from Costa Rica, Honduras, and else¬ 
where were of growing importance in 1984. 31 Two of the three newspa¬ 
pers were privately owned, one supportive of the government but 
critical of specific programs and actions, the other violently hostile. The 
latter, La Prensa , which represented the small, ultraconservative mi¬ 
nority and supported the contras and a foreign-sponsored invasion of 
the country, was allowed to operate throughout the 1984 election, al¬ 
though it was censored. The censorship still allowed the paper to 
publish manifestos of opposition groups and a pastoral letter critical of 
the regime. No comparable paper has been allowed to exist above¬ 
ground, even briefly, in El Salvador and Guatemala. 

There is no doubt that the media in Nicaragua have been under 
government constraint, with censorship and periodic emergency con¬ 
trols that seriously encroached on freedom of the press. 32 It should be 
noted, however, that Nicaragua is under foreign attack and in a state 
of serious warfare. John S. Nichols points out that under the U.S. 
Espionage Act of 1917, over one hundred publications were banned 
from the mails, and hundreds of people were jailed for allegedly inter¬ 
fering with military recruitment. Furthermore, 

Given that the United States was a relatively mature and homoge¬ 
nous political system during World War I and was not particularly 
threatened by the fighting, the range of public discussion tolerated 
in Nicaragua during the first five years of the revolution was 
remarkable. Despite assertions by President Reagan, IAPA, and 
others that the control of the Nicaraguan media was virtually 
totalitarian, the diversity of ownership and opinion was unusual 
for a Third World country, particularly one at war. 33 


LEGITIMIZING VERSUS MEANINGLESS THIRD WORLD ELECTIONS 99 


Our conclusion is that the condition of freedom of the press necessary 
for a free election was dearly absent in El Salvador and Guatemala, and 
that it was partially met in Nicaragua.
