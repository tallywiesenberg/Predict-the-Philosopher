There is legitimate debate over the extent to which the grass-roots 
and other organizations sponsored by the ruling FSLN are indepen¬ 
dent, and whether they might not be a vehicle for both state propaganda 
and coercion, Oxfam America and its parent organization in London 
clearly find them constructive. Luis Hector Serra contends that the 
grass-roots organizations are relatively autonomous, and that their 
close relationship to the leadership of the FSLN “did not obstruct their 
capacity to express the concerns of their members at the local level.” 35 
He concludes that the popular organizations were “profoundly demo¬ 
cratic” in their effects of involving the populace in decision-making and 
educating them on the possibilities of participation in public life, 36 The 
difference with the organization of the Guatemalan peasantry in “poles 
of development,” where the essence of the organization was, quite 
openly, militaiy control by terror and enforced nonparticipaiiony is 
quite dramatic, whatever one’s general assessment of the FSLN popu¬ 
lar organizations may be. 

We conclude that on the third basic condition for a free election, El 
Salvador and Guatemala did not qualify in the years 1984-85; Nicara¬ 
gua did, at least to a significant degree, 37

No party of the left could organize and present candidates in the 1982 
and 1984 elections in El Salvador. The Democratic Front (FDR) had 
been quickly driven underground. Five of its top leaders were seized 
in El Salvador in November 1980 by official and paramilitary forces, and 
were tortured, mutilated, and killed. A year before the March 1982 
election, the army published a list of 138 “traitors,” which included 
virtually all politicians of the left and left-center. Colonel Gutierrez, a 
powerful member of the junta, had stated forcefully that the FDR could 
not participate in the election because it was a “front” for the guerrillas. 
The invitation to the FDR and the FMLN to lay down their arms and

compete in the election was thus fraudulent, a fact confirmed by the 
admission of the U.S. embassy that the FDR could not safely campaign 
in El Salvador, with the accompanying suggestion that they might do 
so by means of videotapes sent in from outside the country's borders! 38 
Subsequently, even Duarte, the preferred candidate of the United 
States, was unable to campaign outside San Salvador in 1982 for fear 
of murder, and scores of Christian Democratic politicans were killed
