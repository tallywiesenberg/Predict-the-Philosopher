The repression in 1980 reached a magnitude surpassed only by the 
[first] maianza and was far worse than anything imagined under 
General Romero. ... By the end of the year the number [mur¬ 
dered] had reached at least 9,000- Every day mutilated bodies, 
missing arms or heads, were found: behind shopping centers; 
stuffed in burlap bags and left on dusty rural roads; hurled over 
cliffs into ravines. 42 

And through all of this, Duarte not only provided the facade of “re¬ 
form,” he regularly complimented the army for its loyal service. In a 
letter published in the Miami Herald on November 9, 1981, Duarte 
wrote that 

The armed forces are waging a heroic battle against a cruel and 
pitiless enemy supported by great resources of ideological aggres¬ 
sion. This goes parallel with armed aggression. . . . This would 
be one more prey in the conquest plan in the Central Ameri¬ 
can region that Moscow has designed to pursue. Immediately 
after that its greatest reward would be the North American na¬

In brief, the Salvadoran public was never offered the option that the 
press itself acknowledged the voters craved. 

In Guatemala, as in El Salvador, no parties of the left participated 
in the 1984 election for a constituent assembly, and only one crippled 
party made a tentative but wholly ineffectual foray in the 1985 presiden¬ 
tial election. 43 The main guerrilla movements were, of course, outside 
the electoral orbit. Their leaders would have been killed if ap¬ 
prehended, but they would not have participated anyway without a 
drastic alteration in basic social and electoral conditions. 44 Even a 
centrist party like the Christian Democrats had suffered scores of mur¬ 
ders in the years 1980-83, and the current president of Guatemala, the 
Christian Democrat Vinicio Cerezo, survived three known assassina¬ 
tion attempts. No seriously left party could have qualified in 1984-85 
under the laws of “illicit association” mentioned earlier. 

The peasant majority was not represented or spoken for by any 
candidate. The Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, an organiza-
