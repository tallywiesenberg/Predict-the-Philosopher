higher rates of killing are no longer deemed beneficial). The poor, for 
whom he expressed so much compassion during the electoral campaign, 
have suffered further losses in real income, as Cerezo’s “reforms” have 
accommodated the demands of the army and oligarchy. He is on very 
poor terms with the Mutual Support Group, Thus, the postelection 
pattern shows that Cerezo, in pan by prior agreement but more deci¬ 
sively by structural constraints, has been entirely unable to serve his 
mass constituency. In the 1984-85 election, Cerezo gave the Guatema¬ 
lan people an opportunity to vote for a man of seeming goodwill and 
good intentions, but one unable to respond to democratic demands 
opposed by the real rulers of the state. 

In Nicaragua, in 1984, the spectrum of candidates was much wider 
than in El Salvador, Guatemala, or, for that matter, the United States. 52 
The Conservative Democratic party and the Independent Liberal party 
both issued strong calls for respect for private property, reduced gov¬ 
ernment control of the economy, elimination of press and other con¬ 
trols, and a foreign policy of greater nonalignment and accommodation. 
Both were able to denounce the Sandinistas for the war and to call for 
depoliticization of the army and negotiations with the contras. Arturo 
Cruz, after lengthy negotiations with representatives of the govern¬ 
ment, chose not to run in the 1984 election. But this was a voluntary 
act of Cruz (albeit under heavy U.S. pressure), 53 in contrast with the 
position of the left in El Salvador and Guatemala, and was not based 
on physical threats to his person or limits on his access to the popu¬ 
lace. 54 

The FSLN had a strong advantage over the opposition parties as the 
party in power, defending the country from foreign attack and having 
mobilized the population for their own projects of development. The 
LAS A group felt that much of the incumbency advantage of the FSLN 
was characteristic of governments everywhere, and concluded: 

It seems clear that the FSLN took substantial advantage of its 
incumbent position and, in some ways, abused it. However, the 
abuses of incumbency do not appear to have been systematic; and 
neither the nature of the abuses nor their frequency was such as 
to cripple the opposition parties* campaigns or to cast doubt on

the fundamental validity of the electoral process. . . . Generally 
speaking* in this campaign the FSLK did little more to take ad¬ 
vantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere 
(including the United States) routinely do* and considerably less 
than ruling parties in other Larin American countries traditionally 
have done. 55
