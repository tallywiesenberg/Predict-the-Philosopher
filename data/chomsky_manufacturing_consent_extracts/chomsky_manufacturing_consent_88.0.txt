in Nicaragua, but not in El Salvador and Guatemala. And our overall 
finding is that neither El Salvador nor Guatemala met any of the five 
basic conditions of a free election, whereas Nicaragua met some of 
them well, others to a lesser extent.

IN EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, 
AND NICARAGUA 

As we noted, in the U.S. government’s sponsored elections, voter turn¬ 
out is interpreted as public support for the election and its sponsors. 
In disapproved elections (here, Nicaragua), this frame is abandoned, 
and voter turnout is either ignored or declared meaningless because of 
limited options or coercive threats by the authorities. But the question 
of coercive threats should clearly be raised in all cases where this is a 
potential problem. As we have just described, the elections in El Salva¬ 
dor were held under conditions of military rule where mass killings of 
“subversives” had taken place and a climate of fear had been estab¬ 
lished. If the government then sponsors an election and the local mili¬ 
tary authorities urge people to vote, a significant part of the vote should 
be assumed to be a result of built-in coercion. A propaganda model 
would anticipate that the U.S. mass media make no such assumption, 
and they did not. 

In El Salvador in 1982 and 1984, voting was also required by law. The 
law stipulated that failure to vote was to be penalized by a specific 
monetary assessment, and it also called on local authorities to check out 
whether voters did in fact vote. This could be done because at the time 
of voting one’s identification card (ID, cedula) was stamped, acknowl¬ 
edging the casting of a vote. Anybody stopped by the army and police 
would have to show the ID card, which would quickly indicate whether 
the individual had carried out his or her patriotic duty. Just prior to the 
March 1982 election, Minister of Defense Garcia warned the popula¬ 
tion in the San Salvador newspapers that the failure to vote would be

regarded as an act of treason. And in the 1984 election, “Advertising by 
the government and military prior to the elections stressed the obliga¬ 
tion to vote rather than the freedom to vote.” 60 Given the climate of 
fear, the voting requirement, the ID stamp, the army warning, and the 
army record in handling “traitors,” it is evident that the coercive ele¬ 
ment in generating turnout in Salvadoran elections has been large. This
