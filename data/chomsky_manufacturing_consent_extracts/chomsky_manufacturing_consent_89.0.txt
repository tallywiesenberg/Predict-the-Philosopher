tion* Hoge asserting that “The elections have taken on a significance 
beyond their outcome because leftist guerrillas mounted a campaign to 
disrupt them and discourage voters from going to the polls.” 67 This is 
a precise statement of the government's propaganda frame. But Hoge 
and Meislin never once cited a rebel source vowing disruption* and 
nobody else did* either. On election day no voters were killed or polling 
stations attacked* and the general level of rebel military activity was 
below average. In short* the disruption claims were falsifications of both 
plans and election-day results* but as they fit the patriotic agenda they 
were given prominence* repeated frequently* and used to establish the 
contest between the forces of good and evil. 68 At the election-day close* 
Dan Rather exclaimed* “A triumph! A million people to the polls,” 
Rather did not regard it as a triumph that the Sandinistas got 700*000 
people to the polls—a higher proportion of the population* and without 
a voting requirement. The propaganda frame of the government gave 
turnout high importance in the Salvadoran election but none in the 
Nicaraguan election* and Rather followed like a good lap dog. 

Neither Rather nor any other media analyst on or before March 30* 
1982* noted that voting was required by law in El Salvador* and not one 
mentioned the warning by the defense minister, General Guillermo 
Garcia* in the San Salvador newspapers that non voting was treaso¬ 
nous. 69 The basic parameters were entirely off the media agenda. The 
destruction of La Gronica and El Independiente and the murder of 
twenty-six journalists prior to the election were unmentioned in dis¬ 
cussing the election's quality and meaning. 70 The army and its allies had 
been killing civilians on a massive scale in El Salvador* for many months 
before (and into) March 1982, Would this not create a climate of fear 
and, in conjunction with a state of siege, somewhat encumber free 
debate and free choice? The point was rarely even hinted at in the mass 
media. 

Could candidates run freely and campaign without fear of murder? 
Could the rebels qualify and run? After all* if it was a civil war* the 
rebels were clearly the “main opposition.” Again, the mass media 
played dumb. They pretended that this exclusion was not important, 
or that it represented a willful boycott by the rebels rather than a refusal 
based on conditions unfavorable to a free election and a blatantly

stacked deck. Neither the March 1981 death list nor the Gutierrez 
statement that the FDR would not be permitted to run were mentioned 
by the mass media in our sample. They never once suggested that the 
election plan was to create an electoral environment of extreme coer¬
