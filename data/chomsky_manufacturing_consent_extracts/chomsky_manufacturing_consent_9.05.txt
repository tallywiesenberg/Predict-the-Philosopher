72 The number of 
individual corporations with budgets for public information and lobby¬ 
ing in excess of those of the AFSC and NCC runs into the hundreds, 
perhaps even the thousands.A corporate collective like the U.S, Cham¬ 
ber of Commerce had a 1983 budget for research, communications, and 
political activities of $65 million.73 By 1980, the chamber was publishing 
a business magazine {Nation’s Business) with a circulation of 1.3 million 
and a weekly newspaper with 740,000 subscribers, and it was producing 
a weekly panel show distributed to 400 radio stations, as well as its own 
weekly panel-discussion programs carried by 128 commercial television 
stations* 74 

Besides the U.S* Chamber, there are thousands of state and local 
chambers of commerce and trade associations also engaged in public- 
relations and lobbying activities* The corporate and trade-association 
lobbying network community is “a network of well over 150,000 profes¬ 
sionals,” 75 and its resources are related to corporate income, profits, 
and the protective value of public-relations and lobbying outlays.Cor¬ 
porate profits before taxes in 1985 were $295*5 billion.When the corpo¬ 
rate community gets agitated about the political environment, as it did in 
the 1970s, it obviously has the wherewithal to meet the perceived threat.
