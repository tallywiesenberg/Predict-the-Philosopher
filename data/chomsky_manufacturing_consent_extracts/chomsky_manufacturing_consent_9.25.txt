As an illustration of how the funded experts preempt space in the 
media* table 1-4 describes the “experts” on terrorism and defense issues 
who appeared on the “McNeil-Lehrer News Hour” in the course of a 
year in the mid-1980s.We can see that, excluding journalists* a majority 
of the participants (54 percent) were present or former government 
officials* and that the next highest category (15.7 percent) was drawn 
from conservative think tanks* The largest number of appearances in 
the latter category was supplied by the Georgetown Center for Strate¬ 
gic and International Studies (CSIS)* an organization funded by con¬ 
servative foundations and corporations* and providing a revolving door 
between the State Department and CIA and a nominally private organi¬ 
zation* 93 On such issues as terrorism and the Bulgarian Connection* the 
CSIS has occupied space in the media that otherwise might have been 
filled by independent voices.94 

The mass media themselves also provide “experts” who regularly 
echo the official view* John Barron and Claire Sterling are household 
names as authorities on the KGB and terrorism because the Reader’s 
Digest has funded* published* and publicized their work; the Soviet 
defector Arkady Shevchenko became an expert on Soviet arms and 
intelligence because Time> ABC-TV* and the New York Times chose to 
feature him (despite his badly tarnished credentials).95 By giving these 
purveyors of the preferred view a great deal of exposure* the media 
confer status and make them the obvious candidates for opinion and 
analysis.Another class of experts whose prominence is largely a function of 
serviceability to power is former radicals who have come to “see the 
light.” The motives that cause these individuals to switch gods* from 
Stalin (or Mao) to Reagan and free enterprise, is varied, but for the 
establishment media the reason for the change is simply that the ex-
