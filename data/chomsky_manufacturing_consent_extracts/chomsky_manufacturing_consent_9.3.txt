* This is a compilation of all appearances on the news hour concerning the 
Bulgarian Connection (3), the shooting down of the Korean airliner KAL 
007 (5), and terrorism, defense, and arms control (33), from January 14, 
1985, through January 27, 1986. 


radicals have finally seen the error of their ways.In a country whose 
citizenry values acknowledgement of sin and repentance, the turncoats 
are an important class of repentant sinners.It is interesting to observe 
how the former sinners, whose previous work was of little interest or 
an object of ridicule to the mass media, are suddenly elevated to promi¬ 
nence and become authentic experts.We may recall how, during the 
McCarthy era, defectors and ex-Communists vied with one another in 
tales of the imminence of a Soviet invasion and other lurid stories.
