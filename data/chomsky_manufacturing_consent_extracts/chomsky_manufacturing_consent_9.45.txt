Adver¬ 
tisers are still concerned to avoid offending constituencies that might 
produce flak, and their demand for suitable programming is a continu¬ 
ing feature of the media environment.98 If certain kinds of fact, posi¬ 
tion, or program are thought likely to elicit flak, this prospect can be 
a deterrent.The ability to produce flak, and especially flak that is costly and 
threatening, is related to power.Serious flak has increased in close 
parallel with business’s growing resentment of media criticism and the 
corporate offensive of the 1970s and 1980s.Flak from the powerful can 
be either direct or indirect.
