The Media Institute* organized in 1972 and funded by corporate- 
wealthy patrons, sponsors monitoring projects, conferences, and stud¬ 
ies of the media.It has focused less heavily on media failings in foreign 
policy, concentrating more on media portrayals of economic issues and 
the business community, but its range of interests is broad.The main 
theme of its sponsored studies and conferences has been the failure of 
the media to portray business accurately and to give adequate weight 
to the business point of view, 101 but it underwrites works such as John 
Corry J s expose of the alleged left-wing bias of the mass media.102 The 
chairman of the board of trustees of the institute in 1985 was Steven V. 
Seekins* the top public-relations officer of the American Medical Asso¬ 
ciation; chairman of the National Advisory Council was Herbert 
Schmertz, of the Mobil Oil Corporation.
