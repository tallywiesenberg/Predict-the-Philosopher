The Center for Media and Public Affairs, run by Linda and Robert 
Lichter, came into existence in the mid-1980s as a “non-profit* non- 
partisan” research institute, with warm accolades from Patrick Bu¬ 
chanan* Faith Whittlesey* and Ronald Reagan himself, who recognized 
the need for an objective and fair press.Their Media Monitor and 
research studies continue their earlier efforts to demonstrate the liberal 
bias and anti-business propensities of the mass media.103 

AIM was formed in 1969, and it grew spectacularly in the 1970s.Its 
annual income rose from $5,000 in 1971 to $1.5 million in the early 1980s, 
with funding mainly from large corporations and the wealthy heirs and 
foundations of the corporate system.At least eight separate oil compa¬ 
nies were contributors to AIM in the early 1980s, but the wide represen¬ 
tation in sponsors from the corporate community is impressive.
