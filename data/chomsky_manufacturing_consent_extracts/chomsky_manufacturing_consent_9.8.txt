The producers of flak add to one another's strength and reinforce the 
command of political authority in its news-management activities.The 
government is a major producer of flak, regularly assailing, threatening, 
and “correcting” the media, trying to contain any deviations from the 
established line.News management itself is designed to produce flak.In the Reagan years, Mr. Reagan was put on television to exude charm 
to millions, many of whom berated the media when they dared to 
criticize the “Great Communicator,” 110

1.5.ANTICOMMUNISM AS A 
CONTROL MECHANISM 

A final filter is the ideology of anticommunism* Communism as the 
ultimate evil has always been the specter haunting property owners, as 
it threatens the very root of their class position and superior status* The 
Soviet, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions were traumas to Western elites, 
and the ongoing conflicts and the well-publicized abuses of Communist 
states have contributed to elevating opposition to communism to a first 
principle of Western ideology and politics* This ideology helps mobilize 
the populace against an enemy, and because the concept is fuzzy it can 
be used against anybody advocating policies that threaten property 
interests or support accommodation with Communist states and radi¬ 
calism* It therefore helps fragment the left and labor movements and 
serves as a political-control mechanism* If the triumph of communism 
is the worst imaginable result, the support of fascism abroad is justified 
as a lesser evil* Opposition to social democrats who are too soft on 
Communists and “play into their hands” is rationalized in similar terms* 
Liberals at home, often accused of being pro-Communist or insuffi¬ 
ciently anti-Communist, are kept continuously on the defensive in a 
cultural milieu in which anticommunism is the dominant religion* If 
they allow communism, or something that can be labeled communism, 
to triumph in the provinces while they are in office, the political costs 
are heavy.
