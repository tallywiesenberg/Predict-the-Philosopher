Most of them have fully internalized the religion anyway, 
but they are all under great pressure to demonstrate their anti-Commu¬ 
nist credentials* This causes them to behave very much like reactionar¬ 
ies* Their occasional support of social democrats often breaks down 
where the latter are insufficiently harsh on their own indigenous radi¬ 
cals or on popular groups that are organizing among generally margin¬ 
alized sectors* In his brief tenure in the Dominican Republic, Juan 
Bosch attacked corruption in the armed forces and government, began 
a land-reform program, undertook a major project for mass education 
of the populace, and maintained a remarkably open government and 
system of effective civil liberties* These policies threatened powerful 
internal vested interests, and the United States resented his indepen¬ 
dence and the extension of civil liberties to Communists and radicals.This was carrying democracy and pluralism too far* Kennedy was 
“extremely disappointed” in Bosch's rule, and the State Department 
“quickly soured on the first democratically elected Dominican Presi¬

allegations of Communist links and a Communist threat caused many 
liberals to support counterrevolutionary intervention, while others 
lapsed into silence, paralyzed by the fear of being tarred with charges 
of infidelity to the national religion.It should be noted that when anti-Communist fervor is aroused, the 
demand for serious evidence in support of claims of “communist” 
abuses is suspended, and charlatans can thrive as evidential sources.
