Defectors, informers, and assorted other opportunists move to center 
stage as “experts,” and they remain there even after exposure as highly 
unreliable, if not downright liars, 113 Pascal Delwit and Jean-Michel 
Dewaele point out that in France, too, the ideologues of anticommu¬ 
nism “can do and say anything,” 114 Analyzing the new status of Annie 
Kriegel and Pierre Daix, two former passionate Stalinists now pos¬ 
sessed of a large and uncritical audience in France, 115 Delwit and 
Dewaele note; 

If we analyse their writings, we find all the classic reactions of 
people who have been disappointed in love.But no one dreams of 
criticising them for their past, even though it has marked them 
forever.They may well have been converted, but they have not 
changed, , , , no one notices the constants, even though they are 
glaringly obvious.Their best sellers prove, thanks to the support 
of the most indulgent and slothful critics anyone could hope for, 
that the public can be fooled.No one denounces or even notices 
the arrogance of both yesterday's eulogies and today's diatribes; 
no one cares that there is never any proof and that invective is 
used in place of analysis.
