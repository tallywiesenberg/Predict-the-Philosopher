OPTS FOR MODERATION” 73 

The U,S, government was less deeply involved in the Guatemalan 
elections of 1984 and 1985 than it was in those held in El Salvador, but, 
as we saw in chapter 2, the Reagan administration went to great pains 
to put a favorable gloss on the murderous regimes of Lucas Garcia, Rios 
Montt, and Mejia Victores, and to attempt to reintegrate them fully into 
the free-world alliance* 74 It encouraged the 1984-85 elections, provided 
advisory and financial support for election management, and gave pub¬ 
lic-relations assistance and sent official observers to help put the elec¬ 
tion in a favorable light* There was little effort made to disguise the fact 
that the purpose of the election, from the standpoint of the Reagan 
administration and the ruling army, was to alter the international 
“image” of Guatemala in order to facilitate aid and loans* 

With the administration supporting the new look, but without the 
intensity of commitment and propaganda backup brought to bear in El 
Salvador, and given the steady stream of reports of ongoing mass 
murder in Guatemala, a propaganda model would anticipate a media 
response that put the Guatemalan elections in a favorable light, but 
with qualifications* There was, in fact, far less coverage than of the 
Salvadoran election; what there was had a little more “balance,” but the 
apologetic framework was still overwhelmingly dominant* 

A telling manifestation of bias was the media’s ready acceptance of 
the Guatemalan elections as meaningful, even though they were admit¬ 
tedly for image-making, in a context of long-standing army rule and 
massacre, and despite new institutional arrangements in the country¬ 
side—the massive relocations of the population, the “model villages,” 
and the civil-defense patrols—that were, on their face, incompatible 
with a free election* In an enemy state where an election was held under 
comparable conditions, it would be designated a meaningless public- 
relations exercise* 75 In the case of Guatemala, however, the civil patrols 
and ongoing massacres were rarely mentioned, sources that addressed 
these matters were ignored, and the overall tone of the news was 
cautiously hopeful and optimistic* It was the consensus that the 1984
