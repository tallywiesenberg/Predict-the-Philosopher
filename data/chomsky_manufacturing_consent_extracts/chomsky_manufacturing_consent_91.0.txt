ate the quality of sources—the State Department is unchallenged be¬ 
cause it expounds the official and patriotic truth, Americas Watch is 
denigrated (and only rarely cited, even with a dismissing put-down) 
because it challenges official propaganda. Pravda could hardly be more 
subservient to state demands than Time in its coverage of demonstra¬ 
tion elections. 78 

The mass media’s sourcing on the Guatemalan election was confined 
almost entirely to U.S. officials and official observers, the most promi¬ 
nent Guatemalan political candidates, and generals. Spokespersons for 
the insurgents—what in Nicaragua would be labeled the “main opposi¬ 
tion”—the smaller parties, spokespersons for popular organizations, 
the churches, human-rights groups, and ordinary citizens, were essen¬ 
tially ignored by the media. Time f Newsweek and CBS News almost 
never talked to ordinary citizens or spokespersons for the insurgents. 
Stephen Kinzer, in the Times> had only one citation to a rebel source 
in several dozen articles on Guatemala during the election periods, 
although on election day in 1984 he did speak with a number of ordinary 
citizens (who gave a much less optimistic view than Kinzer’s usual 
sources). 

The restricted menu of media sources flows from and reinforces the 
media’s propensity to adopt a patriotic agenda. U.S. government offi¬ 
cials and observers are always optimistic and hopeful in their state¬ 
ments about sponsored elections. The leading contestant politicians are 
also moderately optimistic, as they have a good chance of acquiring at 
least nominal power. They do, however, express occasional doubts 
about whether the army will relinquish power. This allows the election 
drama to assume a slightly different character from that in El Salvador, 
where it was the democratic army “protecting the election” versus the 
undemocratic rebels who refused to lay down their arms and partici¬ 
pate. In Guatemala, the frame was: Will the generals keep their promise 
to stay in the barracks? The triumph is that they do stay in the bar¬ 
racks—a civilian president takes office and now “rules.” The media 
then quickly drop the subject, so that whether the army really does 
relinquish power to the civilian leaders is never checked out (just as the 
“peace” sought by the populace in El Salvador was never considered 
in retrospect). In Poland, in January 1947, and Nicaragua, in 1984, and 
in enemy states generally, the focus was on the substance of power, and 
the extent to which that power shaped the electoral results in advance, 
as by limiting the ability of important constituencies to run for office 
and compete effectively. Not so for Guatemala.

If the mass media had enlarged their sources, fundamental condi¬ 
tions would have assumed greater prominence. For example, before 
both the July I, 1984, and December 1985 elections in Guatemala, the
