on this topic, Kinzer is well aware of the facts. 84 The vast majority of 
Guatemalans are very poor, and they have been entirely excluded from 
political participation or representation since 1954. The insurgency 
grew out of the parlous condition and exploitation of that mass, and the 
absence of any possibility of a democratic process to alleviate injustice 
and misery* The ruling army had allowed only parties to run and 
civilians to hold office who agreed, tacitly or explicitly, to keep off the 
policy agenda all matters of central concern to the impoverished major¬ 
ity. There is no way to measure the strength of popular support for the 
insurgents, but in light of the fact that they espouse programs well 
oriented to the interests of the general population and have been able 
to maintain an insurgency without significant external aid, and that the 
army response has been a war against virtually the entire rural popula¬ 
tion, the rebel claim to be a “main opposition” would appear to be 
stronger than that of Arturo Cruz and his upper-class Nicaraguan 
associates* And if the rebels—or any candidates who would threaten the 
army and oligarchy in ways appealing to the majority—cannot qualify 
in a Guatemalan election, is it not essentially fraudulent? This was 
strongly suggested in both 1984 and 1985 by the Guatemalan Bishops’ 
Conference, but this respectable source, in contrast with Arturo Cruz 
and Robert Leiken, is blacked out. As with El Salvador, the election was 
not evaluated, either in advance or in retrospect, on the basis of whether 
or not the fundamental requirements of a free election were met For 
the U.S, government, the insurgents were not a main opposition, 
Guatemalan state terror was merely a public-relations inconvenience, 
and the elections were fair. The mass media’s treatment of the 
Guatemalan election reflected well this government propaganda 
agenda. 


3.6. NICARAGUA: MEDIA 
SERVICE IN THE 
DELEGITIMIZIN G PROCESS 

In contrast with the Salvadoran and Guatemalan cases, the Reagan 
administration was intent on discrediting the Nicaraguan election, 
which threatened to legitimize the Sandinista government and thus

weaken the case for U.S. funding of a terrorist army. The administra¬ 
tion had been berating the Sandinistas for failing to hold an election, 
but the actual holding of one was inconvenient. From the inception of 
Nicaraguan planning for the election, therefore, the administration 
began to express doubts about its quality. And just as it devoted itself 
to creating a positive image of the two client-state elections, so it 
expended substantial resources to depict the Nicaraguan election in the 
worst possible light. The media dutifully followed course, as a propa¬
