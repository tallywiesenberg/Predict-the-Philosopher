election 

In the propaganda format, a great deal of attention is paid to the 
mechanical properties of elections in client states, but not in states 
whose elections are being denigrated. This was true in the cases under 
discussion. Time (Apr* 9,1984) described in detail the elaborate elec¬ 
toral preparations in El Salvador* the “tamper-proof* procedures, the 
use of transparent Lucite ballot boxes* and the indelible-ink marking 
and stamping of ID cards* It turned out* however, that the high-tech, 
computerized voting procedures weren't understood by the population, 
more than half of whom were illiterate. At no point did Time, or its 
media colleagues, raise any question about the importance of improving 
literacy as a necessary prelude to an election; nor did they suggest that 
the Lucite boxes might compromise the secrecy of the vote* or that the 
stamped ID card might be a coercive instrument helping to explain 
turnout, 

Nicaragua went to great pains to provide for election secrecy* and 
for an easy and intelligible system of voting. For one thing, they had 
a massive literacy campaign before the election, making electoral 
printed matter generally accessible* Both the Irish and LASA delega¬ 
tions mention this as an electoral plus* Nicaragua also put a high 
priority on getting a complete registration list and getting the voters 
registered* The Irish delegation noted that “Recent elections in other 
Central American countries such as El Salvador and Guatemala did not 
introduce such measures, and there was considerable debate concern¬ 
ing the validity of their registers* which were based on out-of-date 
census figures* incomplete official registers of population changes, and 
other sources” (p* 5). Nicaragua also deliberately avoided transparent 
ballot boxes* ID stamping, and any other mechanism that would allow 
the authorities to identify whether or how somebody had voted* LASA 
points out that *

The ballots were also printed on heavy opaque white paper* The 
contrast with Somoza-era elections is striking* The Somozas used 
translucent ballots, so virtually everyone assumed that their ballot 
was not secret* The same problem occurred in the 1984 elections 
in El Salvador, where thin-paper ballots were deposited in trans¬ 
parent ballot boxes. The vote in Nicaragua in 1984 was truly a 
secret ballot (p, 14)4 

In Nicaragua, also, there was proportional voting, which made it possi¬
