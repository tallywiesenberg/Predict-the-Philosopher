not required to vote* or to have ID cards stamped indicating that they 
had* And the Sandinistas did not kill ordinary citizens on a daily basis, 
as was true in the “death-squad democracies*” Thus turnout was far 
more meaningful in the Nicaraguan election than in the ones held in 
El Salvador and Guatemala—the public was free to abstain as well as 
to vote for opposition parties* 

The U*S* mass media disposed of this problem mainly by massive 
suppression* They simply ignored the contra-U*S, campaign for absten¬ 
tion, waged with threats and attacks on polling places and election 
workers; and they buried the fact of an effectively secret vote and the 
right not to vote, 93 just as, in parallel, they had inflated rebel disruption 
efforts in El Salvador in 1982 and 1984 and buried the voting requirement 
and other pressures to vote* 

Although the New York Times had gone out of its way to focus on 
the “challenge” of rebel opposition and alleged disruption as giving 
turnout special meaning in the Salvadoran election of 1982, 94 Stephen 
Kinzer never once mentioned that the contras attacked a number of 
polling stations and had issued radio appeals for abstention* 95 For 
Kinzer* neither these facts nor the U.S. campaign to discredit were seen 
as posing a “challenge” that made turnout meaningful in Nicaragua, 

The Irish delegation pointed out that “The Parties of the Demo¬ 
cratic Coordinating Committee [based in the business community] op¬ 
posed the voter registration, and called for a boycott of this process” 
(p, 5), and it noted that eleven polling stations were closed down by 
counterrevolutionary activities (p. 7)* The public voted in large num¬ 
bers “despite the possible dangers involved,” which suggested to the 
Irish delegation that turnout was significant and “showed how impor¬ 
tant the election was to the people” (p* 6), LASA pointed out the 
various ways in which the “main opposition” called for voter absten¬ 
tion, and cited the radio warnings broadcast into the country from 
Costa Rica threatening that voters would be killed by the contras (pp* 
16* 28). LASA also pointed out that “voter turnout was heavy,” with 
“more enthusiasm among voters in low-income areas than in more 
affluent neighborhoods,” 96 Like Time y LASA notes that the turnout did 
not quite realize the expectations of FSLN officials* but unlike Time 3

LASA points out that the rate of participation achieved “compares very 
favorably with the rates achieved in n other recent Latin American 
elections* as well as the 1984 U.S. presidential election . . (p. 16). 97 

In sum* the two observer reports discuss rebel disruption in Nicara¬ 
gua, turnout* and the meaning of that turnout. The U.S. mass media*
