the secrecy of the ballot and absence of a checkable ID card* so that 
there would have been no way to implement a threat even if one had 
been made. It suppresses the fact that the Nicaraguan army did not 
regularly murder even “counterrevolutionaries/ 1 whereas the Salvado¬ 
ran and Guatemalan armies murdered numerous people who weren't 
“revolutionaries” but were somehow in the way. In shorty propaganda 
could hardly be more brazen. 

Time's alleged “fact/ 1 that “many” people feared the removal of the 
rationing card* is contested by LASA, which states that “in our inter¬ 
views in many neighborhoods in several cities, we found no evidence 
that ration cards were being held back or withdrawn , . . for any 
reason,” They note that there were five reports filed with the supreme 
electoral council alleging intimidation by threat of withdrawal of ration 
cards, “but none of these allegations were sustained upon investiga¬ 
tion” (p. 27). Time does not indicate the source of its evidence and fails 
to provide a single illustration of the “many” cases. 

We noted earlier that Stephen Kinzer cited more claims of coercion 
in the Nicaraguan than the Guatemalan elections, a remarkable jour¬ 
nalistic achievement, given the unchallenged facts about the actual 
scale and character of repression in the two states. His playing down 
of state terror in Guatemala as a basic factor affecting the quality of the 
election in all its dimensions—the ability of candidates to run, freedom 
of speech and press, the existence of intermediate groups, endemic fear, 
and the meaning of turnout—amounts to massive deceit. His Nicarag¬ 
uan coverage also involved large-scale misrepresentation. He did not 
point out the absence of mass killings, and he failed to mention the 
absence of a coercion package—no transparent boxes, no requirement 
that an ID card be stamped, and no legal obligation to vote. Kinzer's 
one notice of the voting requirement in his fourteen articles on the 
election amounts to serious deception—he quotes a voter as follows: 
“ Tve always voted because it is always required/ he said. ‘Of course, 
the law says one thing, but after a while one realizes that voting is part 
of patriotism, and patriotism leads to long life, 5 ” 98 Kinzer's source 
implies but doesn't say directly that voting is not legally required in 
Nicaragua, and this murky statement—the closest Kinzer ever comes

to acknowledging the absence of a voting requirement—is counter¬ 
balanced by his respondent's suggestion that voting may be based on 
some kind of threat. 

Both the Irish and LASA delegations stressed the superior protection 
of secrecy in the balloting* which* in LASA's words* was "meticulously 
designed to minimize the potential for abuses'' (p. 15). They also em¬
