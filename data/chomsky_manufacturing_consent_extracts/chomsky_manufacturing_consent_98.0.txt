Cruz was given enormous play: he was continually referred to as the 
“main opposition 51 or “leading opponent” of the ruling party (without 
any supporting evidence), and his candidacy was made “an acid test of 
the Sandinistas 5 democratic intentions” {Time* Oct. 29, 1984). For the 
Times, the election would be a “sham” without Cruz (editorial, Oct. 7, 
1984), and its news columns placed “main opposition” Cruz on center 
stage, from which vantage point he could regularly denounce the pro¬ 
ceedings as a “farce” or sham. 102 The Times did have one good back¬ 
page article that provided evidence that Cruz had not intended to run 
or would not have been allowed to run by his closest Nicaraguan allies 
and U.S, officials, and that his function was, as we stated, to discredit 
the election by pretending to be interested, thus capturing press atten¬ 
tion, 103 But this low-keyed article stood alone and did not alter the 
unremitting focus on the alleged exclusion of this alleged main opposi¬ 
tion as the centerpiece of the Nicaraguan election drama. 

In focusing on an alleged “main opposition” in Nicaragua, which 
voluntarily chose not to run, while ignoring a real main opposition in 
El Salvador, excluded by force and plan, the mass media simply 
adopted without question the government’s propaganda framework. 
Sources that would speak to the condition of the “main opposition” in 
El Salvador and the significance of its exclusion—both Salvadorans and 
foreign observers—were simply ignored. 104 In the case of the Nicara¬ 
guan election, in contrast, Cruz and U.S. government officials were 
given the floor to present their themes, which were transmitted on a 
daily basis with no accompanying notice of their possible falsity and 
manipulative intent, in perfect accord with the expectations of a propa¬ 
ganda model. 

The Reagan administration not only dangled Cruz before the media, 
it tried hard to induce or bribe other candidates in the Nicaraguan 
election to withdraw in order to fulfil the prophecy of a meaningless 
election. The brazenness of this intervention by a great power was 
remarkable, but the U.S. media gave it minimal attention. They never 
denounced it as antidemocratic, they failed to link it to Cruz’s campaign 
(with its suggestion of a larger effort to discredit by boycott), and they 
never suggested that voter “turnout” was more meaningful given the 
active U.S. campaign to discredit the election. On October 31, 1984,
