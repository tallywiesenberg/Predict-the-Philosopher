The role of the media 
in contemporary politics forces us to ask what 
kind of a world and what kind of a society we 
want to live in, and in particular in what sense 
of democracy do we want this to be a democ- 
ratic society?Let me begin by counter-posing 
two different conceptions of democracy.One 
conception of democracy has it that a democ- 
ratic society is one in which the public has the 
means to participate in some meaningful way 
in the management of their own affairs and the 
means of information are open and free.
