If you 
look up democracy in the dictionary you'll get 
a definition something like that.An alternative conception of democracy is 
that the public must be barred from managing 
of their own affairs and the means of informa- 
tion must be kept narrowly and rigidly con- 
trolled.That may sound like an odd conception 
of democracy, but it's important to understand 
that it is the prevailing conception.In fact, it 
has long been, not just in operation, but even 
in theory.There's a long history that goes back 
to the earliest modern democratic revolutions 
in seventeenth century England which largely 
expresses this point of view.
