The pop- 
ulation was extremely pacifistic and saw no rea- 
son to become involved in a European war.The 
Wilson administration was actually committed 
to war and had to do something about it.They 
established a government propaganda com- 
mission, called the Creel Commission which 
succeeded, within six months, in turning a 
pacifist population into a hysterical, war-mon- 
gering population which wanted to destroy 
everything German, tear the Germans limb 
from limb, go to war and save the world.That 
was a major achievement, and it led to a further 
achievement.Right at that time and after the 
war the same techniques were used to whip up 
a hysterical Red Scare, as it was called, which 
succeeded pretty much in destroying unions 
and eliminating such dangerous problems as 
freedom of the press and freedom of political 



thought.
