There was very strong support from 
the media, from the business establishment, 
which in fact organized, pushed much of this 
work, and it was, in general, a great success.Among those who participated actively and 
enthusiastically in Wilson's war were the pro- 
gressive intellectuals, people of the John 
Dewey circle, who took great pride, as you can 
see from their own writings at the time, in hav- 
ing shown that what they called the "more 
intelligent members of the community," 
namely, themselves, were able to drive a 
reluctant population into a war by terrifying 
them and eliciting jingoist fanaticism.The 
means that were used were extensive.For 
example, there was a good deal of fabrication 
of atrocities by the Huns, Belgian babies with 
their arms torn off, all sorts of awful things that 
you still read in history books.Much of it was 
invented by the British propaganda ministry, 
whose own commitment at the time, as they 
put it in their secret deliberations, was "to 
direct the thought of most of the world."
