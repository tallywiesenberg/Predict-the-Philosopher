more crucially they wanted to control the 
thought of the more intelligent members of the 
community in the United States, who would 
then disseminate the propaganda that they 
were concocting and convert the pacifistic

worked very well.And it taught a lesson: State 
propaganda, when supported by the educated 
classes and when no deviation is permitted 
from it, can have a big effect.It was a lesson 
learned by Hitler and many others, and it has 
been pursued to this day.
