SPECTATOR DEMOCRACY 



Another group that was impressed by these 
successes was liberal democratic theorists and 
leading media figures, like, for example, Wal- 
ter Lippmann, who was the dean of American 
journalists, a major foreign and domestic pol- 
icy critic and also a major theorist of liberal 
democracy.If you take a look at his collected 
essays, you'll see that they're subtitled some- 
thing like "A Progressive Theory of Liberal 
Democratic Thought."Lippmann was 
involved in these propaganda commissions and 
recognized their achievements.He argued that 
what he called a "revolution in the art of 
democracy," could be used to "manufacture 
consent, " that is, to bring about agreement on 
the part of the public for things that they did- 
n't want by the new techniques of propaganda.He also thought that this was a good idea, in 
fact, necessary.
