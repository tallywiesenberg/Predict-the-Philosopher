It was necessary because, as he 
put it, "the common interests elude public 
opinion entirely" and can only be understood 
and managed by a "specialized class "of 
"responsible men" who are smart enough to 
figure things out.This theory asserts that only 



a small elite, the intellectual community that 
the Deweyites were talking about, can under- 
stand the common interests, what all of us 
care about, and that these things "elude the 
general public."This is a view that goes back 
hundreds of years.It's also a typical Leninist 
view.In fact, it has very close resemblance to 
the Leninist conception that a vanguard of rev- 
olutionary intellectuals take state power, 
using popular revolutions as the force that 
brings them to state power, and then drive the 
stupid masses toward a future that they're too 
dumb and incompetent to envision for them- 
selves.
