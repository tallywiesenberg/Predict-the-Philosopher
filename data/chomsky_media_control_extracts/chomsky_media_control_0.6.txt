The liberal democratic theory and 
Marxism-Leninism are very close in their 
common ideological assumptions.I think 
that's one reason why people have found it so 
easy over the years to drift from one position 
to another without any particular sense of 
change.It's just a matter of assessing where 
power is.Maybe there will be a popular revo- 
lution, and that will put us into state power; 
or maybe there won't be, in which case we'll 
just work for the people with real power: the 
business community.But we'll do the same 
thing.
