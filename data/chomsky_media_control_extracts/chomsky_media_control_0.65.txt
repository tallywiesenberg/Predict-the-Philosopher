We'll drive the stupid masses toward a 
world that they're too dumb to understand for 
themselves.Lippmann backed this up by a pretty elab- 
orated theory of progressive democracy.He 
argued that in a properly functioning democ- 
racy there are classes of citizens.There is first 
of all the class of citizens who have to take 
some active role in running general affairs.That's the specialized class.
