Now there are two "functions" in a 
democracy: The specialized class, the respon- 
sible men, carry out the executive function, 
which means they do the thinking and plan- 
ning and understand the common interests.Then, there is the bewildered herd, and they 
have a function in democracy too.Their func- 
tion in a democracy, he said, is to be "specta- 
tors," not participants in action.But they have 
more of a function than that, because it's a 



democracy.Occasionally they are allowed to 
lend their weight to one or another member of 
the specialized class.
