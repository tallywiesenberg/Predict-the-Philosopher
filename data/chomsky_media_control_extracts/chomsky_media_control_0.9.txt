We have to tame the bewil- 
dered herd, not allow the bewildered herd to 
rage and trample and destroy things.It's pretty 
much the same logic that says that it would 
be improper to let a three-year-old run across 
the street.You don't give a three-year-old that 
kind of freedom because the three-year-old 
doesn't know how to handle that freedom.Correspondingly, you don't allow the bewil- 
dered herd to become participants in action.They'll just cause trouble.
