So we need something to tame the bewil- 
dered herd, and that something is this new 
revolution in the art of democracy: the manu- 
facture of consent.The media, the schools, and 
popular culture have to be divided.For the 
political class and the decision makers they 
have to provide them some tolerable sense of 
reality, although they also have to instill the 
proper beliefs.Just remember, there is an 
unstated premise here.The unstated premise 
— and even the responsible men have to dis- 
guise this from themselves — has to do with the 
question of how they get into the position 
where they have the authority to make deci- 
sions.
