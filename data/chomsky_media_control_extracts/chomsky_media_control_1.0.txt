The role of the media 
in contemporary politics forces us to ask what 
kind of a world and what kind of a society we 
want to live in, and in particular in what sense 
of democracy do we want this to be a democ- 
ratic society? Let me begin by counter-posing 
two different conceptions of democracy. One 
conception of democracy has it that a democ- 
ratic society is one in which the public has the 
means to participate in some meaningful way 
in the management of their own affairs and the 
means of information are open and free. If you 
look up democracy in the dictionary you'll get 
a definition something like that. 



An alternative conception of democracy is 
that the public must be barred from managing 
of their own affairs and the means of informa- 
tion must be kept narrowly and rigidly con- 
trolled. That may sound like an odd conception 
of democracy, but it's important to understand 
that it is the prevailing conception. In fact, it 
has long been, not just in operation, but even 
in theory. There's a long history that goes back 
to the earliest modern democratic revolutions 
in seventeenth century England which largely 
expresses this point of view. I'm just going to 
keep to the modern period and say a few words 
about how that notion of democracy develops 
and why and how the problem of media and dis- 
information enters within that context.

Let's begin with the first modern government 
propaganda operation. That was under the 
Woodrow Wilson Administration. Woodrow 
Wilson was elected President in 1916 on the
