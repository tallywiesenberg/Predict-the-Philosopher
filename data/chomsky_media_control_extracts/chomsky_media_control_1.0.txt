The way they do that, of course, is by 
serving people with real power.The people 
with real power are the ones who own the soci- 
ety, which is a pretty narrow group.If the spe- 
cialized class can come along and say, I can 
serve your interests, then they'll be part of the 
executive group.You've got to keep that quiet.That means they have to have instilled in them 
the beliefs and doctrines that will serve the 
interests of private power.
