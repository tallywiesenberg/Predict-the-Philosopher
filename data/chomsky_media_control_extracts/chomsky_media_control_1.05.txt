Unless they can 
master that skill, they're not part of the spe- 



cialized class.So we have one kind of educa- 
tional system directed to the responsible men, 
the specialized class.They have to be deeply 
indoctrinated in the values and interests of pri- 
vate power and the state-corporate nexus that 
represents it.If they can achieve that, then they 
can be part of the specialized class.The rest of 
the bewildered herd basically just have to be 
distracted.
