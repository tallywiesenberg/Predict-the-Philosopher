For example, the leading theologian 
and foreign policy critic Reinhold Niebuhr, 
sometimes called "the theologian of the estab- 
lishment, " the guru of George Kennan and the 
Kennedy intellectuals, put it that rationality is 
a very narrowly restricted skill.Only a small 
number of people have it.Most people are 
guided by just emotion and impulse.Those of 
us who have rationality have to create "nec- 
essary illusions" and emotionally potent 
"oversimpli-fications" to keep the naive sim- 
pletons more or less on course.This became a 



substantial part of contemporary political sci- 
ence.
