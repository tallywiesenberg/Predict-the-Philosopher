In the 1920s and early 1930s, Harold Lass- 
well, the founder of the modern field of 
communications and one of the leading Amer- 
ican political scientists, explained that we 
should not succumb to "democratic dogma- 
tisms about men being the best judges of their 
own interests."Because they're not.We're the 
best judges of the public interests.Therefore, 
just out of ordinary morality, we have to make 
sure that they don't have an opportunity to act 
on the basis of their misjudgments .In what is 
nowadays called a totalitarian state, or a mil- 
itary state, it's easy.
