You just hold a bludgeon 
over their heads, and if they get out of line you 
smash them over the head.But as society has 
become more free and democratic, you lose 
that capacity.Therefore you have to turn to the 
techniques of propaganda.The logic is clear.Propaganda is to a democracy what the blud- 
geon is to a totalitarian state.
