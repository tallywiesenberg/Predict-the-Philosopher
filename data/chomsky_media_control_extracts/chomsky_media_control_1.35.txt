The public rela- 
tions industry underwent a huge expansion at 
that time.It succeeded for some time in cre- 
ating almost total subordination of the public 
to business rule through the 1920s.This was 
so extreme that Congressional committees 
began to investigate it as we moved into the 

1930s.That's where a lot of our information 
about it comes from.Public relations is a huge industry.
