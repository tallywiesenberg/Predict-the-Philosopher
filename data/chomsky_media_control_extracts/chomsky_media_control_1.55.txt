From that 
point on — although the number of people in 
the unions increased for a while during the 
World War II, after which it started drop- 
ping — the capacity to act through the unions 
began to steadily drop.It wasn't by accident.We're now talking about the business com- 
munity, which spends lots and lots of money, 
attention, and thought into how to deal with 
these problems through the public relations 
industry and other organizations, like the 



National Association of Manufacturers and the 
Business Roundtable, and so on.They imme- 
diately set to work to try to find a way to 
counter these democratic deviations.The first trial was one year later, in 1937.
