There was a major strike, the Steel strike in 
western Pennsylvania at Johnstown.Business 
tried out a new technique oflabor destruction, 
which worked very well.Not through goon 
squads and breaking knees.That wasn't work- 
ing very well any more, but through the more 
subtle and effective means of propaganda.The 
idea was to figure out ways to turn the public 
against the strikers, to present the strikers as 
disruptive, harmful to the public and against 
the common interests.
