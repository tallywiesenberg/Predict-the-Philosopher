The common interests 
are those of "us," the businessman, the 
worker, the housewife.That's all "us."We 
want to be together and have things like har- 
mony and Americanism and working together.Then there's those bad strikers out there who 
are disruptive and causing trouble and break- 
ing harmony and violating Americanism.We've got to stop them so we can all live 
together.
