That's the whole point of good propaganda.You want to create a slogna that nobody's 
going to be against, and everybody's going to 
be for.Nobody knows what it means, because 
it doesn't mean anything.Its crucial value is 
that it diverts your attention from a question 
that does mean something: Do you support our 
policy?That's the one you're not allowed to 
talk about.
