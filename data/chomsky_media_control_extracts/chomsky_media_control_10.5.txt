world army that you can pulverize before you 
ever bother to look at them â€” which is just 
what happened. That gives relief. We were 
saved at the last minute. That's one of the ways 
in which you can keep the bewildered herd 
from paying attention to what's really going on 
around them, keep them diverted and con- 
trolled. The next one that's coming along, most 
likely, will be Cuba. That's going to require a 
continuation of the illegal economic warfare, 
possibly a revival of the extraordinary inter- 
national terrorism. The most major interna-

against Nicaragua, if you call that terrorism. 
The World Court classified it as something 
more like aggression. There's always an ideo- 
logical offensive that builds up a chimerical 



monster, then campaigns to have it crushed. 
You can't go in if they can fight back. That's 
much too dangerous. But if you are sure that 
they will be crushed, maybe we'll knock that 
one off and heave another sigh of relief.

This has been going on for quite a while. In 
May 1986, the memoirs of the released Cuban 
prisoner, Armando Valladares, came out. They 
quickly became a media sensation. I'll give you 
a couple of quotes. The media described his 
revelations as "the definitive account of the 
vast system of torture and prison by which Cas- 
tro punishes and obliterates political opposi- 
tion." It was "an inspiring and unforgettable 
account" of the "bestial prisons," inhuman tor- 
ture, [and] record of state violence [under] yet 
another of this century's mass murderers, who 
we learn, at last, from this book "has created 
a new despotism that has institutionalized tor-
