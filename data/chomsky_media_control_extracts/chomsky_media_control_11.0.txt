ture as a mechanism of social control" in "the 
hell that was the Cuba that [Valladares] lived 
in." That's the Washington Post and New York 
Times in repeated reviews. Castro was 
described as "a dictatorial goon." His atrocities 
were revealed in this book so conclusively that 
"only the most light-headed and cold-blooded 
Western intellectual will come to the tyrant's 
defense," said the Washington Post. Remem- 
ber, this is the account of what happened to one 
man. Let's say it's all true. Let's raise no ques- 



tions about what happened to the one man who 
says he was tortured. At a White House cere- 
mony marking Human Rights Day, he was sin- 
gled out by Ronald Reagan for his courage in 
enduring the horrors and sadism of this bloody 
Cuban tyrant. He was then appointed the U.S. 
representative at the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission, where he has been able to per- 
form signal services defending the Salvadoran 
and Guatemalan governments against charges 
that they conduct atrocities so massive that 
they make anything he suffered look pretty 
minor. That's the way things stand. 

That was May 1986. It was interesting, and 
it tells you something about the manufacture 
of consent. The same month, the surviving 
members of the Human Rights Group of El Sal- 
vador — the leaders had been killed — were 
arrested and tortured, including Herbert Anaya, 
who was the director. They were sent to a 
prison — LaEsperanza (hope) Prison. While they 
were in prison they continued their human 
rights work. They were lawyers, they continued 
taking affidavits. There were 432 prisoners in 
that prison. They got signed affidavits from 430 
of them in which they described, under oath, 
the torture that they had received: electrical tor- 
ture and other atrocities, including, in one case, 



torture by a North American U.S. major in uni- 
form, who is described in some detail. This is 
an unusually explicit and comprehensive tes- 
timony, probably unique in its detail about
