vador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Damascus, Tel 
Aviv, Capetown, Turkey, Washington, and a 
whole list of other states. These are all cases 
of illegal occupation and aggression and severe 
human rights abuses. If you know the facts 
about that range of examples, you'll know very 



well that Saddam Hussein's aggression and 
atrocities fall well within the range. They're 
not the most extreme. Why doesn't anybody 
come to that conclusion? The reason is that 
nobody knows. In a well-functioning propa- 
ganda system, nobody would know what I'm 
talking about when I list that range of exam- 
ples. If you bother to look, you find that those 
examples are quite appropriate. 

Take one that was ominously close to being 
perceived during the Gulf War. In February, 
right in the middle of the bombing campaign, 
the government of Lebanon requested Israel to 
observe U.N. Security Council Resolution 
425, which called on it to withdraw immedi- 
ately and unconditionally from Lebanon. That 
resolution dates from March 1978. There have 
since been two subsequent resolutions calling 
for the immediate and unconditional with- 
drawal of Israel from Lebanon. Of course it 
doesn't observe them because the United 
States backs it in maintaining that occupation. 
Meanwhile southern Lebanon is terrorized. 
There are big torture-chambers with horrifying 
things going on. It's used as a base for attack- 
ing other parts of Lebanon. Since 1978, 
Lebanon was invaded, the city of Beirut was 
bombed, about 20,000 people were killed, about 



80 percent of them civilians, hospitals were 
destroyed, and more terror, looting, and robbery 
was inflicted. All fine, the United States 
backed it. That's just one case. You didn't see 
anything in the media about it or any discus- 
sion about whether Israel and the United States 
should observe U.N. Security Council Resolu- 
tion 425 or any of the other resolutions, nor did 
anyone call for the bombing of Tel Aviv,
