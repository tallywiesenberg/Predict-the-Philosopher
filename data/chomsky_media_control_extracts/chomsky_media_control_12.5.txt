although by the principles upheld by two-thirds 
of the population, we should. After all, that's 
illegal occupation and severe human rights 
abuses. That's just one case. There are much 
worse ones. The Indonesian invasion of East 
Timor knocked off about 200,000 people. They 
all look minor by that one. That was strongly 
backed by the United States and is still going 
on with major United States diplomatic and 
military support. We can go on and on. 



THE GULF WAR 



That tells you how a well-functioning propa- 
ganda system works. People can believe that 
when we use force against Iraq and Kuwait it's 
because we really observe the principle that 
illegal occupation and human rights abuses 
should be met by force. They don't see what it 
would mean if those principles were applied to 
U.S. behavior. That's a success of propaganda 
of quite a spectacular type. 

Let's take a look at another case. If you look 
closely at the coverage of the war since August 
(1990), you'll notice that there are a couple of 
striking voices missing. For example, there is 
an Iraqi democratic opposition, in fact, a very 
courageous and quite substantial Iraqi democ- 
ratic opposition. They, of course, function in 
exile because they couldn't survive in Iraq. 
They are in Europe primarily. They are 
bankers, engineers, architects â€” people like 
that. They are articulate, they have voices, and 
they speak. The previous February, when Sad- 
dam Hussein was still George Bush's favorite 
friend and trading partner, they actually came 
to Washington, according to Iraqi democratic 
opposition sources, with a plea for some kind 



of support for a demand of theirs calling for a 
parliamentary democracy in Iraq. They were 
totally rebuffed, because the United States had 
no interest in it. There was no reaction to this
