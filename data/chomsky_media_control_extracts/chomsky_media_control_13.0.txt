in the public record. 

Since August it became a little harder to 
ignore their existence. In August we suddenly 
turned against Saddam Hussein after having 
favored him for many years. Here was an Iraqi 
democratic opposition who ought to have some 
thoughts about the matter. They would be 
happy to see Saddam Hussein drawn and quar- 
tered. He killed their brothers, tortured their 
sisters, and drove them out of the country. 
They have been fighting against his tyranny 
throughout the whole time that Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush were cherishing him. What 
about their voices? Take a look at the national 
media and see how much you can find about 
the Iraqi democratic opposition from August 
through March (1991). You can't find a word. 
It's not that they're inarticulate. They have 
statements, proposals, calls and demands. If 
you look at them, you find that they're indis- 
tinguishable from those of the American peace 
movement. They're against Saddam Hussein 
and they're against the war against Iraq. They 
don't want their country destroyed. What they 



want is a peaceful resolution, and they knew 
perfectly well that it might have been achiev- 
able. That's the wrong view and therefore 
they're out. We don't hear a word about the 
Iraqi democratic opposition. If you want to find 
out about them, pick up the German press, or 
the British press. They don't say much about 
them, but they're less controlled than we are 
and they say something. 

This is a spectacular achievement of pro- 
paganda. First, that the voices of the Iraqi 
democrats are completely excluded, and sec- 
ond, that nobody notices it. That's interesting, 
too. It takes a really deeply indoctrinated pop- 
ulation not to notice that we're not hearing the 
voices of the Iraqi democratic opposition and 
not asking the question, Why? and finding out 
the obvious answer: because the Iraqi democ- 
rats have their own thoughts; they agree with 
the international peace movement and there- 
fore they're out.
