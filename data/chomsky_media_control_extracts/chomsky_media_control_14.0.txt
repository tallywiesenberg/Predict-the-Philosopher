ered to point out the conclusion that follows: 
No reason was given for going to war. None. 
No reason was given for going to war that could 
not be refuted by a literate teenager in about 
two minutes. That again is the hallmark of a 
totalitarian culture. It ought to frighten us, that 
we are so deeply totalitarian that we can be dri-

revealed something interesting. People were 
asked, If Iraq would agree to withdraw from

the press â€” you can find a column by Alex Cock- 
burn in the Los Angeles Times, who argued that 
it would be a good idea. The people who were 
answering that question thought, I'm alone, but 
that's what I think. Suppose they knew that 
they weren't alone, that other people thought 
it, like the Iraqi democratic opposition. Suppose 
that they knew that this was not hypothetical, 
that in fact Iraq had made exactly such an offer. 
It had been released by high U.S. officials just 
eight days earlier. On January 2, these officials 
had released an Iraqi offer to withdraw totally 
from Kuwait in return for consideration by the 
Security Council of the Arab-Israeli conflict and 
the problem of weapons of mass destruction. 
The United States had been refusing to negoti-
