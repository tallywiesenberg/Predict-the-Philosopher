ate this issue since well before the invasion of 
Kuwait. Suppose that people had known that 



the offer was actually on the table and that it 
was widely supported and that in fact it's 
exactly the kind of thing that any rational per- 
son would do if they were interested in peace, 
as we do in other cases, in the rare cases that 
we do want to reverse aggression. Suppose that 
it had been known. You can make your own 
guesses, but I would assume that the two-thirds 
would probably have risen to 98 percent of the 
population. Here you have the great successes 
of propaganda. Probably not one person who 
answered the poll knew any of the things I've 
just mentioned. The people thought they were 
alone. Therefore it was possible to proceed with 
the war policy without opposition. 

There was a good deal of discussion about 
whether sanctions would work. You had the 
head of the CIA come up and discuss whether 
sanctions would work. However, there was no 
discussion of a much more obvious question: 
Had sanctions already worked? The answer is 
yes, apparently they had â€” probably by late 
August, very likely by late December. It was 
very hard to think up any other reason for the 
Iraqi offers of withdrawal, which were authen- 
ticated or in some cases released by high U.S. 
officials, who described them as "serious" and 
"negotiable." So the real question is: Had sane- 



tions already worked? Was there a way out? 
Was there a way out in terms quite acceptable 
to the general population, the world at large 
and the Iraqi democratic opposition? These 
questions were not discussed, and it's crucial 
for a well-functioning propaganda system that 
they not be discussed. That enables the chair- 
man of the Republican National Committee to 
say that if any Democrat had been in office, 
Kuwait would not be liberated today. He can 
say that and no Democrat would get up and say 
that if I were president it would have been lib- 
erated not only today but six months ago,
