because there were opportunities then that I 
would have pursued and Kuwait would have 
been liberated without killing tens of thou- 
sands of people and without causing an envi- 
ronmental catastrophe. No Democrat would 
say that because no Democrat took that posi- 
tion. Henry Gonzalez and Barbara Boxer took 
that position. But the number of people who 
took it is so marginal that it's virtually nonex- 
istent. Given the fact that almost no Democ- 
ratic politician would say that, Clayton 
Yeutter is free to make his statements. 

When Scud missiles hit Israel, nobody in 
the press applauded. Again, that's an interest- 
ing fact about a well-functioning propaganda 



system. We might ask, why not? After all, Sad- 
dam Hussein's arguments were as good as 
George Bush's arguments. What were they, 
after all? Let's just take Lebanon. Saddam Hus- 
sein says that he can't stand annexation. He 
can't let Israel annex the Syrian Golan Heights 
and East Jerusalem, in opposition to the unan-

can't stand annexation. He can't stand aggres-

Lebanon since 1978 in violation of Security 
Council resolutions that it refuses to abide by. 
In the course of that period it attacked all of 
Lebanon, still bombs most of Lebanon at will. 
He can't stand it. He might have read the 
Amnesty International report on Israeli atroc- 
ities in the West Bank. His heart is bleeding. 
He can't stand it. Sanctions can't work because 
the United States vetoes them. Negotiations 
won't work because the United States blocks 
them. What's left but force? He's been waiting 
for years. Thirteen years in the case of 
Lebanon, 20 years in the case of the West Bank. 
You've heard that argument before. The only 
difference between that argument and the one 
you heard is that Saddam Hussein could truly 
say sanctions and negotiations can't work 
because the United States blocks them. But
