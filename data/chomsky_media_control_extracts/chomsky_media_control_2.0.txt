So you have people arguing about 
support for the troops?"Of course I don't not 
support them."Then you've won.That's like 
Americanism and harmony.We're all 
together, empty slogans, let's join in, let's 
make sure we don't have these bad people 
around to disrupt our harmony with their talk 
about class struggle, rights and that sort of 
business.
