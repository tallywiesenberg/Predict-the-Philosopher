then disseminate the propaganda that they 
were concocting and convert the pacifistic 



country to wartime hysteria. That worked. It 
worked very well. And it taught a lesson: State 
propaganda, when supported by the educated 
classes and when no deviation is permitted 
from it, can have a big effect. It was a lesson 
learned by Hitler and many others, and it has 
been pursued to this day. 



SPECTATOR DEMOCRACY 



Another group that was impressed by these 
successes was liberal democratic theorists and 
leading media figures, like, for example, Wal- 
ter Lippmann, who was the dean of American 
journalists, a major foreign and domestic pol- 
icy critic and also a major theorist of liberal 
democracy. If you take a look at his collected 
essays, you'll see that they're subtitled some- 
thing like "A Progressive Theory of Liberal 
Democratic Thought." Lippmann was 
involved in these propaganda commissions and 
recognized their achievements. He argued that 
what he called a "revolution in the art of 
democracy," could be used to "manufacture 
consent, " that is, to bring about agreement on 
the part of the public for things that they did- 
n't want by the new techniques of propaganda. 
He also thought that this was a good idea, in 
fact, necessary. It was necessary because, as he 
put it, "the common interests elude public 
opinion entirely" and can only be understood 
and managed by a "specialized class "of 
"responsible men" who are smart enough to 
figure things out. This theory asserts that only 



a small elite, the intellectual community that 
the Deweyites were talking about, can under- 
stand the common interests, what all of us 
care about, and that these things "elude the
