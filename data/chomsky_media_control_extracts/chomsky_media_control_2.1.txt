They're trying to instill the right values.In fact, they have a conception of what democ- 
racy ought to be: It ought to be a system in 
which the specialized class is trained to work 
in the service of the masters, the people who 
own the society.The rest of the population 
ought to be deprived of any form of organiza- 
tion, because organization just causes trouble.They ought to be sitting alone in front of the 
TV and having drilled into their heads the mes- 
sage, which says, the only value in life is to 
have more commodities or live like that rich 
middle class family you're watching and to 
have nice values like harmony and American- 
ism.That's all there is in life.
