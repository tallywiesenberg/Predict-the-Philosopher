You may think 
in your own head that there's got to be some- 
thing more in life than this, but since you're 
watching the tube alone you assume, I must be 
crazy, because that's all that's going on over 
there.And since there is no organization per- 
mitted — that's absolutely crucial — you never 
have a way of finding out whether you are 
crazy, and you just assume it, because it's the 
natural thing to assume.So that's the ideal.Great efforts are made 
in trying to achieve that ideal.Obviously, 
there is a certain conception behind it.
