Every once in a while you call on 
them to chant meaningless slogans like "Sup- 
port our troops."You've got to keep them 
pretty scared, because unless they're properly 



scared and frightened of all kinds of devils that 
are going to destroy them from outside or 
inside or somewhere, they may start to think, 
which is very dangerous, because they're not 
competent to think.Therefore it's important 
to distract them and marginalize them.That's one conception of democracy.In 
fact, going back to the business community, 
the last legal victory for labor really was 1935, 
the Wagner Act.
