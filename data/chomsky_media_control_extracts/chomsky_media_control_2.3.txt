After the war came, the unions 
declined as did a very rich working class cul- 
ture that was associated with the unions.That 
was destroyed.We moved to a business-run 
society at a remarkable level.This is the only 
state -capitalist industrial society which does- 
n't have even the normal social contract that 
you find in comparable societies.Outside of 
South Africa, I guess, this is the only industrial 
society that doesn't have national health care.
