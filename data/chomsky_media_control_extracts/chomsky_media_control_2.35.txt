There's no general commitment to even min- 
imal standards of survival for the parts of the 
population who can't follow those rules and 
gain things for themselves individually.Unions are virtually nonexistent.Other forms 
of popular structure are virtually nonexistent.There are no political parties or organizations.It's a long way toward the ideal, at least struc- 
turally.
