Usually the 
population is pacifist, just like they were dur- 
ing the First World War.The public sees no rea- 
son to get involved in foreign adventures, 
killing, and torture.So you have to whip them 
up.And to whip them up you have to frighten 
them.Bernays himself had an important 
achievement in this respect.
