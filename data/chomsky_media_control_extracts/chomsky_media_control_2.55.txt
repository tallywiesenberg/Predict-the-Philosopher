He was the per- 
son who ran the public relations campaign for 
the United Fruit Company in 1954, when the 
United States moved in to overthrow the cap- 
italist-democratic government of Guatemala 
and installed a murderous death-squad society, 
which remains that way to the present day 
with constant infusions of U.S. aid to prevent 
in more than empty form democratic devia- 
tions.It's necessary to constantly ram through 
domestic programs which the public is 
opposed to, because there is no reason for the 
public to be in favor of domestic programs that 
are harmful to them.This, too, takes extensive 
propaganda.We've seen a lot of this in the last 
ten years.The Reagan programs were over- 



whelmingly unpopular.
