Voters in the 1984 
"Reagan landslide," by about three to two, 
hoped that his policies would not be enacted.If you take particular programs, like arma- 
ments, cutting back on social spending, etc., 
almost every one of them was overwhelmingly 
opposed by the public.But as long as people are 
marginalized and distracted and have no way 
to organize or articulate their sentiments, or 
even know that others have these sentiments, 
people who said that they prefer social spend- 
ing to military spending, who gave that answer 
on polls, as people overwhelmingly did, 
assumed that they were the only people with 
that crazy idea in their heads.They never heard 
it from anywhere else.Nobody's supposed to 
think that.
