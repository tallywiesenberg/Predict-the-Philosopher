Therefore, if you do think it and you 
answer it in apoll, you just assume that you're 
sort of weird.Since there's no way to get 
together with other people who share or rein- 
force that view and help you articulate it, you 
feel like an oddity, an oddball.So you just stay 
on the side and you don't pay any attention to 
what's going on.You look at something else, 
like the Superbowl.To a certain extent, then, that ideal was 
achieved, but never completely.
