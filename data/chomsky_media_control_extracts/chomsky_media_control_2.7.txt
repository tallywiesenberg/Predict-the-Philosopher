There are insti- 
tutions which it has as yet been impossible to 



destroy.The churches, for example, still exist.A large part of the dissident activity in the 
United States comes out of the churches, for 
the simple reason that they're there.So when 
you go to a European country and give a polit- 
ical talk, it may very likely be in the union hall.Here that won't happen, because unions first 
of all barely exist, and if they do exist they're 
not political organizations.
