It was called the 
"Vietnam Syndrome."The Vietnam Syn- 
drome, a term that began to come up around 
1970, has actually been defined on occasion.The Reaganite intellectual Norman Podhoretz 
defined it as "the sickly inhibitions against the 
use of military force."There were these sickly 
inhibitions against violence on the part of a 
large part of the public.People just didn't 
understand why we should go around torturing 
people and killing people and carpet bombing 
them.
