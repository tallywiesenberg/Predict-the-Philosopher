Then, there is the bewildered herd, and they 
have a function in democracy too. Their func- 
tion in a democracy, he said, is to be "specta- 
tors," not participants in action. But they have 
more of a function than that, because it's a 



democracy. Occasionally they are allowed to 
lend their weight to one or another member of 
the specialized class. In other words, they're 
allowed to say, "We want you to be our leader" 
or "We want you to be our leader." That's 
because it's a democracy and not a totalitarian 
state. That's called an election. But once 
they've lent their weight to one or another 
member of the specialized class they're sup- 
posed to sink back and become spectators of 
action, but not participants. That's in a prop- 
erly functioning democracy. 

And there's a logic behind it. There's even 
a kind of compelling moral principle behind 
it. The compelling moral principle is that the 
mass of the public are just too stupid to be 
able to understand things. If they try to par- 
ticipate in managing their own affairs, they're 
just going to cause trouble. Therefore, it 
would be immoral and improper to permit 
them to do this. We have to tame the bewil- 
dered herd, not allow the bewildered herd to 
rage and trample and destroy things. It's pretty 
much the same logic that says that it would 
be improper to let a three-year-old run across 
the street. You don't give a three-year-old that 
kind of freedom because the three-year-old 
doesn't know how to handle that freedom. 



Correspondingly, you don't allow the bewil- 
dered herd to become participants in action. 
They'll just cause trouble. 

So we need something to tame the bewil- 
dered herd, and that something is this new 
revolution in the art of democracy: the manu- 
facture of consent. The media, the schools, and 
popular culture have to be divided. For the 
political class and the decision makers they
