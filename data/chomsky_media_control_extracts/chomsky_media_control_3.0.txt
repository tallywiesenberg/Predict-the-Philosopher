It's very dangerous for a population to be 
overcome by these sickly inhibitions, as 
Goebbels understood, because then there's a 
limit on foreign adventures.It's necessary, as 
the Washington Post put it rather proudly dur- 
ing the Gulf War hysteria, to instill in people 



respect for "martial value."That's important.If you want to have a violent society that uses 
force around the world to achieve the ends of 
its own domestic elite, it's necessary to have 
a proper appreciation of the martial virtues and 
none of these sickly inhibitions about using 
violence.So that's the Vietnam Syndrome.
