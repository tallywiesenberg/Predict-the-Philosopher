It's 
necessary to overcome that one.REPRESENTATION AS REALITY 



It's also necessary to completely falsify history.That's another way to overcome these sickly 
inhibitions, to make it look as if when we 
attack and destroy somebody we're really pro- 
tecting and defending ourselves against major 
aggressors and monsters and so on.There has 
been a huge effort since the Vietnam war to 
reconstruct the history of that.Too many peo- 
ple began to understand what was really going 
on.
