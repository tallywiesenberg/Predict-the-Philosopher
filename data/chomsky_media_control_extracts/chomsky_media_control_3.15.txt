That was the 
phrase used by Adlai Stevenson and others.It 
was necessary to make that the official and well 
understood picture.That's worked pretty well.When you have total control over the media and 
the educational system and scholarship is con- 
formist, you can get that across.One indication 
of it was revealed in a study done at the Uni- 
versity of Massachusetts on attitudes toward 
the current Gulf crisis â€” a study of beliefs and 
attitudes in television watching.
