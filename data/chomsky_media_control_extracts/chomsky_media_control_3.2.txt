One of the 
questions asked in that study was, How many 
Vietnamese casualties would you estimate 
that there were during the Vietnam war?The 
average response on the part of Americans today 
is about 1 00,000.The official figure is about two 
million.The actual figure is probably three to 
four million.The people who conducted the 
study raised an appropriate question: What 
would we think about German political culture 
if, when you asked people today how many Jews 
died in the Holocaust, they estimated about 
300,000?
