In this particular 
case it worked.This is true on every topic.Pick 
the topic you like: the Middle East, interna- 
tional terrorism, Central America, whatever it 



is â€” the picture of the world that's presented to 
the public has only the remotest relation to 
reality.The truth of the matter is buried under 
edifice after edifice of lies upon lies.It's all been 
a marvelous success from the point of view in 
deterring the threat of democracy, achieved 
under conditions of freedom, which is 
extremely interesting.
