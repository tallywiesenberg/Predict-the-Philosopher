It's grown quite a lot since the 1960s.In 
the 1960s the dissident culture first of all was 
extremely slow in developing.There was no 
protest against the Indochina war until years 
after the United States had started bombing 
South Vietnam.When it did grow it was a very 
narrow dissident movement, mostly students 
and young people.By the 1970s that had 
changed considerably.
