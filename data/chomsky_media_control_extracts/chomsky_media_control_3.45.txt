Major popular move- 
ments had developed: the environmental 
movement, the feminist movement, the anti- 
nuclear movement, and others.In the 1980s 
there was an even greater expansion to the sol- 
idarity movements, which is something very 
new and important in the history of at least 
American, and maybe even world dissidence.These were movements that not only 
protested but actually involved themselves, 
often intimately, in the lives of suffering peo- 
ple elsewhere.They learned a great deal from 
it and had quite a civilizing effect on main- 
stream America.All of this has made a very 
large difference.
