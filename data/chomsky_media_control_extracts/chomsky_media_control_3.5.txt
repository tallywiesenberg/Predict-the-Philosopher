Anyone who has been 
involved in this kind of activity for many years 



must be aware of this.I know myself that the 
kind of talks I give today in the most reac- 
tionary parts of the country — central Georgia, 
rural Kentucky, etc.— are talks of the kind that 
I couldn't have given at the peak of the peace 
movement to the most active peace movement 
audience.Now you can give them anywhere.People may agree or not agree, but at least they 
understand what you're talking about and 
there's some sort of common ground that you 
can pursue.
