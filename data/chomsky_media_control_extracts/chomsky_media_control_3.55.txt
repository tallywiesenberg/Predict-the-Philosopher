These are all signs of the civilizing effect, 
despite all the propaganda, despite all the 
efforts to control thought and manufacture 
consent.Nevertheless, people are acquiring an 
ability and a willingness to think things 
through.Skepticism about power has grown, 
and attitudes have changed on many, many 
issues.It's kind of slow, maybe even glacial, 
but perceptible and important.Whether it's 
fast enough to make a significant difference in 
what happens in the world is another question.
