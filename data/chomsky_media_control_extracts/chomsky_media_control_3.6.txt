Just to take one familiar example of it: The 
famous gender gap.In the 1960s attitudes of 
men and women were approximately the 
same on such matters as the "martial virtues" 
and the sickly inhibitions against the use of 
military force.Nobody, neither men nor 



women, were suffering from those sickly 
inhibitions in the early 1960s.The responses 
were the same.Everybody thought that the use 
of violence to suppress people out there was 
just right.
