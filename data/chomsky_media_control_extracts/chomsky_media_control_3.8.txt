There is a very characteristic development 
going on in the United States now.It's not the 
first country in the world that's done this.There are growing domestic social and eco- 
nomic problems, in fact, maybe catastrophes.Nobody in power has any intention of doing 
anything about them.If you look at the 
domestic programs of the administrations of 
the past ten years — I include here the Democ- 
ratic opposition — there's really no serious pro- 
posal about what to do about the severe 
problems of health, education, homelessness, 
joblessness, crime, soaring criminal popula- 
tions, jails, deterioration in the inner cities — 
the whole raft of problems.
