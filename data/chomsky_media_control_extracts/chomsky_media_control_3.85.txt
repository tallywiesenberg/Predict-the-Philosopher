You all know about 
them, and they're all getting worse.Just in the 
two years that George Bush has been in office 
three million more children crossed the 
poverty line, the debt is zooming, educational 
standards are declining, real wages are now 
back to the level of about the late 1950s for 
much of the population, and nobody's doing 



anything about it.In such circumstances 
you've got to divert the bewildered herd, 
because if they start noticing this they may not 
like it, since they're the ones suffering from it.Just having them watch the Superbowl and the 
sitcoms may not be enough.You have to whip 
them up into fear of enemies.
