You could 
always defend yourself against the Russians.But they're losing their attractiveness as an 
enemy, and it's getting harder and harder to use 
that one, so some new ones have to be conjured 
up.In fact, people have quite unfairly criticized 
George Bush for being unable to express or 
articulate what's really driving us now.That's 
very unfair.Prior to about the mid-1980s, when 
you were asleep you would just play the record: 
the Russians are coming.
