pletons more or less on course. This became a 



substantial part of contemporary political sci- 
ence. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Harold Lass- 
well, the founder of the modern field of 
communications and one of the leading Amer- 
ican political scientists, explained that we 
should not succumb to "democratic dogma- 
tisms about men being the best judges of their 
own interests." Because they're not. We're the 
best judges of the public interests. Therefore, 
just out of ordinary morality, we have to make 
sure that they don't have an opportunity to act 
on the basis of their misjudgments . In what is 
nowadays called a totalitarian state, or a mil- 
itary state, it's easy. You just hold a bludgeon 
over their heads, and if they get out of line you 
smash them over the head. But as society has 
become more free and democratic, you lose 
that capacity. Therefore you have to turn to the 
techniques of propaganda. The logic is clear. 
Propaganda is to a democracy what the blud- 
geon is to a totalitarian state. That's wise and 
good because, again, the common interests 
elude the bewildered herd. They can't figure 
them out. 



PUBLIC RELATIONS 

The United States pioneered the public rela- 
tions industry. Its commitment was "to con- 
trol the public mind/' as its leaders put it. They 
learned a lot from the successes of the Creel 
Commission and the successes in creating the 
Red Scare and its aftermath. The public rela- 
tions industry underwent a huge expansion at 
that time. It succeeded for some time in cre- 
ating almost total subordination of the public 
to business rule through the 1920s. This was 
so extreme that Congressional committees 
began to investigate it as we moved into the 

1930s. That's where a lot of our information 
about it comes from. 

Public relations is a huge industry. They're
