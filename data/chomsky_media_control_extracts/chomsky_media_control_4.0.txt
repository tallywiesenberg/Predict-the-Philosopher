But he lost that one 
and he's got to make up new ones, just like the 
Reaganite public relations apparatus did in the 
1980s.So it was international terrorists and 
narco-traffickers and crazed Arabs and Saddam 



Hussein, the new Hitler, was going to conquer 
the world.They've got to keep coming up one 
after another.You frighten the population, ter- 
rorize them, intimidate them so that they're 
too afraid to travel and cower in fear.Then you 
have a magnificent victory over Grenada, 
Panama, or some other defenseless third- 
world army that you can pulverize before you 
ever bother to look at them â€” which is just 
what happened.
