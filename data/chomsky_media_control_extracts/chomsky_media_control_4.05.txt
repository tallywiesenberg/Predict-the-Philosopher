That gives relief.We were 
saved at the last minute.That's one of the ways 
in which you can keep the bewildered herd 
from paying attention to what's really going on 
around them, keep them diverted and con- 
trolled.The next one that's coming along, most 
likely, will be Cuba.That's going to require a 
continuation of the illegal economic warfare, 
possibly a revival of the extraordinary inter- 
national terrorism.
