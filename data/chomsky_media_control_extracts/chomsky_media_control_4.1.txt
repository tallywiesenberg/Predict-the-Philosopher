The most major interna- 
tional terrorism organized yet has been the 
Kennedy administration's Operation Mon- 
goose, then the things that followed along, 
against Cuba.There's been nothing remotely 
comparable to it except perhaps the war 
against Nicaragua, if you call that terrorism.The World Court classified it as something 
more like aggression.There's always an ideo- 
logical offensive that builds up a chimerical 



monster, then campaigns to have it crushed.You can't go in if they can fight back.
