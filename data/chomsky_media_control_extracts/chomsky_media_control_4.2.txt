I'll give you 
a couple of quotes.The media described his 
revelations as "the definitive account of the 
vast system of torture and prison by which Cas- 
tro punishes and obliterates political opposi- 
tion."It was "an inspiring and unforgettable 
account" of the "bestial prisons," inhuman tor- 
ture, [and] record of state violence [under] yet 
another of this century's mass murderers, who 
we learn, at last, from this book "has created 
a new despotism that has institutionalized tor- 
ture as a mechanism of social control" in "the 
hell that was the Cuba that [Valladares] lived 
in."That's the Washington Post and New York 
Times in repeated reviews.Castro was 
described as "a dictatorial goon."
