were revealed in this book so conclusively that 
"only the most light-headed and cold-blooded 
Western intellectual will come to the tyrant's

ber, this is the account of what happened to one 
man.Let's say it's all true.Let's raise no ques- 



tions about what happened to the one man who 
says he was tortured.At a White House cere- 
mony marking Human Rights Day, he was sin- 
gled out by Ronald Reagan for his courage in 
enduring the horrors and sadism of this bloody 
Cuban tyrant.
