He was then appointed the U.S. 
representative at the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission, where he has been able to per- 
form signal services defending the Salvadoran 
and Guatemalan governments against charges

members of the Human Rights Group of El Sal- 
vador — the leaders had been killed — were 
arrested and tortured, including Herbert Anaya, 
who was the director.
