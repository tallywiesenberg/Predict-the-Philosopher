This is 
an unusually explicit and comprehensive tes- 
timony, probably unique in its detail about 
what's going on in a torture chamber.This 
160-page report of the prisoners' sworn testi- 
mony was sneaked out of prison, along with a 
videotape which was taken showing people tes- 
tifying in prison about their torture.It was dis- 
tributed by the Marin County Interfaith Task 
Force.The national press refused to cover it.The TV stations refused to run it.
