There was an 
article in the local Marin County newspaper, 
the San Francisco Examiner, and I think that's 
all.No one else would touch it.This was a time 
when there was more than a few "light-headed 
and cold-blooded Western intellectuals" who 
were singing the praises of Jose Napoleon 
Duarte and of Ronald Reagan.Anaya was not 
the subject of any tributes.He didn't get on 
Human Rights Day.
