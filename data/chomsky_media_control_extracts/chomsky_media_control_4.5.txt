spending by now something on the order of a 
billion dollars a year. All along its commitment 
was to controlling the public mind. In the 

1930s, big problems arose again, as they had 
during the First World War. There was a huge 
depression and substantial labor organizing. In 
fact, in 1935 labor won its first major legisla- 
tive victory, namely, the right to organize, with 
the Wagner Act. That raised two serious prob- 



lems. For one thing, democracy was misfunc- 
tioning. The bewildered herd was actually win- 
ning legislative victories, and it's not supposed 
to work that way. The other problem was that 
itwasbecomingpossibleforpeopletoorganize. 
People have to be atomized and segregated and 
alone. They're not supposed to organize, 
becausethen they might be something beyond 
spectators of action. They might actually be 
participants if many people with limited 
resources could get together to enter the polit- 
ical arena. That's really threatening, A major 
response was taken on the part of business to 
ensure that this would be the last legislative 
victory for labor and that it would be the begin- 
ning of the end of this democratic deviation of 
popular organization. It worked. That was the 
last legislative victory for labor. From that 
point on — although the number of people in 
the unions increased for a while during the 
World War II, after which it started drop- 
ping — the capacity to act through the unions 
began to steadily drop. It wasn't by accident. 
We're now talking about the business com- 
munity, which spends lots and lots of money, 
attention, and thought into how to deal with 
these problems through the public relations 
industry and other organizations, like the 



National Association of Manufacturers and the 
Business Roundtable, and so on. They imme- 
diately set to work to try to find a way to 
counter these democratic deviations. 

The first trial was one year later, in 1937.
