He wasn't appointed to 
anything.He was released in a prisoner 
exchange and then assassinated, apparently by 
the U.S. -backed security forces.Very little infor- 
mation about that ever appeared.The media 
never asked whether exposure of the atroci- 
ties — instead of sitting on them and silencing 
them — might have saved his life.This tells you something about the way a 
well-functioning system of consent manufac- 
turing works.
