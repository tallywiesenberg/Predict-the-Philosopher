Let's 
turn finally to that.Let me begin with this Uni- 
versity of Massachusetts study that I men- 
tioned before.It has some interesting 
conclusions.In the study people were asked 
whether they thought that the United States 
should intervene with force to reverse illegal 
occupation or serious human rights abuses.By 
about two to one, people in the United States 
thought we should.
