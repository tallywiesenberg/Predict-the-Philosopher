We should use force in the 
case of illegal occupation of land and severe 
human rights abuses.If the United States was 
to follow that advice, we would bomb El Sal- 
vador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Damascus, Tel 
Aviv, Capetown, Turkey, Washington, and a 
whole list of other states.These are all cases 
of illegal occupation and aggression and severe 
human rights abuses.If you know the facts 
about that range of examples, you'll know very 



well that Saddam Hussein's aggression and 
atrocities fall well within the range.They're 
not the most extreme.
