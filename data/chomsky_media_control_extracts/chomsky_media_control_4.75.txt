In February, 
right in the middle of the bombing campaign, 
the government of Lebanon requested Israel to 
observe U.N. Security Council Resolution 
425, which called on it to withdraw immedi- 
ately and unconditionally from Lebanon.That 
resolution dates from March 1978.There have 
since been two subsequent resolutions calling 
for the immediate and unconditional with- 
drawal of Israel from Lebanon.Of course it 
doesn't observe them because the United 
States backs it in maintaining that occupation.Meanwhile southern Lebanon is terrorized.
