There are big torture-chambers with horrifying 
things going on.It's used as a base for attack- 
ing other parts of Lebanon.Since 1978, 
Lebanon was invaded, the city of Beirut was 
bombed, about 20,000 people were killed, about 



80 percent of them civilians, hospitals were 
destroyed, and more terror, looting, and robbery 
was inflicted.All fine, the United States 
backed it.That's just one case.
