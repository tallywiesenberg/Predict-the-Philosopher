You didn't see 
anything in the media about it or any discus- 
sion about whether Israel and the United States 
should observe U.N. Security Council Resolu- 
tion 425 or any of the other resolutions, nor did 
anyone call for the bombing of Tel Aviv, 
although by the principles upheld by two-thirds 
of the population, we should.After all, that's 
illegal occupation and severe human rights 
abuses.That's just one case.There are much 
worse ones.The Indonesian invasion of East 
Timor knocked off about 200,000 people.
