There was a major strike, the Steel strike in 
western Pennsylvania at Johnstown. Business 
tried out a new technique oflabor destruction, 
which worked very well. Not through goon 
squads and breaking knees. That wasn't work- 
ing very well any more, but through the more 
subtle and effective means of propaganda. The 
idea was to figure out ways to turn the public 
against the strikers, to present the strikers as 
disruptive, harmful to the public and against 
the common interests. The common interests 
are those of "us," the businessman, the 
worker, the housewife. That's all "us." We 
want to be together and have things like har- 
mony and Americanism and working together. 
Then there's those bad strikers out there who 
are disruptive and causing trouble and break- 
ing harmony and violating Americanism. 
We've got to stop them so we can all live 
together. The corporate executive and the guy 
who cleans the floors all have the same inter- 
ests. We can all work together and work for 
Americanism in harmony, liking each other. 



That was essentially the message. A huge 
amount of effort was put into presenting it. 
This is, after all, the business community, so 
they control the media and have massive 
resources. And it wrked, very effectively. It 
was later called the "Mohawk Valley formula" 
and applied over and over again to break 
strikes. They were called "scientific methods 
of strike-breaking," and worked very effec- 
tively by mobilizing community opinion in 
favor of vapid, empty concepts like American- 
ism. Who can be against that? Or harmony. 
Who can be against that? Or, as in the Persian 
Gulf War, "Support our troops." Who can be 
against that? Or yellow ribbons. Who can be 
against that? Anything that's totally vacuous 
In fact, what does it mean if somebody 
asks you, Do you support the people in Iowa? 
Can you say, Yes, I support them, or No, I don't 
support them? It's not even a question. It does- 
n't mean anything. That's the point. The point 
of public relations slogans like "Support our 
troops" is that they don't mean anything. They 
mean as much as whether you support the peo-
