They don't say much about 
them, but they're less controlled than we are 
and they say something.This is a spectacular achievement of pro- 
paganda.First, that the voices of the Iraqi 
democrats are completely excluded, and sec- 
ond, that nobody notices it.That's interesting, 
too.It takes a really deeply indoctrinated pop- 
ulation not to notice that we're not hearing the 
voices of the Iraqi democratic opposition and 
not asking the question, Why?
