Can that possibly be the reason for the war?Does the United States uphold those principles, 
that aggressors cannot be rewarded and that 
aggression must be reversed by a quick resort 
to violence?I won't insult your intelligence by 
running through the facts, but the fact is those 
arguments could be refuted in two minutes by 
a literate teenager.However, they never were 
refuted.Take a look at the media, the liberal 
commentators and critics, the people who 
testified in Congress and see whether anybody 
questioned the assumption that the United 
States stands up to those principles.
