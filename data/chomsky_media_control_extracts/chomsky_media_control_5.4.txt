Has the 
United States opposed its own aggression in 
Panama and insisted on bombing Washington 
to reverse it?When the South African occupa- 
tion of Namibia was declared illegal in 1969, 
did the United States impose sanctions on food 
and medicine?Did it go to war?Did it bomb 
Capetown?No, it carried out twenty years of 
"quiet diplomacy."
