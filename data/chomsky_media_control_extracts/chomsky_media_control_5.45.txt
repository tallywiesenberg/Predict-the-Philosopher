It wasn't very pretty dur- 
ing those twenty years.In the years of the Rea- 
gan-Bush administration alone, about 1.5 
million people were killed by S outh Afric a j u st 
in the surrounding countries.Forget what was 
happening in South Africa and Namibia.Some- 
how that didn't sear our sensitive souls.We 
continued with "quite diplomacy" and ended 
up with ample reward for the aggressors.
