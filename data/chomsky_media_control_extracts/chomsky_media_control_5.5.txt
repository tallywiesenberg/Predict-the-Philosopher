ple in Iowa. Of course, there was an issue. The 
issue was, Do you support our policy? But you 
don't want people to think about that issue. 
That's the whole point of good propaganda. 



You want to create a slogna that nobody's 
going to be against, and everybody's going to 
be for. Nobody knows what it means, because 
it doesn't mean anything. Its crucial value is 
that it diverts your attention from a question 
that does mean something: Do you support our 
policy? That's the one you're not allowed to 
talk about. So you have people arguing about 
support for the troops? "Of course I don't not 
support them." Then you've won. That's like 
Americanism and harmony. We're all 
together, empty slogans, let's join in, let's 
make sure we don't have these bad people 
around to disrupt our harmony with their talk 
about class struggle, rights and that sort of 
business. 

That's all very effective. It runs right up to 
today. And of course it is carefully thought out. 
The people in the public relations industry 
aren't there for the fun of it. They're doing 
work. They're trying to instill the right values. 
In fact, they have a conception of what democ- 
racy ought to be: It ought to be a system in 
which the specialized class is trained to work 
in the service of the masters, the people who 
own the society. The rest of the population 
ought to be deprived of any form of organiza- 
tion, because organization just causes trouble. 



They ought to be sitting alone in front of the 
TV and having drilled into their heads the mes- 
sage, which says, the only value in life is to 
have more commodities or live like that rich 
middle class family you're watching and to 
have nice values like harmony and American- 
ism. That's all there is in life. You may think 
in your own head that there's got to be some- 
thing more in life than this, but since you're 
watching the tube alone you assume, I must be 
crazy, because that's all that's going on over
