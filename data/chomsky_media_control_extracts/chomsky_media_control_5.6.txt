Right before the bombing started, in mid- 
January, a major Washington Post- ABC poll 
revealed something interesting.People were 
asked, If Iraq would agree to withdraw from 
Kuwait in return for Security Council consid- 
eration of the problem of Arab-Israeli conflict, 
would you be in favor of that?By about two-to- 
one, the population was in favor of that.So was 
the whole world, including the Iraqi democra- 
tic opposition.So it was reported that two- 



thirds of the American population were in favor 
of that.
