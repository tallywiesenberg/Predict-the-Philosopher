Presumably, the people who were in 
favor of that thought they were the only ones 
in the world to think so.Certainly nobody in 
the press had said that it would be a good idea.The orders from Washington have been, we're

burn in the Los Angeles Times, who argued that 
it would be a good idea.The people who were 
answering that question thought, I'm alone, but 
that's what I think.
