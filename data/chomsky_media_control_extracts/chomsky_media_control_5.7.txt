Suppose they knew that 
they weren't alone, that other people thought 
it, like the Iraqi democratic opposition.Suppose 
that they knew that this was not hypothetical, 
that in fact Iraq had made exactly such an offer.It had been released by high U.S. officials just 
eight days earlier.On January 2, these officials 
had released an Iraqi offer to withdraw totally 
from Kuwait in return for consideration by the 
Security Council of the Arab-Israeli conflict and 
the problem of weapons of mass destruction.The United States had been refusing to negoti- 
ate this issue since well before the invasion of 
Kuwait.
