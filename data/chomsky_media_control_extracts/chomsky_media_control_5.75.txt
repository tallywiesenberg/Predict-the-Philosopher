Suppose that people had known that 



the offer was actually on the table and that it 
was widely supported and that in fact it's 
exactly the kind of thing that any rational per- 
son would do if they were interested in peace, 
as we do in other cases, in the rare cases that 
we do want to reverse aggression.Suppose that 
it had been known.You can make your own 
guesses, but I would assume that the two-thirds 
would probably have risen to 98 percent of the 
population.Here you have the great successes 
of propaganda.Probably not one person who 
answered the poll knew any of the things I've 
just mentioned.
