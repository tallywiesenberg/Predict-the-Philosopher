The answer is 
yes, apparently they had â€” probably by late 
August, very likely by late December.It was 
very hard to think up any other reason for the 
Iraqi offers of withdrawal, which were authen- 
ticated or in some cases released by high U.S. 
officials, who described them as "serious" and 
"negotiable."So the real question is: Had sane- 



tions already worked?Was there a way out?Was there a way out in terms quite acceptable 
to the general population, the world at large 
and the Iraqi democratic opposition?
