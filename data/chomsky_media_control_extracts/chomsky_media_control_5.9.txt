These 
questions were not discussed, and it's crucial 
for a well-functioning propaganda system that 
they not be discussed.That enables the chair- 
man of the Republican National Committee to 
say that if any Democrat had been in office, 
Kuwait would not be liberated today.He can 
say that and no Democrat would get up and say 
that if I were president it would have been lib- 
erated not only today but six months ago, 
because there were opportunities then that I 
would have pursued and Kuwait would have 
been liberated without killing tens of thou- 
sands of people and without causing an envi- 
ronmental catastrophe.No Democrat would 
say that because no Democrat took that posi- 
tion.Henry Gonzalez and Barbara Boxer took 
that position.
