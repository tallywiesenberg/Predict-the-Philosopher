there. And since there is no organization per- 
mitted — that's absolutely crucial — you never 
have a way of finding out whether you are 
crazy, and you just assume it, because it's the 
natural thing to assume. 

So that's the ideal. Great efforts are made 
in trying to achieve that ideal. Obviously, 
there is a certain conception behind it. The 
conception of democracy is the one that I men- 
tioned. The bewildered herd is a problem. 
We've got to prevent their roar and trampling . 
We've got to distract them. They should be 
watching the Superbowl or sitcoms or violent 
movies. Every once in a while you call on 
them to chant meaningless slogans like "Sup- 
port our troops." You've got to keep them 
pretty scared, because unless they're properly 



scared and frightened of all kinds of devils that 
are going to destroy them from outside or 
inside or somewhere, they may start to think, 
which is very dangerous, because they're not 
competent to think. Therefore it's important 
to distract them and marginalize them. 

That's one conception of democracy. In 
fact, going back to the business community, 
the last legal victory for labor really was 1935, 
the Wagner Act. After the war came, the unions 
declined as did a very rich working class cul- 
ture that was associated with the unions. That 
was destroyed. We moved to a business-run 
society at a remarkable level. This is the only 
state -capitalist industrial society which does- 
n't have even the normal social contract that 
you find in comparable societies. Outside of 
South Africa, I guess, this is the only industrial 
society that doesn't have national health care. 
There's no general commitment to even min- 
imal standards of survival for the parts of the 
population who can't follow those rules and 
gain things for themselves individually. 
Unions are virtually nonexistent. Other forms 
of popular structure are virtually nonexistent. 
There are no political parties or organizations. 
It's a long way toward the ideal, at least struc- 
turally. The media are a corporate monopoly.
