George Bush couldn't say that, because sanc- 
tions apparently had worked, and there was 
every reason to believe that negotiations could 
work â€” except that he adamantly refused to 
pursue them, saying explicitly, there will be no 
negotiations right through.Did you find any- 
body in the press who pointed that out?No.It's 
a triviality.It's something that, again, a liter- 
ate teenager could figure out in a minute.
