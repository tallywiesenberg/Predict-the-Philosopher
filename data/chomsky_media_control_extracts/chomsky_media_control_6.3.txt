Take the idea that Saddam Hus- 
sein is a monster about to conquer the world â€” 
widely believed, in the United States, and not 
unrealistically.It was drilled into people's 
heads over and over again: He's about to take 
everything.We've got to stop him now.How 
did he get that powerful?This is a small, third- 
world country without an industrial base.
