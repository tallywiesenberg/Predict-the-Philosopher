For 
eight years Iraq had been fighting Iran.That's 
post-revolutionary Iran, which had decimated 
its officer corps and most of its military force.Iraq had a little bit of support in that war.It was 
backed by the Soviet Union, the United States, 



Europe, the major Arab countries, and the Arab 
oil producers.It couldn't defeat Iran.
