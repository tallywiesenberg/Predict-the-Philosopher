They have the same point of view. The two par- 
ties are two factions of the business party. Most 
of the population doesn't even bother voting 
because it looks meaningless. They're mar- 
ginalized and properly distracted. At least that's 
the goal. The leading figure in the public rela- 
tions industry, Edward Bernays, actually came 
out of the Creel Commission. He was part of 
it, learned his lessons there and went on to 
develop what he called the "engineering of con-

the United Fruit Company in 1954, when the 
United States moved in to overthrow the cap- 
italist-democratic government of Guatemala 
and installed a murderous death-squad society, 
which remains that way to the present day 
with constant infusions of U.S. aid to prevent 
in more than empty form democratic devia-

domestic programs which the public is 
opposed to, because there is no reason for the 
public to be in favor of domestic programs that 
are harmful to them. This, too, takes extensive 
propaganda. We've seen a lot of this in the last 
ten years. The Reagan programs were over-
