In com- 
parison with them, Manuel Noriega is a pretty 
minor thug.Bad, but not a world-class thug of 
the kind we like.He was turned into a creature 
larger than life.He was going to destroy us, 
leading the narco-traffickers.We had to 
quickly move in and smash him, killing a cou- 
ple hundred or maybe thousand people, restor- 
ing to power the tiny, maybe eight percent 
white oligarchy, and putting U.S. military 
officers in control at every level of the politi- 
cal system.
