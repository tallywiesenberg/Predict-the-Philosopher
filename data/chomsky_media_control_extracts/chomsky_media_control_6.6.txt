Notice that this is not all that different 
from what the Creel Commission when it 
turned a pacifistic population into raving hys- 
terics who wanted to destroy everything Ger- 
man to save ourselves from Huns who were 
tearing the arms off Belgian babies.The tech- 
niques are maybe more sophisticated, with 
television and lots of money going into it, but 
it's pretty traditional.I think the issue, to come back to my orig- 
inal comment, is not simply disinformation 
and the Gulf crisis.The issue is much broader.It's whether we want to live in a free society 
or whether we want to live under what 
amounts to a form of self-imposed totalitari- 
anism, with the bewildered herd marginalized, 
directed elsewhere, terrified, screaming patri- 
otic slogans, fearing for their lives and admir- 
ing with awe the leader who saved them from 
destruction, while the educated masses goose- 
step on command and repeat the slogans 
they're supposed to repeat and the society dete- 



riorates at home.
