whelmingly unpopular. Voters in the 1984 
"Reagan landslide," by about three to two, 
hoped that his policies would not be enacted. 
If you take particular programs, like arma- 
ments, cutting back on social spending, etc., 
almost every one of them was overwhelmingly 
opposed by the public. But as long as people are 
marginalized and distracted and have no way 
to organize or articulate their sentiments, or 
even know that others have these sentiments, 
people who said that they prefer social spend- 
ing to military spending, who gave that answer 
on polls, as people overwhelmingly did, 
assumed that they were the only people with 
that crazy idea in their heads. They never heard 
it from anywhere else. Nobody's supposed to 
think that. Therefore, if you do think it and you 
answer it in apoll, you just assume that you're 
sort of weird. Since there's no way to get 
together with other people who share or rein- 
force that view and help you articulate it, you 
feel like an oddity, an oddball. So you just stay 
on the side and you don't pay any attention to 
what's going on. You look at something else, 
like the Superbowl. 

To a certain extent, then, that ideal was 
achieved, but never completely. There are insti- 
tutions which it has as yet been impossible to 



destroy. The churches, for example, still exist. 
A large part of the dissident activity in the 
United States comes out of the churches, for 
the simple reason that they're there. So when 
you go to a European country and give a polit- 
ical talk, it may very likely be in the union hall. 
Here that won't happen, because unions first 
of all barely exist, and if they do exist they're 
not political organizations. But the churches do 
exist, and therefore you often give a talk in a 
church. Central American solidarity work 
mostly grew out of the churches, mainly 
because they exist. 

The bewildered herd never gets properly 
tamed, so this is a constant battle. In the 1930s 
they arose again and were put down. In the 
1960s there was another wave of dissidence.
