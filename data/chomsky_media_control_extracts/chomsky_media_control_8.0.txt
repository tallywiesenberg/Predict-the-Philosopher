none of these sickly inhibitions about using 
violence. So that's the Vietnam Syndrome. It's 
necessary to overcome that one. 



REPRESENTATION AS REALITY 



It's also necessary to completely falsify history. 
That's another way to overcome these sickly 
inhibitions, to make it look as if when we 
attack and destroy somebody we're really pro- 
tecting and defending ourselves against major 
aggressors and monsters and so on. There has 
been a huge effort since the Vietnam war to 
reconstruct the history of that. Too many peo- 
ple began to understand what was really going 
on. Including plenty of soldiers and a lot of 
young people who were involved with the peace 
movement and others. That was bad. It was nec- 
essary to rearrange those bad thoughts and to 
restore some form of sanity, namely, a recog- 
nition that whatever we do is noble and right. 
If we're bombing South Vietnam, that's because 
we're defending South Vietnam against some- 
body, namely, the South Vietnamese, since 
nobody else was there. It's what the Kennedy 
intellectuals called defense against "internal 
aggression" in South Vietnam. That was the 
phrase used by Adlai Stevenson and others. It 
was necessary to make that the official and well 
understood picture. That's worked pretty well. 



When you have total control over the media and 
the educational system and scholarship is con- 
formist, you can get that across. One indication 
of it was revealed in a study done at the Uni- 
versity of Massachusetts on attitudes toward 
the current Gulf crisis â€” a study of beliefs and 
attitudes in television watching. One of the 
questions asked in that study was, How many 
Vietnamese casualties would you estimate 
that there were during the Vietnam war? The 
average response on the part of Americans today 
is about 1 00,000. The official figure is about two 
million. The actual figure is probably three to
