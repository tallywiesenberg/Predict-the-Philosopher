four million. The people who conducted the 
study raised an appropriate question: What 
would we think about German political culture 
if, when you asked people today how many Jews 
died in the Holocaust, they estimated about 
300,000? What would that tell us about German 
political culture? They leave the question

it tell us about our culture? It tells us quite a 
bit. It is necessary to overcome the sickly inhi-

reality. The truth of the matter is buried under 
edifice after edifice of lies upon lies. It's all been 
a marvelous success from the point of view in 
deterring the threat of democracy, achieved 
under conditions of freedom, which is 
extremely interesting. It's not like a totalitar- 
ian state, where it's done by force. These 
achievements are under conditions of freedom. 
If we want to understand our own society, we'll 
have to think about these facts. They are impor-

what kind of society they live in. 



DISSIDENT CULTURE 



Despite all of this, the dissident culture sur- 
vived. It's grown quite a lot since the 1960s. In 
the 1960s the dissident culture first of all was 
extremely slow in developing. There was no 
protest against the Indochina war until years 
after the United States had started bombing 
South Vietnam. When it did grow it was a very 
narrow dissident movement, mostly students 
and young people. By the 1970s that had 
changed considerably. Major popular move- 
ments had developed: the environmental
