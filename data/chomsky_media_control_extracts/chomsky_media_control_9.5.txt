inhibitions in the early 1960s. The responses 
were the same. Everybody thought that the use 
of violence to suppress people out there was 
just right. Over the years it's changed. The 
sickly inhibitions have increased all across the

percent. What has happened? What has hap-

people are no longer just glued to the tube, you 
may have all these funny thoughts arising in 
their heads, like sickly inhibitions against the 
use of military force. That has to be overcome, 
but it hasn't been overcome. 



PARADE OF ENEMIES 



Instead of talking about the last war, let me 
talk about the next war, because sometimes it's 
useful to be prepared instead of just reacting. 
There is a very characteristic development 
going on in the United States now. It's not the 
first country in the world that's done this. 
There are growing domestic social and eco- 
nomic problems, in fact, maybe catastrophes. 
Nobody in power has any intention of doing 
anything about them. If you look at the 
domestic programs of the administrations of 
the past ten years — I include here the Democ- 
ratic opposition — there's really no serious pro- 
posal about what to do about the severe 
problems of health, education, homelessness, 
joblessness, crime, soaring criminal popula-
