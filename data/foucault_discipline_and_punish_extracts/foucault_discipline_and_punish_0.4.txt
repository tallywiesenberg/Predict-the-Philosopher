Such a nuance is denied us in English.More seriously the verb 
'surveiller’ has no adequate English equivalent.Our noun ‘surveillance’ 
has an altogether too restricted and technical use.Jeremy Bentham used 
the term ‘inspect’ - which Foucault translates as 'surveiller - but the 
range of connotations does not correspond.‘Supervise’ is perhaps closest 
of all, but again the word has different associations.
