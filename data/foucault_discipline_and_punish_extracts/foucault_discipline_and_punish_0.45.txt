‘Observe’ is rather 
too neutral, though Foucault is aware of the aggression involved in any 
one-sided observation.In the end Foucault himself suggested Discipline 
and Punish, which relates closely to the book’s structure.Another problem was posed by the French word 'supplice', which heads 
the first part of the book.For the sake of brevity I have entitled this 
first part ‘Torture’, but no single English word will cover the full range 
of the French.Here 'supplied refers specifically to the public torture and 
execution of criminals that provided one of the most popular spectacles of 
eighteenth-century France.
