By extension the word can also refer to any 
prolonged torture, mental as well as physical.Depending on the context, 
I have translated the word by ‘torture’, ‘public execution’ or ‘scaffold’.The author also refers to another form of torture, 'la question', the extrac¬ 
tion of confessions by interrogation and the systematic application of 
pain.Here I have followed the accepted translation, ‘judidal torture’.References to other works are usually given not in footnotes but in an 
abbreviated form in the text itself.
