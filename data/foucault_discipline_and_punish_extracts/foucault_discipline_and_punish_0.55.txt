Torture 






I.The body of the condemned 


On 2 March 1757 Damiens the regicide was condemned ‘to make 
the amende honorable before the main door of the Church of Paris’, 
where he was to be ‘taken and conveyed in a cart, wearing nothing 
but a shirt, holding a torch of burning wax weighing two pounds’; 
then, ‘in the said cart, to the Place de Gr^ve, where, on a scaffold 
that will be erected there, the flesh will be tom from his breasts, 
arms, thighs and calves with red-hot pincers, his right hand, holding 
the knife with which he committed the said parricide, burnt with 
sulphur, and, on those places where the flesh will be tom away, 
poured molten lead, boiling oil, burning resin, wax and sulphur 
melted together and then his body drawn and quartered by four 
horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes 
and his ashes thrown to the winds’ {Pieces originales ..., 372-4).‘Finally, he was quartered,’ recounts the Gaiette d’Amsterdam of 
I April 1757.
