‘This last operation was very long, because the horses 
used were not accustomed to drawing; consequently, instead of 
four, six were needed; and when that did not suffice, they were

pulled first at the calf of the right leg, then at the thigh, and from

profusely, though without swearing, raised his head and looked at 
himself; the same executioner dipped an iron spoon in the pot con¬ 
taining the boiling potion, which he poured liberally over each 
wound.
