He said 
to them (I heard him): “Kiss me, gentlemen.” The parish priest of 
St Paul’s did not dare to, so Monsieur de Marsilly slipped under the 
rope holding the left arm and kissed him on the forehead.The 
executioners gathered round and Damiens told them not to swear, 
to carry out their task and that he did not think ill of them; he 
begged them to pray to God for him, and asked the parish priest 
of St Paul’s to pray for him at the first mass.‘After two or three attempts, the executioner Samson and he who 
had used the pincers each drew out a knife from his pocket and cut 
the body at the thighs instead of severing the legs at the joints; the 
four horses gave a tug and carried off the two thighs after them, 
namely, that of the right side first, the other following; then the 
same was done to the arms, the shoulders, the arm-pits and the four 
limbs; the flesh had to be cut almost to the bone, the horses pulling 
hard carried off the right arm first and the other afterwards.‘When the four limbs had been pulled away, the confessors came 
to speak to him; but his executioner told them that he was dead, 
though the truth was that I saw the man move, his lower jaw moving 
from side to side as if he were talking.One of the executioners even 
said shortly afterwards that when they had lifted the trunk to throw 
it on the stake, he was still alive.
