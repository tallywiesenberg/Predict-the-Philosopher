At half-past seven in summer, half-past eight in winter, 
the prisoners must be back in their cells after the washing of hands 
and the inspection of clothes in the courtyard; at the first drum-roll, 
they must undress, and at the second get into bed.The cell doors 
are closed and the supervisors go the rounds in the corridors, to 
ensure order and silenceâ€™ (Faucher, 274-82).We have, then, a public execution and a time-table.They do not 
punish the same crimes or the same type of delinquent.But they 
each define a certain penal style.
