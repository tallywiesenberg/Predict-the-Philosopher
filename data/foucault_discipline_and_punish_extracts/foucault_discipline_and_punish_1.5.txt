Less than a century separates them.It was a time when, in Europe and in the United States, the entire 
economy of punishment was redistributed.It was a time of great 
‘scandals’ for traditional justice, a time of innumerable projects for 
reform.It saw a new theory of law and crime, a new moral or politi¬ 
cal justification of the right to punish; old laws were abolished, old 
customs died out.‘Modern’ codes were planned or drawn up: 
Russia, 1769; Prussia, 1780; Pennsylvania and Tuscany, 1786; 
Austria, 1788; France, 1791, Year IV, 1808 and 1810.
