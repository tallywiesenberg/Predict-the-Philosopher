And yet the 
fact remains that a few decades saw the disappearance of the tor¬ 
tured, dismembered, amputated body, symbolically branded on face 
or shoulder, exposed alive or dead to public view.The body as the 
major target of penal repression disappeared.By the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth 
cenmry, the gloomy festival of punishment was dying out, though 
here and there it flickered momentarily into life.In this transforma¬ 
tion, two processes were at work.They did not have quite the same 
chronology or the same raison d'etre.
