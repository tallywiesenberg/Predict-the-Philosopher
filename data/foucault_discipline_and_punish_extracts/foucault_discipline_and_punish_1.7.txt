The sport of the idle and the vicious, they often become incensed, 
and naturally took violent revenge upon the aggressors.To prevent 
them from returning injuries which might be inflicted on them, 
they were encumbered with iron collars and chains to which bomb¬ 
shells were attached, to be dragged along while they performed their 
degrading service, under the eyes of keepers armed with swords, 
blunderbusses and other weapons of destruction’ (Roberts Vaux, 
Notices, 21, quoted in Teeters, 1937,24).This practice was abolished 
practically everywhere at the end of the eighteenth or the beginning 
of the nineteenth century.The public exhibition of prisoners was 
maintained in France in 1831, despite violent criticism - ‘a disgust¬ 
ing scene’, said Real (cf.Bibliography); it was finally abolished in 
April 1848.
