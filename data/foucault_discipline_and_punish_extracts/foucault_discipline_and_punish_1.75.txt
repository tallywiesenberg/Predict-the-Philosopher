across the whole of France, as far as Brest and Toulon, was replaced 
in 1837 by inconspicuous black-painted cell-carts.Punishment had 
gradually ceased to be a spectacle.And whatever theatrical elements 
it still retained were now downgraded, as if the functions of the 
penal ceremony were gradually ceasing to be understood, as if this 
rite that ‘concluded the crime’ was suspected of being in some 
undesirable way linked with it.It was as if the punishment was 
thought to equal, if not to exceed, in savagery the crime itself, to 
accustom the spectators to a ferocity from which one wished to 
divert them, to show them the frequency of crime, to make the 
executioner resemble a criminal, judges murderers, to reverse roles 
at the last moment, to make the tortured criminal an object of pity 
or admiration.As early as 1764, Beccaria remarked: ‘The murder 
that is depicted as a horrible crime is repeated in cold blood, 
remorselessly’ (Beccaria, loi).
