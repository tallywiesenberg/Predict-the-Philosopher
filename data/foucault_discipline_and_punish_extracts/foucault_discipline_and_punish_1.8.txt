The public execution is now seen as 
a hearth in which violence bursts again into flame.Punishment, then, will tend to become the most hidden part of 
the penal process.This has several consequences: it leaves the 
domain of more or less everyday perception and enters that of 
abstract consciousness; its effectiveness is seen as resulting from its 
inevitability, not from its visible intensity; it is the certainty of being 
punished and not the horrifying spectacle of public punishment that 
must discourage crime; the exemplary mechanics of punishment 
changes its mechanisms.As a result, justice no longer takes public 
responsibility for the violence that is bound up with its practice.If it too strikes, if it too kills, it is not as a glorification of its strength, 
but as an element of itself that it is obliged to tolerate, that it finds 
difficult to account for.
