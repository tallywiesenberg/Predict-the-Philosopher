It is 
typical that in France the administration of the prisons should for so 
long have been the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, 
while responsibility for the bagnes, for penal servitude in the convict 
ships and penal settlements, lay with the Ministry of the Navy or 
the Ministry of the Colonies.And beyond this distribution of roles 
operates a theoretical disavowal: do not imagine that the sentences 
that we judges pass are activated by a desire to punish; they are 
intended to correct, reclaim, ‘cure’; a technique of improvement 
represses, in the penalty, the strict expiation of evil-doing, and 
relieves the magistrates of the demeaning task of punishing.In 
modern justice and on the part of those who dispense it there is a 
shame in punishing, which does not always preclude zeal.This 
sense of shame is constantly growing: the psychologists and the 
minor civil servants of moral orthopaedics proliferate on the wound 
it leaves.The disappearance of public executions marks therefore the decline 
of the spectacle; but it also marks a slackening of the hold on the 
body.
