In 1787, in an address to the Society for Promoting Political 
Enquiries, Benjamin Rush remarked: ‘I can only hope that the time 
is not far away when gallows, pillory, scaffold, flogging and wheel 
will, in the history of punishment, be regarded as the marks of the 
barbarity of centuries and of countries and as proofs of the feeble 
influence of reason and religion over the human mind’ (Teeters, 
1935, 30).Indeed, sixty years later.Van Meenen, opening the second 
penitentiary congress, in Brussels, recalled the time of his childhood 
as of a past age: ‘I have seen the ground strewn with wheels, 
gibbets, gallows, pillories; I have seen hideously stretched skeletons 
on wheels’ (Annales de la Chariti, 529-30).Branding had been 
abolished in England (1834) and in France (1832); in 1820, England 
no longer dared to apply the full punishment reserved for traitors 
(Thistlewood was not quartered).Only flogging still remained in a 
number of penal systems (Russia, England, Prussia).
