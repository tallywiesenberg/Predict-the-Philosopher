If the penality in its most severe forms no longer addresses itself 
to the body, on what does it lay hold.^ The answer of the theoreti¬ 
cians - those who, about 1760, opened up a new period that is not 
yet at an end - is simple, almost obvious. It seems to be contained 
in the question itself: since it is no longer the body, it must be the 
soul. The expiation that once rained down upon the body must be 
replaced by a punishment that acts in depth on the heart, the 
thoughts, the will, the inclinations. Mably formulated the principle 
once and for all: ‘Punishment, if I may so put it, should strike the 
soul rather than the body’ (Mably, 326). 

It was an important moment. The old partners of the spectacle 
of punishment, the body and the blood, gave way. A new character 




The body of the condemned 


came on the scene, masked. It was the end of a certain kind of 
tragedy; comedy began, with shadow play, faceless voices, impalp¬ 
able entities. The apparatus of punitive justice must now bite into 
this bodiless reality. 

Is this any more than a mere theoretical assertion, contradicted 
by penal practice.^ Such a conclusion would be over-hasty. It is true 
that, today, to punish is not simply a matter of converting a soul; 
but Mably’s principle has not remained a pious wish. Its effects can 
be felt throughout modern penality. 

To begin with, there is a substitution of objects. By this I do not 
mean that one has suddenly set about punishing other crimes. No 
doubt the definition of offences, the hierarchy of their seriousness, 
the margins of indulgence, what was tolerated in fact and what was 
legally permitted - all this has considerably changed over the last 
200 years; many crimes have ceased to be so because they were 
bound up with a certain exercise of religious authority or a par¬ 
ticular type of economic activity; blasphemy has lost its status as a 
crime; smuggling and domestic larceny some of their seriousness. 
But these displacements are perhaps not the most important fact: 
the division between the permitted and the forbidden has preserved 
a certain constancy from one century to another. On the other 
hand, ‘crime’, the object with which penal practice is concerned, has 
profoundly altered: the quality, the nature, in a sense the substance 
of which the punishable element is made, rather than its formal 
definition. Undercover of the relative stability of the law, a mass of 
subtle and rapid changes has occurred. Certainly the ‘crimes’ and 
‘offences’ on which judgement is passed are juridical objects defined 
by the code, but judgement is also passed on the passions, instincts,
