In short, the power to judge should no longer depend on the 
innumerable, discontinuous, sometimes contradictory privileges of 
sovereignty, but on the continuously distributed effects of public 
power.This general principle defined an overall strategy that 
covered many different struggles.Those of philosophers like 
Voltaire and of publicists like Brissot or Marat; but also those of 
magistrates whose interests were nevertheless very diverse: Le 
Trosne, a judge at the presidial court of Orleans, and Lacretelle, the 
advocate-general at the parlement; Target, who with the parlements 
was opposed to Maupeou’s reform; but also J. N. Moreau, who 
supported the royal power against the parlementaires-, Servan and 
Dupaty, both magistrates, but in conflict with their colleagues, etc.Throughout the eighteenth century, inside and outside the legal 
apparatus, in both everyday penal practice and the criticism of 
institutions, one sees the emergence of a new strategy for the

exercise of the power to punish.And ‘reform’, in the strict sense, as 
it was formulated in the theories of law or as it was outlined in the 
various projects, was the political or philosophical resumption of 
this strategy, with its primary objectives: to make of the punishment 
and repression of illegalities a regular function, coextensive with 
society; not to punish less, but to punish better; to punish with an 
attenuated severity perhaps, but in order to punish with more 
universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply 
into the social body.
