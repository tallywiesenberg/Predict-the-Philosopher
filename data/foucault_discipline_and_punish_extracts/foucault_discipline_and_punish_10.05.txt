The conjuncture that saw the binh of reform is not, therefore, 
that of a new sensibility, but that of another policy with regard to 
illegalities.Roughly speaking, one might say that, under the Ancien Regime 
each of the different social strata had its margin of tolerated illegaÂ¬ 
lity: the non-application of the rule, the non-observance of the 
innumerable edicts or ordinances were a condition of the political 
and economic functioning of society.This feature may not have 
been peculiar to the Ancien Regime.But illegality was so deeply 
rooted and so necessary to the life of each social stratum, that it had 
in a sense its own coherence and economy.Sometimes it took on an 
absolutely statutory form - as with the privileges accorded certain 
individuals and groups - which made it not so much an illegality 
as a regular exemption.
