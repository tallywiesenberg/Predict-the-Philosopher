Sometimes it took the form of a massive 
general non-observance, which meant that for decades, sometimes 
for centuries, ordinances could be published and constantly renewed 
without ever being implemented.Sometimes it was a matter of laws 
gradually falling into abeyance, then suddenly being reactivated; 
sometimes of silent consent on the part of the authorities, neglect, or 
quite simply the actual impossibility of imposing the law and appre¬ 
hending offenders.The least-favoured strata of the population did 
not have, in principle, any privileges: but they benefited, within the 
margins of what was imposed on them by law and custom, from a 
space of tolerance, gained by force or obstinacy; and this space was 
for them so indispensable a condition of existence that they were 
often ready to rise up to defend it; the attempts that were made 
periodically to reduce it, by reviving old laws or by improving the 
methods of apprehending, provoked popular disturbances, just as

attempts to reduce certain privileges disturbed the nobility, the 
clergy and the bourgeoisie.This necessary illegality, of which eyery social stratum bore 
within itself specific forms, was caught up in a series of paradoxes.In its lower regions, it was identified with criminality, from which 
it was difficult to distinguish it juridically, if not morally: from fiscal 
illegality to customs illegality, to smuggling, to looting, to the 
armed struggle against the government’s taxation agents, then 
against the soldiers themselves and, finally, to rebellion, there was 
a continuity, in which it was difficult to mark the frontiers; or, again, 
vagabondage (severely punished according to the terms of ordin¬ 
ances that were never implemented) with the pillage, aggravated 
theft, even murder that went with it, provided a welcome environ¬ 
ment to the unemployed, to workers who had left their employers 
in irregular circumstances, to domestic servants who had some 
reason to flee their masters, to ill-treated apprentices, to deserting 
soldiers, to all those who wished to escape the press-gang.
