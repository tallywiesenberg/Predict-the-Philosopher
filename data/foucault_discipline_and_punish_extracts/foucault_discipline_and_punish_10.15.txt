So 
criminality merged into a wider illegality, to which the lower strata 
were attached as to conditions of existence; and, conversely, this 
illegality was a perpetual factor in the increase of crime.Hence an 
ambiguity in popular attitudes: on the one hand, the criminal - 
especially when he happened to be a smuggler or a peasant who had 
fled from the exactions of a master - benefited from a spontaneous 
wave of sympathy: his acts of violence were seen as descending 
directly from old struggles.On the other hand, a man who, under 
cover of an illegality accepted by the population, committed crimes 
at the expense of this population, the vagrant beggar, for example, 
who robbed and murdered, easily became the object of a special hate: 
he had redirected upon the least favoured illegality that was integral 
to their conditions of existence.Thus there grew up around crimes 
a network of glorification and blame; effective help and fear alterÂ¬ 
nated with regard to this shifting population, which one knew was 
very near, but from which one felt that crime could emerge.Popular illegality enveloped a whole nucleus of criminality that was 
both its extreme form and its internal danger.
