Between this illegality of the depths and those of the other social

group maintained relations with one another that involved not only 
rivalry, competition and conflicts of interest, but also mutual help 
and complicity: the peasants’ refusal to pay certain state or eccle¬ 
siastical rents was not necessarily disapproved of by the landowners; 
the non-application by artisans of manufacturing regulations was 
often encouraged by the new entrepreneurs; smuggling - the story 
of Mandrin, welcomed by the entire population, received in castles 
and protected by parUmentaires proves this - was very widely 
supported.At most, one had seen in the seventeenth century the 
different fiscal refusals coalesce in serious revolts among widely 
separated social strata.In short, the reciprocal interplay of illegali¬ 
ties formed part of the political and economic life of society.Or 
rather, a number of transformations (the abe5^nce into which 
Colbert’s regulations had fallen, for example, the non-observance 
of customs barriers within the kingdom, the breakdown of guild 
practices) had operated in the breach that was being widened every 
day by popular illegality; the bourgeoisie had needed these trans¬ 
formations; and economic growth was due, in part, to them.
