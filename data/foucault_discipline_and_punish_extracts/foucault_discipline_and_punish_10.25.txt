Tolerance then became encouragement.In the second half of the eighteenth cenmry, the process tended to 
be reversed.First, with the general increase in wealth, but also with 
the sudden demographic expansion, the principal target of popular 
illegality tended to be not so much rights, as goods: pilfering 
and theft tended to replace smuggling and the armed struggle 
against the tax agents.And, in this respect, the peasants, farmers 
and artisans were often its principal victims.Le Trosne was no 
doubt exaggerating a real tendency when he described the peasantsâ€™ 
suffering under the exactions of vagabonds, even more than they 
had suffered under feudal demands: thieves now attacked them like 
a cloud of maleficent insects, devouring crops and depleting the 
granaries (Le Trosne, 1764, 4).
