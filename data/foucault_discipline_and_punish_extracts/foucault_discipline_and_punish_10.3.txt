It might be said that gradually in 
the eighteenth century a crisis of popular illegality had occurred; 
and neither the movements at the beginning of the Revolution 
(around the refusal of seigniorial rights), nor those later movements, 
in which the struggle against property rights, political and religious 
protests and the refusal of conscription came together, recombined 
illegality in its old, welcoming form.Furthermore, although a large 
part of the bourgeoisie had accepted, without too much trouble.84

the illegality of rights, it found it difficult to support illegality when 
it was a question of its own property rights.Nothing could be more 
typical of this than the problem of peasant delinquency at the end 
of the eighteenth century and especially after the Revolution 
(Berce, i6i).The transition to an intensive agriculture exercised, 
over the rights to use common lands, over various tolerated pracÂ¬ 
tices, over small accepted illegalities, a more and more restrictive 
pressure.
