Furthermore, as it was acquired in part by the bourgeoisie, 
now free of the feudal burdens that once weighed upon it, landed 
property became absolute property: all the tolerated ‘rights’ that 
the peasantry had acquired or preserved (the abandonment of old 
obligations or the consolidation of irregular practices: the right of 
free pasture, wood-collecting, etc.)were now rejected by the new 
owners who regarded them quite simply as theft (thus leading, 
among the people, to a series of chain reactions of an increasingly 
illegal, or, if one prefers the term, criminal kind: breaches of close, 
the theft or killing of cattle, fires, assaults, murders (cf.Festy 
and Agulhon).The illegality of rights, which often meant 
the survival of the most deprived, tended, with the new status of 
property, to become an illegality of property.It then had to be 
punished.
