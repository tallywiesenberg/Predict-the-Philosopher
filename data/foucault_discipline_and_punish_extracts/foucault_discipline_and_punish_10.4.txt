And this illegality, while resented by the bourgeoisie where the 
ownership of land was concerned, was intolerable in commercial and 
industrial ownership: the development of the ports, the appearance 
of great warehouses in which merchandise was stored, the organiza¬ 
tion of huge workshops (with considerable quantities of raw 
materials, tools and manufactured articles, which belonged to the 
entrepreneurs and which were difficult to supervise) also necessitated 
a severe repression of illegality.The way in which wealth tended to 
be invested, on a much larger scale than ever before, in commodities 
and machines presupposed a systematic, armed intolerance of 
illegality.The phenomenon was obviously very evident where 
economic development was most intense.Colquhoun set out to 
give proof, supported by figures, of the urgent need to check the 
innumerable illegal practices that had grown up: according to the 
estimates of the entrepreneurs and insurance companies, the theft 
of produce imported from America and warehoused along the banks 
of the Thames had risen, on average, to ^(^250,000 per annum; in

all, approximately £^00,000 worth of goods was stolen each year 
in the Port of London itself (and this did not include the arsenals 
and warehouses outside the port proper); to this should be added 
£700,000 for the town itself.In this situation of permanent pilfering, 
three phenomena, says Colquhoun, should be taken into considera¬ 
tion: first, the complicity and often the active participation of the 
clerks, overseers, foremen and workers: ‘Whenever a large number 
of workers are gathered together in one place, there are bound to be 
a lot of bad characters among them’; second, the existence of a whole 
organization of illicit commerce, which began in the workshops or 
docks, then passed on to the receivers - wholesale receivers, 
specializing in certain kinds of commodity, and retail receivers 
whose stalls offered a ‘wretched display of old iron, rags and worn 
clothes, whereas at the back of the shop were hidden naval munitions 
of great value, copper bolts and nails, pieces of cast iron and precious 
metals, produce from the West Indies, furniture and all kinds of 
goods bought from the labourers’ — then on to dealers and pedlars 
who distributed the stolen goods far into the countryside (Colqu¬ 
houn, 1797; in chapters VII, VIII and XV, he gives a very detailed 
account of this process); third, counterfeiting (it seems that there 
were between forty and fifty mints producing counterfeit money 
throughout England, in permanent operation).
