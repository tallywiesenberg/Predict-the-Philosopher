In that movement 
which transformed a society of juridico-political levies into a society 
of the appropriation of the means and products of labour, theft 
tended to become the first of the great loopholes in legality.Or, to 
put it another way, the economy of illegalities was restructured 
with the development of capitalist society.The illegality of property 
was separated from the illegality of rights.This distinction repreÂ¬ 
sents a class opposition because, on the one hand, the illegality 
that was to be most accessible to the lower classes was that of 
property - the violent transfer of ownership - and because, on the 
other, the bourgeoisie was to reserve to itself the illegality of rights: 
the possibility of getting round its own regulations and its own laws, 
of ensuring for itself an immense sector of economic circulation by 
a skilful manipulation of gaps in the law - gaps that were foreseen 
by its silences, or opened up by de facto tolerance.And this great 
redistribution of illegalities was even to be expressed through a 
specialization of the legal circuits: for illegalities of property - for 
theft - there were the ordinary courts and punishments; for the 
illegalities of rights - fraud, tax evasion, irregular commercial 
operations - special legal institutions applied with transactions, 
accommodations, reduced fines, etc.
