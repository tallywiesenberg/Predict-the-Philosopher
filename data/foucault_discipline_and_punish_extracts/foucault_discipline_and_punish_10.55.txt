The bourgeoisie reserved to 
itself the fruitful domain of the illegality of rights.And at the same 
time as this split was taking place, there emerged the need for 
a constant policing concerned essentially with this illegality of 
property.It became necessary to get rid of the old economy of the 
power to punish, based on the principles of the confused and in¬ 
adequate multiplicity of authorities, the distribution and concentra¬ 
tion of the power correlative with actual inertia and inevitable 
tolerance, punishments that were spectacular in their manifestations 
and haphazard in their application.It became necessary to define a 
strategy and techniques of punishment in which an economy of 
continuity and permanence would replace that of expenditure and 
excess.In short, penal reform was born at the point of junction 
between the struggle against the super-power of the sovereign and 
that against the infra-power of acquired and tolerated illegalities.
