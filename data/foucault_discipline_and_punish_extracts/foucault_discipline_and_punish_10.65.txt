Le Trosne, the 
physiocrat who was a judge at the presidial court of Orleans, may 
serve as an example.In 1764, he published a memorandum on vaga¬ 
bondage: that hot-bed of thieves and murderers ‘who live in the 
midst of society without being members of it’, who wage ‘a veritable 
war on all citizens’, and who are in the midst of us ‘in that state that 
one supposes existed before the establishment of civil society’.Against them, he demanded the most severe penalties (character¬ 
istically, he expressed surprise that one should be more indulgent 
towards them than to smugglers); he wanted the police to be rein¬ 
forced, the mounted constabulary to hunt them down with the help 
of the population that suffered from their depredations; he demanded 
that these useless and dangerous people should be ‘acquired by the 
state and that they should belong to it as slaves to their masters’; 
and if necessary one should organize collective round-ups in the 
woods to drive them out, and anyone making a capture should be 
paid: ‘A reward of ten pounds is given for anyone who kills a wolf.A vagabond is infinitely more dangerous for society’ (Le Trosne, 
1764, 8, 50, 54, 61-2).In 1777 in f^ues sur la justice criminelle, the 
same Le Trosne demanded that the prerogatives of the Crown be 
reduced, that the accused be regarded as innocent until proved 
guilty, that the judge be a just arbiter between them and society, 
that laws be ‘fixed, constant, determined in the most precise way’, 
so that subjects know ‘to what they are exposed’ and that magis¬ 
trates be nothing more than the ‘organ of the law’ (Le Trosne, 1777, 
31, 37, 103-6).
