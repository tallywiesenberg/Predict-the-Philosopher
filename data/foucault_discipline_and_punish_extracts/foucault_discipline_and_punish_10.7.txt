of the public execution should have assumed such importance in 
penal reform: for it was the form in which, in the most visible way, 
the unlimited power of the sovereign and the ever-active illegality 
of the people came together.Humanity in the sentences was the 
rule given to a system of punishment that must fix their limits on 
both.The ‘man’ that must be respected in the sentence was the 
juridical and moral form given to this double delimitation.But, although it is true that reform, as a penal theory and as a 
strategy of the power to punish, took shape at the point of coinci¬ 
dence of these two objectives, its stability in the future was due to 
the fact that, for a long time, priority was given to the second.
