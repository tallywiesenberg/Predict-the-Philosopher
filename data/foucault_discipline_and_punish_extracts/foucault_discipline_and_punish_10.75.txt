It was 
because the pressure on popular illegalities had become, at the period 
of the Revolution, then under the Empire, and finally throughout 
the nineteenth century, an essential imperative, that reform was able 
to pass from the project stage to that of an institution and set of 
practices.That is to say, although the new criminal legislation 
appears to be characterized by less severe penalties, a clearer codi¬ 
fication, a marked diminution of the arbitrary, a more generally 
accepted consensus concerning the power to punish (in the absence 
of a more real division in its exercise), it is sustained in reality by an 
upheaval in the traditional economy of illegalities and a rigorous 
application of force to maintain their new adjustment.A penal sys¬ 
tem must be confceived as a mechanism intended to administer 
illegalities differentially, not to eliminate them all.Shift the object and change the scale.Define new tactics in order 
to reach a target that is now more subtle but also more widely spread 
in the social body.
