Penal punishment is therefore a generalized 
function, coextensive with the function of the social body and with 
each of its elements.This gives rise to the problem of the degree of 
punishment, the economy of the power to punish.In effect the offence opposes an individual to the entire social 
body; in order to punish him, society has the right to oppose him 
in its entirety.It is an unequal struggle: on one side are all the forces, 
all the power, all the rights.And this is how it should be, since the 
defence of each individual is involved.
