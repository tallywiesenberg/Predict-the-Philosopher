Thus a formidable right to 
punish is established, since the offender becomes the common 
enemy.Indeed, he is worse than an enemy, for it is from within 
society that he delivers his blows - he is nothing less than a traitor, 
a ‘monster’.How could society not have an absolute right over him.^ 
How could it not demand, quite simply, his elimination.^ And, 
although it is true that the principle of punishment must be sub¬ 
scribed to in the pact, must not each citizen, logically, accept the 
extreme penalty for those of them who attack them as a body.‘Every malefactor, by attacking the social rights, becomes, by his 
crimes, a rebel and a traitor to his country; by violating its laws he 
ceases to be a member of it; he even makes war upon it.In such a 
case the preservation of the state is inconsistent with his own, and 
one or the other must perish; in putting the guilty to death we slay 
not so much the citizen as the enemy.’® The right to punish has been 
shifted from the vengeance of the sovereign to the defence of 
society.
