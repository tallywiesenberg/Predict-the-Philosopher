material and physical presence, with the force that he himself deploys 
or transmits to some few others, is at the opposite extreme of this 
new physics of power represented by panopticism; the domain of 
panopticism is, on the contrary, that whole lower region, that region 
of irregular bodies, with their details, their multiple movements, 
their heterogeneous forces, their spatial relations; what are required 
are mechanisms that analyse distributions, gaps, series, combina¬ 
tions, and which use instruments that render visible, record, 
differentiate and compare: a physics of a relational and multiple 
power, which has its maximum intensity not in the person of the 
king, but in the bodies that can be individualized by these relations. 
At the theoretical level, Bentham defines another way of analysing 
the social body and the power relations that traverse it; in terms of 
practice, he defines a procedure of subordination of bodies and forces 
that must increase the utility of power while practising the economy 
of the prince. Panopticism is the general principle of a new ‘political 
anatomy’ whose object and end are not the relations of sovereignty 
but the relations of discipline. 

The celebrated, transparent, circular cage, with its high tower, 
powerful and knowing, may have been for Bentham a project of a 
perfect disciplinary institution; but he also set out to show how one 
may ‘unlock’ the disciplines and get them to function in a diffused.

Panopticism 


multiple, polyvalent way throughout the whole social body. These 
disciplines, which the classical age had elaborated in specific, 
relatively enclosed places - barracks, schools, workshops - and 
whose total implementation had been imagined only at the limited 
and temporary scale of a plague-stricken town, Bentham dreamt of 
transforming into a network of mechanisms that would be every¬ 
where and always alert, running through society without interrup¬ 
tion in space or in time. The panoptic arrangement provides the 
formula for this generalization. It programmes, at the level of an 
elementary and easily transferable mechanism, the basic functioning 
of a society penetrated through and through with disciplinary 
mechanisms. 

There are two images, then, of discipline. At one extreme, the 
discipline-blockade, the enclosed institution, established on the 
edges of society, turned inwards towards negative functions: 
arresting evil, breaking communications, suspending time. At the 
other extreme, with panopticism, is the discipline-mechanism: a
