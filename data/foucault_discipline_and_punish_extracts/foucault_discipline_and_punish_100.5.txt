functional mechanism that must improve the exercise of power by 
making it lighter, more rapid, more effective, a design of subtle 
coercion for a society to come. The movement from one project 
to the other, from a schema of exceptional discipline to one of 
a generalized surveillance, rests on a historical transformation: 
the gradual extension of the mechanisms of discipline throughout 
the seventeenth and eighteenth cenmries, their spread throughout the 
whole social body, the formation of what might be called in general 
the disciplinary society. 

A whole disciplinary generalization - the Benthamite physics of 
power represents an acknowledgement of this - had operated 
throughout the classical age. The spread of disciplinary instimtions, 
whose network was beginning to cover an ever larger surface and 
occupying above all a less and less marginal position, testifies to 
this: what was an islet, a privileged place, a circumstantial measure, 
or a singular model, became a general formula; the regulations 
characteristic of the Protestant and pious armies of William of 
Orange or of Gustavus Adolphus were transformed into regulations 
for all the armies of Europe; the model colleges of the Jesuits, or the 
schools of Batencour or Demia, following the exatnple set by Smrm,

provided the outlines for the general forms of educational dis¬ 
cipline; the ordering of the naval and military hospitals provided 
the model for the entire reorganization of hospitals in the eighteenth 
century. 

But this extension of the disciplinary institutions was no doubt 
only the most visible aspect of various, more profound processes. 

I. The functional inversion of the disciplines. At first, they were 
expected to neutralize dangers, to fix useless or disturbed popula¬ 
tions, to avoid the inconveniences of over-large assemblies; now 
they were being asked to play a positive role, for they were becom¬ 
ing able to do so, to increase the possible utility of individuals. 
Military discipline is no longer a mere means of preventing looting, 
desertion or failure to obey orders among the troops; it has become 
a basic technique to enable the army to exist, not as an assembled 
crowd, but as a unity that derives from this very unity an increase 
in its forces; discipline increases the skill of each individual, co¬ 
ordinates these skills, accelerates movements, increases fire power, 
broadens the fronts of attack without reducing their vigour, in¬
