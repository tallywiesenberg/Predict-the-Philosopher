creases the capacity for resistance, etc. The discipline of the work¬ 
shop, while remaining a way of enforcing respect for the regulations 
and authorities, of preventing thefts or losses, tends to increase 
aptitudes, speeds, output and therefore profits; it still exerts a moral 
influence over behaviour, but more and more it treats actions in 
terms of their results, introduces bodies into a machinery, forces into 
an economy. When, in the seventeenth century, the provincial 
schools or the Christian elementary schools were founded, the 
justifications given for them were above all negative: those poor 
who were unable to bring up their children left them ‘in ignorance 
of their obligations: given the difficulties they have in earning a 
living, and themselves having been badly brought up, they are 
unable to communicate a sound upbringing that they themselves 
never had’; this involves three major inconveniences: ignorance of 
God, idleness (with its consequent drunkenness, impurity, larceny, 
brigandage); and the formation of those gangs of beggars, always 
ready to stir up public disorder and ‘virtually to exhaust the funds 
of the Hotel-Dieu’ (Demia, 60-61). Now, at the beginning of the 
Revolution, the end laid down for primary education was to be, 
among other things, to ‘fortify’, to ‘develop the body’, to prepare

the child ‘for a future in some mechanical work’, to give him ‘an 
observant eye, a sure hand and prompt habits’ (Talleyrand’s Report 
to the Constituent Assembly, to September 1791, quoted by Leon, 
106). The disciplines function increasingly as techniques for making 
useful individuals. Hence their emergence from a marginal position 
on the confines of society, and detachment from the forms of 
exclusion or expiation, confinement or retreat. Hence the slow 
loosening of their kinship with religious regularities and enclosures. 
Hence also their rooting in the most important, most central and 
most productive sectors of society. They become attached to some 
of the great essential functions: factory production, the transmission 
of knowledge, the diffusion of aptitudes and skills, the war-machine. 
Hence, too, the double tendency one sees developing throughout 
the eighteenth century to increase the number of disciplinary insti¬ 
tutions and to discipline the existing apparatuses. 

2. The swarming of disciplinary mechanisms. While, on the one 
hand, the disciplinary establishments increase, their mechanisms 
have a certain tendency to become ‘de-institutionalized’, to emerge 
from the closed fortresses in which they once functioned and to 
circulate in a ‘free’ state; the massive, compact disciplines are broken
