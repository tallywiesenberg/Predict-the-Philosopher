down into flexible methods of control, which may be transferred 
and adapted. Sometimes the closed apparatuses add to their internal 
and specific function a role of external surveillance, developing 
around themselves a whole margin of lateral controls. Thus the 
Christian School must not simply train docile children; it must also 
make it possible to supervise the parents, to gain information as to 
their way of life, their resources, their piety, their morals. The 
school tends to constitute minute social observatories that penetrate 
even to the adults and exercise regular supervision over them: the 
bad behaviour of the child, or his absence, is a legitimate pretext, 
according to Demia, for one to go and question the neighbours, 
especially if there is any reason to believe that the family will not 
tell the truth; one can then go and question the parents themselves, 
to find out whether they know their catechism and the prayers, 
whether they are determined to root out the vices of their children, 
how many beds there are in the house and what the sleeping arrange¬ 
ments are; the visit may end with the giving of alms, the present of a 
religious picture, or the provision of additional beds (Demia, 39-40).

Discipline 


Similarly, the hospital is increasingly conceived of as a base for 
the medical observation of the population outside; after the burning 
down of the Hotel-Dieu in 1772, there were several demands that 
the large buildings, so heavy and so disordered, should be replaced 
by a series of smaller hospitals; their function would be to take in 
the sick of the quarter, but also to gather information, to be alert 
to any endemic or epidemic phenomena, to open dispensaries, to 
give advice to the inhabitants and to keep the authorities informed 
of the sanitary state of the region.* 

One also sees the spread of disciplinary procedures, not in the 
form of enclosed Institutions, but as centres of observation dis¬ 
seminated throughout society. Religious groups and charity 
organizations had long played this role of ‘disciplining’ the popula¬ 
tion. From the Counter-Reformation to the philanthropy of the 
July monarchy, initiatives of this type continued to increase; their 
aims were religious (conversion and moralization), economic (aid 
and encouragement to work) or political (the struggle against dis¬ 
content or agitation). One has only to cite by way of example the 
regulations for the charity associations in the Paris parishes. The 
territory to be covered was divided into quarters and cantons and 
the members of the associations divided themselves up along the
