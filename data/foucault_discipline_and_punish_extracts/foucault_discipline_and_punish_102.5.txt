Essarts, 344 and 528). 

But, although the police as an institution were certainly organized 
in the form of a state apparatus, and although this was certainly 
linked directly to the centre of political sovereignty, the type of 
power that it exercises, the mechanisms it operates and the elements 
to which it applies them are specific. It is an apparatus that must be 
coextensive with the entire social body and not only by the extreme 
limits that it embraces, but by the minuteness of the details it is 
concerned with. Police power must bear ‘over everything’: it is not 
however the totality of the state nor of the kingdom as visible and 
invisible body of the monarch; it is the dust of events, actions, 
behaviour, opinions - ‘everything that happens’;’ the police are 
concerned with ‘those things of every moment’, those ‘unimportant 
things’, of which Catherine II spoke in her Great Instruction 
(Supplement to the Instruction for the drawing up of a new code, 1769, 
article 535). With the police, one is in the indefinite world of a

supervision that seeks ideally to reach the most elementary particle, 
the most passing phenomenon of the social body: ‘The ministry of 
the magistrates and police officers is of the greatest importance; the 
objects that it embraces are in a sense definite, one may perceive 
them only by a sufficiently detailed examination’ (Delamare, un¬ 
numbered Preface): the infinitely small of political power. 

And, in order to be exercised, this power had to be given the 
instrument of permanent, exhaustive, omnipresent surveillance, 
capable of making all visible, as long as it could itself remain invisi¬ 
ble. It had to be like a faceless gaze that transformed the whole 
social body into a field of perception: thousands of eyes posted 
everywhere, mobile attentions ever on the alert, a long, hierarchized 
network which, according to Le Maire, comprised for Paris the 
forty-eight commissaires, the twenty inspecteurs, then the ‘observers’, 
who were paid regularly, the ‘basses mouches', or secret agents, who 
were paid by the day, then the informers, paid according to the job 
done, and finally the prostitutes. And this unceasing observation 
had to be accumulated in a series of reports and registers; throughout 
the eighteenth century, an immense police text increasingly covered 
society by means of a complex documentary organization (on the 
police registers in the eighteenth century, cf. Chassaigne). And, 
unlike the methods of judicial or administrative writing, what was
