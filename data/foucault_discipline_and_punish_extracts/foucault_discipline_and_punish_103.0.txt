registered in this way were forms of behaviour, attitudes, possibili¬ 
ties, suspicions - a permanent account of individuals’ behaviour. 

Now, it should be noted that, although this police supervision 
was entirely ‘in the hands of the king’, it did not function in a single 
direction. It was in fact a double-entry system: it had to correspond, 
by manipulating the machinery of justice, to the immediate wishes 
of the king, but it was also capable of responding to solicitations 
from below; the celebrated lettres de cachet, or orders under the 
king’s private seal, which were long the symbol of arbitrary royal 
rule and which brought detention into disrepute on political 
grounds, were in fact demanded by families, masters, local notables, 
neighbours, parish priests; and their function was to punish by 
confinement a whole infra-penality, that of disorder, agitation, dis¬ 
obedience, bad conduct; those things that Ledoux wanted to exclude 
from his architecturally perfect city and which he called ‘offences of 
non-surveillance’. In short, the eighteenth-century police added a

disciplinary function to its role as the auxiliary of justice in the 
pursuit of criminals and as an instrument for the political supervision 
of plots, opposition movements or revolts. It was a complex func¬ 
tion since it linked the absolute power of the monarch to the lowest 
levels of power disseminated in society; since, between these differ¬ 
ent, enclosed institutions of discipline (workshops, armies, schools), 
it extended an intermediary network, acting where they could not 
intervene, disciplining the non-disciplinary spaces; but it filled in 
the gaps, linked them together, guaranteed with its armed force an 
interstitial discipline and a meta-discipline. ‘By means of a wise 
police, the sovereign accustoms the people to order and obedience’ 
(Vattel, 162). 

The organization of the police apparatus in the eighteenth century 
sanctioned a generalization of the disciplines that became co-exten- 
sive with the state itself. Although it was linked in the most explicit 
way with everything in the royal power that exceeded the exercise 
of regular justice, it is understandable why the police offered such 
slight resistance to the rearrangement of the judicial power; and why 
it has not ceased to impose its prerogatives upon it, with ever- 
increasing weight, right up to the present day; this is no doubt 
because it is the secular arm of the judiciary; but it is also because, 
to a far greater degree than the judicial institution, it is identified,
