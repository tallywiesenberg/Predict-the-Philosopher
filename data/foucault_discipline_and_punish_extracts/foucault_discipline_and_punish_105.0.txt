eighteenth century, the peace-time army exceeded 200,000 men). 
The other aspect of the conjuncture was the growth in the apparatus 
of production, which was becoming more and more extended and 
complex; it was also becoming more costly and its profitability had 
to be increased. The development of the disciplinary methods 
corresponded to these two processes, or rather, no doubt, to the new 
need to adjust their correlation. Neither the residual forms of feudal 
power nor the structures of the administrative monarchy, nor the 
local mechanisms of supervision, nor the unstable, tangled mass 
they all formed together could carry out this role: they were 
hindered from doing so by the irregular and inadequate extension of

their network, by their often conflicting functioning, but above all 
by the ‘costly’ nature of the power that was exercised in them. It 
was costly in several senses: because directly it cost a great deal to 
the Treasury; because the system of corrupt offices and farmed-out 
taxes weighed indirectly, but very heavily, on the population; 
because the resistance it encountered forced it into a cycle of per¬ 
petual reinforcement; because it proceeded essentially by levying 
(levying on money or products by royal, seigniorial, ecclesiastical 
taxation; levying on men or time by corvies of press-ganging, by 
locking up or banishing vagabonds). The development of the disci¬ 
plines marks the appearance of elementary techniques belonging to 
a quite different economy: mechanisms of power which, instead of 
proceeding by deduction, are integrated into the productive effi¬ 
ciency of the apparatuses from within, into the growth of this 
efficiency and into the use of what it produces. For the old principle 
of ‘levying-violence’, which governed the economy of power, the 
disciplines substitute the principle of ‘mildness-production-profit’. 
These are the techniques that make it possible to adjust the multi¬ 
plicity of men and the multiplication of the apparatuses of produc¬ 
tion (and this means not only ‘production’ in the strict sense, but 
also the production of knowledge and skills in the school, the 
production of health in the hospitals, the production of destructive 
force in the army). 

In this task of adjustment, discipline had to solve a number of 
problems for which the old economy of power was not sufficiently 
equipped. It could reduce the inefficiency of mass phenomena: 
reduce what, in a multiplicity, makes it much less manageable than 
a unity; reduce what is opposed to the use of each of its elements 
and of their sum; reduce everything that may counter the advantages 
of number. That is why discipline fixes; it arrests or regulates
