movements; it clears up confusion; it dissipates compact groupings 
of individuals wandering about the country in unpredictable ways; 
it establishes calculated distributions. It must also master all the 
forces that are formed from the very constitution of an organized 
multiplicity; it must neutralize the effects of counter-power that 
spring from them and which form a resistance to the power that 
wishes to dominate it: agitations, revolts, spontaneous organizations, 
coalitions - anything that may establish horizontal conjunctions.

Discipline 


Hence the fact that the disciplines use procedures of partitioning 
and verticality, that they introduce, between the different elements 
at the same level, as solid separations as possible, that they define 
compact hierarchical networks, in short, that they oppose to the 
intrinsic, adverse force of multiplicity the technique of the continu¬ 
ous, individualizing pyramid. They must also increase the particular 
utility of each element of the multiplicity, but by means that are the 
most rapid and the least costly, that is to say, by using the multi¬ 
plicity itself as an instrument of this growth. Hence, in order to 
extract from bodies the maximum time and force, the use of those 
overall methods known as time-tables, collective training, exercises, 
total and detailed surveillance. Furthermore, the disciplines must 
increase the effect of utility proper to the multiplicities, so that each 
is made more useful than the simple sum of its elements: it is in 
order to increase the utilizable effects of the multiple that the disci¬ 
plines define tactics of distribution, reciprocal adjustment of bodies, 
gestures and rhythms, differentiation of capacities, reciprocal co¬ 
ordination in relation to apparatuses or tasks. Lastly, the disciplines 
have to bring into play the power relations, not above but inside 
the very texture of the multiplicity, as discreetly as possible, as well 
articulated on the other functions of these multiplicities and also in 
the least expensive way possible: to this correspond anonymous 
instruments of power, coextensive with the multiplicity that they 
regiment, such as hierarchical surveillance, continuous registration, 
perpetual assessment and classification. In short, to substitute for a 
power that is manifested through the brilliance of those who exercise 
it, a power that insidiously objectifies those on whom it is applied; 
to form a body of knowledge about these individuals, rather than to 
deploy the ostentatious signs of sovereignty. In a word, the disci¬ 
plines are the ensemble of minute technical inventions that made it 
possible to increase the useful size of multiplicities by decreasing the 
inconveniences of the power which, in order to make them useful,
