metries and excluding reciprocities. First, because discipline creates 
between individuals a ‘private’ link, which is a relation of constraints 
entirely different from contractual obligation; the acceptance of a 
discipline may be underwritten by contract; the way in which it is 
imposed, the mechanisms it brings into play, the non-reversible

subordination of one group of people by another, the ‘surplus’ 
power that is always fixed on the same side, the inequality of posi¬ 
tion of the different ‘parmers’ in relation to the common regulation, 
all these distinguish the disciplinary link from the contractual link, 
and make it possible to distort the contractual link systematically 
from the moment it has as its content a mechanism of discipline. 
We know, for example, how many real procedures undermine the 
legal fiction of the work contract: workshop discipline is not the 
least important. Moreover, whereas the juridical systems define 
juridical subjects according to universal norms, the disciplines 
characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, 
around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another 
and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate. In any case, in the space 
and during the time in which they exercise their control and bring 
into play the asymmetries of their power, they effect a suspension 
of the law that is never total, but is never annulled either. Regular 
and institutional as it may be, the discipline, in its mechanism, is a 
‘counter-law’. And, although the universal juridicism of modem 
society seems to fix limits on the exercise of power, its universally 
widespread panopticism enables it to operate, on the underside of 
the law, a machinery that is both immense and minute, which sup¬ 
ports, reinforces, multiplies the asymmetry of power and under¬ 
mines the limits that are traced around the law. The minute disci¬ 
plines, the panopticisms of every day may well be below the level 
of emergence of the great apparatuses and the great political 
struggles. But, in the genealogy of modern society, they have been, 
with the class domination that traverses it, the political counterpart 
of the juridical norms according to which power was redistributed. 
Hence, no doubt, the importance that has been given for so long 
to the small techniques of discipline, to those apparently insignificant 
tricks that it has invented, and even to those ‘sciences’ that give it a 
respectable face; hence the fear of abandoning them if one cannot 
find any substitute; hence the affirmation that they are at the very 
foundation of society, and an element in its equilibrium, whereas 
they are a series of mechanisms for unbalancing power relations
