registration, its experts in normality, who continue and multiply the 
fimctions of the judge, should have become the modern instrument 
of penality? Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, 
barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?

Prison 






I. Complete and austere institutions 


It would not be true to say that the prison was born with the new 
codes. The prison form antedates its systematic use in the penal 
system. It had already been constituted outside the legal apparatus 
when, throughout the social body, procedures were being elaborated 
for distributing individuals, fixing them in space, classifying them, 
extracting from them the maximum in time and forces, training their 
bodies, coding their continuous behaviour, maintaining them in 
perfect visibility, forming around them an apparatus of observation, 
registration and recording, constituting on them a body of know¬ 
ledge that is accumulated and centralized. The general form of an 
apparatus intended to render individuals docile and useful, by means 
of precise work upon their bodies, indicated the prison institution, 
before the law ever defined it as the penalty par excellence. At the 
turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was, it is true, 
a penality of detention; and it was a new thing. But it was really the 
opening up of penality to mechanisms of coercion already elaborated 
elsewhere. The ‘models’ of penal detention - Ghent, Gloucester, 
Walnut Street - marked the first visible points of this transition, 
rather than innovations or points of departure. The prison, an 
essential element in the punitive panopoly, certainly marks an import¬ 
ant moment in the history of penal justice: its access to ‘humanity’. 
But it is also an important moment in the history of those disci¬ 
plinary mechanisms that the new class power was developing: that 
in which they colonized the legal institution. At the turn of the
