the repetitive discourse of criminology, find one of their precise 
functions here: by solemnly inscribing offences in the field of objects 
susceptible of scientific knowledge, they provide the mechanisms 
of legal punishment with a justifiable hold not only on offences, but 
on individuals; not only on what they do, but also on what they are, 
will be, may be. The additional factor of the offender’s soul, which 
the legal systenBihas laid hold of, is only apparently explanatory

and limitative, and is in fact expansionist. During the 150 or 200 
years that Europe has been setting up its new penal systems, the 
judges have gradually, by means of a process that goes back very far 
indeed, taken to judging something other than crimes, namely, the 
‘soul’ of the criminal. 

And, by that very fact, they have begun to do something other 
than pass judgement. Or, to be more precise, within the very judicial 
modality of judgement, other types of assessment have slipped in, 
profoundly altering its rules of elaboration. Ever since the Middle 
Ages slowly and painfully built up the great procedure of investiga¬ 
tion, to judge was to establish the truth of a crime, it was to deter¬ 
mine its author and to apply a legal punishment. Knowledge of the 
offence, knowledge of the offender, knowledge of the law: these 
three conditions made it possible to ground a judgement in truth. 
But now a quite different question of truth is inscribed in the course 
of the penal judgement. The question is no longer simply: ‘Has the 
act been established and is it punishable!*’ But also: ‘What is this act, 
what is this act of violence or this murder.^ To what level or to what 
field of reality does it belong.^ Is it a phantasy, a psychotic reaction, a 
delusional episode, a perverse action.^’ It is no longer simply: ‘Who 
committed it.^’ But: ‘How can we assign the causal process that 
produced it.^ Where did it originate in the author himself.’ Instinct, 
unconscious, environment, heredity.’’ It is no longer simply: ‘What 
law punishes this offence.’’ But: ‘What would be the most appropriate 
measures to take.’ How do we see the future development of the 
offender.’ What would be the best way of rehabilitating him.’’ A 
whole set of assessing, diagnostic, prognostic, normative judge¬ 
ments concerning the criminal have become lodged in the frame¬ 
work of penal judgement. Another truth has penetrated the truth 
that was required by the legal machinery; a truth which, entangled 
with the first, has turned the assertion of guilt into a strange 
scientifico-juridical complex. A significant fact is the way in which 
the question of madness has evolved in penal practice. According
