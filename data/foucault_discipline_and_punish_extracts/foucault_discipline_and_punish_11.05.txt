Or again: ‘The laws summon me to the greatest punishment 
of crimes.I go with all the fury that it has inspired in me.But 
what is this.^ They even go beyond it... God, who has imprinted 
in our hearts an aversion to pain for ourselves and for our fellow 
men, are they then those same beings, whom thou hast created so 
weak and so sensible, who have invented such barbarous, such 
refined torturesi*’ (Lacretelle, 129).The principle of moderation in 
punishment, even when it is a question of punishing the enemy of 
the social body, is articulated first as a discourse of the heart.
