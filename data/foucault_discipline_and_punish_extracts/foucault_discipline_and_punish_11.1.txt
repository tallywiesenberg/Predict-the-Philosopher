Or 
rather, it leaps forth like a cry from the body, which is revolted at 
the sight or at the imagination of too much cruelty.The formulation 
of the principle that penality must remain ‘humane’ is expressed by 
the reformers in the first person.It is as if the sensibility of the 
speaker were being expressed direcdy; as if the body of the philoso¬ 
pher or theoretician had come, between executioner and victim, to 
affirm his own law and to impose it finally on the entire economy 
of punishment.Does this lyricism express an inability to find a 
rational foundation for a penal arithmetic?Between the contractual 
principle that expels the criminal from society and the image of the 
monster ‘vomited’ by nature, where is one to find a limit, if not in a 
human nature that is manifested - not in the rigour of the law, 
not in the ferocity of the delinquent - but in the sensibility 
of the reasonable man who makes the law and does not commit 
crime?
