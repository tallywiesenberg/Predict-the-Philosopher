But this recourse to ‘sensibility’ does not exactly express a 
theoretical impossibility.In fact, it bears within it a principle of 
calculation.The body, the imagination, pain, the heart to be re¬ 
spected are not, in effect, those of the criminal that is to be punished, 
but those of the men who, having subscribed to the pact, have the 
right of exercising against him the power of assembly.The pain that 
must exclude any reduction in punishment is that felt by the judges 
or spectators with all the hardness of heart that it may bring with it, 
all the ferocity induced by familiarity, or on the contrary, ill- 
founded feelings of pity and indulgence; ‘Thank God for those 
gentle, sensitive souls on whom those horrible executions exert a 
kind of torture’ (Lacretelle, 131).What has to be arranged and 
calculated are the return effects of punishment on the punishing 
authority and the power that it claims to exercise.
