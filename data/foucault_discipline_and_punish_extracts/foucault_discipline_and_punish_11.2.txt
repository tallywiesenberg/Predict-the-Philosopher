Punishment 


Here the principle takes root that one should never apply ‘in¬ 
humane’ punishments to a criminal, who, nevertheless, may well be 
a traitor and a monster.If the law must now treat in a ‘humane’ way 
an individual who is ‘outside nature’ (whereas the old justice treated 
the ‘outlaw’ inhumanely), it is not on account of some profound 
humanity that the criminal conceals within him, but because of a 
necessary regulation of the effects of power.It is this ‘economic’ 
rationality that must calculate the penalty and prescribe the appro¬ 
priate techniques.‘Humanity’ is the respectable name given to this 
economy and to its meticulous calculations.‘Where punishment is 
concerned, the minimum is ordered by humanity and counselled by 
policy.’* 

So, in order to understand this techno-politics of punishment, let 
us take the extreme case, the ultimate crime: a deed of such enormity 
that it violates all the most respected laws.
