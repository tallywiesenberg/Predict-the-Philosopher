It is produced in circum¬ 
stances so extraordinary, in such profound secrecy, with such lack 
of restraint, as if at the very limit of possibility, that it could not 
be other than unique, in any case the last of its kind: no one could 
ever imitate it; no one could take it as an example, or even feel 
scandalized that it should have been committed.It is doomed to 
disappear without trace.This fable’ of the ‘ultimate crime’ is, to the 
new penality, what original sin was to the old: the pure form in 
which the reason for punishment appears.Ought such a crime to be punished.^ According to what calcula¬ 
tion.^ Of what use could its punishment be in the economy of the 
power to punish.^ It would be useful to the extent that it could make 
reparation for ‘the harm done to society’ (Pastoret, II, 21).Now, 
if one sets aside the strictly material damage - which even when it is 
irreparable as in the case of a murder is of little account in relation 
to society as a whole - the injury that a crime inflicts upon the 
social body is the disorder that it introduces into it: the scandal that 
it gives rise to, the example that it gives, the incitement to repeat it 
if it is not punished, the possibility of becoming widespread that it 
bears within it.
