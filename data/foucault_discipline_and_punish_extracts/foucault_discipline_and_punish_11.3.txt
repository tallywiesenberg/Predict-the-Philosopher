In order to be useful, punishment must have as its 
objective the consequences of the crime, that is to say, the series of 
disorders that it is capable of initiating: ‘The proportion between 
the penalty and the quality of the offence is determined by the 
influence that the violation of the pact has on the social order’

Generalized punishment 


(Filangieri, 214).But this influence of a crime is not necessarily in 
direct proportion to its horror; a crime that horrifies the conscience 
is often of less effect than an offence that everyone tolerates and feels 
quite ready to imitate.There is a scarcity of great crimes; on the 
other hand, there is the danger that everyday offences may multiply.So one must not seek a qualitative relation between the crime and 
its punishment, an equivalence of horror: ‘Can the cries of a wretch 
in torment bring back from the depths of a past that cannot return 
an action that has already been committed.^’ (Beccaria, 87).One 
must calculate a penalty in terms not of the crime, but of its possible 
repetition.
