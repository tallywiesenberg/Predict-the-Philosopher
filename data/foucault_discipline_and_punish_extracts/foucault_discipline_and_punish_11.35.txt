One must take into account not the past offence, but the 
future disorder.Things must be so arranged that the malefactor can 
have neither any desire to repeat his offence, nor any possibility of 
having imitators.Â® Punishment, then, will be an art of effects; rather 
than opposing the enormity of the penalty to the enormity of the 
crime, one must adjust to one another the two series that follow 
from the crime: its own effects and those of the penalty.A crime 
without a dynasty does not call for punishment; any more than, 
according to another version of the same fable, a society on the 
verge of dissolution and disappearance would have the right to erect 
scaffolds.The last crime cannot but remain unpunished.TTiis was an old view.
