The function of punishment as example 
was to be found long before the eighteenth-century reform.That 
punishment looks towards the future, and that at least one of its 
major functions is to prevent crime had, for centuries, been one of 
the current justifications of the right to punish.But the difference 
was that the prevention that was expected as an effect of the punish¬ 
ment and its spectacle - and therefore of its excess - tended now to 
become the principle of its economy and the measure of its just 
proportions.One must punish exactly enough to prevent repetition.There is, then, a shift in the mechanics of example: in a penality 
employing public torture and execution, example was the answer 
to the crime; it had, by a sort of twin manifestation, to show the 
crime and at the same time to show the sovereign power that 
mastered it; in a penality calculated according to its own effects, 
example must refer back to the crime, but in the most discreet way 
possible and with the greatest possible economy indicate the inter¬
