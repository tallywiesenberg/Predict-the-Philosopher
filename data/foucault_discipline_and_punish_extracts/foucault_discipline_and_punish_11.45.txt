The example is no longer a ritual that maniÂ¬ 
fests; it is a sign that serves as an obstacle.Through this technique of 
punitive signs, which tends to reverse the whole temporal field of 
penal action, the reformers thought they were giving to the power 
to punish an economic, effective instrument that could be made 
general throughout the entire social body, capable of coding all its 
behaviour and consequently of reducing the whole diffuse domain 
of illegalities.The semio-technique with which one tried to arm the 
power to punish rested on five or six major rules.The rule of minimum quantity.A crime is committed because it 
procures certain advantages.
