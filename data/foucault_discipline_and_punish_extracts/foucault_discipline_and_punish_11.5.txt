to the 1810 code, madness was dealt with only in terms of article 64. 
Now this article states that there is neither crime nor offence if the 
offender was of unsound mind at the time of the act. The possibility 
of ascertaining madness was, therefore, a quite separate matter from 
the definition of an act as a crime; the gravity of the act was not

altered by the fact that its author was insane, nor the punishment 
reduced as a consequence; the crime itself disappeared. It was im¬ 
possible, therefore, to declare that someone was both guilty and 
mad; once the diagnosis of madness had been accepted, it could not 
be included in the judgement; it interrupted the procedure and 
loosened the hold of the law on the author of the act. Not only the 
examination of the criminal suspected of insanity, but the very 
effects of this examination had to be external and anterior to the 
sentence. But, very soon, the courts of the nineteenth century began 
to misunderstand the meaning of article 64. Despite several decisions 
of the supreme court of appeal confirming that insanity could not 
result either in a light penalty, or even in an acquittal, but required 
that the case be dismissed, the ordinary courts continued to bring 
the question of insanity to bear on their verdicts. They accepted 
that one could be both guilty and mad; less guilty the madder one 
was; guilty certainly, but someone to be put away and treated rather 
than punished; not only a guilty man, but also dangerous, since 
quite obviously sick, etc. From the point of view of the penal code, 
the result was a mass of juridical absurdities. But this was the starting 
point of an evolution that jurisprudence and legislation itself was to 
precipitate in the course of the next 150 years: already the reform 
of 1832, introducing attenuating circumstances, made it possible to 
modify the sentence according to the supposed degrees of an illness 
or the forms of a semi-insanity. And the practice of calling on 
psychiatric expertise, which is widespread in the assize courts and 
sometimes extended to courts of summary jurisdiction, means that 
the sentence, even if it is always formulated in terms of legal punish¬ 
ment, implies, more or less obscurely, judgements of normality, 
attributions of causality, assessments of possible changes, anticipa¬ 
tions as to the offender’s future. It would be wrong to say that all 
these operations give substance to a judgement from the outside; 
they are directly integrated in the process of forming the sentence. 
Instead of insanity eliminating the crime according to the original 
meaning of article 64, every crime and even every offence now 
carries within it, as a legitimate suspicion, but also as a right that may
