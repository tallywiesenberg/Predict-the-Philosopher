If one linked, to the idea of crime, the 
idea of a slightly greater disadvantage, it would cease to be desir¬ 
able.‘For punishment to produce the effect that must be expected of 
it, it is enough that the harm that it causes exceed the good that the 
criminal has derived from the crime’ (Beccaria, 89).A proximity 
between penalty and crime can, indeed must, be accepted; but no 
longer in its old form, where the public execution had to be equi¬ 
valent in intensity to the crime, with an additional factor that 
marked the ‘surplus power’ of the sovereign carrying out his legiti¬ 
mate vengeance; it is a quasi-equivalence at the level of interests: a 
little more interest in avoiding the penalty than in risking the crime.The rule of sufficient ideality.If the motive of a crime is the 
advantage expected of it, the effectiveness of the penalty is the dis¬ 
advantage expected of it.
