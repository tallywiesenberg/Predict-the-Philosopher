This means that the ‘pain’ at the heart of 
punishment is not the actual sensation of pain, but the idea of pain, 
displeasure, inconvenience - the ‘pain’ of the idea of ‘pain’.Punish¬ 
ment has to make use not of the body, but of representation.Or 
rather, if it does make use of the body, it is not so much as the sub¬ 
ject of a pain as the object of a representation: the memory of pain 
must prevent a repetition of the crime, just as the spectacle, how¬ 
ever artificial it may be, of a physical punishment may prevent the 
contagion of a crime.But it is not pain in itself that will be the 
instrument of the technique of punishment.Therefore, as long as 
possible, and except in cases requiring an effective representation, 
one should avoid recourse to the great panoply of the scaffold.
