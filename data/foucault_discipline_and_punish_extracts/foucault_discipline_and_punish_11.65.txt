Beccaria illustrated this paradox in the punish¬ 
ment that he proposed to replace the death sentence - perpetual 
slavery.Is this not a physically more cruel punishment than death.’ 
Not at all, he says: because the pain of slavery, for the condemned 
man, is divided into as many portions as he has moments left to live; 
it is an infinitely divisible penalty, an Eleatic penalty, much less 
severe than capital punishment, which is only one step away from 
the public execution.On the other hand, for those who see these 
slaves, or represent them to themselves, the pains they bear are 
concentrated into a single idea; all the moments of slavery are 
contracted into a representation that then becomes more terrifying 
than the idea of death.It is the economically ideal punishment: it 
is minimal for him who undergoes it (and who, reduced to slavery, 
cannot repeat his crime) and it is maximal for him who represents it 
to himself.‘Among the penalties, and in the way of applying them 
in proportion to the offences, one must choose the means that will 
leave the most lasting impression on the minds of the people, and 
the least cruel on the body of the criminal’ (Beccaria, 87).
