The monarch must renounce his right of 
pardon so that the force that is present in the idea of punishment 
is not attenuated by the hope of intervention: ‘If one allows men to 
see that the crime may be pardoned and that punishment is not a 
necessary consequence of it, one nourishes in them the hope of 
going unpunished...The laws must be inexorable, those who 
execute them inflexible.’® Above all, no crime committed must 
escape the gaze of those whose task it is to dispense justice.Nothing 
so weakens the machinery of the law than the hope of going un¬ 
punished; how could one establish in the minds of the public a strict 
link between the offence and a penalty if it were affected by a certain 
coefficient of improbability.^ Would it not be necessary to make the 
penalty the more to be feared in its violence as it is less to be feared 
in its uncertainty.^ Rather than imitate the old system in this way 
and be ‘more severe, one must be more vigilant’.’" Hence the idea 
that the machinery of justice must be duplicated by an organ of 
surveillance that would work side by side with it, and which would 
make it possible either to prevent crimes, or, if committed, to arrest 
their authors; police and justice must work together as two comple¬ 
mentary actions of the same process - the police assuring ‘the action 
of society on each individual’, justice ‘the rights of individuals 
against society’ (Duport, Archives parlementaires, XXI, 45).
