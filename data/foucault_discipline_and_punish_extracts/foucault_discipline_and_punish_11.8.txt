Thus 
every crime will come to the light of day and be punished in all 
certainty.But it is also necessary that the legal procedures should 
not remain secret, that the reasons why a defendant is condemned or 
acquitted should be known to all, and each individual must be able 
to recognize the reasons for a penalty: ‘Let the magistrate speak his 
opinion aloud, let him be obliged to read in his judgement the text 
of the law that condemns the defendant...Let the procedures that 
are buried mysteriously in the obscurity of the records office be 
opened to all citizens who are concerned at the fate of the con¬ 
demned’ (Mably, 348).
