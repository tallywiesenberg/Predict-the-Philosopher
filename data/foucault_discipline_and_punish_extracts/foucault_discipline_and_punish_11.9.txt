The verification of the crime must obey the general criteria for all 
truth.In the arguments it employs, in the proofs it provides, legal 
judgement must be homogeneous with judgement in general.There 
is, therefore, an abandonment of legal proof, a rejection of torture, 
the need for a complete demonstration of the truth, an effacement 
of all correlation between degrees of suspicion and degrees of 
punishment.Like a mathematical truth, the truth of the crime will 
be accepted only when it is completely proven.It follows that, up 
to the final demonstration of his crime, the defendant must be 
regarded as innocent; and that, in order to carry out this demonstra¬ 
tion, the judge must use not ritual forms, but common instruments, 
that reason possessed by everyone, which is also that of philoso¬ 
phers and scientists: ‘In theory, I regard the magistrate as a philoso¬ 
pher who sets out to discover an interesting truth.
