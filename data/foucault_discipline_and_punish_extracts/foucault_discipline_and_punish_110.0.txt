century, a new legislation defined the power to punish as a general 
function of society that was exercised in the same manner over all its 
members, and in which each individual was equally represented: but 
in making detention the penalty par excellence, it introduced proce¬ 
dures of domination characteristic of a particular type of power. A

justice that is supposed to be ‘equal’, a legal machinery that is 
supposed to be ‘autonomous’, but which contains all the asymmetries 
of disciplinary subjection, this conjunction marked the birth of the 
prison, ‘the penalty of civilized societies’ (Rossi, 169). 

One can understand the self-evident character that prison punish¬ 
ment very soon assumed. In the first years of the nineteenth century, 
people were still aware of its novelty; and yet it appeared so bound 
up and at such a deep level with the very functioning of soci¬ 
ety that it banished into oblivion all the other punishments that 
the eighteenth-century reformers had imagined. It seemed to have 
no alternative, as if carried along by the very movement of histor)^ 
‘It is not chance, it is not the whim of the legislator that have made 
imprisonment the base and almost the entire edifice of our present 
penal scale: it is the progress of ideas and the improvement in 
morals’ (Van Meenan, 529-30). And, although, in a little over a 
century, this self-evident character has become transformed, it has 
not disappeared. We are aware of all the inconveniences of prison, 
and that it is dangerous when it is not useless. And yet one cannot 
‘see’ how to replace it. It is the detestable solution, which one seems 
unable to do without. 

This ‘self-evident’ character of the prison, which we find so diffi¬ 
cult to abandon, is based first of all on the simple form of ‘depriva¬ 
tion of liberty’. How could prison not be the penalty par excellence 
in a society in which liberty is a good that belongs to all in the same 
way and to which each individual is attached, as Duport put it, by 
a ‘universal and constant’ feeling.^ Its loss has therefore the same 
value for all; unlike the fine, it is an ‘egalitarian’ punishment. The 
prison is the clearest, simplest, most equitable of penalties. More¬ 
over, it makes it possible to quantify the penalty exactly according 
to the variable of time. There is a wages-form of imprisonment that 
constitutes, in industrial societies, its economic ‘self-evidence’ - and 
enables it to appear as a reparation. By levying on the time of the 
prisoner, the prison seems to express in concrete terms the idea that 
the offence has injured, beyond the victim, society as a whole. There 
is an economico-moral self-evidence of a penality that metes out 
punishments in days, months and years and draws up quantitative 
equivalences between offences and durations. Hence the express¬ 
ion, so frequently heard, so consistent with the functioning of
