Prison 


by the law has as its principal aim the reparation of the crime, it also 
desires the amendment of the guilty man’ (Real, 244). And this 
transformation must be one of the internal effects of imprisonment. 
Prison-punishment, prison-apparatus: ‘The order that must reign in 
the mcuson deforce may contribute powerfully to the regeneration 
of the convicts; the vices of upbringing, the contagion of bad 
example, idleness ... have given birth to crime. Well, let us try to 
close up all these sources of corruption; let the rules of a healthy 
morality be practised in the maisons de force-, that, compelled to work, 
convicts may come in the end to like it; when they have reaped the 
reward, they will acquire the habit, the taste, the need for occupa¬ 
tion; let them give each other the example of a laborious life; it will 
soon become a pure life; soon they will begin to know regret for the 
past, the first harbinger of a love of duty.’* The techniques of cor¬ 
rection immediately form part of the institutional framework of 
penal detention. 

One should also recall that the movement for reforming the pri¬ 
sons, for controlling their functioning is not a recent phenomenon. 
It does not even seem to have originated in a recognition of failure. 
Prison ‘reform’ is virtually contemporary with the prison itself: it 
constitutes, as it were, its programme. From the outset, the prison 
was caught up in a series of accompanying mechanisms, whose 
purpose was apparently to correct it, but which seem to form part 
of its very functioning, so closely have they been bound up with its 
existence throughout its long history. There was, at once, a prolix 
technology of the prison. There were inquiries: that of Chaptal in 
i8oi (whose task it was to discover what could be used to introduce 
the modern prison system into France), that of Decazes in 1819, 
Villerme’s work published in 1820, the report on the maisons cen¬ 
trales drawn up by Martignac in 1829, the inquiries carried out in 
the United States by Beaumont and Tocqueville in 1831, by Demetz 
and Blouet in 1835, the questionnaires addressed by Montalivet to 
the directors of the maisons centrales and to the general councils of 
the dipartements during the debate on solitary confinement. There 
were societies for supervising the functioning of the prisons and for 
suggesting improvements: in 1818, the very official SocUti pour 
Vamelioration des prisons, a little later the Sociiti des prisons and 
various philanthropic groups. Innumerable measures - orders.
