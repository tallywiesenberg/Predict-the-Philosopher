Complete and austere institutions 


instructions or laws: from the reform that the first Restoration had 
envisaged in September 1814, and which was never implemented, to 
the law of 1844, drawn up by Tocqueville, which ended for a time 
the long debate on the means of making imprisonment effective. 
There were programmes drawn up to improve the functioning of 
the machine-prison:® programmes for the treatment of the prisoners, 
models for material improvement, some of these, like those of 
Danjou and Harou-Romain, remaining no more than projects, 
others becoming embodied in instructions (like the circular of 9 
August 1841 on the building of maisons d’arret), others becoming 
actual buildings, such as the Petite Roquette in which cellular 
imprisonment was organized for the first time in France. 

To these should be added the publications that sprang more or 
less directly from the prison and were drawn up either by philan¬ 
thropists like Appert, or a little later by ‘specialists’ (such as the 
Armales de la CharidY or, again, by former prisoners; Pauvre 
Jacques at the end of the Restoration, or the Gazette de Sainte- 
Pilagie at the beginning of the July monarchy.® 

The prison should not be seen as an inert institution, shaken at 
intervals by reform movements. The ‘theory of the prison’ was its 
constant set of operational instructions rather than its incidental 
criticism - one of its conditions of functioning. The prison has 
always formed part of an active field in which projects, improve¬ 
ments, experiments, theoretical statements, personal evidence and 
investigations have proliferated. The prison institution has always 
been a focus of concern and debate. Is the prison still, then, a dark, 
abandoned region.^ Is the fact that one has ceased to say so for 
almost 200 years sufficient proof that it is not.^ In becoming a legal 
punishment, it weighted the old juridico-political question of the 
right to punish with all the problems, all the agitations that have 
surrounded the corrective technologies of the individual. 

Baltard called them ‘complete and austere institutions’ (Baltard, 
1829). In several respects, the prison must be an exhaustive disciplin¬ 
ary apparatus: it must assume responsibility for all aspects of the 
individual, his physical training, his aptitude to work, his everyday 
conduct, his moral attitude, his state of mind; the prison, much more 
than the school, the workshop or the army, which always involved a
