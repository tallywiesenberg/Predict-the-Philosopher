concerned only the way in which isolation should be used, it being 
accepted by all. 

The Auburn model prescribed the individual cell during the 
night, work and meals in common, but under the rule of absolute 
silence, the convicts being allowed to speak only to the warders, 
with their permission and in a low voice. It was a clear reference to 
the monastic model; a reference, too, to the discipline of the work¬ 
shop. The prison must be the microcosm of a perfect society in 
which individuals are isolated in their moral existence, but in which 
they come together in a strict hierarchical framework, with no 
lateral relation, communication being possible only in a vertical 
direction. The advantage of the Auburnian system, according to its 
advocates, was that it formed a duplication of society itself. Con¬ 
straint was assured by material means, but above all by a rule that 
one had to learn to respect and which was guaranteed by surveillance 
and punishment. Rather than keep the convicts ‘under lock and key 
like wild beasts in their cages’, they must be brought together, 
‘made to join together in useful exercises, forced together to adopt 
good habits, preventing moral contagion by active surveillance, 
maintaining reflection by the rule of silence’; this rule accustoms the 
convict ‘to regard the law as a sacred precept whose violation brings 
just and legitimate harm’ (Mittermaier, in Revue fran<iaise et itrangere 
de Ugislation, 1836). Thus this operation of isolation, assembly 
without communication and law guaranteed by uninterrupted 
supervision, must rehabilitate the criminal as a social individual: it 
trains him to a ‘useful and resigned activity’ (Gasparin); it restores 
for him ‘habits of sociability’ (Beaumont and Tocqueville, 112). 

In absolute isolation - as at Philadelphia - the rehabilitation of 
the criminal is expected not of the application of a common law, 
but of the relation of the individual to his own conscience and to 
what may enlighten him from within.’ ‘Alone in his cell, the convict 
is handed over to himself; in the silence of his passions and of the 
world that surrounds him, he descends into his conscience, he 
questions it and feels awakening within him the moral feeling that 
never entirely perishes in the heart of man’ {Journal des economistes, 
II, 1842). It is not, therefore, an external respect for the law or fear 
of punishment alone that will act upon the convict but the workings 
of the conscience itself. A profound submission, rather than a super-
