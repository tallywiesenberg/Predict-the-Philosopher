to destroy his existence by the variety of his vices, gradually becomes 
by dint of a habit that is at first purely external, but is soon trans¬ 
formed into a second nature, so familiar with work and the pleasures 
that derive from it, that, provided wise instruction has opened up 
his soul to repentance, he may be exposed with more confidence to 
temptations, when he finally recovers his liberty’ (Julius, 417-18). 
Work is defined, with isolation, as an agent of carceral transforma¬ 
tion. This is to be found as early as the code of 1808: ‘Although the 
penalty inflicted by the law has as its aim the reparation of a crime, 
it is also intended to reform the convict, and this double aim will 
be fulfilled if the malefactor is snatched from that fatal idleness 
which, having brought him to prison, meets him again within its 
walls and, seizing hold of him, brings him to the ultimate degree of 
depravity.’® Work is neither an addition nor a corrective to the 
regime of detention; whether it is a question of forced labour, 
reclusion or imprisonment, it is conceived, by the legislator himself, 
as necessarily accompanying it. But the necessity involved is pre¬ 
cisely not the necessity of which the eighteenth-century reformers 
spoke, when they wished to make imprisonment either an example 
for the public or a useful reparation for society. In the carceral 
regime, the link between work and punishment is of another type. 

Several polemics that took place under the Restoration and the 
July Monarchy throw light on the function attributed to penal 
labour. First, there was the debate on the subject of wages. The 
labour of prisoners was remunerated in France. This posed a prob¬ 
lem: if work in prison is remunerated, that work cannot really form 
part of the penalty; and the prisoner may therefore refuse to perform 
it. Moreover, wages reward the skill of the worker and not the 
improvement of the convict: ‘The worst subjects are almost every¬ 
where the most skilful workers; they are the most highly remuner¬ 
ated, consequently the most intemperate and least ready to repent’ 
(Marquet-Wasselot, quoted in Lucas, 324). The debate, which had 
never quite died down, was resumed with great liveliness in the 
early 1840s; it was a period of economic crisis, a period of workers’ 
agitation and a period, too, in which the opposition between the 
worker and the delinquent was beginning to crystallize (cf. below.

Chaumont glove-maker succeeded in organizing a workshop at 
Clairvaux, the workers protested, declared that their labour was
