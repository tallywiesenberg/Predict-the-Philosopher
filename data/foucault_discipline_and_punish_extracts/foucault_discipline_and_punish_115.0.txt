criricized for any unemployment it may give rise to: with its limited 
extent, and its low output, it cannot have a general effect on the 
economy. It is intrinsically useful, not as an activity of production, 
but by virtue of the effect it has on the human mechanism. It is a 
principle of order and regularity; through the demands that it 
imposes, it conveys, imperceptibly, the forms of a rigorous power; 
it bends bodies to regular movements, it excludes agitation and 
distraction, it imposes a hierarchy and a surveillance that are all the 
more accepted, and which will be inscribed all the more deeply in 
the behaviour of the convicts, in that they form part of its logic: 
with work ‘the rule is introduced into a prison, it reigns there with¬ 
out effort, without the use of any repressive and violent means. 
By occupying the convict, one gives him habits of order and obedi¬ 
ence; one makes the idler that he was diligent and active ... with 
time, he finds in the regular movement of the prison, in the manual 
labours to which he is subjected ... a certain remedy against the 
wanderings of his imagination’ (B 4 renger). Penal labour must be 
seen as the very machinery that transforms the violent, agitated, 
unreflective convict into a part that plays its role with perfect 
regularity. The prison is not a workshop; it is, it must be of itself, 
a machine whose convict-workers are both the cogs and the pro¬ 
ducts; it ‘occupies them continually, with the sole aim of filling their 
moments. When the body is agitated, when the mind applies itself 
to a particular object, importunate ideas depart, calm is born once 
again in the soul’ (Danjou, 180). If, in the final analysis, the work of 
the prison has an economic effect, it is by producing individuals 
mechanized according to the general norms of an industrial society: 
‘Work is the providence of the modern peoples; it replaces morality, 
fills the gap left by beliefs and is regarded as the principle of all good. 
Work must be the religion of the prisons. For a machine-society, 
purely mechanical means of reform are required’ (Faucher, 64; in 
England the ‘treadmill’ and the pump provided a disciplinary 
mechanization of the inmates, with no end product). The making 
of machine-men, but also of proletarians; in effect, when one has

only a ‘pair of arms for any good work’, one can live only ‘from 
the product of one’s labour, through the practice of a profession or 
from the product of the labour of others, by thieving’; but, although 
the prison did not force offenders to work, it seems to have reintro¬ 
duced into its very institution and, obliquely, by means of taxation, 
this levying by some on the labour of others: ‘The question of
