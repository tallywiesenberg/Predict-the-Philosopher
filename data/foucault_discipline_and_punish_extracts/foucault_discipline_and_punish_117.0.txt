and rewards that is a way not simply of gaining respect for the prison 
regulations, but of making the action of the prison on the inmates 
effective. The legal authority itself came to accept this: ‘One should 
not be surprised, said the supreme court of appeal, when consulted 
on the subject of a bill concerning the prisons, at the idea of granting 
rewards, which might consist either for the most part in money, or 
in a better diet, or even in a reduction of the duration of the penalty. 
If anything can awaken in the minds of convicts the notions of good 
and evil, bring them to moral reflections and raise them to some 
extent in their own eyes, it is the possibility of obtaining some 
reward’ (Lucas, II, 441-2). 

And it must be admitted that the legal authorities can have no 
immediate control over all these procedures that rectify the penalty 
as it proceeds. It is a question, in effect, of measures that by 
definition can intervene only after the sentence and can bear only on 
something other than the offences. Those who administer detention 
must therefore have an indispensable autonomy, when it comes to 
the question of individualizing and varying the application of the 
penalty: supervisors, a prison governor, a chaplain or an instructor 
are more capable of exercising this corrective function than those 
who hold the penal power. It is their judgement (understood as 
observation, diagnosis, characterization, information, differential 
classification) and not a verdict in the form of an attribution of guilt, 
that must serve as a support for this internal modulation of the 
penalty - for its mitigation or even its interruption. When in 1846, 
Bonneville presented his project of release on licence, he defined it 
as ‘the right of the administration, with the previous approval of the 
legal authority, to place in temporary liberty, after a sufficient period 
of expiation, the completely reformed convict, on condition that he 
will be brought back into prison on the slightest well-founded

complaint’ (Bonneville, 5). All this ‘arbitrariness’ which, in the 
old penal system, enabled the judges to modulate the penalty 
and the princes to ignore it if they so wished, all this arbitrariness, 
which the modern codes have withdrawn from the judicial power, 
has been gradually reconstituted on the side of the power that 
administers and supervises punishment. It is the sovereignty of 
knowledge possessed by the warder: ‘He is a veritable magistrate 
called upon to reign as sovereign in the prison ... who, in order not 
to fall short in his mission, must combine the most eminent virtue
