schema of individual isolation and hierarchy; the economic model 
of force applied to compulsory work; the technico-medical model 
of cure and normalization. The cell, the workshop, the hospital. 
The margin by which the prison exceeds detention is filled in fact 
by techniques of a disciplinary type. And this disciplinary addition 
to the juridical is what, in short, is called the ‘penitentiary’. 

This addition was not accepted easily. To begin with, there was 
the question of principle: the penalty must be nothing more than 
the deprivation of liberty; like our present rulers, but with all the 
freshness of his language, Decazes says: ‘The law must follow the 
convicted man into the prison where it has sent him’ (Decazes). But 
very soon - and this is a characteristic fact - these debates were to 
become a battle for appropriating control of this additional peni¬ 
tentiary element; the judges were to demand a right of inspection 
over the carceral mechanisms: ‘The moral enlightenment of the 
inmates requires innumerable cooperators; it is only by visits of 
inspection, commissions of surveillance and charity associations that 
this may be accomplished. Auxiliaries, then, are needed and it is the 
judges who must provide them’ (Ferrus, viii; an ordinance of 1847 
had set up commissions of surveillance). From this period, the 
penitentiary order had become sufficiently well established for there 
to be no question of dismantling it; the question was how to get 
control of it. This gave rise to the figure of the judge obsessed by a 
desire for prison. A century later, this was to give birth to a bastard, 
yet deformed child: the magistrate entrusted with the determination 
of penalties. 

But, if the penitentiary, in so far as it went well beyond mere 
detention, was able not only to establish itself, but to entrap the

whole of penal justice and to imprison the judges themselves, it was 
because it was able to introduce criminal justice into relations of 
knowledge that have since become its infinite labyrinth. 

The prison, the place where the penalty is carried out, is also the 
place of observation of punished individuals. This takes two forms: 
surveillance, of course, but also knowledge of each inmate, of his 
behaviour, his deeper states of mind, his gradual improvement; the 
prisons must be conceived as places for the formation of clinical 
knowledge about the convicts; ‘the penitentiary system cannot be
