therefore bring all his attention to bear on this object; it is a question 
both of discipline and economy. The more accurate and easy the 
surveillance, the less need will there be to seek in the strength of the 
building guarantees against attempted escape and communication 
between the inmates. But surveillance will be perfect if from a central 
hall the director or head-warder sees, without moving and without 
b«ng seen, not only the entrances of all the cells and even the inside 
of most of them when the unglazed door is open, but also the 
warders guarding the prisoners on every floor... With the formula 
of circular or semi-circular prisons, it would be possible to see from 
a single centre all the prisoners in their cells and the warders in the 
inspection galleries’ (Ducatel, 9). 

But the penitentiary Panopticon was also a system of individual¬ 
izing and permanent documentation. The same year in which 
variants of the Benthamite schema were recommended for the 
building of prisons, the system of ‘moral accounting’ was made 
compulsory: an individual report of a uniform kind in every prison, 
on which the governor or head-warder, the chaplain and the 
instructor had to fill in their observations on each inmate: ‘It is in a 
way the vade mecum of prison administration, making it possible to 
assess each case, each circumstance and, consequently, to know 
what treatment to apply to each prisoner individually’ (Ducpetiaux, 
56-7). Many other, much more complete, systems of recording were 
planned or tried out (cf., for example, Gregory, i99ff; Grellet- 
Wammy, 23-5 and 199-203). The overall aim was to make the 
prison a place for the constitution of a body of knowledge that 
would regulate the exercise of penitentiary practice. The prison has 
not only to know the decision of the judges and to apply it in terms

of the established regulations: it has to extract unceasingly from the 
inmate a body of knowledge that will make it possible to transform 
the penal measure into a penitentiary operation; which will make of 
the penalty required by the offence a modification of the inmate that 
will be of use to society. The autonomy of the carceral regime and 
the knowledge that it creates make it possible to increase the utility 
of the penalty, which the code had made the very principle of its 
punitive philosophy: ‘The governor must not lose sight of a single 
inmate, because in whatever part of the prison the inmate is to be 
found, whether he is entering or leaving, or whether he is staying 
there, the governor must also justify the motives for his staying in
