be claimed, the hypothesis of insanity, in any case of anomaly. And 
the sentence that condemns or acquits is not simply a judgement of 
guilt, a legal decision that lays down punishment; it bears within it

an assessment of normality and a technical prescription for a possible 
normalization. Today the judge - magistrate or juror - certainly does 
more than ‘judge’. 

And he is not alone in judging. Throughout the penal procedure 
and the implementation of the sentence there swarms a whole 
series of subsidiary authorities. Small-scale legal systems and 
parallel judges have multiplied around the principal judgement: 
psychiatric or psychological experts, magistrates concerned with 
the implementation of sentences, educationalists, members of the 
prison service, all fragment the legal power to punish; it might be 
objected that none of them really shares the right to judge; that some, 
after sentence is passed, have no other right than to implement the 
punishment laid down by the court and, above all, that others - the 
experts - intervene before the sentence not to pass judgement, but 
to assist the judges in their decision. But as soon as the penalties and 
the security measures defined by the court are not absolutely deter¬ 
mined, from the moment they may be modified along the way, 
from the moment one leaves to others than the judges of the offence 
the task of deciding whether the condemned man ‘deserves’ to be 
placed in semi-liberty or conditional liberty, whether they may 
bring his penal tutelage to an end, one is handing over to them 
mechanisms of legal punishment to be used at their discretion: 
subsidiary judges they may be, but they are judges all the same. 
The whole machinery that has been developing for years around 
the implementation of sentences, and their adjustment to individuals, 
creates a proliferation of the authorities of judicial decision-making 
and extends its powers of decision well beyond the sentence. The 
psychiatric experts, for their part, may well refrain from judging. 
Let us examine the three questions to which, since the 1958 ruling, 
they have to address themselves: Does the convicted person repre¬ 
sent a danger to society.^ Is he susceptible to penal punishment.^ Is he 
curable or readjustable.^ These questions have nothing to do with 
article 64, nor with the possible insanity of the convicted person at 
the moment of the act. They do not concern ‘responsibility’. They 
concern nothing but the administration of the penalty, its necessity, 
its usefulness, its possible effectiveness; they make it possible to
