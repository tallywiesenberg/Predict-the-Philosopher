Henceforth, penal practice was to be subject to a common rule of 
truth, or rather to a complex rule in which heterogeneous elements 
of scientific demonstration, the evidence of the senses and common 
sense come together to form the judge’s ‘deep-seated conviction’.Although penal justice preserves the forms that guarantee its equity, 
it may now be opened up to all manner of truths, providing they 
are evident, well founded, acceptable to all.The legal ritual in itself 
no longer generates a divided truth.It is resituated in the field of 
reference of common proofs.With the multiplicity of scientific 
discourses, a difficult, infinite relation was then forged that penal 
justice is still unable to control.
