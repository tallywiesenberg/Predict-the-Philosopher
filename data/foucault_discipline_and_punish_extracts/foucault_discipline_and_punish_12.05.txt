The master of justice is no longer 
the master of its truth.The rule of optimal specification.For penal semiotics to cover the 
whole field of illegalities that one wishes to eliminate, all offences 
must be defined; they must be classified and collected into species 
from which none of them can escape.A code is therefore necessary 
and this code must be sufficiently precise for each type of offence to 
be clearly present in it.The silence of the law must not harbour the 
hope of impunity.
