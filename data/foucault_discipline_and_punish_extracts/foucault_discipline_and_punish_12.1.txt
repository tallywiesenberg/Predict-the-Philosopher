An exhaustive, explicit code is required, defining 
crimes and fixing penalties.(On this theme, cf., among others, 
Linguet, 8.)But the same imperative need for a total coincidence 
between all possible offences and the effects-signs of punishment 
forces one to go further.The idea of the same punishment does not 
have the same effect on everyone: the rich do not fear fines nor the 
notorious infamy.The injury caused by an offence and its value as 
example differ according to the status of the offender; a crime 
committed by a noble is more injurious to society than one comÂ¬ 
mitted by a man of the people (Lacretelle, 144).
