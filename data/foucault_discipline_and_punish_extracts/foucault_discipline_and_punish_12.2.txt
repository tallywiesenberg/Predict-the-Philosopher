The old system - and on this point it followed Christian peniten¬ 
tiary practice - used two series of variables to adjust the punishment, 
those of‘circumstances’ and those of‘intention’; elements, that is to 
say, that made it possible to qualify the act itself.The modulation 
of the penalty belonged to ‘casuistry’ in the broad sense.(On the 
non-individualizing character of casuistry, cf.Cariou.)But what 
was now beginning to emerge was a modulation that referred to the 
defendant himself, to his nature, to his way of life and his attitude of 
mind, to his past, to the ‘quality’ and not to the intention of his will.
