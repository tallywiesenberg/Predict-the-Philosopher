One perceives, but as a place as yet unfilled, the locus in which, in 
penal practice, psychological knowledge will take over the role of 
casuistic jurisprudence.Of course, at the end of the eighteenth

link was sought in the scientific models of the period.Natural 
history no doubt offered the most adequate schema: the taxonomy 
of species according to an uninterrupted gradation.One sought to 
constitute a Linnaeus of crimes and punishments, so that each 
particular offence and each punishable individual might come, withÂ¬ 
out the slightest risk of any arbitrary action, within the provisions 
of a general law.
