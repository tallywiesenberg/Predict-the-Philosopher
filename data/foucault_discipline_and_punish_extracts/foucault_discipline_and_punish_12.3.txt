‘A table must be drawn up of all the genera of 
crimes to be observed in different countries.According to the

Punishment 


enumeration of crimes, a division into species must be carried out.The best rule of this division is, it seems to me, to separate the 
crimes according to their objects.This division must be such that 
each species is quite distinct from another, and that each particular 
crime, considered in all its relations may be placed between that 
which must precede it and that which must follow it, in the strictest 
gradation; lastly, this table must be such that it may be compared 
with another table that will be drawn up for penalties, in such a way 
that they may correspond exactly to one another’ (Lacretelle, 351- 
352).In theory, or rather in dream, the double taxonomy of 
punishments and crimes will solve the problem: but how is one to 
apply fixed laws to particular individuals.^ 

Far removed from this speculative model, forms of anthropologi¬ 
cal individualization were being constituted at the same period in 
what was still a very rough and ready way.
