Let us take first the 
notion of the repetition of crime.Not that this was unknown to the 
old criminal laws.^i But it was tending to become a description 
of the defendant himself capable of altering the sentence passed: 
according to the legislation of 1791, recidivists were liable in almost 
all cases to a doubling of the penalty; according to the law of Floreal 
Year X, they had to be branded with the letter R; and the penal code 
of 1810 inflicted on them either the maximum possible of the normal 
penalty, or the penalty immediately above it.Now, through the 
repetition of the crime, what one was aiming at was not the author 
of an act defined by law, but the delinquent subject himself, a certain 
will that manifested his intrinsically criminal character.Gradually, 
as criminality, rather than crime, became the object of penal interÂ¬ 
vention, the opposition between first oflFender and recidivist tended 
to become more important.And on the basis of this opposition, 
reinforcing it on several points, one sees at the same period the 
formation of the notion of the 'crime passioneV - an involuntary, 
unpremeditated crime, bound up with extraordinary circumstances, 
which, while not offering the same excuse as madness, nevertheless 
prevented it from being regarded as an ordinary crime.
