As early as 
1791, Le Peletier remarked that the subtle gradation of penalties 
that he had presented to the Constituent Assembly might dissuade 
from crime ‘the evil-doer who plans a wicked action in cold blood’, 
and who may be restrained by thoughts of the penalty; but, on the

other hand, it was powerless against crimes due to ‘violent passions 
that have no regard to consequences’; this, however, was unimport¬ 
ant, since such crimes revealed in their authors ‘no reasoned wicked¬ 
ness.’** 

Beneath the humanization of the penalties, what one finds are all 
those rules that authorize, or rather demand, ‘leniency’, as a calcu¬ 
lated economy of the power to punish.But they also provoke a 
shift in the point of application of this power: it is no longer the 
body, with the ritual play of excessive pains, spectacular brandings 
in the ritual of the public execution; it is the mind or rather a play 
of representations and signs circulating discreetly but necessarily 
and evidently in the minds of all.It is no longer the body, but the 
soul, said Mably.And we see very clearly what he meant by this 
term; the correlative of a technique of power.Old ‘anatomies’ of 
punishment are abandoned.
