But have we really entered the age of 
non-corporal punishment.^ 

At the point of departure, then, one may place the political 
project of rooting out illegalities, generalizing the punitive function 
and delimiting, in order to control it, the power to punish.From 
this there emerge two lines of objectification of crime and of the 
criminal.On the one hand, the criminal designated as the enemy of 
all, whom it is in the interest of all to track down, falls outside the 
pact, disqualifies himself as a citizen and emerges, bearing within 
him as it were, a wild fragment of nature; he appears as a villain, 
a monster, a madman, perhaps, a sick and, before long, ‘abnormal’ 
individual.It is as such that, one day, he will belong to a scientific 
objectification and to the ‘treatment’ that is correlative to it.On the 
other hand, the need to measure, from within, the effects of the 
punitive power prescribes tactics of intervention over all criminals, 
actual or potential; the organization of a field of prevention, the 
calculation of interests, the circulation of representations and signs, 
the constitution of a horizon of certainty and proof, the adjustment 
of penalties to ever more subtle variables; all this also leads to an 
objectification of criminals and crimes.
