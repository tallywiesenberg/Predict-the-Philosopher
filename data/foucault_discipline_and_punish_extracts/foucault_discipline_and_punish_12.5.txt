In either case, one sees that 
the power relation that underlies the exercise of punishment begins 
to be duplicated by an object relation in which are caught up not 
only the crime as a fact to be established according to common

Punishment 


norms, but the criminal as an individual to be known according 
to specific criteria.One also sees that this object relation is not 
superimposed, from the outside, on the punitive practice, as would 
be a prohibition laid on the fury of the public execution by the 
limits of the sensibility, or as would be a rational or ‘scientific’ 
interrogation as to what this man that one is punishing really is.The 
processes of objectification originate in the very tactics of power and 
of the arrangement of its exercise.However, the two types of objectification that emerge with the 
project of penal reform are very different from one another: both in 
their chronology and in their effects.The objectification of the 
criminal as outside the law, as natural man, is still only a potentiality, 
a vanishing trace, in which are entangled the themes of political 
criticism and the figures of the imagination.
