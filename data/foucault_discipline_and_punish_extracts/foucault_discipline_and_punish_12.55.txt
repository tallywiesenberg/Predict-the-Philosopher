One will have to wait a 
long time before homo criminalis becomes a definite object in the 
field of knowledge.The other, on the contrary, has had much more 
rapid and decisive effects in so far as it was linked more directly 
to the reorganization of the power to punish; codification, definition 
of offences, the fixing of a scale of penalties, rules of procedure, 
definition of the role of magistrates.And also because it made use 
of the discourse already constituted by the Ideologues.This discourse 
provided, in effect, by means of the theory of interests, representa¬ 
tions and signs, by the series and geneses that it reconstituted, a sort 
of general recipe for the exercise of power over men: the ‘mind’ as 
a surface of inscription for power, with semiology as its tool; the 
submission of bodies through the control of ideas; the analysis of 
representations as a principle in a politics of bodies that was much 
more effective than the ritual anatomy of torture and execution.The 
thought of the Ideologues was not only a theory of the individual 
and society; it developed as a technology of subtle, effective, 
economic powers, in opposition to the sumptuous expenditure of 
the power of the sovereign.
