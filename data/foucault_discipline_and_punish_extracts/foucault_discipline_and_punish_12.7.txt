The undertaking can succeed only if it forms part of 
a natural mechanics.‘Like the gravitation of bodies, a secret force 
compels us ever towards our well-being.This impulsion is affected 
only by the obstacles that laws oppose to it.All the diverse actions 
of man are the effects of this interior tendency.’ To find the suitable 
punishment for a crime is to find the disadvantage whose idea is 
such that it robs for ever the idea of a crime of any attraction.It 
is an art of conflicting energies, an art of images linked by associa¬ 
tion, the forging of stable connections that defy time: it is a matter 
of establishing the representation of pairs of opposing values, of 
establishing quantitative differences between the opposing forces, 
of setting up a complex of obstacle-signs that may subject the 
movement of the forces to a power relation.
