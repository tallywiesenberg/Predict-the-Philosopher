If this is the 
triumph of justice, it is also the triumph of liberty, for then penalties 
no longer proceed from the will of the legislator, but from the nature 
of things; one no longer sees man committing violence on man’ 
(Marat, 33).In analogical punishment, the power that punishes is 
hidden.The reformers proposed a whole panoply of penalties that were 
natural by institution and which represented in their form the 
content of the crime.Take Vermeil, for example: those who abuse 
public liberty will be deprived of their own; those who abuse the 
benefits of law and the privileges of public office will be deprived of 
their civil rights; speculation and usury will be punished by fines; 
theft will be punished by confiscation; ‘vainglory’ by humiliation; 
murder by death; fire-raising by the stake.In the case of the poi¬ 
soner, ‘the executioner will present him with a goblet the contents 
of which will be thrown into his face; thus he will be made to feel 
the horror of his crime by being offered an image of it; he will then 
be thrown into a cauldron of boiling water’ (Vermeil, 68-145; cf.
