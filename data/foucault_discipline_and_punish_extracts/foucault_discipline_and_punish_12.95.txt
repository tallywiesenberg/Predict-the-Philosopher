The punishment must proceed 
from the crime; the law must appear to be a necessity of things, and 
power must act while concealing itself beneath the gentle force of 
nature.2.This complex of signs must engage with the mechanics of 
forces: reduce the desire that makes the crime attractive; increase 
the interest that makes the penalty be feared; reverse the relation of 
intensities, so that the representation of the penalty and its dis¬ 
advantages is more lively than that of the crime and its pleasures.There is a whole mechanics, therefore, of interest, of its movement, 
of the way that one represents it to oneself and of the liveliness of 
this representation.‘The legislator must be a skilful architect who 
knows how to employ all the forces that may contribute to the 
solidity of the building and reduce all those that might ruin it’ 
(Beccaria, 135).
