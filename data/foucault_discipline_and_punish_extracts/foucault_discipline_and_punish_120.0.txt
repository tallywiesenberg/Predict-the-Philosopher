dangerous proclivities of the first, the harmful predispositions of the 
second and the bad antecedents of the third. This biographical 
investigation is an essential part of the preliminary investigation for 
the classification of penalities before it becomes a condition for the 
classification of moralities in the penitentiary system. It must 
accompany the convict from the court to the prison, where the 
governor’s task is not only to receive it, but also to complete, super¬ 
vise and rectify its various factors during the period of detention’ 
(Lucas, II, 440-42). Behind the offender, to whom the investigation 
of the facts may attribute responsibility for an offence, stands the 
delinquent whose slow formation is shown in a biographical 
investigation. The introduction of the ‘biographical’ is important 
in the history of penality. Because it establishes the ‘criminal’ as 
existing before the crime and even outside it. And, for this reason, 
a psychological causality, duplicating the juridical attribution of 
responsibility, confuses its effects. At this point one enters the 
‘criminological’ labyrinth from which we have certainly not yet 
emerged: any determining cause, because it reduces responsibility, 
marks the author of the offence with a criminality all the more for¬ 
midable and demands penitentiary measures that are all the more 
strict. As the biography of the criminal duplicates in penal practice 
the analysis of circumstances used in gauging the crime, so one sees 
penal discourse and psychiatric discourse crossing each other’s 
frontiers; and there, at their point of junction, is formed the notion 
of the ‘dangerous’ individual, which makes it possible to draw up a 
network of causality in terms of an entire biography and to present 
a verdict of punishment-correction.** 

The delinquent is also to be distinguished from the offender in

that he is not only the author of his acts (the author responsible in 
terms of certain criteria of free, conscious will), but is linked to his 
offence by a whole bundle of complex threads (instincts, drives, 
tendencies, character). The penitentiary technique bears not on the 
relation between author and crime, but on the criminal’s affinity with 
his crime. The delinquent, the strange manifestation of an overall 
phenomenon of criminality, is to be found in quasi-natural classes, 
each endowed with its own characteristics and requiring a specific 
treatment, what Marquet-Wasselot called in 1841 the ‘ethnography 
of the prisons’; ‘The convicts are ... another people within the 
same people; with its own habits, instincts, morals’ (Marquet-
