their very incapacity. For these, solitude would merely encourage 
their inertia; they must therefore live in common, but in such a way 
as to form small groups, constantly stimulated by collective 
operations, and subjected to rigid surveillance’ (Ferrus, iSzff and 
zySff). Thus a ‘positive’ knowledge of the delinquents and their 
species, very different from the juridical definition of offences and 
their circumstances, is gradually established; but this knowledge is 
also distinct from the medical knowledge that makes it possible to 
introduce the insanity of the individual and, consequently, to efface 
the criminal character of the act. Ferrus states the principle quite 
clearly: ‘Considered as a whole, criminals are nothing less than 
madmen; it would be unjust to the latter to confuse them with 
consciously perverted men.’ The task of this new knowledge is to 
define the act ‘scientifically’ qua offence and above all the individual 
qua delinquent. Criminology is thus made possible. 

The correlative of penal justice may well be the offender, but the 
correlative of the penitentiary apparatus is someone other; this is the 
delinquent, a biographical unity, a kernel of danger, representing a 
type of anomaly. And, although it is true that to a detention that 
deprives of liberty, as defined by law, the prison added the addi¬ 
tional element of the penitentiary, this penitentiary element intro¬ 
duced in turn a third character who slipped between the individual 
condemned by the law and the individual who carries out this law. 
At the point that marks the disappearance of the branded, dis¬ 
membered, burnt, annihilated body of the tortured criminal, there

appeared the body of the prisoner, duplicated by the individuality 
of the ‘delinquent’, by the little soul of the criminal, which the very 
apparatus of punishment fabricated as a point of application of the 
power to punish and as the object of what is still called today 
penitentiary science. It is said that the prison fabricated delinquents; 
it is true that it brings back, almost inevitably, before the courts those 
who have been sent there. But it also fabricates them in the sense 
that it has introduced into the operation of the law and the offence, 
the judge and the offender, the condemned man and the executioner, 
the non-corporal reality of the delinquency that links them together 
and, for a century and a half, has caught them in the same trap. 

The penitentiary technique and the delinquent are in a sense twin 
brothers. It is not true that it was the discovery of the delinquent
