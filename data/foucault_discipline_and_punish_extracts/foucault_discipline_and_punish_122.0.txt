the object of a scientific technique are superimposed - or almost - 
one upon the other. That the grip of the prison on the penal system 
should not have led to a violent reaction of rejection is no doubt 
due to many reasons. One of these is that, in fabricating delinquency, 
it gave to criminal justice a unitary field of objects, authenticated 
by the ‘sciences’, and thus enabled it to function on a general 
horizon of ‘truth’. 

The prison, that darkest region in the apparatus of justice, is the 
place where the power to punish, which no longer dares to manifest 
itself openly, silently organizes a field of objectivity in which 
punishment will be able to function openly as treatment and the 
sentence be inscribed among the discourses of knowledge. It is 
understandable that justice should have adopted so easily a prison 
that was not the offspring of its own thoughts. Justice certainly owed 
the prison this recognition.

Illegalities and delinquency 


From the point of view of the law, detention may be a mere depriva¬ 
tion of liberty. But the imprisonment that performs this function 
has always involved a technical project. The transition from the 
public execution, with its spectacular rituals, its art mingled with the 
ceremony of pain, to the penalties of prisons buried in architectural 
masses and guarded by the secrecy of administrations, is not a 
transition to an undifferentiated, abstract, confused penality; it is the 
transition from one art of punishing to another, no less skilful one. 
It is a technical mutation. From this transition spring a symptom and 
a symbol: the replacement, in 1837, of the chain-gang by the police 
carriage. 

The chain-gang, a tradition that went back to the time of the 
galley slaves, was still surviving under the July monarchy. The 
importance it seems to have assumed as a spectacle at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century may be bound up with the fact that it 
combined in a single manifestation the two modes of punishment: 
the way to detention unfolded as a ceremonial of torture. (Faucher 
remarked that the chain-gang was a popular spectacle ‘especially 
since the scaffolds were almost entirely abolished’.) The accounts of 
the ‘last chain-gangs’ — those that crossed France in the summer of 
1836 - and of its scandals allow us to rediscover this functioning, so 
alien to the rules of ‘penitentiary science’. It began with a scaffold 
ritual: the fixing of iron collars and chains in the courtyard of
