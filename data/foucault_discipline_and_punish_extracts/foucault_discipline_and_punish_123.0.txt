with the priest, they said, down with that hateful man; he should 
have got his deserts. Without the energy and firmness of the muni¬ 
cipal guard, serious disorders could have taken place. At Vaugirard,

it was the women who were the most angry. They cried: Down with 
the wicked priest! Down with the monster Delacollonge! The 
police inspectors of Montrouge and Vaugirard and several mayors 
and deputy-mayors ran the gauntlet in their attempt to enforce the 
decision of the courts. Shortly before reaching Issy, Fran5ois, 
recognizing M. Allard and the officers of the brigade, threw his 
wooden bowl at them. It was then remembered that the families of 
some of the former comrades of the convict lived at Ivry. From that 
moment the police inspectors spread out along the route and fol¬ 
lowed the convicts’ cart closely. Those of the Paris gang all threw 
their wooden bowls at the heads of the police, some of whom were 
struck. At that moment, the crowd reacted strongly. They started to 
fight amongst themselves’ {Gaiette des tribimaux, 20 July 1836). 
Between Bicetre and Sevres a considerable number of houses were 
looted as the chain-gang passed by (La Phalange, i August 1836). 

In this festival of the departing convicts, there was something of 
the rites of the scapegoat that is struck as it is chased away, some¬ 
thing of the festival of fools, in which the reversal of roles is prac¬ 
tised, something of the old ceremonies of the scaffold, in which the 
truth must burst forth in the full light of day, something, too, of 
those popular spectacles, in which famous characters or traditional 
types were recognized: the play of truth and infamy, the procession 
of notoriety and shame, invective against the guilty who have been 
unmasked and, on the other hand, the joyous avowal of crimes. One 
sought to rediscover the face of the criminals who had had their 
glory; broadsheets recalled the crimes of those one saw pass; news¬ 
paper^ provided their names and recounted their lives; sometimes 
they provided a description of their persons and dress, so that their 
identity might not pass unnoticed: like programmes for spectators.* 
People also came to examine different types of criminals, trying to 
decide, according to facial appearance or dress, the ‘profession’ of 
the convict, whether he was a murderer or thief: it was a game of 
masquerades and marionnettes, which was also, for more educated 
eyes, something of an empirical ethnography of crime. From spec¬ 
tacles on trestles to Gall’s phrenology, according to the milieu to 
which one belonged, one practised the semiologies of crime at one’s 
disposal: ‘Physiognomies are as varied as clothes: here a majestic
