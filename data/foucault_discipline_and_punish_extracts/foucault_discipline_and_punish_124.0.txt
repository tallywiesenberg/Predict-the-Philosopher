Illegalities and delinquency 


receiving, but which were addressed to him, and the ridicule that 
brought back, under the appearances of another criminal, the priest 
that he was and would have liked to have concealed. His passion 
was laid out before his eyes, by a buffoon murderer to whom he was 
chained. 

In every town it passed through, the chain-gang brought its 
festival with it; it was a saturnalia of punishment, a penalty turned 
into a privilege. And, by a very curious tradition which seems to 
have escaped the ordinary rites of the public execution, it aroused 
in the convict not so much the compulsory marks of repentance as 
the explosion of a mad joy that denied the punishment. To the 
ornaments of the collar and chain, the convicts themselves added 
ribbons, braided straw, flowers or precious stuffs. The chain was the 
round and the dance; it was also a coupling, a forced marriage in 
forbidden love. Wedding, festival and rite in chains: ‘They ran in 
front of the chains, bunches of flowers in their hands, ribbons or 
straw tassels decorated their caps and the most skilful made crested 
helmets. . . Others wore open-work stockings and clogs or a 
fashionable waistcoat, under a workman’s smock.’* And throughout 
the evening that followed the riveting, the chain-gang formed a 
great merry-go-round, which went round and round the courtyard 
of Bicetre: ‘Woe betide the warders if the chain-gang recognized 
them; they were enveloped and drowned in its rings; the prisoners 
remained masters of the field of battle until nightfall.’® The convicts’ 
Sabbath corresponded to the ceremonial of justice through the 
spectacle it invented. It inverted the splendours, the order of power 
and its signs, the forms of pleasure. But something of the political 
Sabbath was not far away. One would have had to be very deaf 
indeed not to hear something of these new accents. The convicts 
sang marching songs, which rapidly became famous and were 
repeated everywhere for a long time after. No doubt an echo was 
to be found in them of the complaints that the broadsheets attributed 
to criminals - an affirmation of the crime, a black heroization, an 
evocation of terrible punishments and of the general hate that 
surrounded them: ‘Renown, let the trumpets blow for us. . . 
Courage, children, let us submit without fear to the terrible fate 
that hangs over our heads. . . Our chains are heavy, but we will 
bear them. For the convicts, no voice rises to say: relieve them of
