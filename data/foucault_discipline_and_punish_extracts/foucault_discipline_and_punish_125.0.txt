Illegaliries and delinquency 


agitation that had always surrounded the public executions now 
found an echo in precise threats. One can see why the July monarchy 
decided to abolish the chain-gang for the same - but more pressing - 
reasons that brought about, in the eighteenth century, the abolition 
of the public executions: ‘It is no part of our morality to treat men 
in this way; one must avoid providing in the towns that the convoy 
passes through so hideous a spectacle, which, in any case, teaches 
the population nothing’ (Gaiette des tribuneaux, 19 July 1836). It 
was necessary, therefore, to break with these public rites; to subject 
the movements of convicts to the same mutation as the punishments 
themselves; and to bring them, too, under the veil of administrative 
decency. 

But what, in June 1837, was adopted to replace the chain-gang was 
not the simple covered cart, which had been suggested at one time, 
but a machine that had been very meticulously designed: a carriage 
conceived as a moving prison, a mobile equivalent of the Panopticon. 
A central corridor divided it along its entire length: on either side 
were six cells in which the two rows of convicts sat facing one 
another. Their feet were placed in rings that were lined on the inside 
with wool and linked together by chains eighteen inches long; the 
legs were secured in metal knee-guards. The convict sat on a kind 
of ‘zinc and oak funnel that emptied onto the public way’. The cell 
had no window onto the outside; it was completely lined with sheet 
iron; only a ventilator, also of sheet-iron, with holes pierced in it, 
allowed a ‘suitable flow of air’. On the corridor side, the door of 
each cell was provided with a hatch, divided into two compartments: 
one for food, the other, covered by a grill, for surveillance. ‘The 
opening and the oblique direction of the hatches were so arranged 
that the warders had the prisoners constantly in view and heard 
every word they spoke, though the prisoners themselves were 
unable to see or hear one another.’ In this way, ‘the same carriage 
may, without the slightest inconvenience, contain at one and the 
same time a convict and a simple offender, men and women, children 
and adults. Whatever the length of the journey, all would be 
brought to their destination without having been able to perceive 
one another or to speak to one another.’ Lastly, the constant sur¬ 
veillance of the two warders, who were each armed with a small oak 
club, ‘with thick nails of crushed diamond’ made it possible to
