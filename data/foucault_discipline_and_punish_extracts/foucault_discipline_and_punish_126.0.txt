tion, then the recognition of its failure; then the slow rise of projects 
of reform, seeming to culminate in the more or less coherent 
definition of penitentiary technique; then the implementation of this 
project; lastly, the recognition of its successes or its failure. There 
was in fact a telescoping or in any case a different distribution of 
these elements. And, just as the project of a corrective technique 
accompanied the principle of punitive detention, the critique of the 
prison and its methods appeared very early on, in those same years 
1820-45; indeed, it was embodied in a number of formulations 
which - figures apart - are today repeated almost unchanged. 

- Prisons do not diminish the crime rate: they can be extended, 
multiplied or transformed, the quantity of crime and criminals 
remains stable or, worse, increases: ‘In France, one calculates at 
about 108,000 the number of individuals who are in a state of flagrant 
hostility to society. The means of repression at one’s disposal are; 
the scaffold, the iron-collar, three convict-ships, 19 maisons centrales, 
86 maisons de justice, 362 maisons d’arret, 2,800 cantonal prisons, 
2,238 cells in police stations. Despite all these, vice goes unchecked. 
The number of crimes is not diminishing... the number of recidiv¬ 
ists is increasing, rather than declining’ {La Fraterniti, no. 10, 
February 1842). 

- Detention causes recidivism; those leaving prison have more 
chance than before of going back to it; convicts are, in a very high 
proportion, former inmates; 38 per cent of those who left the maisons 
centrales were convicted again and 33 per cent of those sent to con¬ 
vict-ships (a figure given by G. de Rochefoucauld during the debate 
on the reform of the penal code, 2 December 1831, Archives parle- 
mentaires, LXXII, 209-10); between 1828 and 1834, out of almost 
35,000 convicted of crime, about 7,400 were recidivists (that is, 
I out of 4-7 of those convicted); out of over 200,000 correctionels, 
or petty offenders, almost 35,000 were also recidivists (i out of 6); 
in all, one recidivist out of 5 -8 of those convicted (Ducpetiaux, 1837, 
276!!); in 1831, out of 2,174 of those condemned for recidivism, 350 
had been in convict-ships, 1,682 in maisons centrales, 142 in four 
maisons de correction that followed the same regime as the centrales 
(Ducpetiaux, 1837, 276!?). And the diagnosis became even more 
severe during the July monarchy: in 1835, out of 7,223 convicted 
criminals, 1,486 were recidivists; in 1839,1,749 out of 7,858; in 1844, 



Prison 


1,821 out of 7,195. Among the 980 prisoners at Loos, there were 570 
recidivists and, at Melun, 745 out of 1,008 prisoners (Ferrus, 363-7). 
Instead of releasing corrected individuals, then, the prison was 
setting loose a swarm of dangerous delinquents throughout the 
population: '7,000 persons handed back each year to society... they 
are 7,000 principles of crime or corruption spread throughout the 
social body. And, when one thinks that this population is constantly 
increasing, that it lives and moves around us, ready to seize every 
opportunity of disorder, to avail itself of every crisis in society to 
try out its strength, can one remain unmoved by such a spectacle.^’ 
(Beaumont and Tocqueville, 22-3). 

- The prison cannot fail to produce delinquents. It does so by 
the very type of existence that it imposes on its inmates: whether 
they are isolated in cells or whether they are given useless work, 
for which they will find no employment, it is, in any case, not ‘to 
think of man in society; it is to create an unnatural, useless and dan¬ 
gerous existence’; the prison should educate its inmates, but can a 
system of education addressed to man reasonably have as its object 
to act against the wishes of nature.^ (Lucas, I, 127 and 130). The 
prison also produces delinquents by imposing violent constraints 
on its inmates; it is supposed to apply the law, and to teach respect 
for it; but all its functioning operates in the form of an abuse of 
power. The arbitrary power of administration: ‘The feeling of in¬ 
justice that a prisoner has is one of the causes that may make his 
character untamable. When he sees himself exposed in this way to 
suffering, which the law has neither ordered nor envisaged, he 
becomes habitually angry against everything around him; he sees 
every agent of authority as an executioner; he no longer thinks that 
he was guilty: he accuses justice itself’ (Bigot Preameneu). Corrup¬ 
tion, fear and the inefficiency of the warders: ‘Between 1,000 and 
1,500 convicts live under the surveillance of between thirty and 
forty supervisors, who can preserve some kind of security only by 
depending on informers, that is to say, on the corruption that they 
carefully sow themselves. Who are these warders.^ Retired soldiers, 
men uninstructed in their task, making a trade of guarding male¬ 
factors’ {La Fraternite, March 1842). Exploitation by penal labour, 
which can in these conditions have no educational character: ‘One 
inveighs against the slave-trade. But are not our prisoners sold.

Is this how we teach our prisoners honesty.^ Are they not still more 
demoralized by these examples of abominable exploitation.^’®
