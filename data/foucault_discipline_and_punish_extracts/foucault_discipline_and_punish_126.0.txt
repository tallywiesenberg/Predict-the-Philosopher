tion, then the recognition of its failure; then the slow rise of projects 
of reform, seeming to culminate in the more or less coherent 
definition of penitentiary technique; then the implementation of this 
project; lastly, the recognition of its successes or its failure. There 
was in fact a telescoping or in any case a different distribution of 
these elements. And, just as the project of a corrective technique 
accompanied the principle of punitive detention, the critique of the 
prison and its methods appeared very early on, in those same years 
1820-45; indeed, it was embodied in a number of formulations 
which - figures apart - are today repeated almost unchanged. 

- Prisons do not diminish the crime rate: they can be extended, 
multiplied or transformed, the quantity of crime and criminals 
remains stable or, worse, increases: ‘In France, one calculates at 
about 108,000 the number of individuals who are in a state of flagrant 
hostility to society. The means of repression at one’s disposal are; 
the scaffold, the iron-collar, three convict-ships, 19 maisons centrales, 
86 maisons de justice, 362 maisons d’arret, 2,800 cantonal prisons, 
2,238 cells in police stations. Despite all these, vice goes unchecked. 
The number of crimes is not diminishing... the number of recidiv¬ 
ists is increasing, rather than declining’ {La Fraterniti, no. 10, 
February 1842). 

- Detention causes recidivism; those leaving prison have more 
chance than before of going back to it; convicts are, in a very high 
proportion, former inmates; 38 per cent of those who left the maisons 
centrales were convicted again and 33 per cent of those sent to con¬ 
vict-ships (a figure given by G. de Rochefoucauld during the debate 
on the reform of the penal code, 2 December 1831, Archives parle- 
mentaires, LXXII, 209-10); between 1828 and 1834, out of almost 
35,000 convicted of crime, about 7,400 were recidivists (that is, 
I out of 4-7 of those convicted); out of over 200,000 correctionels, 
or petty offenders, almost 35,000 were also recidivists (i out of 6); 
in all, one recidivist out of 5 -8 of those convicted (Ducpetiaux, 1837, 
276!!); in 1831, out of 2,174 of those condemned for recidivism, 350 
had been in convict-ships, 1,682 in maisons centrales, 142 in four 
maisons de correction that followed the same regime as the centrales 
(Ducpetiaux, 1837, 276!?). And the diagnosis became even more 
severe during the July monarchy: in 1835, out of 7,223 convicted 
criminals, 1,486 were recidivists; in 1839,1,749 out of 7,858; in 1844,

1,821 out of 7,195. Among the 980 prisoners at Loos, there were 570 
recidivists and, at Melun, 745 out of 1,008 prisoners (Ferrus, 363-7). 
Instead of releasing corrected individuals, then, the prison was 
setting loose a swarm of dangerous delinquents throughout the
