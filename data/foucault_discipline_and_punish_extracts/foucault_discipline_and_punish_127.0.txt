of a milieu of delinquents, loyal to one another, hierarchized, ready 
to aid and abet any future criminal act: ‘Society prohibits associa¬ 
tions of more than twenty persons_and it constitutes for itself 

associations of 200, 500, 1,200 convicts in the maisons centrales, 
which are constructed for them ad hoc, and which it divides up for 
their greater convenience into workshops, courtyards, dormitories, 
refectories, where they can all meet together. . . And it multiplies 
them across France in such a way that, where there is a prison, 
there is an association ... and as many anti-social clubs’ (Moreau- 
Christophe, 7). And it is in these clubs that the education of the 
young first offender takes place; ‘The first desire that is born within 
him will be to learn from his cleverer seniors how to escape the 
rigours of the law; the first lesson will be derived from the strict 
logic of thieves who regard society as an enemy; the morality will 
be the informing and spying honoured in our prisons; the first 
passion to be aroused in him will be to frighten the young mind by 
these monsters that must have been born in the dungeon and which 
the pen refuses to name. . . Henceforth he has broken with every¬ 
thing that has bound him to society’ {L'Almanack populaire de 
France, 49-56). Faucher spoke of ‘barracks of crime’. 

- The conditions to which the free inmates are subjected neces¬ 
sarily condemn them to recidivism: they are under the surveillance 
of the police; they are assigned to a particular residence, or forbidden 
others; ‘they leave prison with a passport that they must show every¬ 
where they go and which mentions the sentence that they have 
served’ (Barbe Marbois, 17). Being on the loose, being unable to find 
work, leading the life of a vagabond are the most frequent factors in 
recidivism. The Gaiette des tribunaux, but also the workers’ news¬ 
papers, regularly cited cases like that of the worker convicted of 
theft, placed under surveillance at Rouen, caught again for theft, 
and whom no lawyers would defend; so he took it upon himself to 
speak before the court, told the story of his life, explained how, on 
leaving prison and forced to reside in a particular place, he was 
unable to take up his trade as a gilder, since as an ex-convict he was

turned down wherever he went; the police refused him the right to 
seek work elsewhere: he found himself unable to leave Rouen, with 
nothing to do but die of hunger and poverty as a result of this 
terrible surveillance. He went to the town hall and asked for work; 
for eight days he was given work in the cemeteries for fourteen sous 
a day: ‘But,’ he said, ‘I am young, I have a good appetite, I eat more 
than two pounds of bread a day at five sous a pound; what can I do 
with fourteen sous to feed myself, wash my clothes and find lodging.^
