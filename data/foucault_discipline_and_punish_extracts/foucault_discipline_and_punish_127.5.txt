I was driven to despair, I wanted to become an honest man again; 
the surveillance plunged me back into misfortune. I became dis¬ 
gusted with everything; it was then that I met Lemaitre, who was 
also a pauper; we had to live and wicked thoughts of thieving came 
back to us.’i® 

- Lastly, the prison indirectly produces delinquents by throwing 
the inmate’s family into destitution: ‘The same order that sends the 
head of the family to prison reduces each day the mother to destitu¬ 
tion, the children to abandonment, the whole family to vagabondage 
and begging. It is in this way that crime can take root’ (Lucas, II, 64). 

It should be noted that this monotonous critique of the prison 
always takes one of two directions: either that the prison was in¬ 
sufficiently corrective, and that the penitentiary technique was still 
at the rudimentary stage; or that in attempting to be corrective it 
lost its power as punishment,ii that the true penitentiary technique 
was rigour,** and that prison was a double economic error: directly, 
by its intrinsic cost and, indirectly, by the cost of the delinquency 
that it did not abolish.** The answer to these criticisms was invariably 
the same: the reintroduction of the invariable principles of peniten¬ 
tiary technique. For a century and a half the prison had always been 
offered as its own remedy: the reactivation of the penitentiary 
techniques as the only means of overcoming their perpetual failure; 
the realization of the corrective project as the only method of over¬ 
coming the impossibility of implementing it. 

This is shown conclusively in the fact that the prisoners’ revolts 
of recent weeks* have been attributed to the fact that the reforms 
proposed in 1945 never really took effect; that one must therefore 
return to the fundamental principles of the prison. But these

principles, of which such wonderful results are still expected today, 
are well enough known: for the past 150 years they have constituted 
the seven universal maxims of the good ‘penitential condition’.

formation of the individual’s behaviour: ‘The reform of the convict 
as the principal aim of the penalty is a sacred principle whose formal
