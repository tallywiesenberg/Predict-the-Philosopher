appearance in the domain of science and above all in that of legisla¬ 
tion is quite recent’ (‘Congres penitentiaire de Bruxelles’, 1847). 
And the Amor commission, of May 1945, faithfully repeats: ‘The 
penalty that deprives of liberty has as its essential aim the reforma¬ 
tion and social rehabilitation of the convict.’ The principle of 
correction. 

2. Convicts must be isolated or at least distributed according to 
the penal gravity of their act, but above all according to age, mental 
attitude, the technique of correction to be used, the stages of their 
transformation. ‘One must take into account, in using methods for 
altering the great physical and moral differences to be found in the 
characters of convicts, their degree of perversity, the unequal 
opportunities for correction that they may offer’ (February, 1850). 
1945: ‘The distribution in the penitentiary establishments of indivi¬ 
duals serving a light sentence of up to one year is based on sex, 
personality and the degree of perversion of the delinquent.’ The prin¬ 
ciple of classification. 

3. It must be possible to alter the penalties according to the 
individuality of the convicts, the results that have been obtained, 
progress or relapses. ‘Since the principal aim of the penalty is the 
reform of the convict, it is desirable that any convict whose moral 
regeneration is sufficiently assured should be set free’ (Lucas, 1838), 
1945: ‘A progressive regime is applied ... with a view to adapting 
the treatment of the prisoner to his attitude and to his degree of 
improvement. This regime stretches from solitary confinement to 
semi-liberty. . . The benefit of parole is extended to all penalties 
involving a term of imprisonment.’ The principle of the modulation 
ofpenalties. 

4. Work must be one of the essential elements in the transforma¬ 
tion and progressive socialization of convicts. Penal labour ‘must 
not be regarded as the complement and as it were an aggravation 
of the penalty, but as a mitigation, of which it is no longer possible

to deprive the prisoner’. It must enable him to learn or to practise a 
trade, and to provide the prisoner and his family with a source of 
income (Ducpetiaux, 1857). 1945: ‘Every common-law prisoner is 
obliged to work. . . No prisoner may be forced to remain unoccu¬ 
pied.’ The principle of work as obligation and right.
