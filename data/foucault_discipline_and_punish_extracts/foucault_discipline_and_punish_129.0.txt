- the element of ‘super-power’; the production of an objectivity, a 
technique, a penitentiary ‘rationality’ - the element of auxiliary 
knowledge; the de facto reintroduction, if not actual increase, of a 
criminality that the prison ought to destroy - the element of in¬ 
verted efficiency; lastly, the repetition of a ‘reform’ that is isomor¬ 
phic, despite its ‘idealism’, with the disciplinary functioning of the 
prison - the element of utopian duplication. It is this complex 
ensemble that constitutes the ‘carceral system’, not only the institu¬ 
tion of the prison, with its walls, its staff, its regulations and its 
violence. The carceral system combines in a single figure discourses 
and architectures, coercive regulations and scientific propositions, 
real social effects and invincible utopias, programmes for correcting 
delinquents and mechanisms that reinforce delinquency. Is not the 
supposed failure part of the functioning of the prison.^ Is it not to 
be included among those effects of power that discipline and the 
auxiliary technology of imprisonment have induced in the apparatus 
of justice, and in society in general, and which may be grouped 
together under the name of ‘carceral system’.^ If the prison-institu¬ 
tion has survived for so long, with such immobility, if the principle 
of penal detention has never seriously been questioned, it is no 
doubt because this carceral system was deeply rooted and carried 
out certain very precise functions. As evidence of this strength and 
immobility, let us take a recent fact: the model prison opened at 
Fleury-Merogis in 1969 simply took over in its overall plan the 
panoptic star-shape that made such a stir in 1836 at the Petite- 
Roquette. It was the same machinery of power that assumed a real 
body and a symbolic form. But what role was it supposed to play.^ 

If the law is supposed to define offences, if the function of the 
penal apparatus is to reduce them and if the prison is the instrument 
of this repression, then failure has to be admitted. Or rather - for in 
order to establish it in historical terms, one must be able to measure 
the effects of the penality of detention on the overall level of

Prison 


criminality - one should be surprised that for the past 150 years the 
proclamation of the failure of the prison has always been accom¬ 
panied by its maintenance. The only alternative actually envisaged 
was deportation, which England abandoned at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century and which France took up under the Second 
Empire, but rather as a rigorous and distant form of imprisonment. 

But perhaps one should reverse the problem and ask oneself what 
is served by the failure of the prison; what is the use of these different 
phenomena that are continually being criticized; the maintenance of 
delinquency, the encouragement of recidivism, the transformation of 
the occasional offender into a habitual delinquent, the organization 
of a closed milieu of delinquency. Perhaps one should look for what 
is hidden beneath the apparent cynicism of the penal institution, 
which, after purging the convicts by means of their sentence, con¬ 
tinues to follow them by a whole series of‘brandings’ (a surveillance 
that was once de jure and which is today de facto-, the police record 
that has taken the place of the convict’s passport) and which thus 
pursues as a ‘delinquent’ someone who has acquitted himself of his 
punishment as an offender.^ Can we not see here a consequence 
rather than a contradiction.^ If so, one would be forced to suppose 
that the prison, and no doubt punishment in general, is not intended 
to eliminate offences, but rather to distinguish them, to distribute 
them, to use them; that it is not so much that they render docile 
those who are liable to transgress the law, but that they tend to 
assimilate the transgression of the laws in a general tactics of subjec¬ 
tion. Penality would then appear to be a way of handling illegalities, 
of laying down the limits of tolerance, of giving free rein to some, 
of putting pressure on others, of excluding a particular section, of 
making another useful, of neutralizing certain individuals and of 
profiting from others. In short, penality does not simply ‘check’ 
illegalities; it ‘differentiates’ them, it provides them with a general 
‘economy’. And, if one can speak of justice, it is not only because 
the law itself or the way of applying it serves the interests of a class, it 
is also because the differential administration of illegalities through 
the mediation of penality forms part of those mechanisms of domina¬ 
tion. Legal punishments are to be resituated in an overall strategy 
of illegalities. The ‘failure’ of the prison may be understood on this 
basis.

Illegalities and delinquency 


The general schema of penal reform had taken shape at the end of 
the eighteenth cenmry in the struggle against illegalities: a whole 
equilibrium of tolerance, mutual support and interests which, under 
the Ancien Regime, had maintained the illegalities of different social 
strata side by side, was disturbed. There then emerged the utopia of 
a universally and publicly punitive society in which ceaselessly 
active penal mechanisms would function without delay, mediation 
or uncertainty; one law, doubly ideal because perfect in its calcula¬
