- the element of ‘super-power’; the production of an objectivity, a 
technique, a penitentiary ‘rationality’ - the element of auxiliary 
knowledge; the de facto reintroduction, if not actual increase, of a 
criminality that the prison ought to destroy - the element of in¬ 
verted efficiency; lastly, the repetition of a ‘reform’ that is isomor¬ 
phic, despite its ‘idealism’, with the disciplinary functioning of the 
prison - the element of utopian duplication. It is this complex 
ensemble that constitutes the ‘carceral system’, not only the institu¬ 
tion of the prison, with its walls, its staff, its regulations and its 
violence. The carceral system combines in a single figure discourses 
and architectures, coercive regulations and scientific propositions, 
real social effects and invincible utopias, programmes for correcting 
delinquents and mechanisms that reinforce delinquency. Is not the 
supposed failure part of the functioning of the prison.^ Is it not to 
be included among those effects of power that discipline and the 
auxiliary technology of imprisonment have induced in the apparatus 
of justice, and in society in general, and which may be grouped 
together under the name of ‘carceral system’.^ If the prison-institu¬ 
tion has survived for so long, with such immobility, if the principle 
of penal detention has never seriously been questioned, it is no 
doubt because this carceral system was deeply rooted and carried 
out certain very precise functions. As evidence of this strength and 
immobility, let us take a recent fact: the model prison opened at 
Fleury-Merogis in 1969 simply took over in its overall plan the 
panoptic star-shape that made such a stir in 1836 at the Petite- 
Roquette. It was the same machinery of power that assumed a real 
body and a symbolic form. But what role was it supposed to play.^ 

If the law is supposed to define offences, if the function of the 
penal apparatus is to reduce them and if the prison is the instrument 
of this repression, then failure has to be admitted. Or rather - for in 
order to establish it in historical terms, one must be able to measure 
the effects of the penality of detention on the overall level of

criminality - one should be surprised that for the past 150 years the 
proclamation of the failure of the prison has always been accom¬ 
panied by its maintenance. The only alternative actually envisaged 
was deportation, which England abandoned at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century and which France took up under the Second 
Empire, but rather as a rigorous and distant form of imprisonment.
