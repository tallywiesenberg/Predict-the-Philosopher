Beneath the increasing leniency of punishment, then, one may 
map a displacement of its point of application; and through this

displacement, a whole field of recent objects, a whole new system of 
truth and a mass of roles hitherto unknown in the exercise of criminal 
justice. A corpus of knowledge, techniques, ‘scientific’ discourses is 
formed and becomes entangled with the practice of the power to 
punish. 

This book is intended as a correlative history of the modern soul 
and of a new power to judge; a genealogy of the present scientifico- 
legal complex from which the power to punish derives its bases, 
justifications and rules, from which it extends its effects and by which 
it masks its exorbitant singularity. 

But from what point can such a history of the modem soul on 
trial be written.^ If one confined oneself to the evolution of legisla¬ 
tion or of penal procedures, one would run the risk of allowing a 
change in the collective sensibility, an increase in humanization or 
the development of the human sciences to emerge as a massive, 
external, inert and primary fact. By studying only the general social 
forms, as Durkheim did (cf. Bibliography), one runs the risk of 
positing as the principle of greater leniency in punishment pro¬ 
cesses of individualization that are rather one of the effects of the 
new tactics of power, among which are to be included the new penal 
mechanisms. This study obeys four general rules: 

1. Do not concentrate the study of the punitive mechanisms on 
their ‘repressive’ effects alone, on their ‘punishment’ aspects alone, 
but situate them in a whole series of their possible positive effects, 
even if these seem marginal at first sight. As a consequence, regard 
punishment as a complex social function. 

2. Analyse punitive methods not simply as consequences of 
legislation or as indicators of social structures, but as techniques 
possessing their own specificity in the more general field of other 
ways of exercising power. Regard punishment as a political tactic. 

3. Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of 
the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears 
to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing
