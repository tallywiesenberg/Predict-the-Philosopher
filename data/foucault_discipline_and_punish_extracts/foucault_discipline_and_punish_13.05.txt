‘One will not succeed by locking 
beggars up in filthy prisons that are more like cesspools’; they will 
have to be forced to work.‘The best way of punishing them is to 
employ them’ (Brissot, 258).Against a bad passion, a good habit; 
against a force, another force, but it must be the force of sensibility 
and passion, not that of armed power.‘Must one not deduce all 
penalties from this principle, which is so simple, so appropriate and 
already well known, namely, to choose them in that which is most 
subduing for the passion that led to the crime committed.^’ (Lacre- 
telle, 361).Set the force that drove the criminal to the crime against itself.
