Divide interest, use it to make the penalty something to be feared.106 



The gentle way in punishment 


Let the punishment irritate it and stimulate it more than the crime 
was able to flatter it.If pride led to the committing of a crime, let 
it be hurt, let the punishment disgust it.Shameful punishments are 
effective because they are based on the vanity that was at the root 
of the crime.Fanatics glory both in their opinions and in the torÂ¬ 
tures that they endure for them.
