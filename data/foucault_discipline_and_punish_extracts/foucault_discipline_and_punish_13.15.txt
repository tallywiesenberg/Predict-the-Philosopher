Let us, therefore, set against 
fanaticism the proud obstinacy that sustains it: ‘Reduce it with 
ridicule and shame; if one humiliates the proud vanity of fanatics 
before a great crowd of spectators, one may expect happy effects 
from this punishment.’ It would be quite useless, on the other hand, 
to impose physical pain on them.(Beccaria, 113).Reanimate the useful, virtuous interest that has been so weakened 
by the crime.The feeling of respect for property - for wealth, but 
also for honour, liberty, life - this the criminal loses when he robs, 
calumniates, abducts or kills.So he must be taught this feeling 
once again.
