What use would it be if it had to be permanent.^ A penalty that had 
no end would be contradictory; all the constraints that it imposes on 
the convict and of which, having become virtuous once more, he 
would never be able to take advantage, would be little better than 
torture; and the effort made to reform him would be so much 
trouble and expense lost by society.If incorrigibles there be, one 
must be determined to eliminate them.But, for all the others, 
punishment can function only if it comes to an end.This analysis 
was accepted by the Constituent Assembly: the code of 1791 lays 
down the death penalty for traitors and murderers; all other penalties 
must have an end (the maximum is twenty years).But above all the role of duration must be integrated into the 
economy of the penalty.
