But the delicate mechanism of the passions must not be con¬ 
strained in the same way or with the same insistence when they 
begin to improve; the punishment should diminish as it produces its 
effects.It may well be fixed, in the sense that it is determined for all, 
in the same way, by law, but its internal mechanism must be variable.In the bill put before the Constituent Assembly, Le Peletier pro¬ 
posed a system of diminishing penalties: a convict condemned to 
the most serious penalty would be subjected to the 'cachot' (manacles 
on hands and feet, darkness, solitude, bread and water) only during 
the first stage of his imprisonment; he would be allowed to work 
first two then three days a week.After two thirds of his sentence 
had been served, he could pass to the ‘gene' (a cell with light, chain 
around the waist, solitary work for five hours a day, but with other 
prisoners on the other two days; this work would be paid and would 
enable him to improve his daily fare).Lastly, when he approached 
the end of his sentence, he could pass to the normal prison regime: 
‘He will be allowed every day to meet other prisoners for work in 
common.
