For punishment is directed above all at others, at all 
the potentially guilty.So these obstacle-signs that are gradually 
engraved in the representation of the condemned man must there¬ 
fore circulate rapidly and widely; they must be accepted and redis¬ 
tributed by all; they must shape the discourse that each individual 
has with others and by which crime is forbidden to all by all - the 
true coin that is substituted in people’s minds for the false profits of 
crime.108 



The gentle way in punishment 


For this, everyone must see punishment not only as natural, but 
in his own interest; everyone must be able to read in it his own 
advantage.There must be no more spectacular, but useless penalties.There must be no secret penalties either; but punishment must be 
regarded as a retribution that the guilty man makes to each of his 
fellow citizens, for the crime that has wronged them all - penalties 
that are constantl}- placed before citizens’ eyes, and which ‘bring out 
the public utility of common and particular movements’ (Dufriche 
de Valaze, 346).
