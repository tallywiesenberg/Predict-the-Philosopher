or useful effect, according to one’s point of view, see whether there 
is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive 
from a single process of ‘epistemologico-juridical’ formation; in 
short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the 
humanization of the penal system and Of the knowledge of man.

4. Try to discover whether this entry of the soul on to the scene 
of penal justice, and with it the insertion in legal practice of a whole 
corpus of ‘scientific’ knowledge, is not the effect of a transformation 
of the way in which the body itself is invested by power relations. 

In short, try to study the metamorphosis of punitive methods on 
the basis of a political technology of the body in which might be 
read a common history of power relations and object relations. 
Thus, by an analysis of penal leniency as a technique of power, 
one might understand both how man, the soul, the normal or 
abnormal individual have come to duplicate crime as objects of 
penal intervention; and in what way a specific mode of subjection 
was able to give birth to man as an object of knowledge for a dis¬ 
course with a ‘scientific’ status. 

But I am not claiming to be the first to have worked in this 
direction.^ 

Rusche and Kirchheimer’s great work. Punishment and Social 
Structures, provides a number of essential reference points. We must 
first rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all (if not 
exclusively) a means of reducing crime and that, in this role, accord¬ 
ing to the social forms, the political systems or beliefs, it may be 
severe or lenient, tend towards expiation of obtaining redress, to¬ 
wards the pursuit of individuals or the attribution of collective 
responsibility. We must analyse rather the ‘concrete systems of 
punishment’, study them as social phenomena that cannot be 
accounted for by the juridical structure of society alone, nor by its 
fundamental ethical choices; we must situate them in their field of 
operation, in which the punishment of crime is not the sole element; 
we must show that punitive measures are not simply ‘negative’ 
mechanisms that make it possible to repress, to prevent, to exclude, 
to eliminate; but that they are linked to a whole series of positive 
and useful effects which it is their task to support (and, in this sense, 
although legal punishment is carried out in order to punish offences,
