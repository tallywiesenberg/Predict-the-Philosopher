The ideal would be for the convict to appear as a 
sort of rentable property: a slave at the service of all.Why would 
society eliminate a life and a body that it could appropriate.^ If 
would be more useful to make him ‘serve the state in a slavery 
that would be more or less extended according to the nature of his 
crime’; France has all too many impracticable roads that impede 
trade; thieves who also obstruct the free circulation of goods could 
be put to rebuilding the highways.Far more telling than death 
would be ‘the example of a man who is ever before one’s eyes, whom 
one has deprived of liberty and who is forced to spend the rest of 
his days repairing the loss that he has caused society’ (Boucher 
d’Argis, 1781, 139).In the old system, the body of the condemned man became the 
king’s property, on which the sovereign left his mark and brought 
down the effects of his power.Now he will be rather the property 
of society, the object of a collective and useful appropriation.
