This 
explains why the reformers almost always proposed public works 
as one of the best possible penalties; in this, they were supported by 
the Cahiers de doleancesi ‘Let those condemned to penalties short of 
death be put to the public works of the country for a time propor¬ 
tionate to their crime.’* Public works meant two things: the collec¬ 
tive interest in the punishment of the condemend man and the 
visible, verifiable character of the punishment.Thus the convict 
pays twice; by the labour he provides and by the signs that he 
produces.At the heart of society, on the public squares or highways, 
the convict is a focus of profit and signification.Visibly, he is 
serving everyone; but, at the same time, he lets slip into the minds 
of all the crime-punishment sign: a secondary, purely moral, but 
much more real utility.5.
