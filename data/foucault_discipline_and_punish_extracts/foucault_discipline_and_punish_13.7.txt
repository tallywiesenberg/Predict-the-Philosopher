.That is the 
moment to punish the crime: do not let it slip by; hasten to prove 
it and judge it.Set up scaffolds, stakes, drag out the guilty man to 
the public squares, summon the people with great cries; you will 
then hear them applaud the proclamation of your judgements, as the 
proclamation of peace and liberty; you will see them run to these 
terrible spectacles as to the triumph of the lawsâ€™ (Servan, 35-6).Public punishment is the ceremony of immediate recoding.The law is re-formed: it takes up its place on the side of the crime 
that violated it.
