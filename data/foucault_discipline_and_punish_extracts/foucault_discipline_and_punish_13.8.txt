Let the 
different scenes of this tragedy strike all the senses, stir all gentle, 
honest affections’ (Dufau, 688).The meaning of this mourning must be clear to all; each element 
of its ritual must speak, repeat the crime, recall the law, show the 
need for punishment and justify its degree.Posters, placards, signs, 
symbols must be distributed, so that everyone may learn their 
significations.The publicity of punishment must not have the 
physical effect of terror; it must open up a book to be read.Le 
Peletier suggested that, once a month, the people should be allowed 
to visit convicts, ‘in their mournful cells: they will read, written in 
bold letters above the door, the name of the convict, his crime and 
his sentence" (Le Peletier, 329-30).
