And in the simple, military style 
of the imperial ceremonies, Bexon was to imagine some years later a 
whole tableau of penal heraldry: ‘The prisoner condemned to death 
will be taken to the scaffold in a cart “hung or painted in black and 
red”; if he is a traitor, he will wear a red coat on which will be 
inscribed, in front and behind, the word “traitor”; if he is a parri¬ 
cide, his head will be covered with a black veil and on his shirt will 
be embroidered daggers or whatever instruments of death he used; 
if he is a poisoner, his red shirt will be decorated with snakes and 
other venomous animals’ (Bexon, 24-3 - this project was presented 
to the King of Bavaria).This legible lesson, this ritual recoding, must be repeated as often 
as possible; the punishments must be a school rather than a festival; 
an ever-open book rather than a ceremony.The duration that makes 
the punishment effective for the guilty is also useful for the specta¬ 
tors.They must be able to consult at each moment the permanent 
lexicon of crime and punishment.A secret punishment is a punish¬ 
ment half wasted.
