And Le Peletier considered that this 
visibility of punishment was one of the fundamental principles of the 
new penal code: ‘Often, at certain special times, the presence of 
the people must bring down shame upon the heads of the guilty; and 
the presence of the guilty person in the pitiful state to which his crime 
has reduced him must bring useful instruction to the souls of the 
people’ (Le Peletier, 322).Long before he was regarded as an object 
of science, the criminal was imagined as a source of instruction.Once one made charitable visits to prisoners to share in their suffer¬ 
ings (the seventeenth century had invented or revived this practice); 
now it was being suggested that children should come and learn how 
the benefits of the law are applied to crime - a living lesson in the 
museum of order.6.This will make possible in society an inversion of the tradi¬ 
tional discourse of crime.
