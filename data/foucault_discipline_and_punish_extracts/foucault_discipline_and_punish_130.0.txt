tions and engraven on the minds of each citizen would stop, at their 
very origin, all practices of illegality. Now, at the turn of the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and against the new codes, the 
danger of a new popular illegality arose. Or, to be more precise, 
perhaps the popular illegalities began to develop according to new 
dimensions: those that were introduced by the movements which, 
from the 1780s to the Revolutions of 1848, linked together social 
conflicts, the struggles against the political regimes, the resistance 
to the movement of industrialization, the effects of the economic 
crises. Broadly speaking, there were three characteristic processes. 
First, the development of the political dimension of the popular 
illegalities. This occurred in two ways: hitherto localized practices, 
limited in some sense to themselves (like the refusal to pay taxes and 
rents or to comply with conscription; the violent confiscation of 
hoarded goods; the looting of shops and the forced selling of pro¬ 
ducts at a ‘fair price’; confrontations with the representatives of 
power), were able during the Revolution to lead to directly political 
struggles, whose aim was not simply to extract concessions from the 
state or to rescind some intolerable measure, but to change the 
government and the very structure of power. On the other hand, 
certain political movements were explicitly based on existing forms 
of illegality (for example, the royalist agitation of the west and south 
of France used the peasants’ rejection of the new laws on property, 
religion and conscription); this political dimension of illegality was 
to become more complex and more marked in the relations between 
the workers’ movement and the republican parties in the nineteenth 
century, in the passage from the workers’ struggles (strikes, pro¬ 
hibited coalitions, illegal associations) to political revolution. In any 
case, on the horizon of these illegal practices - which multiplied with 
ever more restrictive legislation - there emerged struggles of a

strictly political kind; the possible overthrow of power was not 
present in all of them, far from it; but a good many were able to turn 
themselves to account in overall political struggles and sometimes 
even to lead directly to them. 

On the other hand, through the rejection of the law or other 
regulations, it is easy enough to recognize the struggles against those 
who set them up in their own interests: people were no longer 
fighting against the tax farmers, financiers, the king’s agents, pre¬ 
varicating magistrates or bad ministers - all the agents of injustice - 
but against the law itself and the justice whose task it was to apply 
it; against local landowners who introduced new rights; against 
employers who worked together, but forbade workers’ coalitions; 
against entrepreneurs who introduced more machines, lower wages 
and longer working hours, and made the factory regulations more 
and more strict. It was against the new regime of landed property - 
set up by a bourgeoisie that profited from the Revolution - that a 
whole peasant illegality developed. This no doubt assumed its most 
violent forms between Thermidor and the Consulate, but it did not 
disappear then; it was against the new system of the legal exploita¬ 
tion of labour that workers’ illegalities at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century developed: from the most violent such as machine¬ 
breaking, or the most lasting such as the formation of associations, 
to the most everyday, such as absenteeism, abandoning work, 
vagabondage, pilfering raw materials, deception as to the quantity 
and quality of the work completed. A whole series of illegalities 
was inscribed in struggles in which those struggling knew that 
they were confronting both the law and the class that had im¬ 
posed it. 

Lastly, although it is true that, during the eighteenth century, 
criminality tended towards more specialized forms, inclining more 
and more to the skilful theft, and became, to some extent, the prac¬ 
tice of men on the fringes of society, isolated from a population that 
was hostile to them - one sees, in the last years of the eighteenth 
century, the reconstitution of certain links or the establishment of 
new relations; not, as contemporaries said, that the leaders of popular 
agitation had been criminals, but because the new forms of law, 
the rigours of the labour regulations, the demands either of the 
state, or of the landowners, or of the employers, and the mos;

detailed techniques of surveillance, increased the occasions of 
offences, and threw to the other side of the law many individuals, who, 
in other conditions, would not have gone over to specialized 
criminality; it is against the background of the new laws of property, 
against the background, too, of unacceptable conscription that a 
peasant illegality developed in the last years of the Revolution, with 
a consequent increase in violence, acts of aggression, thefts, looting 
and even the greater forms of ‘political brigandage’; it was also 
against a background of legislation or very heavy regulations (con¬ 
cerning the livret, or service certificate, rents, hours, absences from 
work) that a workers’ vagabondage developed that often crossed 
the boundary into actual delinquency. A whole series of illegal
