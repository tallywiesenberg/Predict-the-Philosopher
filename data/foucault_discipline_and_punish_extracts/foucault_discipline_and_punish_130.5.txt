it; against local landowners who introduced new rights; against 
employers who worked together, but forbade workers’ coalitions; 
against entrepreneurs who introduced more machines, lower wages 
and longer working hours, and made the factory regulations more 
and more strict. It was against the new regime of landed property - 
set up by a bourgeoisie that profited from the Revolution - that a 
whole peasant illegality developed. This no doubt assumed its most 
violent forms between Thermidor and the Consulate, but it did not 
disappear then; it was against the new system of the legal exploita¬ 
tion of labour that workers’ illegalities at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century developed: from the most violent such as machine¬ 
breaking, or the most lasting such as the formation of associations, 
to the most everyday, such as absenteeism, abandoning work, 
vagabondage, pilfering raw materials, deception as to the quantity 
and quality of the work completed. A whole series of illegalities 
was inscribed in struggles in which those struggling knew that 
they were confronting both the law and the class that had im¬ 
posed it. 

Lastly, although it is true that, during the eighteenth century, 
criminality tended towards more specialized forms, inclining more 
and more to the skilful theft, and became, to some extent, the prac¬ 
tice of men on the fringes of society, isolated from a population that 
was hostile to them - one sees, in the last years of the eighteenth 
century, the reconstitution of certain links or the establishment of 
new relations; not, as contemporaries said, that the leaders of popular 
agitation had been criminals, but because the new forms of law, 
the rigours of the labour regulations, the demands either of the 
state, or of the landowners, or of the employers, and the mos;

Illegalities and delinquency 


detailed techniques of surveillance, increased the occasions of 
offences, and threw to the other side of the law many individuals, who, 
in other conditions, would not have gone over to specialized 
criminality; it is against the background of the new laws of property, 
against the background, too, of unacceptable conscription that a 
peasant illegality developed in the last years of the Revolution, with 
a consequent increase in violence, acts of aggression, thefts, looting 
and even the greater forms of ‘political brigandage’; it was also 
against a background of legislation or very heavy regulations (con¬ 
cerning the livret, or service certificate, rents, hours, absences from 
work) that a workers’ vagabondage developed that often crossed 
the boundary into actual delinquency. A whole series of illegal
