practices, which during the previous century had tended to remain 
isolated from one another, now seemed to come together to form a 
new threat. 

There was a threefold diffusion of popular illegalities at the turn 
of the century (quite apart from a quantitative extension that is 
problematic and still uncalculated): their insertion in a general 
political outlook; their explicit articulation on social struggles; a 
communication between different forms and levels of offences. 
These processes may not have reached their full development; 
certainly there did not develop at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century a massive movement of illegality that was both political and 
social. But, in their emerging form and despite their dispersal, they 
were sufficiently marked to serve as a support for the ‘great fear’ 
of a people who were believed to be criminal and seditious as a 
whole, for the myth of a barbaric, immoral and outlaw class which, 
from the empire to the July monarchy, haunted the discourse of 
legislators, philanthropists and investigators into working-class life. 
It is these processes that are to be found behind a whole series of 
affirmations that are quite alien to the penal theory of the eighteenth 
century: that crime is not a potentiality that interests or passions 
have inscribed in the hearts of all men, but that it is almost exclu¬ 
sively committed by a certain social class; that criminals, who were 
once to be met with in every social class, now emerged ‘almost all 
from the bottom rank of the social order’ (Comte, 49); that ‘nine 
tenths of murderers, thieves and idlers come from what we have 
called the social base’ (Lauvergne, 337); that it is not crime that

alienates an individual from society, but that crime is itself due rather 
to the fact that one is in society as an alien, that one belongs to that 
‘bastardized race’, as Target called it, to that ‘class degraded by 
misery whose vices stand like an invincible obstacle to the generous 
intentions that wish to combat it’ (Bure, 391); that, this being the 
case, it would be hypocritical or naive to believe that the law was 
made for all in the name of all; that it would be more prudent to 
recognize that it was made for the few and that it was brought to 
bear upon others; that in principle it applies to all citizens, but that 
it is addressed principally to the most numerous and least enlight¬ 
ened classes; that, unlike political and civil laws, their application 
does not concern everybody equally (Rossi, I, 32); that in the courts 
society as a whole does not judge one of its members, but that a
