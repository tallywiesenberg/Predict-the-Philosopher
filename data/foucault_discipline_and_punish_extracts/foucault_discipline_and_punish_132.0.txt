has given an instrumental role in relation to the other illegalities. 
In short, although the juridical opposition is between legality and 
illegal practice, the strategic opposition is between illegalities and 
delinquency. 

For the observation that prison fails to eliminate crime, one should 
perhaps substitute the hypothesis that prison has succeeded ex¬ 
tremely well in producing delinquency, a specific type, a politically 
or economically less dangerous — and, on occasion, usable - form 
of illegality; in producing delinquents, in an apparently marginal, 
but in fact centrally supervised milieu; in producing the delinquent 
as a pathologized subject. The success of the prison, in the struggles 
around the law and illegalities, has been to specify a ‘delinquency’. 
We have seen how the carceral system substituted the ‘delinquent’ 
for the offender, and also superimposed upon juridical practice a 
whole horizon of possible knowledge. Now this process that con¬ 
stitutes delinquency as an object of knowledge is one with the 
political operation that dissociates illegalities and isolates delin¬ 
quency from them. The prison is the hinge of these two mechanisms; 
it enables them to reinforce one another perpetually, to objectify the 
delinquency behind the offence, to solidify delinquency in the move¬ 
ment of illegalities. So successful has the prison been that, after a 
century and a h^lf of ‘failures’, the prison still exists, producing the 
same results, and there is the greatest reluctance to dispense 
with it.

Prison 


The penality of detention seems to fabricate - hence no doubt its 
longevity - an enclosed, separated and useful illegality. The circuit 
of delinquency would seem to be not the sub-product of a prison 
which, while punishing, does not succeed in correcting; it is rather 
the direct effect of a penality which, in order to control illegal 
practices, seems to invest certain of them in a mechanism of ‘punish¬ 
ment-reproduction’, of which imprisonment is one of the main 
parts. But why and how is the prison called upon to participate in 
the fabrication of a delinquency that it is supposed to combat.^ 

The establishment of a delinquency that constitutes something 
like an enclosed illegality has in fact a number of advantages. To 
begin with, it is possible to supervise it (by locating individuals, 
infiltrating the group, organizing mutual informing): for the vague, 
swarming mass of a population practising occasional illegality, which
