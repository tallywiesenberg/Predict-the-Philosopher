is always likely to spread, or again for those loose bands of vaga¬ 
bonds, recruiting as they move from place to place, and according 
to circumstances, from the unemployed, beggars, ‘bad characters’ 
of all kinds, which sometimes reach such proportions - as we saw at 
the end of the eighteenth century - as to form formidable forces for 
looting and rioting, is substituted a relatively small and enclosed 
group of individuals on whom a constant surveillance may be kept. 
Moreover, it is possible to divert this self-absorbed delinquency to 
forms of illegality that are less dangerous: maintained by the pres¬ 
sure of controls on the fringes of society, reduced to precarious 
conditions of existence, lacking links with the population that would 
be able to sustain it (as was once the case with smugglers or certain 
forms of bandits - cf. Hobsbawm), delinquents inevitably fell back 
on a localized criminality, limited in its power to attract popular 
support, politically harmless and economically negligible. Now this 
concentrated, supervised and disarmed illegality is directly useful. 
It may be useful in relation to other illegalities: isolated from them, 
turned inwards upon its own internal organization, dedicated to a 
violent criminality, of which the poorer classes are often the first 
victims, hemmed in on every side by the police, exposed to long 
prison sentences, followed by a permanently ‘specialized’ life - 
delinquency - this alien, dangerous and often hostile world obstructs 
or at least maintains at a sufficiently low level everyday illegal 
practices (petty thefts, minor acts of violence, routine acts of law-

Illegalities and delinquency 


breaking); it prevents them from leading to broader, more obvious 
forms, rather as though the exemplary effect once expected of the 
spectacle of the scaffold was now sought not so much in the rigour 
of the punishments, as in the visible, branded existence of delin¬ 
quency itself: while differentiating itself from other popular illegali¬ 
ties, delinquency serves to keep them in check. 

But delinquency has other direct uses. The example of coloniza¬ 
tion comes to mind. Yet it is not the most convincing example; 
indeed, although the deportation of criminals was demanded on 
several occasions under the Restoration, either by the Chamber of 
Deputies or by the General Councils, this was essentially in order 
to lighten the financial burdens imposed by the whole apparatus of 
detention; and, despite all the projects that were drawn up under the 
July monarchy for delinquents, undisciplined soldiers, prostitutes 
and orphans to take part in the colonization of Algeria, that colony
