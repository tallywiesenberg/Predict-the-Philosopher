was formally excluded, by the law of 1854, from becoming one of 
the overseas penal colonies; in fact, deportation to Guiana or later 
to New Caledonia had no real economic importance, despite the 
obligation imposed on the convicts to remain in the colony where 
they had served their sentence for a number of years equal to their 
time of detention (in certain cases, they even had to spend the rest 
of their lives there).^* In fact, the use of delinquency as a milieu 
that was both separate and manipulable took place above all on the 
fringes of legality, that is to say, a sort of subordinate illegality was 
also set up in the nineteenth century whose organization as delin¬ 
quency, with all the surveillance that this implies, provided a guaran¬ 
tee of docility. Delinquency, controlled illegality, is an agent for the 
illegality of the dominant groups. The setting up of prostitution 
networks in the nineteenth century is characteristic in this respect;*® 
police checks and checks on the prostitutes’ health, their regular 
stay in prison, the large-scale organization of the maisons closes, or 
brothels, the strict hierarchy that was maintained in the prostitution 
milieu, its control by delinquent-informers, all this made it possible 
to canalize and to recover by a whole series of intermediaries the 
enormous profits from a sexual pleasure that an ever-more insistent 
everyday moralization condemned to semi-clandestinity and naturally 
made expensive; in setting up a price for pleasure, in creating a 
profit from repressed sexuality and in collecting this profit, the

delinquent milieu was in complicity with a self-interested puritan- 
ism: an illicit fiscal agent operating over illegal practices.^® Arms 
trafficking, the illegal sale of alcohol in prohibition countries, or 
more recently drug trafficking show a similar functioning of this 
‘useful delinquency’: the existence of a legal prohibition creates 
around it a field of illegal practices, which one manages to supervise, 
while extracting from it an illicit profit through elements, themselves 
illegal, but rendered manipulable by their organization in delin¬ 
quency. This organization is an instrument for administering and 
exploiting illegalities. 

It is also an instrument for the illegality with which the very 
exercise of power surrounds itself. The political use of delinquents - 
as informers and agents provocateurs — was a fact well before the 
nineteenth century.But, after the Revolution, this practice 
acquired quite different dimensions: the infiltration of political 
parties and workers’ associations, the recruitment of thugs against
