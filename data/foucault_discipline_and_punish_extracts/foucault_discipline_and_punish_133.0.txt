was formally excluded, by the law of 1854, from becoming one of 
the overseas penal colonies; in fact, deportation to Guiana or later 
to New Caledonia had no real economic importance, despite the 
obligation imposed on the convicts to remain in the colony where 
they had served their sentence for a number of years equal to their 
time of detention (in certain cases, they even had to spend the rest 
of their lives there).^* In fact, the use of delinquency as a milieu 
that was both separate and manipulable took place above all on the 
fringes of legality, that is to say, a sort of subordinate illegality was 
also set up in the nineteenth century whose organization as delin¬ 
quency, with all the surveillance that this implies, provided a guaran¬ 
tee of docility. Delinquency, controlled illegality, is an agent for the 
illegality of the dominant groups. The setting up of prostitution 
networks in the nineteenth century is characteristic in this respect;*® 
police checks and checks on the prostitutes’ health, their regular 
stay in prison, the large-scale organization of the maisons closes, or 
brothels, the strict hierarchy that was maintained in the prostitution 
milieu, its control by delinquent-informers, all this made it possible 
to canalize and to recover by a whole series of intermediaries the 
enormous profits from a sexual pleasure that an ever-more insistent 
everyday moralization condemned to semi-clandestinity and naturally 
made expensive; in setting up a price for pleasure, in creating a 
profit from repressed sexuality and in collecting this profit, the

delinquent milieu was in complicity with a self-interested puritan- 
ism: an illicit fiscal agent operating over illegal practices.^® Arms 
trafficking, the illegal sale of alcohol in prohibition countries, or 
more recently drug trafficking show a similar functioning of this 
‘useful delinquency’: the existence of a legal prohibition creates 
around it a field of illegal practices, which one manages to supervise, 
while extracting from it an illicit profit through elements, themselves 
illegal, but rendered manipulable by their organization in delin¬ 
quency. This organization is an instrument for administering and 
exploiting illegalities. 

It is also an instrument for the illegality with which the very 
exercise of power surrounds itself. The political use of delinquents - 
as informers and agents provocateurs — was a fact well before the 
nineteenth century.But, after the Revolution, this practice 
acquired quite different dimensions: the infiltration of political 
parties and workers’ associations, the recruitment of thugs against 
strikers and rioters, the organization of a sub-police - working 
directly with the legal police and capable if necessary of becoming a 
sort of parallel army - a whole extra-legal functioning of power was 
partly assured by the ^ mass of reserve labour constituted by the 
delinquents: a clandestine police force and standby army at the 
disposal of the state. It seems that, in France, it was around the 
Revolution of 1848 and Louis Napoleon’s seizure of power that 
these practices reached their height (Marx, Eighteenth Brumaire ..., 
63-5). Delinquency, solidified by a penal system centred upon the 
prison, thus represents a diversion of illegality for the illicit circuits 
of profit and power of the dominant class. 

The organization of an isolated illegality, enclosed in delinquency, 
would not have been possible without the development of police 
supervision. General surveillance of the population, ‘silent, mysteri¬ 
ous, unperceived vigilance... it is the eye of the government cease¬ 
lessly open and watching without distinction over ail citizens, yet 
without subjecting them to any measure of coercion whatever... It 
does not need to be written into the law’ (Bonneville, 1847, 397-9). 
Surveillance of individuals, envisaged by the code of 1810, of ex¬ 
convicts and of all those who, having appeared before the courts on 
serious charges, were legally presumed to represent a new threat to 
the peace of society. But surveillance, too, of milieux and groups

Illegalities and delinquency 


regarded as dangerous by informers, almost all of whom were 
former delinquents, supervised as such by the police: delinquency, 
an object among others of police surveillance, is also one of its 
privileged instruments. All these surveillances presuppose the 
organization of a hierarchy, partly official, partly secret (in the Paris 
police, this was essentially the ‘security service’, which comprised, 
apart from its ‘open agents’ - inspectors and sergeants - its ‘secret 
agents’ and informers, who were motivated by fear of punishment 
or the prospect of reward: cf. Fregier, I, 142-8). They also presup¬ 
pose the setting up of a documentary system, the heart of which 
would be the location and identification of criminals: compulsory 
description of the criminal combined with arrest warrants issued by 
the assize courts, a description included in prison committal registers, 
copies of the registers of assize courts and courts of summary 
jurisdiction sent each month to the Ministries of Justice and of 
General Police, the organization a little later at the Ministry of the 
Interior of a criminal records office with an alphabetical index con¬
