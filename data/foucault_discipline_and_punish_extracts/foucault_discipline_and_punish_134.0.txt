taining summaries of these registers, the use in about 1833, according 
to the method of ‘naturalists, librarians, merchants, businessmen’ of 
a system of individual cards or reports, which facilitated the integra¬ 
tion of new data and, at the same time, together with the name of the 
individual under investigation, all the information that might con¬ 
cern him (Bonneville, 1844,92-3) - the appearance of the card-index 
and the constitution of the human sciences are another invention 
that historians have taken little note of). Delinquency, with the 
secret agents that it procures, but also with the generalized policing 
that it authorizes, constitutes a means of perpetual surveillance of 
the population: an apparatus that makes it possible to supervise, 
through the delinquents themselves, the whole social field. Delin¬ 
quency functions as a political observatory. In their turn, the statis¬ 
ticians and the sociologists have made use of it, long after the police. 

But this surveillance has been able to function only in conjunction 
with the prison. Because the prison facilitates the supervision of 
individuals when they are released, because it makes possible the 
recruiting of informers and multiplies mutual denunciations, because 
it brings offenders into contact with one another, it precipitates the 
organization of a delinquent milieu, closed in upon itself, but easily 
supervised: and all the results of non-rehabilitation (unemployment.

prohibitions on residence, enforced residences, probation) make it 
all too easy for former prisoners to carry out the tasks assigned 
to them. Prison and police form a twin mechanism; together they 
assure in the whole field of illegalities the differentiation, isolation 
and use of delinquency. In the illegalities, the police-prison system 
segments a manipulable delinquency. This delinquency, with its 
specificity, is a result of the system; but it also becomes a part and 
an instrument of it. So that one should speak of an ensemble whose 
three terms (police-prison-delinquency) support one another and 
form a circuit that is never interrupted. Police surveillance provides 
the prison with offenders, which the prison transforms into delin¬ 
quents, the targets and auxiliaries of police supervisions, which 
regularly send back a certain number of them to prison. 

There is no penal justice intended to prosecute ail illegal practices 
which, to do so, would use the police as an auxiliary and prison as a 
punitive instrument, and not leave in its wake the unassimilable 
residue of ‘delinquency’. One should regard this justice as an instru¬
