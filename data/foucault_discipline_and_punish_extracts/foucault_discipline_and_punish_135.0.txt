now appeared, that of some dark, secret understanding between 
those who enforced the law and those who violated it. The Shake¬ 
spearian age when sovereignty confronted abomination in a single 
character had gone; the everyday melodrama of police power and of 
the complicities that crime formed with power was soon to begin. 

Opposite Vidocq stood his contemporary, Lacenaire. His pres¬ 
ence, assured for ever in the paradise of the aesthetes of crime, is 
surprising enough: despite all his good will, his neophyte’s zeal, he 
was only able to commit, and even then with a singular lack of skill, 
no more than a few minor crimes; he was so strongly suspected of 
being a police spy that the administration had to protect him against 
his fellow prisoners, who tried to kill him (the charge was formally 
taken up by Canler, 15), and it was the fashionable society of Louis- 
Philippe’s Paris that gave him, before his execution, a feast beside 
which many a later literary resurrection has been little more than 
academic homage. His fame owed nothing either to the extent of his 
crimes or to the art of their conception; it was their ineptitude that 
gave cause for surprise. But it did owe a great deal to the visible 
play, in what he did and what he said, between illegality and delin¬ 
quency. Swindling, desertion, petty theft, imprisonment, the revival

of friendships made in prison, mutual blackmail, recidivism, up to 
the last, failed attempt at murder - Lacenaire is the typical ‘delin¬ 
quent’. But he brought with him, at least potentially, a horizon of 
illegalities that had, until quite recently, represented a threat: this 
ruined petty bourgeois, of good education, would, a generation 
earlier,have been a revolutionary, a Jacobin, a regicide;^® had he been 
a contemporary of Robespierre, his rejection of the law would have 
taken a directly political form. Born in 1800, at more or less the 
same time as Stendhal’s Julien Sorel, his character bears the trace 
of these possibilities; but they took the form of theft, murder and 
denunciation. All these potentialities became a delinquency of no 
great moment: in this sense, Lacenaire is a reassuring character. 
And if these potentialities reappear, it is in what he says about the 
theory of crime. At the moment of his death, Lacenaire manifested 
the triumph of delinquency over illegality, or rather the figure of an 
illegality, on the one hand, dragged down into delinquency, and, 
on the other, displaced towards an aesthetics of crime, that is to say, 
towards an art of the privileged classes. There is a symmetry be¬ 
tween Lacenaire and Vidocq, who in the same period, made it
