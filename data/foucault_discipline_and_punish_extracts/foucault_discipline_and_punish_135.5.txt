possible to turn delinquency in upon itself by constituting it as an 
enclosed, observable milieu and by displacing towards police tech¬ 
niques a whole delinquent practice that was becoming the licit 
illegality of power. That the Parisian bourgeoisie should have 
feasted Lacenaire, that his cell should have been open to famous 
visitors, that he should have been showered with praise during the 
last days of his life, he whose death his plebeian fellow prisoners had 
demanded before his judges had done so, he who had done every¬ 
thing, in court, to bring his accomplice Frangois to the scaffold, 
there was a reason for all this: what was being celebrated was the 
symbolic figure of an illegality kept within the bounds of delin¬ 
quency and transformed into discourse - that is to say, made doubly 
inoffensive; the bourgeoisie had invented for itself a new pleasure, 
which it has still far from outgrown. It should not be forgotten that 
Lacenaire’s celebrated death succeeded in muffling the echoes of 
Fieschi’s attempt on the life of Louis-Philippe; Fieschi, one of the 
most recent of the regicides, represented the converse figure of a 
petty criminality leading to political violence. Nor should we forget 
that it took place a few months before the departure of the last 




Illegalities and delinquency 


chain-gang and the scandalous demonstrations that accompanied it. 
These two festivals overlapped in history; and, indeed, Fran5ois, 
Lacenaire’s accomplice, was one of the best-known characters in the 
chain-gang of 19 July.®* The one extended the ancient rituals of the 
public execution at the risk of reactivating popular illegalities around 
the criminals. It was to be prohibited, for the criminal was no longer 
to occupy any other space than that appropriate to delinquency. 
The other inaugurated the theoretical play of an illegality of the 
privileged; or rather it marked the moment when the political and 
economic illegalities actually practised by the bourgeoisie were to 
be duplicated in theoretical and aesthetic representation: the ‘Meta¬ 
physics of crime’, a term often associated with Lacenaire. The French 
translation of De Quincey’s Murder Considered as One of the Fine 
Arts was published in 1849. 

This production of delinquency and its investment by the penal 
apparatus must be taken for what they are: not results acquired once 
and for all, but tactics that shift according to how closely they reach 
their target. The split between delinquency and other illegalities, the 
way in which it is turned back upon them, its colonization by the 
dominant illegality - these all appear clearly in the way in which the 
police-prison system functions; yet they have always met with 
resistance; they have given rise to struggles and provoked reaction.
