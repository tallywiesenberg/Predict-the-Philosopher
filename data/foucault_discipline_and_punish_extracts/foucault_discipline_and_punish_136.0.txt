of the population from which they sprang and with which they 
remained linked has been a difficult task, especially no doubt in 
urban milieux.®^ It has been a long and arduous undertaking. It has 
involved the use of the general principles of the ‘moralization’ of the 
poorer classes that elsewhere has had such crucial importance both 
from an economic and a political point of view (the acquisition of 
what might be called a ‘basic legalism’, which was indispensable 
from the time when custom was replaced by the system of the code; 
learning the elementary rules of property and thrift; training in 
docility at work, in stability of residence and of the family, etc.). 
More specific methods were used to maintain the hostility of the 
poorer classes to delinquents (the use of ex-convicts as informers, 
police spies, strike-breakers or thugs). There has been a systematic 
confusion between offences against common law and those offences

against the severe legislation concerning the livret (work record), 
strikes, coalitions, associations,*® for which the workers demanded 
political status. Workers’ action was regularly accused of being 
animated, if not manipulated, by mere criminals (cf., for example. 
Monfalcon, 142). Verdicts were often more severe against workers 
than against thieves (cf. L'Atelier, October 1840, or La Fraternite, 
July-August 1847). The two categories of convict were mixed in 
the prisons and preferential treatment given to common-law 
offenders, while convicted journalists and politicians usually enjoyed 
the right to separate treatment. In short, a whole tactic of confusion 
aimed at maintaining a permanent state of conflict. 

To this was added a patient attempt to impose a highly specific 
grid on the common perception of delinquents: to present them as 
close by, everywhere present and everywhere to be feared. This was 
the function of the_/a/t divers, which invaded a part of the press and 
which began to have its own newspapers.** The criminal divers, 
by its everyday redundancy, makes acceptable the system of judicial 
and police supervisions that partition society; it recounts from day 
to day a sort of internal battle against the faceless enemy; in this war, 
it constitutes the daily bulletin of alarm or victory. The crime novel, 
which began to develop in the broadsheet and in mass-circulation 
literature, assumed an apparently opposite role. Above all, its func¬ 
tion was to show that the delinquent belonged to an entirely different 
world, unrelated to familiar, everyday life. This strangeness was first 
that of the lower depths of society {Les Myst'eres de Paris, Rocam¬ 
bole), then that of madness (especially in the latter half of the cen¬
