it.^ ‘Poison, fire-raising and sometimes even revolt are evidence of 
the terrible miseries of the social condition’ {La Phalange, 10 
January 1837). And what of the prisoners, ‘the most unfortunate 
and most oppressed part of mankind’.^ La Phalange sometimes 
shared the contemporary aesthetic of crime, but in a very different 
cause. 

Hence a use of fait divers that was intended not only to turn the 
reproach of immorality back upon the adversary, but to reveal the

play of opposing forces. La Phalange analyses penal affairs as a 
confrontation coded by ‘civilization’, the great crimes not as 
monstrosities, but as the fatal return and revolt of what is repressed,*® 
the minor illegalities not as the necessary margins of society, but as 
a rumbling from the midst of the battle-field. 

After Vidocq and Lacenaire, a third character must be introduced. 
He made only a short appearance; his notoriety lasted hardly more 
than a day. He was merely the passing figure of minor illegalities: a 
child of thirteen, without home or family, charged with vagabond¬ 
age and whom a two-year sentence had no doubt long placed in the 
circuits of delinquency. He would certainly have passed without 
trace, had he not opposed to the discourse of the law that made him 
delinquent (in the name of the disciplines, even more than in the 
terms of the code) the discourse of an illegality that remained resist¬ 
ant to these coercions and which revealed indiscipline in a systematic¬ 
ally ambiguous manner as the disordered order of society and as the 
affirmation of inalienable rights. All the illegalities that the court 
defined as offences the accused reformulated as the affirmation of a 
living force: the lack of a home as vagabondage, the lack of a master 
as independence, the lack of work as freedom, the lack of a time-table 
as the fullness of days and nights. This confrontation of illegality 
with the discipline-penality-delinquency system was perceived by 
contemporaries or rather by the journalist who happened to be there 
as the comic effect of the criminal law at grips with the petty details 
of indiscipline. And it was true: the affair itself and the verdict that 
followed represented the heart of the problem of legal punishment 
in the nineteenth century. The irony with which the judge tried to 
envelop indiscipline in the majesty of the law and the insolence 
with which the accused reinscribed indiscipline among the funda¬ 
mental rights represent for penality an exemplary scene.
