3- The carceral 


Were I to fix the date of completion of the carceral system, I would 
choose not i8io and the penal code, nor even 1844, when the law 
laying down the principle of cellular internment was passed; I might 
not even choose 1838, when books on prison reform by Charles 
Lucas, Moreau-Christophe and Faucher were published. The date I 
would choose would be 22 January 1840, the date of the official 
opening of Mettray. Or better still, perhaps, that glorious day, 
unremarked and unrecorded, when a child in Mettray remarked as 
he lay dying: ‘What a pity I left the colony so soon’ (Ducpetiaux, 
1852, 383). This marked the death of the first penitentiary saint. 
Many of the blessed no doubt went to join him, if the former 
inmates of the penal colonies are to be believed when, in singing 
the praises of the new punitive policies of the body, they remarked: 
‘We preferred the blows, but the cell suits us better.’ 

Why Mettray.^ Because it is the disciplinary form at its most 
extreme, the model in which are concentrated all the coercive 
technologies of behaviour. In it were to be found ‘cloister, prison, 
school, regiment’. The small, highly hierarchized groups, into which 
the inmates were divided, followed simultaneously five models: that 
of the family (each group was a ‘family’ composed of ‘brothers’ and 
two ‘elder brothers’); that of the army (each family, commanded by 
a head, was divided into two sections, each of which had a second 
in command; each inmate had a number and was taught basic 
military exercises; there was a cleanliness inspection every day, an 
inspection of clothing every week; a roll-call was taken three times 
a day); that of the workshop, with supervisors and foremen, who 
were responsible for the regularity of the work and for the appren¬ 
ticeship of the younger inmates; that of the school (an hour or an 
hour and a half of lessons every day; the teaching was given by the
