How can one extinguish the dubious glory 
of the criminal.^ This was a matter of grave concern to the law¬ 
makers of the eighteenth century.How can one silence the adven¬ 
tures of the great criminals celebrated in the almanacs, broadsheets 
and popular tales.^ If the recoding of punishment is well done, if the 
ceremony of mourning takes place as it should, the crime can no 
longer appear as anything but a misfortune and the criminal as an 
enemy who must be re-educated into social life.Instead of those 
songs of praise that turn the criminal into a hero, only those 
obstacle-signs that arrest the desire to commit the crime by the 
calculated fear of punishment will circulate in men’s discourse.The 
positive mechanics will operate to the full in the language of every 
day, which will constantly reinforce it with new accounts.Discourse 
will become the vehicle of the law: the constant principle of uni¬ 
versal recoding.
