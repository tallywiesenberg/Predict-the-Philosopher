Each crime will have its law; each criminal his punishment.It will 
be a visible punishment, a punishment that tells all, that explains, 
justifies itself, convicts: placards, different-coloured caps bearing 
inscriptions, posters, symbols, texts read or printed, tirelessly repeat 
the code.Scenery, perspectives, optical effects, trompe-Votil someÂ¬ 
times magnify the scene, making it more fearful than it is, but also 
clearer.From where the public is sitting, it is possible to believe in 
the existence of certain cruelties which, in fact, do not take place.But the essential point, in all these real or magnified severities, is 
that they should all, according to a strict economy, teach a lesson: 
that each punishment should be a fable.
