multifarious and persuasive scenes.And popular memory will 
reproduce in rumour the austere discourse of the law.But perhaps 
it will be necessary, above these innumerable spectacles and narra¬ 
tives, to place the major sign of punishment for the most terrible 
of crimes: the keystone of the penal edifice.
