Above the 
punitive city hangs this iron spider; and the criminal who is to be 
thus crucified by the new law is the parricide.There is a whole new arsenal of picturesque punishments.‘Avoid 
inflicting the same punishments,’ said Mably.The idea of a uniform 
penalty, modulated only according to the gravity of the crime is 
banished.To be more precise: the use of imprisonment as a general 
form of punishment is never presented in these projects for specific, 
visible and ‘telling’ penalties.
