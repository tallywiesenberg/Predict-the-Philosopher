Imprisonment is envisaged, but as one 
among other penalties; it is the specific punishment for certain 
oflFences, those that infringe the liberty of individuals (such as 
abduction) or those that result from an abuse of liberty (disorder, 
violence).It is also envisaged as a condition to enable certain 
punishments to be carried out (forced labour, for example).But it 
does not cover the whole field of penality with its duration as the 
sole principle of variation.Or rather, the idea of penal imprisonÂ¬ 
ment is explicitly criticized by many reformers.Because it is 
incapable of corresponding to the specificity of crimes.
