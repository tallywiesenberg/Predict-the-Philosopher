...Whereas if, without multiplying crimes, one could multiply the 
example of punishments, one would succeed at last in rendering 
them less necessary; indeed, the obscurity of the prisons becomes 
a subject of defiance for the citizens; they easily suppose that great 
injustices are committed there...There is certainly something 
wrong when the law, which is made for the good of the multitude, 
instead of arousing its gratitude, continually arouses its discontentâ€™ 
(Dufriche de Valaze, 344-5).
