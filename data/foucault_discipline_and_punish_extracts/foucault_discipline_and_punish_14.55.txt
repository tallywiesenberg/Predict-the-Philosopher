Forced labour is a form of incarceration.The 
convict-ship is an open-air prison.Detention, reclusion, imprison¬ 
ment for a minor offence are in a sense merely different names for 
one and the same punishment’ (Remusat, 185).And the Empire 
decided at once to translate this imprisonment, envisaged by the 
law, into reality, according to a whole penal, administrative, geo¬ 
graphical hierarchy; at the lowest degree, associated with each 
justice of the peace, municipal maisons de police-, in each arrondisse- 
ment, maisons d’arriv, in each departement, a maison de correction-, 
at the summit, several maisons centrales for convicted criminals or 
correctionels serving sentences of over one year; lastly, in a few ports, 
convict-ships.A great prison structure was planned, whose different 
levels would correspond exactly to the levels of the centralized 
administration.
