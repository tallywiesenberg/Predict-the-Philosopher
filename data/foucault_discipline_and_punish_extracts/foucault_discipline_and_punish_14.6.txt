The scaffold, where the body of the tortured 
criminal had been exposed to the ritually manifested force of the 
sovereign, the punitive theatre in which the representation of 
punishment was permanently available to the social body, was 
replaced by a great enclosed, complex and hierarchized structure

Punishment 


that was integrated into the very body of the state apparatus.A 
quite different materiality, a quite different physics of power, a quite 
different way of investing men’s bodies had emerged.During the 
Restoration and the July monarchy, there were, apart from a few 
exceptional moments, between 40,000 and 43,000 prisoners in 
French gaols (approximately one prisoner per 600 inhabitants).The high wall, no longer the wall that surrounds and protects, no 
longer the wall that stands for power and wealth, but the meticu¬ 
lously sealed wall, uncrossable in either direction, closed in upon the 
now mysterious work of punishment, will become, near at hand, 
sometimes even at the very centre of the cities of the nineteenth 
century, the monotonous figure, at onc^ material and symbolic, of 
the power to punish.Already under the Consulate, the Minister of 
the Interior had been appointed to investigate the different ‘places 
of safety’ that were already functioning and which could be used in 
different towns.
