A few years later, sums had been allocated for the 
construction, in keeping with the power that they were to represent

formulated in the Constituent Assembly, of specific, appropriate, 
effective penalties, constituting, in each case, a lesson for all, became 
the law of detention for every offence of any importance, except 
those requiring the death penalty.The theatre of punishment of

essentially on the minds of the general public was replaced by the 
great uniform machinery of the prisons, whose network of immense 
buildings was to extend across France and Europe.
