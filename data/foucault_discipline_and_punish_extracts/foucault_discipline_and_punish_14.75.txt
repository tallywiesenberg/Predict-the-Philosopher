The diversity, so solemnly 
promised, is reduced in the end to this grey, uniform penalty.Indeed, at the time, there were deputies who expressed surprise that, 
instead of establishing a natural relation between offences and 
penalties, a quite different plan had been adopted: ‘So that if I have 
betrayed my country, I go to prison; if I have killed my father, I go 
to prison; every imaginable offence is punished in the same uniform 
way.One might as well see a physician who has the same remedy 
for all ills’ (Chabroud, 6i8).This prompt substitution was not confined to France.It was to be 
found, to a greater or lesser degree, in other countries.
