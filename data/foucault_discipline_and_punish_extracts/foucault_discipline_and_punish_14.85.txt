The ordinance of 
1670 does not include detention among the peines afflictives, or 
serious penalties.Perpetual or temporary imprisonment was no 
doubt included among certain local customs and practices (cf., for 
example, Coquille).But contemporary writers maintained that it was 
falling into disuse together with other forms of torture: ‘There were 
formerly penalties that are no longer practised in France, such as 
writing a condemned man’s penalty on his face or forehead and 
perpetual imprisonment, just as one no longer condemns a criminal 
to be exposed to wild beasts or sent down the mines’ (Rousseaud de 
la Combe, 3).In fact, it is certain that imprisonment had survived 
tenaciously as a punishment for less serious offences, according to 
local customs and practices.In this sense, Soulatges spoke of the 
‘light penalties’ that the ordinance of 1670 had not mentioned: 
reprimand, admonition, banishment from a certain place, satisfaction 
to the injured party and a term of imprisonment.
