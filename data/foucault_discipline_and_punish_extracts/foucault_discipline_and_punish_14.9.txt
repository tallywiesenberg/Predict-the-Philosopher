In certain regions, 
especially those that had most preserved their legal p>eculiarities, the 
penalty of imprisonment was still widespread, but this had its 
difficulties, as in the recently annexed province of Roussillon.Yet, despite these divergencies, jurists held firmly to the principle 
that ‘imprisonment is not to be regarded as a penalty in our civil 
law’ (Serpillon, 1095 - however, one does find in Serpillon the idea 
that the rigour of imprisonment is the beginning of a penalty).Its 
role is rather that of holding the person and his body as security: 
aJ continendos homines, non ad puniendos, as the tag has it; in this 
sense, the imprisonment of a suspect has a role similar to that of a 
debtor.Through imprisonment, one has security for someone, one 
does not punish him.* This was the general principle.
