normalization. And yet, in the formation and growth of psychology, 
the appearance of these professionals of discipline, normality and 
subjection surely marks the beginning of a new stage. It will be said 
that the quantitative assessment of sensorial responses could at least 
derive authority from the prestige of the emerging science of 
physiology and that for this alone it deserves to feature in the 
history of the sciences. But the supervision of normality was firmly 
encased in a medicine or a psychiatry that provided it with a sort 
of ‘scientificity’; it was supported by a judicial apparatus which, 
directly or indirectly, gave it legal justification. Thus, in the shelter 
of these two considerable protectors, and, indeed, acting as a link 
between them, or a place of exchange, a carefully worked out 
technique for the supervision of norms has continued to develop 
right up to the present day. The specific, institutional supports of 
these methods have proliferated since the founding of the small 
school at Mettray; their apparatuses have increased in quantity and 
scope; their auxiliary services have increased, with hospitals, schools, 
public administrations and private enterprises; their agents have 
proliferated in number, in power, in technical qualification; the 
technicians of indiscipline have founded a family. In the normaliza¬ 
tion of the power of normalization, in the arrangement of a power- 
knowledge over individuals, Mettray and its school marked a new 
era. 

But why choose this moment as the point of emergence of the 
formation of an art of punishing that is still more or less our own.^ 
Precisely because this choice is somewhat ‘unjust’. Because it 
situates the ‘end’ of the process in the lower reaches of criminal law. 
Because Mettray was a prison, but not entirely; a prison in that it 
contained young delinquents condemned by the courts; and yet 
something else, too, because it also contained minors who had been 
charged, but acquitted under article 66 of the code, and boarders 
held, as in the eighteenth century, as an alternative to paternal 
correction. Mettray, a punitive model, is at the limit of strict

penality. It was the most famous of a whole series of institutions 
which, well beyond the frontiers of criminal law, constituted what 
one might call the carceral archipelago. 

Yet the general principles, the great codes and subsequent legisla¬ 
tion were quite clear on the matter: no imprisonment ‘outside the 
law’, no detention that had not been decided by a qualified judicial
