and ‘vicious and insubordinate wards of the Public Assistance’ (on 
all these institutions, cf. Gaillac, 99-107). And, moving still farther 
away from penality in the strict sense, the carceral circles widen and 
the form of the prison slowly diminishes and finally disappears 
altogether: the institutions for abandoned or indigent children, the 
orphanages (like Neuhof or Mesnil-Firmin), the establishments for 
apprentices (like the Bethleem de Reims or the Maison de Nancy); 
still farther away the factory-convents, such as La Sauvagere, 
Tarare and Jujurieu (where the girl workers entered about the age of 
thirteen, lived confined for years and were allowed out only under 
surveillance, received instead of wages pledged payment, which 
could be increased by bonuses for zeal and good behaviour, which 
they could use only on leaving). And then, still farther, there was a 
whole series of mechanisms that did not adopt the ‘compact’ prison 
model, but used some of the carceral methods: charitable societies, 
moral improvement associations, organizations that handed out 
assistance and also practised surveillance, workers’ estates and 
lodging houses - the most primitive of which still bear the all too 
visible marks of the penitentiary system.* And, lastly, this great 
carceral network reaches all the disciplinary mechanisms that func¬ 
tion throughout society. 

We have seen that, in penal justice, the prison transformed the 
punitive procedure into a penitentiary technique; the carceral archi¬ 
pelago transported this technique from the penal institution to the 
entire social body. With several important results. 

I. This vast mechanism established a slow, continuous, imper¬ 
ceptible gradation that made it possible to pass naturally from dis¬ 
order to offence and back from a transgression of the law to a slight 
departure from a rule, an average, a demand, a norm. In the classical 
period, despite a certain common reference to offence in general,® 
the order of the crime, the order of sin and the order of bad conduct

mechanisms of surveillance and punishment functioned, on the 
contrary, according to a principle of relative continuity. The con^
