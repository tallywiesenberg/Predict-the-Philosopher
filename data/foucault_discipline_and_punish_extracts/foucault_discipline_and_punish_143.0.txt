against the powerful, the refusal of obligations and laws, and organ¬ 
ized crime all came together as chance and fortune would dictate; 
it was the domain of adventure that Gil Bias, Sheppard or Mandrin, 
each in his own way, inhabited. Through the play of disciplinary 
differentiations and divisions, the nineteenth century constructed 
rigorous channels which, within the system, inculcated docility and 
produced delinquency by the same mechanisms. There was a sort of 
disciplinary ‘training’, continuous and compelling, that had some¬ 
thing of the pedagogical curriculum and something of the profes¬ 
sional network. Careers emerged from it, as secure, as predictable, 
as those of public life: assistance associations, residential apprentice¬ 
ships, penal colonies, disciplinary battalions, prisons, hospitals, 
almshouses. These networks were already well mapped out at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century: ‘Our benevolent establish¬ 
ments present an admirably coordinated whole by means of which 
the indigent does not remain a moment without help from the cradle 
to the grave. Follow the course of the unfortunate man: you will 
see him born among foundlings; from there he passes to the nursery, 
then to an orphanage; at the age of six he goes off to primary school 
and later to adult schools. If he cannot work, he is placed on the list 
of the charity offices of his district, and if he falls ill he may choose 
between twelve hospitals. . . Lastly, when the poor Parisian 
reaches the end of his career, seven almshouses await his age and 
often their salubrious regime has prolonged his useless days well 
beyond those of the rich man’ (Moreau de Jonnes, quoted in 
Touquet).

The carceral 


The carceral network does not cast the unassimilable into a con¬ 
fused hell; there is no outside. It takes back with one hand what it 
seems to exclude with the other. It saves everything, including what 
it punishes. It is unwilling to waste even what it has decided to 
disqualify. In this panoptic society of which incarceration is the 
omnipresent armature, the delinquent is not outside the law; he is, 
from the very outset, in the law, at the very heart of the law, or at 
least in the midst of those mechanisms that transfer the individual 
imperceptibly from discipline to the law, from deviation to offence. 
Although it is true that prison punishes delinquency, delinquency 
is for the most part produced in and by an incarceration which, 
ultimately, prison perpetuates in its turn. The prison is merely the 
natural consequence, no more than a higher degree, of that hier¬ 
archy laid down step by step. The delinquent is an institutional
