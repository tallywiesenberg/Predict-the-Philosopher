operate the mechanisms of justice itself, even with a view to mitigat¬ 
ing their intensity.^ When, by generalizing its effects and trans¬ 
mitting it to every level, it makes it possible to avoid its full rigour.^ 
Carceral continuity and the fusion of the prison-form make it 
possible to legalize, or in any case to legitimate disciplinary power, 
which thus avoids any element of excess or abuse it may entail. 

But, conversely, the carceral pyramid gives to the power to 
inflict legal punishment a context in which it appears to be free of all 
excess and all violence. In the subtle gradation of the apparatuses of 
discipline and of the successive ‘embeddings’ that they involve, the 
prison does not at all represent the unleashing of a different kind of 
power, but simply an additional degree in the intensity of a mechan¬ 
ism that has continued to operate since the earliest forms of legal 
punishment. Between the latest institution of ‘rehabilitation’, where 
one is taken in order to avoid prison, and the prison where one is 
sent after a definable offence, the difference is (and must be) scarcely 
perceptible. There is a strict economy that has the effect of render¬ 
ing as discreet as possible the singular power to punish. There is 
nothing in it now that recalls the former excess of sovereign power 
when it revenged its authority on the tortured body of those about 
to be executed. Prison continues, on those who are entrusted to it, 
a work begun elsewhere, which the whole of society pursues on

each individual through innumerable mechanisms of discipline. By 
means of a carceral continuum, the authority that sentences infil¬ 
trates all those other authorities that supervise, transform, correct, 
improve. It might even be said that nothing really distinguishes 
them any more except the singularly ‘dangerous’ character of the 
delinquents, the gravity of their departures from normal behaviour 
and the necessary solemnity of the ritual. But, in its function, the 
power to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or 
educating. It receives from them, and from their lesser, smaller task, 
a sanction from below; but one that is no less important for that, 
since it is the sanction of technique and rationality. The carceral 
‘naturalizes’ the legal power to punish, as it ‘legalizes’ the technical 
power to discipline. In thus homogenizing them, effacing what may 
be violent in one and arbitrary in the other, attenuating the effects of 
revolt that they may both arouse, thus depriving excess in either of 
any purpose, circulating the same calculated, mechanical and dis¬ 
creet methods from one to the other, the carceral makes it possible 
to carry out that great ‘economy’ of power whose formula the
