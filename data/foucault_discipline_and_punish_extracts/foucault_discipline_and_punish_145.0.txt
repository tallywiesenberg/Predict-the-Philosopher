become one of the major functions of our society. The judges of 
normality are present everywhere. We are in the society of the 
teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the ‘social 
worker’-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative 
is based; and each individual, wherever he may find himself, subjects 
to it his body, his gestures, his behaviour, his aptitudes, his achieve¬ 
ments. The carceral network, in its compact or disseminated forms, 
with its systems of insertion, distribution, surveillance, observation, 
has been the greatest support, in modern society, of the normalizing 
power. 

5. The carceral texture of society assures both the real capture 
of the body and its perpetual observation; it is, by its very nature, 
the apparatus of punishment that conforms most completely to the 
new economy of power and the instrument for the formation of 
knowledge that this very economy needs. Its panoptic functioning

enables it to play this double role. By virtue of its methods of fixing, 
dividing, recording, it has been one of the simplest, crudest, also 
most concrete, but perhaps most indispensable conditions for the 
development of this immense activity of examination that has objec¬ 
tified human behaviour. If, after the age of ‘inquisitorial’ justice, we 
have entered the age of ‘examinatory’ justice, if, in an even more 
general way, the method of examination has been able to spread so 
widely throughout society, and to give rise in part to the sciences 
of man, one of the great instruments for this has been the multiplicity 
and close overlapping of the various mechanisms of incarceration. 
I am not saying that the human sciences emerged from the prison. 
But, if they have been able to be formed and to produce so many 
profound changes in the episteme, it is because they have been 
conveyed by a specific and new modality of power: a certain policy 
of the body, a certain way of rendering the group of men docile and 
useful. This policy required the involvement of definite relations of 
knowledge in relations of power; it called for a technique of over¬ 
lapping subjection and objectification; it brought with it new pro¬ 
cedures of individualization. The carceral network constituted one 
of the armatures of this power-knowledge that has made the human 
sciences historically possible. Knowable man (soul, individuality, 
consciousness, conduct, whatever it is called) is the object-effect 
of this analytical investment, of this domination-observation. 

6. This no doubt explains the extreme solidity of the prison, that
