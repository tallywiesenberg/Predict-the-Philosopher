power and the disciplinary power. In the midst of all these mechan¬ 
isms of normalization, which are becoming ever more rigorous in 
their application, the specificity of the prison and its role as link are 
losing something of their purpose. 

If there is an overall political issue around the prison, it is not 
therefore whether it is to be corrective or not; whether the judges, 
the psychiatrists or the sociologists are to exercise more power in it 
than the administrators or supervisors; it is not even whether we 
should have prison or something other than prison. At present, the 
problem lies rather in the steep rise in the use of these mechanisms 
of normalization and the wide-ranging powers which, through the 
proliferation of new disciplines, they bring with them.

The carceral 


In 1836, a correspondent wrote to La Phalange: ‘Moralists, 
philosophers, legislators, flatterers of civilization, this is the plan of 
your Paris, neatly ordered and arranged, here is the improved plan 
in which all like things are gathered together. At the centre, and 
within a first enclosure; hospitals for all diseases, almshouse» for 
all types of poverty, madhouses, prisons, convict-prisons for men,

for the executioner and his assistants. At the four corners, the 
Chamber of Deputies, the Chamber of Peers, the Institute and the 
Royal Palace. Outside, there are the various services that supply 
the central enclosure, commerce, with its swindlers and its bank¬

sophisms; the gambling dens; prostitution, the people dying of 
hunger or wallowing in debauchery, always ready to lend an ear 
to the voice of the Genius of Revolutions; the heartless rich. . . 
Lastly the ruthless war of all against all’ {La Phalange, 10 August 
1836). 

I shall stop with this anonymous text. We are now far away from 
the country of tortures, dotted with wheels, gibbets, gallows, 
pillories; we are far, too, from that dream of the reformers, less 
than fifty years before: the city of punishments in which a thousand 
small theatres would have provided an endless multicoloured repre¬ 
sentation of justice in which the punishments, meticulously pro¬ 
duced on decorative scaffolds, would have constituted the permanent 
festival of the penal code. The carceral city, with its imaginary
