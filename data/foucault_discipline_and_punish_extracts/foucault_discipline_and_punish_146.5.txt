‘geo-politics’, is governed by quite different principles. The extract 
from La Phalange reminds us of some of the more important ones: 
that at the centre of this city, and as if to hold it in place, there is, 
not the ‘centre of power’, not a network of forces, but a multiple 
network of diverse elements - walls, space, institution, rules, dis¬ 
course; that the model of the carceral city is not, therefore, the body 
of the king, with the powers that emanate from it, nor the contrac¬ 
tual meeting of wills from which a body that was both individual 
and collective was born, but a strategic distribution of elements of 
different natures and levels. That the prison is not the daughter of 
laws, codes or the judicial apparatus; that it is not subordinated to 
the court and the docile or clumsy instrument of the sentences that

Prison 


it hands out and of the results that it would like to achieve; that it is 
the court that is external and subordinate to the prison. That in the 
central position that it occupies, it is not alone, but linked to a whole 
series of ‘carceral’ mechanisms which seem distinct enough - since 
they are intended to alleviate pain, to cure, to comfort - but which 
all tend, like the prison, to exercise a power of normalization. That 
these mechanisms are applied not to transgressions against a ‘central’ 
law, but to the apparatus of production - ‘commerce’ and ‘industry’ 
- to a whole multiplicity of illegalities, in all their diversity of nature 
and origin, their specific role in profit and the different ways in 
which they are dealt with by the punitive mechanisms. And that 
ultimately what presides over all these mechanisms is not the unitary 
functioning of an apparatus or an institution, but the necessity of 
combat and the rules of strategy. That, consequently, the notions of 
institutions of repression, rejection, exclusion, marginalization, are 
not adequate to describe, at the very centre of the carceral city, the 
formation of the insidious leniencies, unavowable petty cruelties, 
small acts of cunning, calculated methods, techniques, ‘sciences’ 
that permit the fabrication of the disciplinary individual. In this 
central and centralized humanity, the effect and instrument of com¬ 
plex power relations, bodies and forces subjected by multiple 
mechanisms of ‘incarceration’, objects for discourses that are in 
themselves elements for this strategy, we must hear the distant roar 
of battle. 

At this point I end a book that must serve as a historical back¬ 
ground to various studies of the power of normalization and the 
formation of knowledge in modern society.
