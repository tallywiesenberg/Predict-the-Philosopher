PART ONE TORTURE 

I The body of the condemned 

1 The public execution of traitors described by William Blackstone, 
Commentaries on the Laws of England, vol. 4, 1766 9, 89. Since the 
French translation was intended to bring out the humaneness of 
English legislation, in contrast with the old ordinance of 1760, the 
French translator adds the following note: ‘In this form of execution, 
which is so terrifying to see, the guilty man does not suffer much pain, 
or for long.’ 

2 In any case, I could give no notion by references or quotations what 
this book owes to Gilles Deleuze and the work he is undertaking with 
F^lix Guattari. I should also have quoted a number of pages from 
R. Castell’s Psychancdysme and say how much I am indebted to 
Pierre Nora. 

3 I shall study the birth of the prison only in the French penal system. 
Differences in historical developments and institutions would make a 
detailed comparative examination too burdensome and any attempt to 
describe the phenomenon as a whole too schematic. 

2 The spectacle of the scaffold 

1 The name given to two fortresses in old Paris, the Grand and the 
Petit Chatelet. The first, demolished in 1802, was situated on the 
right bank of the Seine. It was the seat of the criminal jurisdiction of 
the viscounty and provostry of Paris. The second, on the left bank, 
near the H6tel-Dieu, served as a prison [Tr.]. 

2 In the catalogues of judicial proofs, the confession appears in about 
the thirteenth or fourteenth century. Bernard of Pavia does not refer 
to it, but it is mentioned by Hostiemis. Crater’s definition is character¬ 
istic: 'Aut legitime convictus out sponte confessus.’
