Valaze, 344: perpetual imprisonment for those who have been judged 
‘irremediably wicked’. 

2 Masson, 139. Yet the objection made against penal labour was that it 
implied a recourse to violence (Le Peletier) or that it represented a 
profanation of the sacred character of work (Duport). Rabaud Saint- 
Etienne got the term ‘forced labour’ adopted in contra-distinction to 
‘free labour that belongs exclusively to free men’ (Archives Parlemen- 
taires, XXVI, yioff).

3 Part of this code was translated in the introduction to the French 
translation of Colquhoun, 1807, 1 , 84. 

4 This explains the numerous prison regulations concerning the exac¬ 
tions of the warders, the security of the premises and the inability of 
prisoners to communicate among themselves. For example, the 
judgement of the Dijon Parlement of 21 September 1706. Cf. also 
Serpillon, 601-47.

thieves or that of 18 July 1724 concerning vagabondage. A boy, who 
was too young to go to the galleys, remained in a prison until he was 
old enough to be sent there, sometimes to serve the whole of his 
sentence. Cf. Crime et crimituditi en France sous I’Ancien Rigime, 266fF.

about 560 B.c. He is said to have roasted men alive in a brazen bull. 
His name is used here to typify tyrants in general [Tr.].

houses of detention that families might use.

exhaustive study of the Rasphuis and the Spinhuis of Amsterdam. One 
may leave to one side another ‘model’, often cited in the eighteenth 
century. This is the one proposed by Mabillon in the Riflexions sur les 
prisons des ordres religieux, republished in 1845. It seems that this work 
was exhumed in the nineteenth century at a time when the Catholics
