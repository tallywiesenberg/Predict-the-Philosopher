And this extra-judicial imprison¬ 
ment came to be rejected by both classical jurists and reformers.Prisons are made by princes, said a traditionalist like Serpillon, who 
sheltered behind the authority of Judge Bouhier: ‘Although, for 
reasons of state, princes are sometimes inclined to inflict this penalty, 
ordinary justice makes no use of this kind of sentence’ (Serpillon, 
1095).Detention was described by the reformers in innumerable 
statements as a figure and privileged instrument of despotism: ‘What 
is one to say of those secret prisons conjured up by the fatal spirit of 
monarchism, reserved in the main either for philosophers, in whose 
hands nature has placed her torch and who dared to enlighten their 
century, or for those proud independent souls who lack the coward¬ 
ice to keep silent on the ills of their country; prisons whose gloomy 
doors are opened by mysterious letters and swallow up forever its 
unfortunate victims.^ What is to be said even of those letters, those 
masterpieces of ingenious tyranny, which overthrow the privilege 
of every citizen to be heard before he is judged, and which are a 
thousand times more dangerous for men than the invention of 
Phalaris .. .’* (Brissot, 173).No doubt these protests, coming from such diverse sources, are 
directed not at imprisonment as a legal penalty, but at the ‘illegal’ 
use of arbitrary, indeterminate detention.Nevertheless, imprison¬ 
ment was seen, generally speaking, as branded by the abuses of 
power.
