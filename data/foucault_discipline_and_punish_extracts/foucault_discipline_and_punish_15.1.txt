.And the decree 
of 13 March 1790 ordered the freeing of ‘all persons detained in 
castles, religious houses, maisons de force, maisons de police or any 
other prisons, by orders under the king’s private seal or by orders 
of the agents of the executive power’.How then could detention, so evidently bound up with an 
illegality that was denounced even in the power of the prince, 
become in so short a time one of the most general forms of legal 
punishment.^ 

The explanation most usually given is the formation, during the 
classical age, of a number of great models of punitive imprisonment.Their prestige, which was all the greater in that the most recent 
examples came from England and above all from America, appears 
to have made it possible to overcome the double obstacle constituted 
by the age-old rules of law and the despotic functioning of im¬ 
prisonment.Very soon, it seems, these obstacles were swept away 
by the punitive marvels thought up by the reformers, and detention 
became a serious reality.
