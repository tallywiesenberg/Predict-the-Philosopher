Its functioning obeyed three great 
principles: the duration of the penalties could, at least within 
certain limits, be determined by the administration itself, according 
to the prisoner’s conduct (indeed this latitude could be given in the 
sentence itself: in 1597 a prisoner was condemned to twelve years’ 
imprisonment, which could be reduced to eight, if his behaviour 
proved satisfactory).Work was obligatory; it was performed in 
common (indeed the individual cell was used only as an additional 
punishment; prisoners slept two or three to a bed, in cells containing 
between four and twelve persons); and, for the work done, the 
prisoners received wages.A strict time-table, a system of prohibi¬ 
tions and obligations, continual supervision, exhortations, religious 
readings, a whole complex of methods ‘to draw towards good’ and 
‘to turn away from evil’ held the prisoners in its grip from day to 
day.One may take the Rasphuis of Amsterdam as a basic figure.Historically, it forms the link between the theory, so characteristic 
of the sixteenth century, of a pedagogical and spiritual transforma¬ 
tion of individuals brought about by continuous exercise, and the 
penitentiary techniques conceived in the second half of the eighteenth 
century.
