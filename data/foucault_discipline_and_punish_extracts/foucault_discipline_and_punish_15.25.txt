And it provided the three institutions that were then set up 
with the fundamental principles that each was to develop in its own 
particular direction.The maison de force at Ghent organized penal labour above all 
around economic imperatives.The reason given was that idleness 
was the general cause of most crimes.An investigation - no doubt 
one of the first - carried out among those sentenced under the 
jurisdiction of Alost, in 1749, showed that malefactors were not 
‘artisans or labourers’ (workers think only of the work that feeds 
them), but ‘idlers given up to begging’.® Hence the idea of a house 
that would in a sense provide a universal pedagogy of work for 
those who had proved to be resistant to it.This had four advantages: 
it reduced the number of criminal prosecutions, which were costly 
to the state (it was estimated that this would save over 100,000 
pounds in Flanders); this would make it unnecessary to return 
money paid in taxes to the owners of woods ruined by vagabonds; 
it would create a mass of new workers, which would help ‘by com¬ 
petition to bring down the cost of labour’; lastly, it would enable the 
true poor to benefit, to the full, from necessary charity (Vilan, 68).
