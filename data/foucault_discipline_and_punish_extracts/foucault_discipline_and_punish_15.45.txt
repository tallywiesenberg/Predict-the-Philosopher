Imprisonment, with the 
purpose of transforming the soul and conduct, made its entry into 
the system of civil laws.The preamble of the bill, written by Black- 
stone and Howard, describes individual imprisonment in terms of 
its triple function as example to be feared, instrument of conversion 
and condition for an apprenticeship: subjected ‘to isolated detention, 
regular work and the influence of religious instruction’, certain 
criminals might not only inspire terror in those who would be 
tempted to imitate them, ‘but also to correct themselves and to 
acquire the habit of work’ (Preamble of the bill of 1779).Hence the 
decision to build two penitentiaries, one for men, one for women, 
in which the isolated prisoners would be put ‘to the most servile 
labours, most compatible with the ignorance, negligence and 
obstinacy of the criminals’: walking in a wheel to move a machine, 
fixing a winch, polishing marble, beating hemp, rasping logwood, 
cutting up rags, rope-making and sewing sacks.In fact, only one 
penitentiary was built, at Gloucester, and it corresponded only 
partially to the initial plan: total confinement for the most dangerous 
criminals; for the others, day work in common and separation at 
night.Then came the Philadelphia model.
