This was no doubt the most

Punishment 


the Walnut Street Prison, opened in 1790, under the direct influence 
of the Quakers, was modelled on those of Ghent and Gloucester.There was compulsory work in workshops; the prisoners were kept 
constantly occupied; the prison was flnanced by this work, but the 
prisoners were also rewarded individually as a way of reinserting 
them morally and materially into the strict world of the economy; 
by keeping the prisoners ‘constantly employed on productive 
works, they were able to defray the expenses of the prison, they 
were not left idle and they were able to save a little money for the 
time when their captivity would cease’ (La Rochefoucauld-Lian- 
court, 9).Life was partitioned, therefore, according to an absolutely 
strict time-table, under constant supervision; each moment of the 
day was devoted to a particular type of activity, and brought with it 
its own obligations and prohibitions: ‘All prisoners rise at daybreak, 
so that, after making their beds, cleaning and washing themselves 
and attending to other needs, they generally begin their work at 
sunrise.From that moment, no one may go into the rooms or other 
places except to the workshops and places assigned for their work.
