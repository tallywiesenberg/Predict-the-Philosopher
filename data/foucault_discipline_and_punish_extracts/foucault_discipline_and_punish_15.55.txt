... At nightfall, a bell rings to mark the end of their work...They 
are given half an hour to arrange their beds, after which they are not 
allowed to converse aloud or to make the least noise’ (Turnbull, 15- 
16).As at Gloucester, solitary confinement was not total; it was used 
for certain prisoners who would in former times have incurred the 
death penalty, and for those inside the prison who deserved special 
punishment: ‘There, without occupation, without anything to dis¬ 
tract him, waiting in uncertainty for the moment when he would be 
delivered’, the prisoner spent ‘long anxious hours, with nothing but 
the reflections that are present to the minds of all guilty persons’ 
(Teeters, 1935, 49).Lastly, as at Ghent, the length of the imprison¬ 
ment could vary with the behaviour of the prisoner: after consulting 
the files, the prison inspectors obtained from the authorities - with¬ 
out much difficulty up to the 1820s - pardons for prisoners who had 
shown good behaviour.Furthermore, Walnut Street had a number of characteristics that 
were specific to it, or which at least developed what was potentially 
present in the other models.
