towns and on the highways.The punishment and correction that 
it must operate are processes that unfold between the prisoner and 
those who supervise him.They are processes that effect a transforma¬ 
tion of the individual as a whole - of his body and of his habits by 
the daily work that he is forced to perform, of his mind and his will 
by the spiritual attentions that are paid to him: ‘Bibles and other 
books of religious practice are provided; the clergy of the different 
obediences to be found in the town and suburbs perform the services 
once a week and any other edifying person may have access to the 
prisoners at any time’ (Teeters, 1935, 53-4).But this transformation 
is entrusted to the administration itself.Solitude and self-examina¬ 
tion are not enough; nor are purely religious exhortations.
