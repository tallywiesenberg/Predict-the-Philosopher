the prisoner’s soul must be carried out as often as possible.The 
prison, though an administrative apparatus, will at the same time be 
a machine for altering minds.On first entering the prison, the 
prisoner will be read the regulations; ‘at the same time, the inspectors

they represent to him the offence that he has committed with regard 
to them, the evil that has consequently resulted for the society that 
protected him and the need to make compensation by his example 
and his amendment.They then make him promise to do his duty 
gladly, to behave decently, promising him or allowing him to hope 
that, before the expiration of the term of the sentence, he will be 
able to obtain his discharge if he behaves well..
