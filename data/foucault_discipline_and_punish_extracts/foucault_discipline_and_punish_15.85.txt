And in 

Pennsylvania, Buxton declared, the principles of Montesquieu and 
Beccaria should now have the ‘force of axioms’, that ‘the prevention 
of crimes is the sole end of punishment’ (Bradford, 3).So one 
punishes not to efface the crime, but to transform a criminal (actual 
or potential); punishment must bring with it a certain corrective 
technique.Here, too.Rush is close to the reforming jurists - were 
it not, perhaps, for the metaphor he uses when he says: we have 
invented machines that facilitate labour; how much more one should 
praise the inventor of ‘the most speedy and effectual methods of 
restoring the vicious part of mankind to virtue and happiness, and of 
extirpating a portion of vice from the world’.^® Lastly, the English 
and the American models, like the projects of the legislators and 
theoreticians, require methods to individualize the penalty: in its 
duration, its nature, its intensity, the way in which it is carried out, 
the punishment must be adjusted to the individual character and to 
the danger that he bears within him for others.The system of 
penalties must be open to individual variables.
