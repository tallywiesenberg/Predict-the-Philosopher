In their general out¬ 
line, the models more or less inspired by the Rasphuis of Amsterdam 
were not in contradiction with the proposals of the reformers.It 
might even be thought at first glance that they were merely a devel¬ 
opment of them - or a sketch - at the level of concrete institutions.Yet the disparity emerges clearly enough when one defines the 
techniques of this individualizing correction.The difference is 
to be found in the procedure of access to the individual, the way in 
which the punishing power gets control over him, the instruments 
that it uses in order to achieve this transformation; it is in the 
technology of the penalty, not in its theoretical foundation; in the 
relation that it establishes with the body and with the soul, and not 
in the way that it is inserted within the legal system.That was the method of the reformers.
