Where exactly did the 
penalty apply its pressure, gain control of the individual.^ Represen¬ 
tations: the representations of his interests, the representation of his 
advantages and disadvantages, pleasure and displeasure; and, if the 
punishment happens to seize the body, to apply techniques to it that 
are little short of torture, it is because it is - for the condemned man

and for the spectators - an object of representation.By what instru¬ 
ment did one act on the representations.^ Other representations, or 
rather couplings of ideas (crime-punishment, the imagined advan¬ 
tage of crime-disadvantage perceived in the punishments); these 
pairings could function only in the element of publicity: punitive 
scenes that established them or reinforced them in the eyes of all, a 
discourse that circulated, brought back into currency at each 
moment the complex of signs.The role of the criminal in punish¬ 
ment was to reintroduce, in the face of crime and the criminal code, 
the real presence of the signified - that is to say, of the penalty 
which, according to the terms of the code, must be infallibly associ¬ 
ated with the offence.By producing this signified abundantly and 
visibly, and therefore reactivating the signifying system of the code, 
the idea of crime functioning as a sign of punishment, it is with this 
coin that the offender pays his debt to society.Individual correction 
must, therefore, assure the process of redefining the individual as 
subject of law, through the reinforcement of the systems of signs 
and representations that they circulate.
