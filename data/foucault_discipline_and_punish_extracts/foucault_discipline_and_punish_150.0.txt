colonization, slavery and child rearing. 

2 Cf what La Metherie wrote after a visit to Le Creusot: ‘The buildings 
for so fine an establishment and so large a quantity of different work 
should cover a sufficient area, so that there will be no confusion among 
the workers during working time’ (La Metherie, 66).
