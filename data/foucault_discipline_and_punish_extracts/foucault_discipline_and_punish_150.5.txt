contract: the master is obliged to give his pupil - in exchange for his 
money and his labour - all his knowledge, without keeping any secret 
from him; otherwise, he is liable to a fine. Cf., for example, Grosre- 
naud, 62. 

7 F. de la Noue recommended the creation of military academies at the 
end of the sixteenth century, suggesting that one should learn in them 
‘howto handle horses, to practise with the dagger, with and without 
shield, to fence, to perform on horseback, to jump; if swimming and 
wrestling were added, it would be to the good, for all this makes the 
person robust and more subtle’ (Noue, 181-2).

took up in the scenography of their schools, thus reintroducing a 
military model. But the decury was replaced in turn by an even more 
military schema, with ranks, columns, lines.
