has calculated that pupils must have been given over 200 commands a 
day (without counting exceptional orders); for the morning alone 
twenty-six commands communicated by the voice, twenty-three by 
signs, thirty-seven by rings of the bell, and twenty-four by whistle, 
which means a blow on the whistle or a ring on the bell every three 
minutes.

the Instruction sur le service des reglements de Cavcderie dans les camps,

visiting the £cole Militaire that his brother first had the idea of the 
Panopticon.

of the teachers, entrusted with the moral responsibility for small groups 
of pupils. After 1762, above all, one sees the appearance of a new 
type of supervision, which was more administrative and more inte¬ 
grated into the hierarchy; supervisors, maitres de quartier, maitres 
subalternes. Cf. Dupont-Ferrier, 254 and 476.

2 In the Postscript to the Panopticon, *791* Bentham adds dark inspec¬ 
tion galleries painted in black around the inspector’s lodge, each 
making it possible to observe two storeys of cells.
