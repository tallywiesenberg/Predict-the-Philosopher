duration, to take up their place once more in society without abusing 
it. . . The surest ways of making individuals better are work and 
education.’ Education consists not only in reading and arithmetic, but 
also in reconciling the prisoners with ‘ideas of order, morality, respect 
for themselves and for others’ (Beugnot, prefect of Seine-Inferieure, 
order issued Frimaire, Year X). In the reports that Chaptal demanded 
from the General Councils of the dipartements, over a dozen asked for 
prisons in which the inmates could be made to work. 

3 The most important were no doubt those proposed by Lucas, Marquet- 
Wasselot, Faucher, Bonneville, and a little later by Ferrus. It should 
be noted that most of them were not philanthropists, criticizing the 
carceral institution from the outside, but were bound up, in one way or 
another, with the administration of the prisons. They were official 
technicians.

Anstalten. 

5 Although these newspapers were above all organs of defence on the 
part of those in prison for debt and had on several occasions dissoci¬ 
ated themselves from delinquents as such, one finds the statement that 
‘the columns of Pauvre Jacques are not devoted to an exclusive 
speciality. The terrible law of constraint by body and its disastrous 
application will not be the only target of the journalist prisoner. . . 
Pauvre Jacques will draw the attention of its readers to places of 
reclusion and detention, prisons and almshouses; it will not keep silent 
on places where the guilty man is handed over to torture when the law 
condemns him only to work ...’ {Pauvre Jacques, ist year, no. 7). 
Similarly, the Gaiette de Sainte-Pelagie campaigned for a penitentiary 
system whose aim would be ‘the amelioration of the species’, any other 
being ‘the expression of a still barbarous society’ (21 March 1833). 

6 The discussion that began in France about 1830 was still continuing in 
1850; Charles Lucas, the advocate of Auburn, was the inspiration 
behind the order of 1839 on the running of the maisons centrales (work 
in common and absolute silence). The wave of revolt that followed 
and perhaps the general agitation in the country in the years 1842-3 
resulted in the adoption in 1844 of the Pennsylvanian regime of 
absolute isolation, advocated by Demetz, Blouet and Tocqueville. But 
the second penitentiary congress in 1847 opted against this method. 

7 ‘Every man’, said Fox, ‘is illuminated by the divine light and I have 
seen it shine through every man.’ It was in the spirit of the Quakers 
and of Walnut Street that the prisons of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh and 
Cherry Hill were organized from 1820.
