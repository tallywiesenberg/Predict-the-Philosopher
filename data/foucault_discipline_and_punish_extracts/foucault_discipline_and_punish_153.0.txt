about the same time as the constitution of the individual delinquent in 
the punitive mechanisms: the biography or autobiography of prisoners

in Appert; the drawing up of biographical files on the psychiatric 
model; the use of biography in the defence of accused persons. On 
the last point one might compare the great justificatory memoirs of 
the late eighteenth century written for the three men condemned to the 
wheel, or for Jeanne Salmon — and the defences of criminals in the 
period of Louis Philippe. Chaix d’Est-Ange pleaded for La Ronciere: 
‘If long before the crime, long before the charge is laid, you can 
scrutinize the defendant’s life, penetrate into his heart, find its most 

hidden corners, lay bare all his thoughts, his entire soul_ ’ {Discours 

etplaidoyers. III, i 6 < 5 ). 

2 Illegalities and delinquency 

1 Revue de Paris, 7 June 1836. This part of the spectacle, in 1836, was 
no longer public; only a few privileged spectators were admitted to it.

‘criminal’ notices. From the following description people would be 
able to recognize Delacollonge: ‘Old cloth trousers over a pair of 
boots, a peaked cap of the same stuff and a grey overall.. . A coat of 
blue stuff’ (6 June 1836). Later, it was decided to disguise Delacollonge 
in order to protect him from the violence of the crowd. The Gazette 
des trihunaux immediately described the disguise: ‘Striped trousers, 
blue linen overalls, a straw hat’ (20 July). 

3 Revue de Paris, June 1836. Cf. Claude Gueux: ‘Feel all those heads ... 
each of these fallen men has below him his own bestial type. . . Here 
is the lynx, here the cat, here the monkey, here the vulture, here the 
hyena.’
