11 This campaign was very vigorous before and after the passing of new 
regulations for the maisons centrales in 1839. The regulations were 
severe (silence, abolition of wine and tobacco, reduction in food) and 
they were followed by revolts. On 3 October 1840, Le Moruteur 
wrote: ‘It was scandalous to see prisoners gorging themselves with 
wine, meat, game, delicacies of all kinds and treating prison as a 
convenient hostelry where they could procure all the comforts that 
the state of liberty often refused them.’ 

12 In 1826, many of the General Councils demanded that deportation be 
substituted for constant and ineffective incarceration. In 1842, the 
General Council of the Hautes-Alpes demanded that the prisons 
become ‘truly expiatory’; those of Drome, Eure-et-Loir, Ni^vre, 
Rhone and Seine-et-Oise made similar demands.

Notes 


13 According to an investigation carried out in 1839 among the directors 
of the maisons centrales. The director of the maison centrale of Embrun 
remarked: ‘The excessive comfort in the prisons probably contributes 
a great deal to the terrible increase in the number of recidivists.’ While 
the director at Eysses remarked; ‘The present regime is not severe 
enough, and if one thing is certain it is that for many of the inmates 
prison has its attractions and that they find in prison depraved pleasures 
that are entirely to their liking.’ The director at Limoges: ‘The 
present regime of the maisons centrales which, for the recidivists, are in 
fact little more than boarding houses, is in no way repressive’ (Cf. 
Moreau-Christophe, 1840, 86). Compare these remarks with declara¬ 
tions made, in July 1974, by the leaders of the union of prison workers 
concerning the effects of liberalization in prisons. 

14 On the problem of deportation, cf. Barbe-Marbois and the discussion 
between Blosseville and La Pilorgerie (on the subject of Botany Bay). 
Bure, Marengo and L. de Carn6, among others, drew up plans for the 
colonization of Algeria with delinquents. 

15 One of the first episodes was the organization under police supervision 
of the maisons de tolerance (1823), which went well beyond the pro¬ 
visions of the law of 14 July 1791, concerning surveillance in brothels. 
Cf. on this subject the manuscripts collected by the Prefecture of
