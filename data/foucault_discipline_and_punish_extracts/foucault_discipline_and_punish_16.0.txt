The apparatus of corrective penality acts in a quite different way.The point of application of the penalty is not the representation, but 
the body, time, everyday gestures and activities; the soul, too, but 
in so far as it is the seat of habits.The body and the soul, as prin¬ 
ciples of behaviour, form the element that is now proposed for 
punitive intervention.Rather than on an art of representations, this 
punitive intervention must rest on a studied manipulation of the 
individual: ‘I have no more doubt of every crime having its cure in 
moral and physical influence ...’; so, in order to decide on punish¬ 
ments, one ‘will require some knowledge of the principles of sensa¬ 
tion, and of the sympathies which occur in the nervous system’ 
(Rush, 13).As for the instruments used, these are no longer com¬ 
plexes of representation, reinforced and circulated, but forms of 
coercion, schemata of constraint, applied and repeated.
