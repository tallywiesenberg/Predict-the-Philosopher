tained as the physical yet intangible support of the kingdom; 
around this duality, which was originally close to the Christological 
model, are organized an iconography, a political theory of monarchy, 
legal mechanisms that distinguish between as well as link the person

The body of the condemned 


of the king and the demands of the Crown, and a whole ritual that 
reaches its height in the coronation, the funeral and the ceremonies 
of submission. At the opposite pole one might imagine placing the 
body of the condemned man; he, too, has his legal status; he gives 
rise to his own ceremonial and he calls forth a whole theoretical 
discourse, not in order to ground the ‘surplus power’ possessed by 
the person of the sovereign, but in order to code the ‘lack of power’ 
with which those subjected to punishment are marked. In the darkest 
region of the political field the condemned man represents the sym¬ 
metrical, inverted figure of the king. We should analyse what might 
be called, in homage to Kantorowitz, ‘the least body of the con¬ 
demned man’. 

If the surplus power possessed by the king gives rise to the 
duplication of his body, has not the surplus power exercised on the 
subjected body of the condemned man given rise to another type of 
duplication.^ That of a ‘non-corporal’, a ‘soul’, as Mably called it. 
The history of this ‘micro-physics’ of the punitive power would then 
be a genealogy or an element in a genealogy of the modern ‘soul’. 
Rather than seeing this soul as the reactivated remnants of an ideo- 
one would see it as the present correlative of a certain tech¬ 
nology of power over the body. It would be wrong to say that the 
soul is an illusion, or an ideological effect. On the contrary, it exists, 
it has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within the 
body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those 
punished - and, in a more general way, on those one supervises, 
trains and corrects, over madmen, children at home and at school, 
the colonized, over those who are stuck at a machine and supervised 
for the rest of their lives. This is the historical reality of this soul, 
which, unlike the soul represented by Christian theology, is not 
born in sin and subject to punishment, but is born rather out of 
methods of punishment, supervision and constraint. This real, non¬ 
corporal soul is not a substance; it is the element in which are 
articulated the effects of a certain type of power and the reference 
of a certain type of knowledge, the machinery by which the power 
relations give rise to a possible corpus of knowledge, and knowledge
