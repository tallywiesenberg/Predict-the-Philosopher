The training of behaviour by a full 
time-table, the acquisition of habits, the constraints of the body 
imply a very special relation between the individual who is punished 
and the individual who punishes him.It is a relation that not only 
renders the dimension of the spectacle useless: it excludes it.** The 
agent of punishment must exercise a total power, which no third 
party can disturb; the individual to be corrected must be entirely 
enveloped in the power that is being exercised over him.Secrecy is 
imperative, and so too is autonomy, at least in relation to this 
technique of punishment: it must have its own functioning, its own 
rules, its own techniques, its own knowledge; it must fix its own 
norms, decide its own results.There is a discontinuity, or in any 
case a specificity, in relation to the legal power that declares guilt 
and fixes the general limits of punishment.
