These two consequences 
- secrecy and autonomy in the exercise of the power to punish - are 
unacceptable for a theory and a policy of penality that has two aims 
in view: to get all citizens to participate in the punishment of the 
social enemy and to render the exercise of the power to punish 
entirely adequate and transparent to the laws that publicly define it.Secret punishments and punishments not specified in the legal code, 
a power to punish exercised in the shadows according to criteria and 
with instruments that elude control - this was enough to compro¬ 
mise the whole strategy of the reform.After the sentence, a power 
was constituted that was reminiscent of the power exercised in the 
old system.The power that applied the penalties now threatened 
to be as arbitrary, as despotic, as the power that once decided them.In short, the divergence is the following: punitive city or coercive 
institution.^ On the one hand, a functioning of penal power, dis¬ 
tributed throughout the social space; present everywhere as scene.
