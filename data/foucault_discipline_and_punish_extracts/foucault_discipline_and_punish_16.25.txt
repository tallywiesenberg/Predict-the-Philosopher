The other two both refer to a preventive, 
utilitarian, corrective conception of a right to punish that belongs 
to society as a whole; but they are very different from one another 
at the level of the mechanisms they envisage.Broadly speaking, one 
might say that, in monarchical law, punishment is a ceremonial of 
sovereignty; it uses the ritual marks of the vengeance that it applies 
to the body of the condemned man; and it deploys before the eyes 
of the spectators an effect of terror as intense as it is discontinuous, 
irregular and always above its own laws, the physical presence of the 
sovereign and of his power.The reforming jurists, on the other 
hand, saw punishment as a procedure for requalifying individuals 
as subjects, as juridical subjects; it uses not marks, but signs, coded 
sets of representations, which would be given the most rapid 
circulation and the most general acceptance possible by citizens

The gentle way in punishment 


wimessing the scene of punishment.Lastly, in the project for a 
prison institution that was then developing, punishment was seen 
as a technique for the coercion of individuals; it operated methods 
of training the body - not signs - by the traces it leaves, in the form 
of habits, in behaviour; and it presupposed the setting up of a 
specific power for the administration of the penalty.We have, then, 
the sovereign and his force, the social body and the administrative 
apparatus; mark, sign, trace; ceremony, representation, exercise; 
the vanquished enemy, the juridical subject in the process of reÂ¬ 
qualification, the individual subjected to immediate coercion; the 
tortured body, the soul with its manipulated representations, the 
body subjected to training.
