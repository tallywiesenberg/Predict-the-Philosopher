We have here the three series of elements 
that characterize the three mechanisms that face one another in the 
second half of the eighteenth century.They cannot be reduced to 
theories of law (though they overlap with such theories), nor can 
they be identified with apparatuses or institutions (though they are 
based on them), nor can they be derived from moral choices (though 
they find their justification in morality).They are modalities accord¬ 
ing to which the power to punish is exercised: three technologies of 
power.The problem, then, is the following: how is it that, in the end, 
it was the third that was adoptedi' How did the coercive, corporal, 
solitary, secret model of the power to punish replace the representa¬ 
tive, scenic, signifying, public, collective model.^ Why did the 
physical exercise of punishment (which is not torture) replace, with 
the prison that is its institutional support, the social play of the signs 
of punishment and the prolix festival that circulated them.^

I. Docile bodies 


Let us take the ideal figure of the soldier as it was still seen in the 
early seventeenth century.To begin with, the soldier was someone 
who could be recognized from afar; he bore certain signs: the natural 
signs of his strength and his courage, the marks, too, of his pride; 
his body was the blazon of his strength and valour; and although it 
is true that he had to learn the profession of arms little by little - 
generally in actual fighting - movements like marching and attitudes 
like the bearing of the head belonged for the most part to a bodily 
rhetoric of honour; ‘The signs for recognizing those most suited to 
this profession are a lively, alert manner, an erect head, a taut 
stomach, broad shoulders, long arms, strong fingers, a small belly, 
thick thighs, slender legs and dry feet, because a man of such a 
figure could not fail to be agile and strong’; when he becomes a pike- 
bearer, the soldier ‘will have to march in step in order to have as 
much grace and gravity as possible, for the pike is an honourable 
weapon, worthy to be borne with gravity and boldness’ (Mont- 
gommery, 6 and 7).
