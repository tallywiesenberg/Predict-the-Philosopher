The classical age discovered the body as object and target of 
power.It is easy enough to find signs of the attention then paid to 
the body - to the body that is manipulated, shaped, trained, which 
obeys, responds, becomes skilful and increases its forces.The great 
book of Man-the-Machine was written simultaneously on two 
registers: the anatomico-metaphysical register, of which Descartes 
wrote the first pages and which the physicians and philosophers 
continued, and the technico-political register, which was constituted 
by a whole set of regulations and by empirical and calculated 
methods relating to the army, the school and the hospital, for con¬ 
trolling or correcting the operations of the body.These two regis¬ 
ters are quite distinct, since it was a question, on the one hand, of 
submission and use and, on the other, of functioning and explana¬ 
tion: there was a useful body and an intelligible body.And yet there 
are points of overlap from one to the other.
