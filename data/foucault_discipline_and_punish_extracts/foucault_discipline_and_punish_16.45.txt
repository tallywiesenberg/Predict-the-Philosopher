La Mettrie’s L'Homme- 
machine is both a materialist reduction of the soul and a general 
theory of dressage, at the centre of which reigns the notion of 
‘docility’, which joins the analysable body to the manipulable body.A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and 
improved.The celebrated automata, on the other hand, were not 
only a way of illustrating an organism, they were also political 
puppets, small-scale models of power: Frederick II, the meticulous 
king of small machines, well-trained regiments and long exercises, 
was obsessed with them.What was so new in these projects of docility that interested the 
eighteenth century so much.^ It was certainly not the first time that 
the body had become the object of such imperious and pressing 
investments; in every society, the body was in the grip of very 
strict powers, which imposed on it constraints, prohibitions or 
obligations.However, there were several new things in these tech¬ 
niques.
