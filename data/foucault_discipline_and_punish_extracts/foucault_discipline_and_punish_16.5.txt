To begin with, there was the scale of the control: it was a

question not of treating the body, en masse, ‘wholesale’, as if it were 
an indissociable unity, but of working it ‘retail’, individually; of 
exercising upon it a subtle coercion, of obtaining holds upon it at the 
level of the mechanism itself - movements, gestures, attitudes, 
rapidity: an infinitesimal power over the active body.Then there 
was the object of the control: it was not or was no longer the signify¬ 
ing elements of behaviour or the language of the body, but the 
economy, the efficiency of movements, their internal organization; 
constraint bears upon the forces rather than upon the signs; the only 
truly important ceremony is that of exercise.Lastly, there is the 
modality: it implies an uninterrupted, constant coercion, super¬ 
vising the processes of the activity rather than its result and it is 
exercised according to a codification that partitions as closely as 
possible time, space, movement.These methods, which made 
possible the meticulous control of the operations of the body, 
which assured the constant subjection of its forces and imposed 
upon them a relation of docility-utility, might be called ‘disciplines’.Many disciplinary methods had long been in existence - in monas¬ 
teries, armies, workshops.
