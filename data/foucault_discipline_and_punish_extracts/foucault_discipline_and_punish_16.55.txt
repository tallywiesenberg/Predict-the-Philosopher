But in the course of the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries the disciplines became general formulas of 
domination.They were different from slavery because they were 
not based on a relation of appropriation of bodies; indeed, the 
elegance of the discipline lay in the fact that it could dispense with 
this costly and violent relation by obtaining effects of utility at least 
as great.They were different, too, from ‘service’, which was a 
constant, total, massive, non-analytical, unlimited relation of 
domination, established in the form of the individual will of the 
master, his ‘caprice’.They were different from vassalage, which was 
a highly coded, but distant relation of submission, which bore less 
on the operations of the body than on the products of labour and 
the ritual marks of allegiance.Again, they were different from 
asceticism and from ‘disciplines’ of a monastic type, whose function 
was to obtain renunciations rather than increases of utility and 
which, although they involved obedience to others, had as their 
principal aim an increase of the mastery of each individual over his 
own body.
