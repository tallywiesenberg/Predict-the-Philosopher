Discipline increases the forces of 
the body (in economic terms of utility) and diminishes these same 
forces (in political terms of obedience).In short, it dissociates power 
from the body; on the one hand, it turns it into an ‘aptitude’, a 
‘capacity’, which it seeks to increase; on the other hand, it reverses 
the course of the energy, the power that might result from it, and 
turns it into a relation of strict subjection.If economic exploit¬ 
ation separates the force and the product of labour, let us say 
that disciplinary coercion establishes in the body the con¬ 
stricting link between an increased aptitude and an increased 
domination.The ‘invention’ of this new political anatomy must not be seen 
as a sudden discovery.It is rather a multiplicity of often minor 
processes, of different origin and scattered location, which overlap, 
repeat, or imitate one another, support one another, distinguish 
themselves from one another according to their domain of applica¬ 
tion, converge and gradually produce the blueprint of a general 
method.
