I simply intend to map on a series of examples some of the 
essential techniques that most easily spread from one to another.These were always meticulous, often minute, techniques, but they 
had their importance: because they defined a certain mode of 
detailed political investment of the body, a ‘new micro-physics’ of 
power; and because, since the seventeenth century, they had con¬ 
stantly reached out to ever broader domains, as if they tended to 
cover the entire social body.Small acts of cunning endowed with a 
great power of diffusion, subtle arrangements, apparently innocent, 
but profoundly suspicious, mechanisms that obeyed economies too 
shameful to be acknowledged, or pursued petty forms of coercion - 
it was nevertheless they that brought about the mutation of the 
punitive system, at the threshold of the contemporary period.De¬ 
scribing them will require great attention to detail: beneath every set 
of figures, we must seek not a meaning, but a precaution; we must 
situate them not only in the inextricability of a functioning, but in 
the coherence of a tactic.They are the acts of cunning, not so much 
of the greater reason that works even in its sleep and gi\^es meaning 
to the insignificant, as of the attentive ‘malevolence’ that turns 
everything to account.
