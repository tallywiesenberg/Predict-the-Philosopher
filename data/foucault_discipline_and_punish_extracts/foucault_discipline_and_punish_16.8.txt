Discipline is a political anatomy of detail.Before we lose patience we would do well to recall the words of 
Marshal de Saxe: ‘Although those who concern themselves with 
details are regarded as folk of limited intelligence, it seems to me 
that this part is essential, because it is the foundation, and it is 
impossible to erect any building or establish any method without 
understanding its principles.It is not enough to have a liking for 
architecture.One must also know stone-cutting’ (Saxe, 5).There is 
a whole history to be written about such ‘stone-cutting’ - a history 
of the utilitarian rationalization of detail in moral accountability and 
political control.
