Little things; and if God accepts them and wishes to 
receive them as great things?Little things; has one ever felt this?Does one judge according to experience?Little things; one is cerÂ¬ 
tainly guilty, therefore, if seeing them as such, one refuses them?Little things; yet it is they that in the end have made great saints!
