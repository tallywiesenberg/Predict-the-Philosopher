I was concerned with it then, and this memory lives 
within me, as an obsession never to be abandoned...That other 
world is the most important of all that I flatter myself I have dis¬ 
covered: when I think of it, my heart aches’ (these words are 
attributed to Bonaparte in the Introduction to Saint-Hilaire’s 
Notions synthitiques et historiques de pkilosophie naturelle).Napoleon 
did not discover this world; but we know that he set out to organize 
it; and he wished to arrange around him a mechanism of power that 
would enable him to see the smallest event that occurred in the state 
he governed; he intended, by means of the rigorous discipline that he 
imposed, ‘to embrace the whole of this vast machine without the 
slightest detail escaping his attention’ (Treilhard, 14).
