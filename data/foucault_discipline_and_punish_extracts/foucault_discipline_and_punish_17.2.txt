The ordinance 
of 1719 envisaged the construction of several hundred barracks, 
on the model of those already set up in the south of the country; 
there would be strict confinements: ‘The whole will be enclosed by 
an outer wall ten feet high, which will surround the said houses, at 
a distance of thirty feet from ail the sides’; this will have the effect 
of maintaining the troops in ‘order and discipline, so that an officer 
will be in a position to answer for them’ {L’Ordonnance militaire, 
IXL, 25 September 1719).In 1745, there were barracks in about 
320 towns; and it was estimated that the total capacity of the bar¬ 
racks in 1775 was approximately 200,000 men (Daisy, 201-9; ®n 
anonymous memoir of 1775, in Dep6t de la guerre, 3689, f. 156; 
Navereau, 132-5).Side by side with the spread of workshops, there 
also developed great manufacturing spaces, both homogeneous and 
well defined: first, the combined manufactories, then, in the second 
half of the eighteenth century, the works or factories proper (the 
Chaussade ironworks occupied almost the whole of the Medine 
peninsula, between Ni^vre and Loire; in order to set up the Indret 
factory in 1777, Wilkinson, by means of embankments and dikes, 
constructed an island on the Loire; Toufait built Le Creusot in the 
valley of the Charbonni^re, which he transformed, and he had 
workers’ accommodation built in the factory itself); it was a change 
of scale, but it was also a new type of control.The factory was 
explicitly compared with the monastery, the fortress, a walled town; 
the guardian ‘will open the gates only on the return of the workers, 
and after the bell that announces the resumption of work has been 
rung’; a quarter of an hour later no one will be admitted; at the end 
of the day, the workshops’ heads will hand back the keys to the Swiss 
guard of the factory, who will then open the gates {Amboise, f. 
12,1301).The aim is to derive the maximum advantages and to 
neutralize the inconveniences (thefts, interruptions of work, dis¬ 
turbances and ‘cabals’), as the forces of production become more 
concentrated; to protect materials and tools and to master the labour 
force: ‘The order and inspection that must be maintained require

Docile bodies 


that all workers be assembled under the same roof, so that the part¬ 
ner who is entrusted with the management of the manufactory may 
prevent and remedy abuses that may arise among the workers and 
arrest their progress at the outset’ (Dauphin, 199).
