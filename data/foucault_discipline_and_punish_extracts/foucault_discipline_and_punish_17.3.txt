Avoid distributions in groups; break up collective dispositions; 
analyse confused, massive or transient pluralities.Disciplinary space 
tends to be divided into as many sections as there are bodies or 
elements to be distributed.One must eliminate the effects of impre¬ 
cise distributions, the uncontrolled disappearance of individuals, 
their diffuse circulation, their unusable and dangerous coagulation; 
it was a tactic of anti-desertion, anti-vagabondage, anti-concentra¬ 
tion.Its aim was to establish presences and absences, to know where 
and how to locate individuals, to set up useful communications, to 
interrupt others, to be able at each moment to supervise the conduct 
of each individual, to assess it, to judge it, to calculate its qualities 
or merits.It was a procedure, therefore, aimed at knowing, master¬ 
ing and using.
