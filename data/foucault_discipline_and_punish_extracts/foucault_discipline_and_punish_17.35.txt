Discipline organizes an analytical space.And there, too, it encountered an old architectural and religious 
method: the monastic cell.Even if the compartments it assigns 
become purely ideal, the disciplinary space is always, basically, 
cellular.Solitude was necessary to both body and soul, according to 
a certain asceticism: they must, at certain moments at least, confront 
temptation and perhaps the severity of God alone.‘Sleep is the 
image of death, the dormitory is the image of the sepulchre — 
although the dormitories are shared, the beds are nevertheless 
arranged in such a way and closed so exactly by means of curtains 
that the girls may rise and retire without being seen’ {Reglementpour 
la communauti des fillet du Bon Pasteur, in Delamare, 507).
