In France, it seems that Rochefort served both as experi¬ 
ment and model.A port, and a military port is - with its circulation 
of goods, men signed up willingly or by force, sailors embarking 
and disembarking, diseases and epidemics - a place of desertion, 
smuggling, contagion: it is a crossroads for dangerous mixtures, a 
meeting-place for forbidden circulations.The naval hospital must 
therefore treat, but in order to do this it must be a filter, a mechanism 
that pins down and partitions; it must provide a hold over this whole 
mobile, swarming mass, by dissipating the confusion of illegality 
and evil.The medical supervision of diseases and contagions is 
inseparable from a whole series of other controls: the military control 
over deserters, fiscal control over commodities, administrative con¬ 
trol over remedies, rations, disappearances, cures, deaths, simula¬ 
tions.Hence the need to distribute and partition off space in a 
rigorous manner.
