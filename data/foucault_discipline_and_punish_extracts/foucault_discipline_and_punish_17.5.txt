The first steps taken at Rochefort concerned 
things rather than men, precious commodities, rather than patients.The arrangements of fiscal and economic supervision preceded the 
techniques of medical observation: placing of medicines under lock 
and key, recording their use; a little later, a system was worked out 
to verify the real number of patients, their identity, the units to 
which they belonged; then one began to regulate their comings and 
goings; they were forced to remain in their wards; to each bed was 
attached the name of its occupant; each individual treated was 
entered in a register that the doctor had to consult during the visit; 
later came the isolation of contagious patients and separate beds.Gradually, an administrative and political space was articulated upon 
a therapeutic space; it tended to individualize bodies, diseases, 
symptoms, lives and deaths; it constituted a real table of juxtaposed 
and carefully distinct singularities.Out of discipline, a medically 
useful space was bom.In the factories that appeared at the end of the eighteenth century, 
the principle of individualizing partitioning became more compliÂ¬ 
cated.
