The ground floor was devoted mainly to 
block printing; it contained 132 tables arranged in two rows, the 
length of the workshop, which had eighty-eight windows; each 
printer worked at a table with his ‘puller’, who prepared and spread 
the colours.There were 264 persons in all.At the end of each table 
was a sort of rack on which the material that had just been printed 
was left to dry (Saint-Maur).By walking up and down the central 
aisle of the workshop, it was possible to carry out a supervision that 
was both general and individual: to observe the worker’s presence 
and application, and the quality of his work; to compare workers 
with one another, to classify them according to skill and speed; 
to follow the successive stages of the production process.All these 
serializations formed a permanent grid: confusion was eliminated*: 
that is to say, production was divided up and the labour process 
was articulated, on the one hand, according to its stages or element¬ 
ary operations, and, on the other hand, according to the individuals, 
the particular bodies, that carried it out: each variable of this force - 
strength, promptness, skill, constancy - would be observed, and 
therefore characterized, assessed, computed and related to the 
individual who was its particular agent.
