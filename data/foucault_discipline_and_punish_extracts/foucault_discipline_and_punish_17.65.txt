Thus, spread out in a per¬ 
fectly legible way over the whole series of individual bodies, the 
work force may be analysed in individual units.At the emergence 
of large-scale industry, one finds, beneath the division of the pro¬ 
duction process, the individualizing fragmentation of labour power; 
the distributions of the disciplinary space often assured both.4.In discipline, the elements are interchangeable, since each is 
defined by the place it occupies in a series, and by the gap that 
separates it from the others.The unit is, therefore, neither the 
territory (unit of domination), nor the place (unit of residence), but 
the ran^; the place one occupies in a classification, the point at which 
a line and a column intersect, the interval in a series of intervals that

one may traverse one after the other.
