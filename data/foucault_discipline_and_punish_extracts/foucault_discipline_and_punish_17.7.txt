Discipline is an art of rank, 
a technique for the transformation of arrangements.It individualizes 
bodies by a location that does not give them a fixed position, but 
distributes them and circulates them in a network of relations.Take the example of the ‘class’.In the Jesuit colleges, one still 
found an organization that was at once binary and unified; the 
classes, which might comprise up to two or three hundred pupils, 
were subdivided into groups of ten; each of these groups, with its 
‘decurion’, was placed in a camp, Roman or Carthaginian; each 
‘decury’ had its counterpart in the opposing camp.The general 
form was that of war and rivalry; work, apprenticeship and classifi¬ 
cation were carried out in the form of the joust, through the con¬ 
frontation of two armies; the contribution of each pupil was in¬ 
scribed in this general duel; it contributed to the victory or the 
defeat of a whole camp; and the pupils were assigned a place that 
corresponded to the function of each individual and to his value as 
a combatant in the unitary group of his ‘decury’ (Rochemonteix, 
5 iff).
