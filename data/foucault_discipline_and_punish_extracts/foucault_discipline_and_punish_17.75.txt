It should be observed moreover that this Roman comedy 
made it possible to link, to the binary exercises of rivalry, a spatial 
disposition inspired by the legion, with rank, hierarchy, pyramidal 
supervision.One should not forget that, generally speaking, the 
Roman model, at the Enlightenment, played a dual role: in its 
republican aspect, it was the very embodiment of liberty; in its 
military aspect, it was the ideal schema of discipline.The Rome of 
the eighteenth century and of the Revolution was the Rome of the 
Senate, but it was also that of the legion; it was the Rome of the 
Forum, but it was also that of the camps.Up to the empire, the 
Roman reference transmitted, somewhat ambiguously, the juridical 
ideal of citizenship and the technique of disciplinary methods.In 
any case, the strictly disciplinary element in the ancient fable used by 
the Jesuit colleges came to dominate the element of joust and mock 
warfare.
