space unfolds; the class becomes homogeneous, it is no longer made 
up of individual elements arranged side by side under the master’s 
eye.In the eighteenth century, ‘rank’ begins to define the great form 
of distribution of individuals in the educational order: rows or ranks

obtains from week to week, month to month, year to year; an 
alignment of age groups, one after another; a succession of subjects 
taught and questions treated, according to an order of increasing 
difficulty.And, in this ensemble of compulsory alignments, each 
pupil, according to his age, his performance, his behaviour, occupies 
sometimes one rank, sometimes another; he moves constantly over 
a series of compartments - some of these are ‘ideal’ compartments, 
marking a hierarchy of knowledge or ability, others express the 
distribution of values or merits in material terms in the space of the 
college or classroom.It is a perpetual movement in which individuals 
replace one another in a space marked off by aligned intervals.The organization of a serial space was one of the great technical 
mutations of elementary education.
