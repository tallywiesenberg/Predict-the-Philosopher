It made it possible to supersede 
the traditional system (a pupil working for a few minutes with the 
master, while the rest of the heterogeneous group remained idle and 
unattended).By assigning individual places it made possible the 
supervision of each individual and the simultaneous work of all.It 
organized a new economy of the time of apprenticeship.It made the 
educational space function like a learning machine, but also as a

La Salle dreamt of a classroom in which the spatial distribution 
might provide a whole series of distinctions at once: according to 
the pupils’ progress, worth, character, application, cleanliness and 
parents’ fortune.
