Thus, the classroom would form a single great 
table, with many different entries, under the scrupulously ‘classi- 
ficatory’ eye of the master: ‘In every class there will be places 
assigned for all the pupils of all the lessons, so that all those attending 
the same lesson will always occupy the same place.Pupils attending 
the highest lessons will be placed in the benches closest to the wall, 
followed by the others according to the order of the lessons moving 
towards the middle of the classroom...Each of the pupils will 
have his place assigned to him and none of them will leave it or 
change it except on the order or with the consent of the school 
inspector.’ Things must be so arranged that ‘those whose parents 
are neglectful and verminous must be separated from those who are 
careful and clean; that an unruly and frivolous pupil should be 
placed between two who are well behaved and serious, a libertine 
either alone or between two pious pupils’.®

In organizing ‘cells’, ‘places’ and ‘ranks’, the disciplines create 
complex spaces that are at once architectural, functional and hier¬ 
archical.
