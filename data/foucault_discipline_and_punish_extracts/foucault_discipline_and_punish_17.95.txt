It is spaces that provide fixed positions and permit circula¬ 
tion; they carve out individual segments and establish operational 
links; they mark places and indicate values; they guarantee the 
obedience of individuals, but also a better economy of time and 
gesture.They are mixed spaces: real because they govern the dis¬ 
position of buildings, rooms, furniture, but also ideal, because they 
are projected over this arrangement of characterizations, assessments, 
hierarchies.The first of the great operations of discipline is, there¬ 
fore, the constitution of ‘tableaux vivants’, which transform the 
confused, useless or dangerous multitudes into ordered multiplici¬ 
ties.The drawing up of ‘tables’ was one of the great problems of the 
scientific, political and economic technology of the eighteenth 
century: how one was to arrange botanical and zoological gardens, 
and construct at the same time rational classifications of living beings; 
how one was to observe, supervise, regularize the circulation of 
commodities and money and thus build up an economic table that 
might serve as the principle of the increase of wealth; how one was 
to inspect men, observe their presence and absence and constitute 
a general and permanent register of the armed forces; how one was 
to distribute patients, separate them from one another, divide up 
the hospital space and make a systematic classification of diseases: 
these were all twin operations in which the two elements - distribu¬ 
tion and analysis, supervision and intelligibility - are inextricably 
bound up.In the eighteenth century, the table was both a technique 
of power and a procedure of knowledge.
