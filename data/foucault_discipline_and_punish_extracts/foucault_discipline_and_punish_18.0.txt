gradation of pain: from decapitation (which reduces all pain to a 
single gesture, performed in a single moment - the zero degree of 
torture), through hanging, the stake and the wheel (all of which 
prolong the agony), to quartering, which carries pain almost 
to infinity; death-torture is the art of maintaining life in pain, by

subdividing it into a ‘thousand deaths’, by achieving before life 
ceases ‘the most exquisite agonies’ (cf. Ollyffe). Torture rests on a 
whole quantitative art of pain. But there is more to it: this production 
of pain is regulated. Torture correlates the type of corporal effect, the 
quality, intensity, duration of pain, with the gravity of the crime, 
the person of the criminal, the rank of his victims. There is a legal 
code of pain; when it involves torture, punishment does not fall 
upon the body indiscriminately or equally; it is calculated according 
to detailed rules: the number of lashes of the whip, the positioning 
of the branding iron, the duration of the death agony on the stake 
or the wheel (the court decides whether the criminal is to be 
strangled at once or allowed to die slowly,, and the points at which 
this gesture of pity must occur), the type of mutilation to be used 
(hand cut off, lips or tongue pierced). All these various elements 
multiply the punishments and are combined according to the court 
and the crime. ‘The poetry of Dante put into laws,’ was how Rossi 
described it; a long course in physico-penal knowledge, in any case. 
Furthermore, torture forms part of a ritual. It is an element in the 
liturgy of punishment and meets two demands. It must mark the 
victim: it is intended, either by the scar it leaves on the body, or by 
the spectacle that accompanies it, to brand the victim with infamy; 
even if its function is to ‘purge’ the crime, torture does not recon¬ 
cile; it traces around or, rather, on the very body of the condemned 
man signs that must not be effaced; in any case, men will remember 
public exhibition, the pillory, torture and pain duly observed. And, 
from the point of view of the law that imposes it, public torture and 
execution must be spectacular, it must be seen by all almost as its 
triumph. The very excess of the violence employed is one of the 
elements of its glory: the fact that the guilty man should moan and 
cry out under the blows is not a shameful side-effect, it is the very 
ceremonial of justice being expressed in all its force. Hence no doubt 
those tortures that take place even after death: corpses burnt, ashes 
thrown to the winds, bodies dragged on hurdles and exhibited at 
the roadside. Justice pursues the body beyond all possible pain.
