But the table does not have the same function in these different 
registers.In the order of the economy, it makes possible the 
measurement of quantities and the analysis of movements.In the 
form of taxonomy, it has the function of characterizing (and conÂ¬ 
sequently reducing individual singularities) and constituting classes 
(and therefore of excluding considerations of number).But in the 
form of the disciplinary distribution, on the other hand, the table 
has the function of treating multiplicity itself, distributing it and 
deriving from it as many effects as possible.Whereas natural 
taxonomy is situated on the axis that links character and category, 
disciplinary tactics is situated on the axis that links the singular and 
the multiple.
