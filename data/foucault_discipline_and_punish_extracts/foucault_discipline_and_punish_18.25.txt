This happened in the army, of course: 
Guibert systematically implemented the chronometric measurement 
of shooting that had been suggested earlier by Vauban.In the ele¬ 
mentary schools, the division of time became increasingly minute; 
activities were governed in detail by orders that had to be obeyed 
immediately: ‘At the last stroke of the hour, a pupil will ring the 
bell, and at the first sound of the bell all the pupils will kneel, with 
their arms crossed and their eyes lowered.When the prayer has been 
said, the teachet will strike the signal once to indicate that the pupils 
should get up, a second time as a sign that they should salute Christ, 
and a third that they should sit down’ (La Salle, Conduite ..., 27-8).In the early nineteenth century, the following time-table was sug¬ 
gested for the Ecoles mutuelles, or ‘mutual improvement schools’: 
8.45 entrance of the monitor, 8.52 the monitor’s summons, 8.56 
entrance of the children and prayer, 9.00 the children go to their 
benches, 9.04 first slate, 9.08 end of dictation, 9.12 second slate, etc.(Tronchot, 221).
