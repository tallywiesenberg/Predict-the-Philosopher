The gradual extension of the wage-earning class 
brought with it a more detailed partitioning of time; ‘If workers 
arrive later than a quarter of an hour after the ringing of the bell...’ 
(Amboise, article 2); ‘if any one of the companions is asked for 
during work and loses more than five minutes ...’, ‘anyone who is 

not at his work at the correct time_’ (Oppenheim, article 7-8).But an attempt is also made to assure the quality of the time used: 
constant supervision, the pressure of supervisors, the elimination o£ 
anything that might disturb or distract; it is a question of constitut¬ 
ing a totally useful time: ‘It is expressly forbidden during work to 
amuse one’s companions by gestures or in any other way, to play

at any game whatsoever, to eat, to sleep, to tell stories and comedies’ 
(Oppenheim, article i6); and even during the meal-break, ‘there will 
be no telling of stories, adventures or other such talk that distracts 
the workers from their work’; ‘it is expressly forbidden for any 
worker, under any pretext, to bring wine into the manufactory and 
to drink in the workshops’ {Amboise, article 4).Time measured and 
paid must also be a time without impurities or defects; a time of 
good quality, throughout which the body is constantly applied to 
its exercise.Precision and application are, with regularity, the funda¬ 
mental virtues of disciplinary time.But this is not the newest thing 
about it.
