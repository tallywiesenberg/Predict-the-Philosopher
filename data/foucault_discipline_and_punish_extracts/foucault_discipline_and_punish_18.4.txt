And to do this, one 
must begin with the right foot so that the whole troop raises the 
same foot at the same time’ (Montgommery, 86).In the mid¬ 
eighteenth century, there are four sorts of steps: ‘The length of the 
the short step will be a foot, that of the ordinary step, the double 
step and the marching step will be two feet, the whole measured from 
one heel to the next; as for the duration, that of the small step and 
the ordinary step will last one second, during which two double 
steps would be performed; the duration of the marching step will be 
a little longer than one second.The oblique step will take one 
second; it will be at most eighteen inches from one heel to the next....The ordinary step will be executed forwards, holding the head 
up high and the body erect, holding oneself in balance successively 
on a single leg, and bringing the other forwards, the ham taut, the 
point of the foot a little turned outwards and low, so that one may 
without affectation brush the ground on which one must walk and 
place one’s foot, in such a way that each part may come to rest there 
at the same time without striking the ground’ (‘Ordonnance du i®*’ 
janvier 1766, pour regler I’exercise de I’infanterie’).
