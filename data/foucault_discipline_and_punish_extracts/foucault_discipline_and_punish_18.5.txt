Time 
penetrates the body and with it all the meticulous controls of power.3.Hence the correlation of the body and the gesture.Disciplinary 
control does not consist simply in teaching or imposing a series of 
particular gestures; it imposes the best relation between a gesture 
and the overall position of the body, which is its condition of effiÂ¬ 
ciency and speed.In the correct use of the body, which makes 
possible a correct use of time, nothing must remain idle or useless: 
everything must be called upon to form the support of the act 
required.
