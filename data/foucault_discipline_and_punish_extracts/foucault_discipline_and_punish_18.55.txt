A well-disciplined body forms the operational context of 
the slightest gesture.Good handwriting, for example, presupposes 
a gymnastics - a whole routine whose rigorous code invests the body 
in its entirety, from the points of the feet to the tip of the index 
finger.The pupils must always ‘hold their bodies erect, somewhat 
turned and free on the left side, slightly inclined, so that, with the 
elbow placed on the table, the chin can be rested upon the hand, 
unless this were to interfere with the view; the left leg must be some¬ 
what more forward under the table than the right.A distance of two 
fingers must be left between the body and the table; for not only 
does one write with more alertness, but nothing is more harmful 
to the health than to acquire the habit of pressing one’s stomach 
against the table; the part of the left arm from the elbow to the hand 
must be placed on the table.The right arm must be at a distance 
from the body of about three fingers and be about five fingers from 
the table, on which it must rest lightly.
