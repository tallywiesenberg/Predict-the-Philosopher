At 
the third stage, let go of the rifle with the left hand, which falls along 
the thigh, raising the rifle with the right hand, the lock outwards 
and opposite the chest, the right arm half flexed, the elbow close to 
the body, the thumb lying against the lock, resting against the first 
screw, the hammer resting on the first finger, the barrel perpendicu¬ 
lar’ (‘Ordonnance du i®’' janvier 1766 ..., titreXI, article 2’).This 
is an example of what might be called the instrumental coding of the 
body.It consists of a breakdown of the total gesture into two parallel 
series: that of the parts of the body to be used (right hand, left hand, 
different fingers of the hand, knee, eye, elbow, etc.)and that of the 
parts of the object manipulated (barrel, notch, hammer, screw, etc.); 
then the two sets of parts are correlated together according to a 
number of simple gestures (rest, bend); lastly, it fixes the canonical 
succession in which each of these correlations occupies a particular 
place.
