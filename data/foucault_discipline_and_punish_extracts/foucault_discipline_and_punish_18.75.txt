This obligatory syntax is what the military theoreticians of 
the eighteenth century called 'manoeuvre'.The traditional recipe 
gives place to explicit and obligatory prescriptions.Over the whole 
surface of contact between the body and the object it handles, power 
is introduced, fastening them to one another.It constitutes a body- 
weapon, body-tool, body-machine complex.One is as far as possible 
from those forms of subjection that demanded of the body only 
signs or products, forms of expression or the result of labour.
