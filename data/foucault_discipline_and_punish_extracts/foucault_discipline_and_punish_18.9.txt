This new object is the natural body, the bearer of forces and the seat 
of duration; it is the body susceptible to specified operations, which 
have their order, their stages, their internal conditions, their con¬ 
stituent elements.In becoming the target for new mechanisms 
of power, the body is offered up to new forms of knowledge.It is 
the body of exercise, rather than of speculative physics; a body 
manipulated by authority, rather than imbued with animal spirits; 
a body of useful training and not of rational mechanics, but one in 
which, by virtue of that very fact, a number of natural requirements 
and functional constraints are beginning to emerge.This is the body 
that Guibert discovered in his critique of excessively artificial move¬ 
ments.In the exercise that is imposed upon it and which it resists, 
the body brings out its essential correlations and spontaneously 
rejects the incompatible: ‘On entering most of our training schools, 
one sees all those unfortunate soldiers in constricting and forced 
attitudes, one sees all their muscles contracted, the circulation of their 
blood interrupted.
