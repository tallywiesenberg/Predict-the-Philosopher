..If we studied the intention of nature and the 
construction of the human body, we would find the position and 
the bearing that nature clearly prescribes for the soldier.The head 
must be erect, standing out from the shoulders, sitting perpendicuÂ¬ 
larly between them.It must be turned neither to left nor to right, 
because, in view of the correspondence between the vertebrae of the 
neck and the shoulder-blade to which they are attached, none of them 
may move in a circular manner without slightly bringing with it 
from the same side that it moves one of the shoulders and because, 
the body no longer being placed squarely, the soldier can no longer 
walk straight in front of him or serve as a point of alignment.
