right and the exclusive power of the sovereign and his judges. 
Ayrault supposed that this procedure (which was more or less 
established by the sixteenth century) originated in ‘the fear of the

uproar, shouting and cheering that the people usually indulge in, 
the fear that there would be disorder, violence, and outbursts against 
the parties, or even against the judges’; the king wished to show in 
this that the ‘sovereign power’ from which the right to punish 
derived could in no case belong to the ‘multitude’ (cf. Ayrault, 
LIII, chapters LXXII and LXIX). Before the justice of the sover¬ 
eign, all voices must be still. 

Yet, despite the use of secrecy, certain rules had to be obeyed in 
establishing the truth. Secrecy itself required that a rigorous model 
of penal truth be defined. A whole tradition dating from the Middle 
Ages and considerably developed by the great lawyers of the 
Renaissance laid down what the nature and the use of evidence 
might be. Even in the eighteenth century, it was still common to 
meet distinctions like the following: true, direct, or legitimate proof 
(that provided by witnesses, for example) and indirect, conjeictural, 
artificial proof (obtained by argument); or, again, manifest proof, 
considerable proof, imperfect or slight (Jousse, 660); or, again, 
‘urgent or necessary’ proof that did not allow one to doubt the 
truth of the deed (this was ‘full’ proof: thus two irreproachable wit¬ 
nesses affirming that they saw the accused, carrying an unsheathed 
and bloody sword, leave the place where, some time later, the body 
of the dead man was found with stab wounds); approximate or semi¬ 
full proof, which may be regarded as true as long as the accused does 
not destroy it with evidence to the contrary (the evidence of a single 
eye-witness or death threats preceding a murder); lastly, distant or 
'adminicule' clues, which consisted only of opinion (rumour, the 
flight of the suspect, his manner when questioned, etc. - Muyart de 
Vouglans, 1757, 345-7)- Now, these distinctions are not simply 
theoretical subtleties. They have an operational function. First, 
because each of these kinds of evidence, taken in isolation, may have 
a particular type of judicial effect: ‘full’ proof may lead to any 
sentence; ‘semi-full’ proof may lead to any of the 'peines afflictives’, 
or heavy penalties, except death; imperfect and slight clues are 
enough for the suspect to have a writ issued against him, to have 
the case deferred for further inquiry or to have a fine imposed on 
him. Secondly, because they are combined according to precise
