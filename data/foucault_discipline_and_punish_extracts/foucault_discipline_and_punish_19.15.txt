The school was divided into three classes.The 
first for those who had no notion of drawing; they were made to 
copy models, which were more or less difficult according to the 
abilities of each pupil.The second ‘for those who already have some 
principles’, or who had passed through the first class; they had to 
reproduce pictures ‘at sight, without tracing’, but considering only 
the drawing.In the third class, they learnt colouring and pastel 
drawing, and were introduced to the theory and practice of dyeing.The pupils performed individual tasks at regular intervals; each of 
these exercises, signed with the name of its author and date of 
execution, was handed in to the teacher; the best were rewarded; 
assembled together at the end of the year and compared, they made 
it possible to establish the progress, the present ability and the 
relative place of each pupil; it was then decided which of them could 
pass into the next class.
