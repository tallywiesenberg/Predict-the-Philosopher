A general book, kept by the teachers and 
their assistants, recorded from day to day the behaviour of the 
pupils and everything that happened in the school; it was periodically 
shown to an inspector (Gerspach, 1892).The Gobelins school is only one example of an important pheno¬ 
menon: the development, in the classical period, of a new technique 
for taking charge of the time of individual existences; for regulating 
the relations of time, bodies and forces; for assuring an accumula¬ 
tion of duration; and for turning to ever-increased profit or use the 
movement of passing time.How can one capitalize the time of 
individuals, accumulate it in each of them, in their bodies, in their 
forces or in their abilities, in a way that is susceptible of use and 
control.^ How can one organize profitable durations.^ The disciplines, 
which analyse space, break up and rearrange activities, must also be 
understood as machinery for adding up and capitalizing time.This 
was done in four ways, which emerge most clearly in military 
organization.I. Divide duration into successive or parallel segments, each of 
which must end at a specific time.
