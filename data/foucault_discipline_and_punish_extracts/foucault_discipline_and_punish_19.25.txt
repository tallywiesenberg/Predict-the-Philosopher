For example, isolate the period 
of training and the period of practice; do not mix the instruction of 
recruits and the exercise of veterans; open separate military schools 
for the armed service (in 1764, the creation of the Fcole Militaire in 
Paris, in 1776 the creation of twelve schools in the provinces);

Discipline 

recruit professional soldiers at the youngest possible age, take 
children, ‘have them adopted by the nation, and brought up in 
special schools’ (Servan, J., 456); teach in turn posture, marching, 
the handling of weapons, shooting, and do not pass to another 
activity until the first has been completely mastered: ‘One of the 
principal mistakes is to show a soldier every exercise at once’ 
(‘Reglement de 1743 ...’); in short, break down time into separate 
and adjusted threads.2.Organize these threads according to an 
analytical plan - successions of elements as simple as possible, 
combining according to increasing complexity.This presupposes 
that instruction should abandon the principle of analogical repeti¬ 
tion.In the sixteenth century, military exercise consisted above all 
in copying all or part of the action, and of generally increasing the 
soldier’s skill or strength;’ in the eighteenth century, the instruction 
of the ‘manual’ followed the principle of the ‘elementary’ and not of 
the ‘exemplary’: simple gestures - the position of the fingers, the 
bend of the leg, the movement of the arms - basic elements for useful 
actions that also provide a general training in strength, skill, 
docility.
