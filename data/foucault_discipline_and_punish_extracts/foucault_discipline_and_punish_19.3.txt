3.Finalize these temporal segments, decide on how long 
each will last and conclude it with an examination, which will have 
the triple function of showing whether the subject has reached the 
level required, of guaranteeing that each subject undergoes the same 
apprenticeship and of differentiating the abilities of each individual.When the sergeants, corporals, etc.‘entrusted with the task of 
instructing the others, are of the opinion that a particular soldier is 
ready to pass into the first class, they will present him first to the 
officers of their company, who will carefully examine him; if they 
do not find him sufficiently practised, they will refuse to admit him; 
if, on the other hand, the man presented seems to them to be ready, 
the said officers will themselves propose him to the commanding 
officer of the regiment, who will see him if he thinks it necessary, 
and will have him examined by the senior officers.The slightest 
mistakes will be enough to have him rejected, and no one will be 
able to pass from the second class to the first until he has undergone 
this first examination’ {Instruction par I'exercise de Vinfanterie, 14 
mai 1754).
