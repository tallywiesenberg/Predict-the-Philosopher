..The lance-corporals will 
be exercised every Sunday by the head of the section ...; the cor¬ 
porals and anspessades will be exercised every Tuesday afternoon 
by the sergeants and their company and these in turn on the after¬ 
noons of every second, twelfth and twenty-second day of each 
month by senior officers’ {Instruction _).It is this disciplinary time that was gradually imposed on peda¬ 
gogical practice - specializing the time of training and detaching it 
from the adult time, from the time of mastery; arranging different 
stages, separated from one another by graded examinations; drawing 
up programmes, each of which must take place during a particular 
stage and which involves exercises of increasing difficulty; qualifying 
individuals according to the way in which they progress through 
these series.For the ‘initiatory’ time of traditional training (an over¬ 
all time, supervised by the master alone, authorized by a single 
examination), disciplinary time had substituted its multiple and 
progressive series.
