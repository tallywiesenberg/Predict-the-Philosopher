(Demia, 19-20).Each stage in the combinatory of el¬ 
ements must be inscribed within a great temporal series, which is both 
a natural progress of the mind and a code for educative procedures.The ‘seriation’ of successive activities makes possible a whole 
investment of duration by power: the possibility of a detailed con¬ 
trol and a regular intervention (of differentiation, correction, 
punishment, elimination) in each moment of time; the possibility of 
characterizing, and therefore of using individuals according to the 
level in the series that they are moving through; the possibility of 
accumulating time and activity, of rediscovering them, totalized and 
usable in a final result, which is the ultimate capacity of an individual.Temporal dispersal is brought together to produce a profit, thus 
mastering a duration that would otherwise elude one’s grasp.Power 
is articulated directly onto time; it assures its control and guarantees 
its use.
