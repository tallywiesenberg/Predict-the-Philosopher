The disciplinary methods reveal a linear time whose moments are 
integrated, one upon another, and which is orientated towards a 
terminal, stable point; in short, an ‘evolutive’ time.But it must be 
recalled that, at the same moment, the administrative and economic 
techniques of control reveal a social time of a serial, orientated, 
cumulative type: the discovery of an evolution in terms of‘progress’, 
The disciplinary techniques reveal individual series: the discovery of 
an evolution in terms of ‘genesis’.These two great ‘discoveries’ 
of the eighteenth century - the progress of societies and the geneses 
of individuals - were perhaps correlative with the new techniques of 
power, and more specifically, with a new way of administering 
time and making it useful, by segmentation, seriation, synthesis and 
totalization.A macro- and a micro-physics of power made possible, 
not the Invention of history (it had long had no need of that), but 
the integration of a temporal, unitary, continuous, cumulative 
dimension in the exercise of controls and the practice of dominations.‘Evolutive’ historicity, as it was then constituted - and so profoundly 
that it is still self-evident for many today - is bound up with a mode
