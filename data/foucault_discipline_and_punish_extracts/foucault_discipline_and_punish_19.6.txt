No doubt it is as if the ‘history-remember¬ 
ing’ of the chronicles, genealogies, exploits, reigns and deeds had 
long been linked to a modality of power.With the new techniques 
of subjection, the ‘dynamics’ of continuous evolutions tends to re¬ 
place the ‘dynasties’ of solemn events.In any case, the small temporal continuum of individuality- 
genesis certainly seems to be, like the individuality-cell or the 
individuality-organism, an effect and an object of discipline.And, at 
the centre of this seriation of time, one finds a procedure that is, for 
it, what the drawing up of ‘tables’ was for the distribution of 
individuals and cellular segmentation, or, again, what 'manoeuvre’ 
was for the economy of activities and organic control.This proce¬ 
dure is ‘exercise’.
