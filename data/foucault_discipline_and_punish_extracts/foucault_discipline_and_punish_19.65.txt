Exercise is that technique by which one imposes 
on the body tasks that are both repetitive and different, but always 
graduated.By bending behaviour towards a terminal state, exercise 
makes possible a perpetual characterization of the individual either 
in relation to this term, in relation to other individuals, or in relation 
to a type of itinerary.It thus assures, in the form of continuity and 
constraint, a growth, an observation, a qualification.Before adoptÂ¬ 
ing this strictly disciplinary form, exercise had a long history: it is 
to be found in military, religious and university practices either as 
initiation ritual, preparatory ceremony, theatrical rehearsal or 
examination.Its linear, continuously progressive organization, its 
genetic development in time were, at least in the army and the 
school, introduced at a later date - and were no doubt of religious 
origin.
