In any case, the idea of an educational ‘programme’ that 
would follow the child to the end of his schooling and which would 
involve from year to year, month to month, exercises of increasing 
complexity, first appeared, it seems, in a religious group, the 
Brothers of the Common Life (cf.Meir, i6o ff).Strongly inspired 
by Ruysbroek and Rhenish mysticism, they transposed certain of 
the spiritual techniques to education - and to the education not only 
of clerks, but also of magistrates and merchants: the theme of a per¬ 
fection towards which the exemplary master guides the pupil became 
with them that of an authoritarian perfection of the pupils by the 
teacher; the ever-increasing rigorous exercises that the ascetic life 
proposed became tasks of increasing complexity that marked the 
gradual acquisition of knowledge and good behaviour; the striving

of the whole community towards salvation became the collective, 
permanent competition of individuals being classified in relation to 
one another.Perhaps it was these procedures of community life and 
salvation that were the first nucleus of methods intended to produce 
individually characterized, but collectively useful aptitudes.® In its 
mystical or ascetic form, exercise was a way of ordering earthly time 
for the conquest of salvation.It was gradually, in the history of the 
West, to change direction while preserving certain of its character¬ 
istics; it served to economize the time of life, to accumulate it in a 
useful form and to exercise power over men through the mediation 
of time arranged in this way.
