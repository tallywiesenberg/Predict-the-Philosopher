Exercise, having become an element 
in the political technology of the body and of duration, does not 
culminate in a beyond, but tends towards a subjection that has never 
reached its limit.The composition of forces 

‘Let us begin by destroying the old prejudice, according to which 
one believed one was increasing the strength of a troop by increasing 
its depth.All the physical laws of movement become chimeras when 
one wishes to adapt them to tactics.’® From the end of the seven¬ 
teenth century, the technical problem of infantry had been freed 
from the physical model of mass.In an army of pikes and muskets - 
slow, imprecise, practically incapable of selecting a target and taking 
aim - troops were used as a projectile, a wall or a fortress: ‘the 
formidable infantry of the army of Spain’; the distribution of soldiers 
in this mass was carried out above all according to their seniority 
and their bravery; at the centre, with the task of providing weight 
and volume, of giving density to the body, were the least experi¬ 
enced; in front, at the angles and on the flanks, were the bravest or 
reputedly most skilful soldiers.In the course of the classical period, 
one passed over to a whole set of delicate articulations.
