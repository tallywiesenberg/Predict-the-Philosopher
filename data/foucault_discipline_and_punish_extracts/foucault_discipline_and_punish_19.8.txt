The unit - 
regiment, battalion, section and, later, ‘division’- became a sort 
of machine with many parts, moving in relation to one another, in 
order to arrive at a configuration and to obtain a specific result.What were the reasons for this mutation?Some were economic: to 
make each individual useful and the training, maintenance, and 
arming of troops profitable; to give to each soldier, a precious unit.162

maximum efficiency.But these economic reasons could become 
determinant only with a technical transformation: the invention of 
the rifle:^' more accurate, more rapid than the musket, it gave 
greater value to the soldier’s skill; more capable of reaching a par¬ 
ticular target, it made it possible to exploit fire-power at an indivi¬ 
dual level; and, conversely, it turned every soldier into a possible 
target, requiring by the same token greater mobility; it involved 
therefore the disappearance of a technique of masses in favour of an 
art tLn distributed units and men along extended, relatively flexible, 
mobile lines.
