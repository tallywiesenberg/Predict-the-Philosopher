Hence the need to find a whole calculated practice of 
individual and collective dispositions, movements of groups or 
isolated elements, changes of position, of movement from one dis¬ 
position to another; in short, the need to invent a machinery whose 
principle would no longer be the mobile or immobile mass, but a 
geometry of divisible segments whose basic unity was the mobile 
soldier with his rifle;'^ and, no doubt, below the soldier himself, the 
minimal gestures, the elementary stages of actions, the fragments of 
spaces occupied or traversed.The same problems arose when it was a question of constituting 
a productive force whose effect had to be superior to the sum of 
elementary forces that composed it: ‘The combined working-day 
produces, relatively to an equal sum of working-days, a greater 
quantity of use-values, and, consequently, diminishes the labour¬ 
time necessary for the production of a given useful effect.Whether 
the combined working-day, in a given case, acquires this increased 
productive power, because it heightens the mechanical force of 
labour, or extends its sphere of action over a greater space, or con¬ 
tracts the field of production relatively to the scale of production, 
or at the critical moment sets large masses of labour to work... the 
special productive power of the combined working-day is, under 
all circumstances, the social productive power of labour, or the 
productive power of social labour.This power is due to cooperation 
itself’ (Marx, Capital, vol.i, 311-12).
