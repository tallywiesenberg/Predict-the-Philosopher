power of a squadron of cavalry, or the defensive power of a regi¬ 
ment of infantry, is essentially different from the sum of the offen¬

exerted by isolated workmen differs from the social force that is 
developed, when many hands take part simultaneously in one and

construct a machine whose effect will be maximized by the concerted 
articulation of the elementary parts of which it is composed.Disci¬ 
pline is no longer simply an art of distributing bodies, of extracting 
time from them and accumulating it, but of composing forces in 
order to obtain an efficient machine.
