The body of the condemned 

speaking, punitive practices had become more reticent.One no 
longer touched the body, or at least as little as possible, and then 
only to reach something other than the body itself.It might be 
objected that imprisonment, confinement, forced labour, penal 
servitude, prohibition from entering certain areas, deportation - 
which have occupied so important a place in modern penal systems - 
are ‘physical’ penalties: unlike fines, for example, they directly 
aflFect the body.But the punishment-body relation is not the same 
as it was in the torture during public executions.The body now 
serves as an instrument or intermediary: if one intervenes upon it 
to imprison it, or to make it work, it is in order to deprive the 
individual of a liberty that is regarded both as a right and as property.
