The body, according to this penality, is caught up in a system of 
constraints and privations, obligations and prohibitions.Physical 
pain, the pain of the body itself, is no longer the constituent element 
of the penalty.From being an art of unbearable sensations punish¬ 
ment has become an economy of suspended rights.If it is still 
necessary for the law to reach and manipulate the body of the con¬ 
vict, it will be at a distance, in the proper way, according to strict 
rules, and with a much ‘higher’ aim.As a result of this new restraint, 
a whole army of technicians took over from the executioner, the 
immediate anatomist of pain: warders, doctors, chaplains, psychia¬ 
trists, psychologists, educationalists; by their very presence near the 
prisoner, they sing the praises that the law needs: they reassure it 
that the body and pain are not the ultimate objects of its punitive 
action.
