Today a doctor must watch over those condemned to death, 
right up to the last moment - thus juxtaposing himself as the agent 
of welfare, as the alleviator of pain, with the official whose task it is 
to end life.This is worth thinking about.When the moment of 
execution approaches, the patients are injected with tranquillizers.A utopia of judicial reticence: take away life, but prevent the patient 
from feeling it; deprive the prisoner of all rights, but do not inflict 
pain; impose penalties free of all pain.Recourse to psycho-pharma¬ 
cology and to various physiological ‘disconnectors’, even if it is 
temporary, is a logical consequence of this ‘non-corporal’ penality.
