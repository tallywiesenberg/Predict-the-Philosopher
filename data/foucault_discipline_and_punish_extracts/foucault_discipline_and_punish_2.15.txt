The modern rituals of execution attest to this double process: the

its own rate: the same death for all - the execution no longer bears 
the specific mark of the crime or the social status of the criminal; a 
death that lasts only a moment - no torture must be added to it in

that affects life rather than the body.There are no longer any of 
those long processes in which death was both retarded by calculated 
interruptions and multiplied by a series of successive attacks.There 
are no longer any of those combinations of tortures that were 
organized for the killing of regicides, or of the kind advocated, at 
the beginning of the eighteenth century, by the anonymous author 
of Hanging not Punishment Enough (1701), by which the condemned 
man would be broken on the wheel, then flogged until he fainted, 
then hung up with chains, then finally left to die slowly of hunger.There are no longer any of those executions in which the condemned 
man was dragged along on a hurdle (to prevent his head smashing 
against the cobble-stones), in which his belly was opened up, his 
entrails quickly ripped out, so that he had time to see them, with his 
own eyes, being thrown on the fire; in which he was finally decapi¬ 
tated and his body quartered.^ The reduction of these ‘thousand 
deaths’ to strict capital punishment defines a whole new morality 
concerning the act of punishing.
