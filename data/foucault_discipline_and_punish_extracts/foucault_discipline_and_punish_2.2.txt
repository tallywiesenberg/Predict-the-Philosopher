As early as i7<5o, a hanging machine had been tried out in 
England (for the execution of Lord Ferrer).It made use of a support, 
which opened under the feet of the condemned man, thus avoiding 
slow deaths and the altercations that occurred between victim and 
executioner.It was improved and finally adopted in 1783, the same 
year in which the traditional procession from Newgate to Tyburn 
was abolished, and in which the opportunity offered by the rebuild¬ 
ing of the prison, after the Gordon Riots, was used to set up the 
scaffolds in Newgate itself (see Hibbert, 85-6).The celebrated 
article 3 of the French Code of 1791 - ‘Every man condemned to 
death will have his head cut off’ — bears this triple signification: an 
equal death for all (‘Crimes of the same kind will be punished by the 
same kind of punishment, whatever the rank and state of the guilty 
man may be,’ in the words of the motion proposed by Guillotin and 
passed on i December 1789); one death per condemned man, 
obtained by a single blow, without recourse to those ‘long and 
consequently cruel’ methods of execution, such as the gallows.12

man alone, since decapitation, the capital punishment of the nobility, 
was the least shaming for the criminal’s family (Le Peletier, 720).
