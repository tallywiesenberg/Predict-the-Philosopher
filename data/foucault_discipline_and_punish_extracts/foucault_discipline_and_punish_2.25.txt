The guillotine, first used in March 1792, was the perfect vehicle for 
these principles.Death was reduced to a visible, but instantaneous 
event.Contact between the law, or those who carry it out, and the 
body of the criminal, is reduced to a split second.There is no 
physical confrontation; the executioner need be no more than a 
meticulous watchmaker.â€˜Experience and reason demonstrate that 
the method used in the past to cut off the head of a criminal exposed 
him to a torture more frightful than the loss of life alone, which is 
the express intention of the law; the execution should therefore be 
carried out in a single moment and with a single blow; examples 
show how difficult it is to achieve this.
