The 
guillotine takes life almost without touching the body, just as prison 
deprives of liberty or a fine reduces wealth.It is intended to apply 
the law not so much to a real body capable of feeling pain as to a 
juridical subject, the possessor, among other rights, of the right to 
exist.It had to have the abstraction of the law itself.No doubt something of the old public execution was, for a time, 
superimposed in France on the sobriety of the new method.ParriÂ¬ 
cides - and the regicides who were regarded as such - were led to 
the scaffold wearing a black veil; there, until 1832, one of their 
hands was cut off.
