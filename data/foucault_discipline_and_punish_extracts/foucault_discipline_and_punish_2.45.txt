This was a common enough notion at the time.For the 
parricide one should ‘construct an iron cage or dig an impenetrable 
dungeon that would serve him as an eternal retreat’ - De Molene, 
275-7-) The last vestige of the great public execution was its annul¬ 
ment: a drapery to hide a body.Benoit, triply infamous (his 
mother’s murderer, a homosexual, an assassin), was the first of the 
parricides not to have a hand cut off: ‘As the sentence was being 
read, he stood on the scaffold supported by the executioners.It was 
a horrible sight; wrapped in a large white shroud, his face covered 
with black crepe, the parricide escaped the gaze of the silent crowd, 
and beneath these mysterious and gloomy clothes, life was mani¬ 
fested only by frightful cries, which soon expired under the knife’ 
{Gazette des trihunaux, 30 August 1832).At the beginning of the nineteenth century, then, the great 
spectacle of physical punishment disappeared; the tortured body 
was avoided; the theatrical representation of pain was excluded from 
punishment.
