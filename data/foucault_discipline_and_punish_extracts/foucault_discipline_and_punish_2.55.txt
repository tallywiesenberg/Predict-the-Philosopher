Paradoxically, England 
was one of the countries most loath to see the disappearance of the 
public execution: perhaps because of the role of model that the 
institution of the jury, public hearings and respect of habeas corpus 
had given to her criminal law; above all, no doubt, because she did 
not wish to diminish the rigour of her penal laws during the great 
social disturbances of the years 1780-1820.For a long time Romilly, 
Mackintosh and Fowell Buxton failed in their attempts to attenuate 
the multiplicity and severity of the penalties laid down by English 
law - that ‘horrible butchery’, as Rossi described it.Its severity (in 
fact, the juries regarded the penalties laid down as excessive and 
were consequently more lenient in their application) had even 
increased: in 1760, Blackstone had listed 160 capital crimes in 
English legislation, while by 1819 there were 223.One should also 
take into account the advances and retreats that the process as a 
whole underwent between 1760 and 1840; the rapidity of reform

France under the Constituent Assembly, then the retreat at the 
time of the counter-revolutions in Europe and the great social fear 
of the years 1820-48; more or less temporary changes introduced by 
emergency courts or laws; the gap between the laws and the real 
practice of the courts (which was by no means a faithful reflection 
of the state of legislation).All these factors account for the irregu¬ 
larity of the transformation that occurred at the turn of the century.
