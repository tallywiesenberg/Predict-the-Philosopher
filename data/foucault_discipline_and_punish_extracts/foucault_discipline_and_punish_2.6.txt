It should be added that, although most of the changes had been 
achieved by 1840, although the mechanisms of punishment had by 
then assumed their new way of functioning, the process was far 
from complete.The reduction in the use of torture was a tendency 
that was rooted in the great transformation of the years 1760-1840, 
but it did not end there; it can be said that the practice of the public 
execution haunted our penal system for a long time and still haunts 
it today.In France, the guillotine, that machine for the production 
of rapid and discreet deaths, represented a new ethic of legal death.But the Revolution had immediately endowed it with a great theatriÂ¬ 
cal ritual.For years it provided a spectacle.
