It had to be removed to 
the Barri^re Saint-Jacques; the open cart was replaced by a closed 
carriage; the condemned man was hustled from the vehicle straight 
to the scaffold; hasty executions were organized at unexpected times.In the end, the guillotine had to be placed inside prison walls and 
made inaccessible to the public (after the execution of Weidmann 
in 1939), by blocking the streets leading to the prison in which the 
scaffold was hidden, and in which the execution would take place in 
secret (the execution of Buffet and Bontemps at the Sante in 1972).Witnesses who described the scene could even be prosecuted, thereÂ¬ 
by ensuring that the execution should cease to be a spectacle and 
remain a strange secret between the law and those it condemns.One 
has only to point out so many precautions to realize that capital 
punishment remains fundamentally, even today, a spectacle that 
must actually be forbidden.Similarly, the hold on the body did not entirely disappear in the 
mid-nineteenth century.
