What would a non-corporal punishment be.^ 

There remains, therefore, a trace of ‘torture’ in the modern 
mechanisms of criminal justice — a trace that has not been entirely 
overcome, but which is enveloped, increasingly, by the non-corporal 
nature of the penal system.The reduction in penal severity in the last 200 years is a pheno¬ 
menon with which legal historians are well acquainted.But, for a 
long time, it has been regarded in an overall way as a quantitative 
phenomenon: less cruelty, less pain, more kindness, more respect, 
more ‘humanity’.In fact, these changes are accompanied by a dis¬ 
placement in the very object of the punitive operation.Is there a 
diminution of intensity.^ Perhaps.
