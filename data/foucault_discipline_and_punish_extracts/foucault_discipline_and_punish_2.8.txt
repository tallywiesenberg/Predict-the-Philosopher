There is certainly a change of 
objective.If the penality in its most severe forms no longer addresses itself 
to the body, on what does it lay hold.^ The answer of the theoreti¬ 
cians - those who, about 1760, opened up a new period that is not 
yet at an end - is simple, almost obvious.It seems to be contained 
in the question itself: since it is no longer the body, it must be the 
soul.The expiation that once rained down upon the body must be 
replaced by a punishment that acts in depth on the heart, the 
thoughts, the will, the inclinations.Mably formulated the principle 
once and for all: ‘Punishment, if I may so put it, should strike the 
soul rather than the body’ (Mably, 326).
