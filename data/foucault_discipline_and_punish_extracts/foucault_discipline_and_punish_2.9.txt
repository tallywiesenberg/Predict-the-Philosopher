Is this any more than a mere theoretical assertion, contradicted 
by penal practice.^ Such a conclusion would be over-hasty.It is true 
that, today, to punish is not simply a matter of converting a soul; 
but Mablyâ€™s principle has not remained a pious wish.Its effects can 
be felt throughout modern penality.To begin with, there is a substitution of objects.By this I do not 
mean that one has suddenly set about punishing other crimes.
