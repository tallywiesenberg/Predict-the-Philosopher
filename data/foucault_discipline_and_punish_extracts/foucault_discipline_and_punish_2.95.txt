No 
doubt the definition of offences, the hierarchy of their seriousness, 
the margins of indulgence, what was tolerated in fact and what was 
legally permitted - all this has considerably changed over the last 
200 years; many crimes have ceased to be so because they were 
bound up with a certain exercise of religious authority or a par¬ 
ticular type of economic activity; blasphemy has lost its status as a 
crime; smuggling and domestic larceny some of their seriousness.But these displacements are perhaps not the most important fact: 
the division between the permitted and the forbidden has preserved 
a certain constancy from one century to another.On the other 
hand, ‘crime’, the object with which penal practice is concerned, has 
profoundly altered: the quality, the nature, in a sense the substance 
of which the punishable element is made, rather than its formal 
definition.Undercover of the relative stability of the law, a mass of 
subtle and rapid changes has occurred.Certainly the ‘crimes’ and 
‘offences’ on which judgement is passed are juridical objects defined 
by the code, but judgement is also passed on the passions, instincts, 
anomalies, infirmities, maladjustments, effects of environment or 
heredity; acts of aggression are punished, so also, through them, is 
aggressivity; rape, but at the same time perversions; murders, but 
also drives and desires.
