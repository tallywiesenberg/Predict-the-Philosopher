reasons; first, because the confession constituted so strong a proof

that there was scarcely any need to add others, or to enter the diffi¬ 
cult and dubious combinatory of clues; the confession, provided it 
was obtained in the correct manner, almost discharged the prosecu¬ 
tion of the obligation to provide further evidence (in any case, the 
most difficult evidence). Secondly, the only way that this procedure 
might use all its unequivocal authority, and become a real victory 
over the accused, the only way in which the truth might exert all its 
power, was for the criminal to accept responsibility for his own 
crime and himself sign what had been skilfully and obscurely 
constructed by the preliminary investigation. ‘It is not enough’, as 
Ayrault, who did not care for these secret procedures, remarked, 
‘that wrong-doers be justly punished. They must if possible judge 
and condemn themselves’ (Ayrault, i. I, chapter 14). Within the 
crime reconstituted by writing, the criminal who confessed came to 
play the role of living truth. The confession, an act of the criminal, 
responsible and speaking subject, was the complement to the written, 
secret preliminary investigation. Hence the importance that all this 
procedure of an inquisitorial tyjje accorded to the confession. 

Hence, too, the ambiguities of its role. On the one hand, an 
attempt was made to introduce it into the general arithmetic of 
evidence; it was stressed that it was no more than one proof among 
many. It was not the evidentia rev, nor was it the strongest of the 
proofs, it was not in itself enough to bring conviction, it had to be 
accompanied by additional, circumstantial evidence; for it is a well- 
known fact that the accused sometimes declare themselves to be 
guilty of crimes that they have not committed; the examining magis¬ 
trate had therefore to carry out additional investigations if he 
possessed no more than the confession of the accused. But, on the 
other hand, the confession had priority over any other kind of 
evidence. To a certain extent, it transcended all other evidence; an 
element in the calculation of the truth, it was also the act by which 
the accused accepted the charge and recognized its truth; it trans¬ 
formed an investigation carried out without him into a voluntary 
affirmation. Through the confession, the accused himself took part 
in the ritual of producing penal truth. As medieval law put it, the 
confession ‘renders the thing notorious and manifest’. To this first 
ambiguity was added a second; as a particularly strong proof, 
requiring for a conviction only a few additional clues, thus reducing
