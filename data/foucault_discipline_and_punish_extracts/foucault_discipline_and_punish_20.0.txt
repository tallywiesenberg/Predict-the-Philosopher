Guibert describes 
the soldier in the following way: ‘When he is under arms, he occu¬ 
pies two feet along his greatest diameter, that is to say, taking him 
from one end to the other, and about one foot in his greatest thick¬ 
ness taken from the chest to the shoulders, to which one must add an 
interval of a foot between him and the next man; this gives two feet 
in all directions per soldier and indicates that a troop of infantry in 
battle occupies, either in its front or in its depth, as many steps as it 
has ranks’ (Guibert, 27).This is a functional reduction of the body.But it is also an insertion of this body-segment in a whole ensemble 
over which it is articulated.The soldier whose body has been trained 
to function part by part for particular operations must in turn form 
an element in a mechanism at another level.The soldiers will be 
instructed first ‘one by one, then two by two, then in greater 
numbers.
