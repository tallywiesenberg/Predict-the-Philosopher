each must be adjusted to the time of the others in such a way that the 
maximum quantity of forces may be extracted from each and com¬ 
bined with the optimum result.Thus Servan dreamt of a military 
machine that would cover the whole territory of the nation and in 
which each individual would be occupied without interruption but 
in a different way according to the evolutive segment, the generic 
sequence in which he finds himself.Military life would begin in 
childhood, when young children would be taught the profession of 
arms in ‘military manors’; it would end in these same manors when 
the veterans, right up to their last day, would teach the children, 
exercise the recruits, preside over the soldiers’ exercises, supervise 
them when they were carrying out works in the public interest, and 
finally make order reign in the country, when the troops were fight¬ 
ing at the frontiers.There is not a single moment of life from which 
one cannot extract forces, providing one knows how to differentiate 
it and combine it with others.
