From the master of discipline to him who is 
subjected to it the relation is one of signalization: it is a question not 
of understanding the injunction but of perceiving the signal and 
reacting to it immediately, according to a more or less artificial, 
prearranged code.Place the bodies in a little world of signals to each 
of which is attached a single, obligatory response; it is a technique 
of training, of dressage, that ‘despotically excludes in everything 
the least representation, and the smallest murmur’; the dis¬ 
ciplined soldier ‘begins to obey whatever he is ordered to do; his 
obedience is prompt and blind; an appearance of indocility, the least 
delay would be a crime’ (Boussanelle, 2).The training of school- 
children was to be carried out in the same way: few words, no 
explanation, a total silence interrupted only by signals - bells, clap¬ 
ping of hands, gestures, a mere glance from the teacher, or that little 
wooden apparatus used by the Brothers of the Christian Schools; it 
was called par excellence the ‘Signal’ and it contained in its mechanical 
brevity both the technique of command and the morality of obedi¬ 
ence.‘The first and principal use of the signal is to attract at once 
the attention of all the pupils to the teacher and to make them 
attentive to what he wishes to impart to them.Thus, whenever he 
wishes to attract the attention of the children, and to bring the 
exercise to an end, he will strike the signal once.
