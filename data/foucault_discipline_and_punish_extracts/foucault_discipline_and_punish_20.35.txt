.To make a sign to a pupil to repeat when he has read 
badly or mispronounced a letter, a syllable or a word, he will strike 
the signal twice in rapid succession.If, after the sign had been made 
two or three times, the pupil who is reading does not find and repeat 
the word that he has badly read or mispronounced - because he has 
read several words beyond it before being called to order - the 
teacher will strike three times in rapid succession, as a sign to him to 
begin to read farther back; and he will continue to make the sign 
till the pupil finds the word which he has said incorrectlyâ€™ (La Salle, 
Conduite ... 137-8; cf.also Demia, 21).The mutual improvement 
school was to exploit still further this control of behaviour by the 
system of signals to which one had to react immediately.
