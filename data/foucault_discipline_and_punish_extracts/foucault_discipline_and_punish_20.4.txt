Even 
verbal orders were to function as elements of signalization: ‘Enter 
your benches.At the word enter, the children bring their right 
hands down on the table with a resounding thud and at the same 
time put one leg into the bench; at the words ^our benches they put 
the other leg in and sit down opposite their slates ... Take your 
slates.At the word take, the children, with their right hands, take 
hold of the string by which the slate is suspended from the nail 
before them, and, with their left hands, they grasp the slate in the 
middle; at the word slates, they unhook it and place it on the table’.’® 
To sum up, it might be said that discipline creates out of the 
bodies it controls four types of individuality, or rather an individual¬ 
ity that is endowed with four characteristics: it is cellular (by the 
play of spatial distribution), it is organic (by the coding of activities), 
it is genetic (by the accumulation of time), it is combinatory (by the 
composition of forces).And, in doing so, it operates four great 
techniques; it draws up tables; it prescribes movements; it imposes 
exercises; lastly, in order to obtain the combination of forces, it 
arranges ‘tactics’.Tactics, the art of constructing, with located 
bodies, coded activities and trained aptitudes, mechanisms in which 
the product of the various forces is increased by their calculated 
combination are no doubt the highest form of disciplinary practice.
