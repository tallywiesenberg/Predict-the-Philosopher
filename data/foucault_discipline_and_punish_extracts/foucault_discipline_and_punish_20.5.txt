The spectacle of the scaffold 


to the minimum the work of investigation and the mechanics of 
demonstration, the confession was therefore highly valued; every 
possible coercion would be used to obtain it. But, although it had 
to be, in the procedure, the living and oral counterpart of the 
written preliminary investigation, although it had to be its reply, 
its authentication, as it were, on the part of the accused, it had to be 
surrounded by guarantees and formalities. It preserved something 
of a transaction; that is why it had to be ‘spontaneous’, why it had 
to be formulated before the competent court, why it had to be made 
in full consciousness, why it should not concern impossible things, 
etc.* Through the confession, the accused committed himself to the 
procedure; he signed the truth of the preliminary investigation. 

This double ambiguity of the confession (an element of proof and 
the counterpart of preliminary investigation; the effect of constraint 
and a semi-voluntary transaction) explains the two great means used 
by classical criminal law to obtain it: the oath that the accused was 
asked to make before his interrogatory (and therefore under threat 
of perjury before both human and divine justice; and, at the same 
time, a ritual act of commitment); judicial torture (physical violence 
to obtain truth, which, in any case, had then to be repeated before 
the judges, as a ‘spontaneous’ confession, if it were to constitute 
proof). At the end of the eighteenth century, torture was to be 
denounced as a survival of the barbarities of another age: the mark 
of a savagery that was denounced as ‘Gothic’. It is true that the 
practice of torture is of ancient origin: it goes back at least as far 
as the Inquisition, of course, and probably to the torture of slaves. 
But it did not figure in classical law as a survival or defect. It occu¬ 
pied a strict place in a complex penal mechanism, in which the 
procedure of an inquisitorial type was reinforced with elements of 
the accusatory system; in which the written demonstration required 
an oral correlative; in which the techniques of proof administered 
by the magistrates were mingled with the methods of the ordeal to 
which the accused was challenged; in which he was called upon — if 
necessary by the most violent persuasion - to play the role of 
voluntary partner in the procedure; in which it was a question, in 
short, of producing truth by a mechanism consisting of two ele¬ 
ments - that of the investigation carried out in secret by the judicial 
authority and that of the act ritually performed by the accused. The
