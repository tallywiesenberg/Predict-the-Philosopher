But it 
must not be forgotten that ‘politics’ has been conceived as a con¬ 
tinuation, if not exactly and directly of war, at least of the military 
model as a fundamental means of preventing civil disorder.Politics, 
as a technique of internal peace and order, sought to implement the 
mechanism of the perfect army, of the disciplined mass, of the docile, 
useful troop, of the regiment in camp and in the field, on manoeu¬ 
vres and on exercises.In the great eighteenth-century states, the 
army guaranteed civil peace no doubt because it was a real force, 
an ever-threatening sword, but also because it was a technique and a 
body of knowledge that could project their schema over the social 
body.If there is a politics-war series that passes through strategy, 
there is an army-politics series that passes through tactics.It is 
strategy that makes it possible to understand warfare as a way of 
conducting politics between states; it is tactics that makes it possible 
to understand the army as a principle for maintaining the absence of 
warfare in civil society.
