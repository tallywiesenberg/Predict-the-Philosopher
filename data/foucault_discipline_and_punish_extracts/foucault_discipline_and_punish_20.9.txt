The chief function of 
the disciplinary power is to ‘train’, rather than to select and to levy; 
or, no doubt, to train in order to levy and select all the more.It does 
not link forces together in order to reduce them; it seeks to bind them 
together in such a way as to multiply and use them.Instead of bend¬ 
ing ail its subjects into a single uniform mass, it separates, analyses, 
differentiates, carries its procedures of decomposition to the point of 
necessary and sufficient single units.It ‘trains’ the moving, confused, 
useless multitudes of bodies and forces into a multiplicity of indivi¬ 
dual elements - small, separate cells, organic autonomies, genetic 
identities and continuities, combinatory segments.Discipline 
‘makes’ individuals; it is the specific technique of a power that 
regards individuals both as objects and as instruments of its exercise.
