It is not a triumphant power, which because of its own excess can 
pride itself on its omnipotence; it is a modest, suspicious power, 
which functions as a calculated, but permanent economy.These 
are humble modalities, minor procedures, as compared with the 
majestic rituals of sovereignty or the great apparatuses of the state.And it is precisely they that were gradually to invade the major 
forms, altering their mechanisms and imposing their procedures.The 
legal apparatus was not to escape this scarcely secret invasion.The 
success of disciplinary power derives no doubt from the use of simple 
instruments; hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and 
their combination in a procedure that is specific to it, the examination.
