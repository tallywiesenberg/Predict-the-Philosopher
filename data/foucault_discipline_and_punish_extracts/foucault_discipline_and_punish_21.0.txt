Hierarchical observation 

The exercise of discipline presupposes a mechanism that coerces by 
means of observation; an apparatus in which the techniques that

make it possible to see induce effects of power, and in which, 
conversely, the means of coercion make those on whom they are 
applied clearly visible.Slowly, in the course of the classical age, we 
see the construction of those ‘observatories’ of human multiplicity 
for which the history of the sciences has so little good to say.Side 
by side with the major technology of the telescope, the lens and the 
light beam, which were an integral part of the new physics and cos¬ 
mology, there were the minor techniques of multiple and intersect¬ 
ing observations, of eyes that must see without being seen; using 
techniques of subjection and methods of exploitation, an obscure 
art of light and the visible was secretly preparing a new knowledge 
of man.These ‘observatories’ had an almost ideal model: the military 
camp - the short-lived, artificial city, built and reshaped almost at 
will; the seat of a power that must be all the stronger, but also all 
the more discreet, all the more effective and on the alert in that it is 
exercised over armed men.In the perfect camp, all power would be 
exercised solely through exact observation; each gaze would form a 
part of the overall functioning of power.
