Torture 


body of the accused, the speaking and, if necessary, suffering body, 
assured the interlocking of these two mechanisms; that is why, 
until the classical system of punishment was re-examined from top 
to bottom, there were so few r^ical criticisms of torture (the most 
famous being Nicolas’s Si la tohure est im moyen a verifier les crimes 
of 1682). Much more frequent were simple recommendations of 
prudence: ‘Judicial torture is a dangerous means of arriving at 
knowledge of the truth; that is why judges must not resort to it with¬ 
out due consideration. Nothing is more equivocal. There are guilty 
men who have enough firmness to hide a true crime... and innocent 
victims who are made to confess crimes of which they were not 
guilty’ (Ferriere, 612). 

On this basis one may see the functioning of judicial torture, or 
interrogation under torture, as a torture of the truth. To begin with, 
judicial torture was not a way of obtaining the truth at all costs; it 
was not the unrestrained torture of modern interrogations; it was 
certainly cruel, but it was not savage. It was a regulated practice, 
obeying a well-defined procedure; the various stages, their duration, 
the instruments used, the length of ropes and the heaviness of the 
weights used, the number of interventions made by the interrogating 
magistrate, all this was, according to the different local practices, 
carefully codified (In 1729, Aguesseau ordered an investigation into 
the means and rules of torture used in France. For a summary of the 
findings, cf. Joly de Fleury, 322-8.) Torture was a strict judicial 
game. And, as such, it was linked to the old tests or trials - ordeals, 
judicial duels, judgements of God - that were practised in accusatory 
procedures long before the techniques of the Inquisition. Something 
of the joust survived, between the judge who ordered the judicial 
torture and the suspect who was tortured; the ‘patient’ - this is the 
term used to designate the victim - was subjected to a series of trials, 
graduated in severity, in which he succeeded if he ‘held out’, or 
failed if he confessed. (The first degree of torture was the sight of 
the instruments. In the case of children or of persons over the age 
of seventy, one did not go beyond this stage.) But the examining 
magistrate did not employ torture without himself taking certain 
risks (apart, that is, from the danger of causing the suspect’s death); 
he had a stake in the game, namely, the evidence that he had already 
collected; for the rule was that if the accused ‘held out’ and did not
