The old, traditional square 
plan was considerably refined in innumerable new projects.The 
geometry of the paths, the number and distribution of the tents, 
the orientation of their entrances, the disposition of files and ranks 
were exactly defined; the network of gazes that supervised one 
another was laid down: â€˜In the parade ground, five lines are drawn 
up, the first is sixteen feet from the second; the others are eight feet 
from one another; and the last is eight feet from the arms depots.The arms depots are ten feet from the tents of the junior officers, 
immediately opposite the first tentpole.A company street is fifty-one 
feet wide..
