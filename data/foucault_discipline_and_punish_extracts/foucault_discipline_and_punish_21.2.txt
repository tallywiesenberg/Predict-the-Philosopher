The camp was to the rather shameful art of surveillance what the 
dark room was to the great science of optics.A whole problematic then develops: that of an architecture that 
is no longer built simply to be seen (as with the ostentation of 
palaces), or to observe the external space (cf.the geometry of forÂ¬ 
tresses), but to permit an internal, articulated and detailed control - 
to render visible those who are inside it; in more general terms, an 
architecture that would operate to transform individuals: to act on 
those it shelters, to provide a hold on their conduct, to carry the 
effects of power right to them, to make it possible to know them, to 
alter them.Stones can make people docile and knowable.The old 
simple schema of confinement and enclosure - thick walls, a heavy 
gate that prevents entering or leaving - began to be replaced by the 
calculation of openings, of filled and empty spaces, passages and 
transparencies.
