In this way the hospital building was gradually 
organized as an instrument of medical action: it was to allow a better 
observation of patients, and therefore a better calibration of their 
treatment; the form of the buildings, by the careful separation of the 
patients, was to prevent contagions; lastly, the ventilation and the 
air that circulated around each bed was to prevent the deleterious 
vapours from stagnating around the patient, breaking down his 
humours and spreading the disease by their immediate effects.The 
hospital - which was to be built in the second half of the century 
and for which so many plans were drawn up after the Hotel-Dieu 
was burnt down for the second time - was no longer simply the 
roof under which penury and imminent death took shelter; it was, 
in its very materiality, a therapeutic operator.Similarly, the school building was to be a mechanism for training.It was as a pedagogical machine that Paris-Duverney conceived the 
ficole Militaire, right down to the minute details that he had imposed 
on the architect, Gabriel.Train vigorous bodies, the imperative of 
health; obtain competent officers, the imperative of qualification; 
create obedient soldiers, the imperative of politics; prevent deÂ¬ 
bauchery and homosexuality, the imperative of morality.
