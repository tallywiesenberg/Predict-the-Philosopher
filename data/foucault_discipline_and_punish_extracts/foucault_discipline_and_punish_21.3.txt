A fourfold 
reason for establishing sealed compartments between individuals, 
but also apertures for continuous surveillance.The very building 
of the £cole was to be an apparatus for observation; the rooms were

The means of correct training 


distributed along a corridor like a series of small cells; at regular 
intervals, an officer’s quarters were situated, so that ‘every ten pupils 
had an officer on each side’; the pupils were confined to their cells 
throughout the night; and Paris had insisted that ‘a window be 
placed on the corridor wall of each room from chest-level to within 
one or two feet of the ceiling.Not only is it pleasant to have such 
windows, but one would venture to say that it is useful, in several 
respects, not to mention the disciplinary reasons that may deter¬ 
mine this arrangement’ (quoted in Laulan, 117-18).In the dining¬ 
rooms was ‘a slightly raised platform for the tables of the inspectors 
of studies, so that they may see all the tables of the pupils of their 
divisions during meals’; latrines had been installed with half-doors, 
so that the supervisor on duty could see the head and legs of the 
pupils, and also with side walls sufficiently high ‘that those inside 
cannot see one another’.* This infinitely scrupulous concern with 
surveillance is expressed in the architecture by innumerable petty 
mechanisms.
