These mechanisms can only be seen as unimportant 
if one forgets the role of this instrumentation, minor but flawless, 
in the progressive objectification and the ever more subtle partitionÂ¬ 
ing of individual behaviour.The disciplinary institutions secreted 
a machinery of control that functioned like a microscope of conduct; 
the fine, analytical divisions that they created formed around men 
an apparatus of observation, recording and training.How was one 
to subdivide the gaze in these observation machines.^ How was one 
to establish a network of communications between themi* How was 
one so to arrange things that a homogeneous, continuous power 
would result from their calculated multiplicity.^ 

The perfect disciplinary apparatus would make it possible for a 
single gaze to see everything constantly.A central point would be 
both the source of light illuminating everything, and a locus of 
convergence for everything that must be known: a perfect eye that 
nothing would escape and a centre towards which all gazes would be 
turned.This is what Ledoux had imagined when he built Arc-et- 
Senans; all the buildings were to be arranged in a circle, opening on 
the inside, at the centre of which a high construction was to house 
the administrative functions of management, the policing functions 
of surveillance, the economic functions of control and checking, the 
religious functions of encouraging obedience and work; from here

all orders would come, all activities would be recorded, all offences 
perceived and judged; and this would be done immediately with no 
other aid than an exact geometry.
