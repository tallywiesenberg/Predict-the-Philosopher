Among all the reasons for the 
prestige that was accorded in the second half of the eighteenth 
century, to circular architecture, one must no doubt include the fact 
that it expressed a certain political utopia.But, the disciplinary gaze did, in fact, need relays.The pyramid 
was able to fulfil, more efficiently than the circle, two requirements: 
to be complete enough to form an uninterrupted network - con¬ 
sequently the possibility of multiplying its levels, and of distributing 
them over the entire surface to be supervised; and yet to be discreet 
enough not to weigh down with an inert mass on the activity to be 
disciplined, and not to act as a brake or an obstacle to it; to be 
integrated into the disciplinary mechanism as a function that in¬ 
creases its possible effects.It had to be broken down into smaller 
elements, but in order to increase its productive function: specify 
the surveillance and make it functional.This was the problem of the great workshops and factories, in 
which a new type of surveillance was organized.
