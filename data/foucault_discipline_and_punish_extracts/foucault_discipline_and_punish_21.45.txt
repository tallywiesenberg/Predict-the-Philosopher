It was different 
from the one practised in the regimes of the manufactories, which 
had been carried out from the outside by inspectors, entrusted with 
the task of applying the regulations; what was now needed was an 
intense, continuous supervision; it ran right through the labour 
process; it did not bear - or not only - on production (the nature 
and quantity of raw materials, the type of instruments used, the 
dimensions and quality of the products); it also took into account 
the activity of the men, their skill, the way they set about their tasks, 
their promptness, their zeal, their behaviour.But it was also different 
from the domestic supervision of the master present beside his 
workers and apprentices; for it was carried out by clerks, supervisors 
and foremen.As the machinery of production became larger and 
more complex, as the number of workers and the division of labour 
increased, supervision became ever more necessary and more diffi¬ 
cult.It became a special function, which had nevertheless to form 
an integral part of the production process, to run parallel to it 
throughout its entire length.A specialized personnel became indis¬ 
pensable, constantly present and distinct from the workers: ‘In the 
large factory, everything is regulated by the clock.
