treated strictly and harshly.The clerks, who are used to treating 
them with an air of superiority and command, which is really 
necessary with the multitude, treat them with severity or contempt; 
hence these workers either cost more or leave the factory soon after 
arrival’ {Encyclopidie, article on ‘Manufacture’).But, although the 
workers preferred a framework of a guild type to this new regime 
of surveillance, the employers saw that it was indissociable from the 
system of industrial production, private property and profit.At the 
scale of a factory, a great iron-works or a mine, ‘the objects of 
expenditure are so multiplied, that the slightest dishonesty on each 
object would add up to an immense fraud, which would not only 
absorb the profits, but would lead to a loss of capital... the slightest 
incompetence, if left unnoticed and therefore repeated each day, may 
prove fatal to the enterprise to the extent of destroying it in a very 
short time’; hence the fact that only agents, directly dependent on 
the owner, and entrusted with this task alone would be able to see 
‘that not a sou is spent uselessly, that not a moment of the day is 
lost’; their role would be ‘to supervise the workers, to inspect all the 
places of work, to inform the directors of everything that takes 
place’ (Cournol).Surveillance thus becomes a decisive economic 
operator both as an internal part of the production machinery and 
as a specific mechanism in the disciplinary power.
