‘The work of 
directing, superintending and adjusting becomes one of the functions 
of capital, from the moment that the labour under the control of 
capital, becomes cooperative.Once a function of capital, it requires 
special characteristics’ (Marx, Capital, vol.i, 313).The same movement was to be found in the reorganization of 
elementary teaching: the details of surveillance were specified and 
it was integrated into the teaching relationship.The development 
of the parish schools, the increase in the number of their pupils, the 
absence of methods for regulating simultaneously the activity of a 
whole class, and the disorder and confusion that followed from this 
made it necessary to work out a system of supervision.
