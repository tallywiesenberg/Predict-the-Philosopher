In order to 
help the teacher, Batencour selected from among the best pupils a 
whole series of ‘officers’ - intendants, observers, monitors, tutors, 
reciters of prayers, writing officers, receivers of ink, almoners and 
visitors.The roles thus defined were of two kinds: the first involved 
material tasks (distributing ink and paper, giving alms to the poor.175 



Discipline 


reading spiritual texts on feast days, etc.); the second involved sur¬ 
veillance: the ‘observers must record who left his bench, who was 
talking, who did not have his rosary, or Book of Hours, who did not 
comport himself properly at mass, who committed an impure act, 
who indulged in idle talk or was unruly in the street’; the ‘admoni- 
tors’ were placed in charge of those ‘who talk or hum when studying 
their lessons and those who will not write and who waste their time 
in play’; the ‘visitors’ called on the families of pupils who had been 
absent or who had committed serious oifences.The ‘intendants’ 
supervised all the other officers.
