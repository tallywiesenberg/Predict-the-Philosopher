Only the ‘tutors’ had a pedagogical 
role: their task was to teach the pupils reading, two by two, in low 
tones (M.I.D.B., 68-83).^ decades later, Demia favoured a 
hierarchy of the same type but almost all the functions of surveillance 
were duplicated by a pedagogical role: an assistant teacher taught the 
holding of the pen, guided the pupil’s hand, corrected mistakes and 
at the same time ‘marked down trouble-makers’; another assistant 
teacher had the same tasks in the reading class; the intendant who 
supervised the other officers and was in charge of behaviour in 
general also had the task of ‘initiating newcomers into the customs 
of the school’; the decurions got the pupils to recite their lessons and 
‘marked down’ those who did not know them.® We have here a 
sketch of an institution of the ‘mutual’ type in which three proce¬ 
dures are integrated into a single mechanism: teaching proper, the 
acquisition of knowledge by the very practice of the pedagogical 
activity and a reciprocal, hierarchized observation.A relation of 
surveillance, defined and regulated, is inscribed at the heart of the 
practice of teaching, not as an additional or adjacent part, but as a 
mechanism that is inherent to it and which increases its efficiency.Hierarchized, continuous and functional surveillance may not be 
one of the great technical ‘inventions’ of the eighteenth century, but 
its insidious extension owed its importance to the mechanisms of 
power that it brought with it.By means of such surveillance, dis¬ 
ciplinary power became an ‘integrated’ system, linked from the 
inside to the economy and to the aims of the mechanism in which it 
was practised.
