It was also organized as a multiple, automatic and 
anonymous power; for although surveillance rests on individuals, 
its functioning is that of a network of relations from top to bottom, 
but also to a certain extent from bottom to top and laterally; this

network ‘holds’ the whole together and traverses it in its entirety 
with effects of power that derive from one another: supervisors, 
perpetually supervised.The power in the hierarchized surveillance 
of the disciplines is not possessed as a thing, or transferred as a 
property; it functions like a piece of machinery.And, although it is 
true that its pyramidal organization gives it a ‘head’, it is the appara¬ 
tus as a whole that produces ‘power’ and distributes individuals in 
this permanent and continuous field.This enables the disciplinary 
power to be both absolutely indiscreet, since it is everywhere and 
always alert, since by its very principle it leaves no zone of shade and 
constantly supervises the very individuals who are entrusted with 
the task of supervising; and absolutely ‘discreet’, for it functions 
permanently and largely in silence.Discipline makes possible the 
operation of a relational power that sustains itself by its own 
mechanism and which, for the spectacle of public events, substitutes 
the uninterrupted play of calculated gazes.
