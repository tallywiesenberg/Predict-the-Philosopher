The disciplines estab¬ 
lished an ‘infra-penality’; they partitioned an area that the laws had 
left empty; they defined and repressed a mass of behaviour that the 
relative indifference of the great systems of punishment had allowed 
to escape.‘On entering, the companions will greet one another ... 
on leaving, they must lock up the materials and tools that they have 
been using and also make sure that their lamps are extinguished’; 
‘it is expressly forbidden to amuse companions by gestures or in any 
other way’; they must ‘comport themselves honestly and decently’; 
anyone who is absent for more than five minutes without warning 
M. Oppenheim will be ‘marked down for a half-day’; and in order 
to be sure that nothing is forgotten in this meticulous criminal 
justice, it is forbidden to do ‘anything that may harm M. Oppenheim 
and his companions’ (Oppenheim, 29 September 1809).The work¬ 
shop, the school, the army were subject to a whole micro-penality 
of time (latenesses, absences, interruptions of tasks), of activity 
(inattention, negligence, lack of zeal), of behaviour (impoliteness, 
disobedience), of speech (idle chatter, insolence), of the body 
(‘incorrect’ attitudes, irregular gestures, lack of cleanliness), of 
sexuality (impurity, indecency).At the same time, by way of punish¬ 
ment, a whole series of subtle procedures was used, from light 
physical punishment to minor deprivations and petty humiliations.It was a question both of making the slightest departures from cor¬ 
rect behaviour subject to punishment, and of giving a punitive 
function to the apparently indifferent elements of the disciplinary 
apparatus: so that, if necessary, everything might serve to punish 
the slightest thing; each subject find himself caught in a punishable, 
punishing universality.
