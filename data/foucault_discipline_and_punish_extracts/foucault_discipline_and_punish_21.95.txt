The regulations for the Prussian infantry ordered that 
a soldier who had not correctly learnt to handle his rifle should be 
treated with the ‘greatest severity’.Similarly, ‘when a pupil has not 
retained the catechism from the previous day, he must be forced to 
learn it, without making any mistake, and repeat it the following 
day; either he will be forced to hear it standing or kneeling, his 
hands joined, or he will be given some other penance’.The order that the disciplinary punishments must enforce is of a 
mixed nature; it is an ‘artificial’ order, explicitly laid down by a law, 
a programme, a set of regulations.But it is also an order defined by 
natural and observable processes: the duration of an apprenticeship, 
the time taken to perform an exercise, the level of aptitude refer to 
a regularity that is also a rule.The children of the Christian Schools 
must never be placed in a ‘lesson’ of which they are not yet capable, 
for this would expose them to the danger of being unable to learn 
anything; yet the duration of each stage is fixed by regulation and a 
pupil who at the end of three examinations has been unable to pass 
into the higher order must be placed, well in evidence, on the bench 
of the ‘ignorant’.
