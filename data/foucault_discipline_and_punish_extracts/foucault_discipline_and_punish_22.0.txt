In a disciplinary regime punishment involves a 
double juridico-natural reference.3.Disciplinary punishment has the function of reducing gaps.It must therefore be essentially corrective.In addition to punish¬ 
ments borrowed directly from the judicial model (fines, flogging, 
solitary confinement), the disciplinary systems favour punishments 
that are exercise - intensified, multiplied forms of training, several 
times repeated: the regulations of 1766 for the infantry laid down 
that lance-corporals ‘who show some negligence or lack of willing¬ 
ness will be reduced to the rank of private’, and they will be able 
to rise to their former rank only after new exercises and a new 
examination.
