4.In discipline, punishment is only one element of a double 
system: gratification-punishment.And it is this system that operates 
in the process of training and correction.The teacher ‘must avoid, 
as far as possible, the use of punishment; on the contrary, he must 
endeavour to make rewards more frequent than penalties, the lazy 
being more encouraged by the desire to be rewarded in the same 
way as the diligent than by the fear of punishment; that is why it 
will be very beneficial, when the teacher is obliged to use punish¬ 
ment, to win the heart of the child if he can before doing so’ (Demia, 
17).This mechanism with two elements makes possible a number 
of operations characteristic of disciplinary penality.
