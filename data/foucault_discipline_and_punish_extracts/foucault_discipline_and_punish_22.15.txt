First, the 
definition of behaviour and performance on the basis of the two 
opposed values of good and evil; instead of the simple division of 
the prohibition, as practised in penal justice, we have a distribu¬ 
tion between a positive pole and a negative pole; all behaviour falls 
in the field between good and bad marks, good and bad points.Moreover, it is possible to quantify this field and work out an 
arithmetical economy based on it.A penal accountancy, constantly 
brought up to date, makes it possible to obtain the punitive balance- 
sheet of each individual.School ‘justice’, rudiments of which are to 
be found in the army and the workshops, carried this system very 
far.The Brothers of the Christian Schools organized a whole micro¬ 
economy of privileges and impositions; ‘Privileges may be used by 
pupils to gain exemption from penances which have been imposed 
on them.
