for the first.For example, a child has an imposition from which he 
can redeem himself with six points; he earns a privilege of ten; 
he presents it to the teacher who gives him back four points, and so 
on’ (La Salle, Condtute ..., i56fF).What we have here is a transposi¬ 
tion of the system of indulgences.And by the play of this quantifica¬ 
tion, this circulation of awards and debits, thanks to the continuous 
calculation of plus and minus points, the disciplinary apparatuses 
hierarchized the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ subjects in relation , to one 
another.Through this micro-economy of a perpetual penality 
operates a differentiation that is not one of acts, but of individuals 
themselves, of their nature, their potentialities, their level or their 
value.
