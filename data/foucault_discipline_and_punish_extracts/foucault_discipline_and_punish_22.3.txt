By assessing acts with precision, discipline judges individuals 
‘in truth’; the penality that it implements is integrated into the cycle 
of knowledge of individuals.5.The distribution according to ranks or grade has a double role: 
it marks the gaps, hierarchizes qualities, skills and aptitudes; but it 
also punishes and rewards.It is the penal functioning of setting in 
order and the ordinal character of judging.Discipline rewards 
simply by the play of awards, thus making it possible to attain 
higher ranks and places; it punishes by reversing this process.
