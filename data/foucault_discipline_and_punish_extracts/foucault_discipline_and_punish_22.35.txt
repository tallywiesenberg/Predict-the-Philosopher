Rank 
in itself serves as a reward or punishment.At the ficole Militaire, a 
complex system of ‘honorary’ classification was developed; this 
classification was visible to all in the form of slight variations in 
uniform and more or less noble or ignoble punishments were 
associated, as a mark of privilege or infamy, with the ranks thus 
distributed.This classificatory, penal distribution was carried out 
at short intervals by the reports that the officers, teachers and their 
assistants made, without consideration of age or grade, on ‘the 
moral qualities of the pupils’ and on ‘their universally recognized 
behaviour’.The first class, known as the ‘very good’, were dis¬ 
tinguished by a silver epaulette; they enjoyed the honour of being 
treated as ‘purely military troops’; they therefore had a right to 
military punishment (arrests and, in serious cases, imprisonment).The second class, ‘the good’, wore an epaulette of red silk and silver; 
they could be arrested and condemned to prison, but also to the cage 
and to kneeling.
