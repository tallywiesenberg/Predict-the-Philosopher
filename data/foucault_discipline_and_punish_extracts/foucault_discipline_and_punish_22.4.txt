The class of'midiocres', had the right to an epaulette 
of red wool; to the preceding penalties was added, if necessary, the 
wearing of sackcloth.The last class, that of the ‘bad’, was marked by 




Discipline 


an epaulette of brown wool; ‘the pupils of this class will be subjected 
to all the punishments used in the Hotel or all those that are thought 
necessary, even solitary confinement in a dark dungeon’.To this 
was added, for a time, the ‘shameful’ class, for which special regula¬ 
tions were drawn up ‘so that those who belonged to it would always 
be separated from the others and would be dressed in sackcloth’.Since merit and behaviour alone must decide the place of the pupil, 
‘those of the last two classes would be able to flatter themselves that 
they would be able to rise to the first two and bear its marks, when, 
by universal agreement, they will be recognized as having made 
themselves worthy of it by the change in their conduct and by their 
progress; and those of the top classes will similarly descend into the 
others if they become slack and if the various reports taken together 
are to their disadvantage and show that they no longer deserve the 
rewards and prerogatives of the higher classes..
