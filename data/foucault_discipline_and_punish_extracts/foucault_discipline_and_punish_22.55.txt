The perpetual penality that traverses all points and 
supervises every instant in the disciplinary institutions compares, 
differentiates, hierarchizes, homogenizes, excludes.In short, it 
normaliies.It is opposed, therefore, term by term, to a judicial penality 
whose essential function is to refer, not to a set of observable 
phenomena, but to a corpus of laws and texts that must be remem¬ 
bered; that operates not by differentiating individuals, but by 
specifying acts according to a number of general categories; not by 
hierarchizing, but quite simply by bringing into play the binary 
opposition of the permitted and the forbidden; not by homogeniz¬ 
ing, but by operating the division, acquired once and for all, of 
condemnation.The disciplinary mechanisms secreted a ‘penality of 
the norm’, which is irreducible in its principles and functioning to 
the traditional penality of the law.The minor court that seems to sit 
permanently in the buildings of discipline, and which sometimes 
assumes the theatrical form of the great legal apparatus, must not 
mislead us: it does not bring, except for a few formal remnants, the 
mechanisms of criminal justice to the web of everyday existence; or 
at least that is not its essential role; the disciplines created - drawing 
on a whole series of very ancient procedures — a new functioning 
of punishment, and it was this that gradually invested the great 
external apparatus that it seemed to reproduce in either a modest or 
an ironic way.
