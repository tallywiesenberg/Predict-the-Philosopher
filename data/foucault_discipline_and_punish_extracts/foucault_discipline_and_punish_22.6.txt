The juridico-anthropological functioning revealed in 
the whole history of modern penality did not originate in the super¬ 
imposition of the human sciences on criminal justice and in the 
requirements proper to this new rationality or to the humanism that 
it appeared to bring with it; it originated in the disciplinary tech¬ 
nique that operated these new mechanisms of normalizing 
judgement.183 




Discipline 


The power of the Norm appears through the disciplines.Is this 
the new law of modern society.^ Let us say rather that, since the 
eighteenth century, it has joined other powers - the Law, the Word 
{Parole) and the Text, Tradition - imposing new delimitations upon 
them.The Normal is established as a principle of coercion in teach¬ 
ing with the introduction of a standardized education and the 
establishment of the dcoles norrrutles (teachers’ training colleges); it 
is established in the effort to organize a national medical profession 
and a hospital system capable of operating general norms of health; 
it is established in the standardization of industrial processes and 
products (on this topic, one should refer to the important contribu¬ 
tion of Canguilhem, 171-91).Like surveillance and with it, normal¬ 
ization becomes one of the great instruments of power at the end of 
the classical age.
