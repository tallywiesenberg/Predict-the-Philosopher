For the marks that once indicated status, privilege 
and affiliation were increasingly replaced - or at least supplemented 
— by a whole range of degrees of normality indicating membership 
of a homogeneous social body but also playing a part in classifica¬ 
tion, hierarchization and the distribution of rank.In a sense, the 
power of normalization imposes homogeneity; but it individualizes 
by making it possible to measure gaps, to determine levels, to fix 
specialities and to render the differences useful by fitting them one 
to another.It is easy to understand how the power of the norm 
functions within a system of formal equality, since within a homo¬ 
geneity that is the rule, the norm introduces, as a useful imperative 
and as a result of measurement, all the shading of individual 
differences.The examination 

The examination combines the techniques of an observing hierarchy 
and those of a normalizing judgement.It is a normalizing gaze, a 
surveillance that makes it possible to qualify, to classify and to 
punish.
