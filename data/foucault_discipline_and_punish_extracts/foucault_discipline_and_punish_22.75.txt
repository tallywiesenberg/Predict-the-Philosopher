It is yet another innovation of the classical age that the 
historians of science have left unexplored.People write the history 
of experiments on those born blind, on wolf-children or under 
hypnosis.But who will write the more general, more fluid, but also 
more determinant history of the ‘examination’ - its rituals, its 
methods, its characters and their roles, its play of questions and 
answers, its systems of marking and classification.^ For in this 
slender technique are to be found a whole domain of knowledge, a 
whole type of power.One often speaks of the ideology that the 
human ‘sciences’ bring with them, in either discreet or prolix manner.But does their very technology, this tiny operational schema that 
has become so widespread (from psychiatry to pedagogy, from the 
diagnosis of diseases to the hiring of labour), this familiar method 
of the examination, implement, within a single mechanism, power 
relations that make it possible to extract and constitute knowledge.^ 
It is not simply at the level of consciousness, of representations and 
in what one thinks one knows, but at the level of what makes possible 
the knowledge that is transformed into political investment.
