One of the essential conditions for the epistemological ‘thaw’ of 
medicine at the end of the eighteenth century was the organization 
of the hospital as an ‘examining’ apparatus.The ritual of the visit 
was its most obvious form.In the seventeenth century, the physi¬ 
cian, coming from the outside, added his inspection to many other 
controls - religious, administrative, etc.; he hardly participated in 
the everyday administration of the hospital.Gradually, the visit 
became more regular, more rigorous, above all more extended: it 
became an ever more important part of the functioning of the 
hospital.
