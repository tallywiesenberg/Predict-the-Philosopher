Similarly, the school became a sort of apparatus of uninterrupted 
examination that duplicated along its entire length the operation of 
teaching.It became less and less a question of jousts in which pupils 
pitched their forces against one another and increasingly a perpetual 
comparison of each and all that made it possible both to measure and 
to judge.The Brothers of the Christian Schools wanted their pupils 
to be examined every day of the week: on the first for spelling, on 
the second for arithmetic, on the third for catechism in the morning 
and for handwriting in the afternoon, etc.Moreover, there was to be 
an examination each month in order to pick out those who deserved 
to be submitted for examination by the inspector (La Salle, Con- 
duite ..., i6o).From 1775, there existed at the Fcole des Fonts et 
Chaussees sixteen examinations a year: three in mathematics, three 
in architecture, three in drawing, two in writing, one in stoneÂ¬ 
cutting, one in style, one in surveying, one in levelling, one in 
quantity surveying.
