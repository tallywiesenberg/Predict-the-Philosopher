Torture 


scaffold and said that it had certainly not been set up for him, since 
he was innocent; he first asked to return to the chamber, where he 
beat about the bush for half an hour, still trying to justify himself; 
then, when he was sent back to execution, he ascended the scaffold 
with a purposeful air, but, when he saw himself undressed and tied 
to the cross before being stretched, he asked to go back to the 
chamber a second time and there made a full confession of his 
crimes and even declared that he was guilty of another murder’ 
(Hardy, IV, 8o). The function of the public torture and execution 
was to reveal the truth; and in this respect it continued, in the public 
eye, the work of the judicial torture conducted in private. It added 
to the conviction the signature of the convicted man. A successful 
public execution justified justice, in that it published the truth of the 
crime in the very body of the man to be executed. An example of the 
good condemned man was Frangois Billiard, a senior postal official, 
who murdered his wife in 1772. The executioner wanted to hide 
his face to spare him the insults of the crowd: ‘ “This punishment, 
which I have merited, has not been inflicted upon me,” he said, “so 
that I should not be seen by the public. . .” He was still wearing 
mourning dress in honour of his wife. . . He was wearing new 
shoes, his hair had been recently curled and powdered, and he had a 
countenance so modest and so dignified that those present who 
found themselves observing him more closely said that he must be 
the most perfect Christian or the greatest of all hypocrites. The 
placard that he was wearing on his chest had gone askew, and it was 
noticed that he had straightened it himself, no doubt so that people 
could read it the more easily’ (Hardy, I, 327). If each of the partici¬ 
pants played his role well, the penal ceremony had the effectiveness 
of a long public confession. 

3. It pinned the public torture on to the crime itself; it established 
from one to the other a series of decipherable relations. It was an 
exhibition of the corpse of the condemned man at the scene of his 
crime, or at one of the near-by crossroads. The execution was often 
carried out at the very place where the crime had been committed - 
as in the case of the student who, in 1723, had killed several persons 
and for whom the presidial court of Nantes decided to set up a 
scaffold in front of the inn where he had committed his murders 
(Nantes, F.F. 124; cf. Parfouru, XXV). There was the use of
