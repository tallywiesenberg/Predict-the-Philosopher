Those on whom it was exercised could remain in the shade; 
they received light only from that portion of power that was 
conceded to them, or from the reflection of it that for a moment they 
carried.Disciplinary power, on the other hand, is exercised through 
its invisibility; at the same time it imposes on those whom it subjects 
a principle of compulsory visibility.In discipline, it is the subjects 
who have to be seen.Their visibility assures the hold of the power 
that is exercised over them.It is the fact of being constantly seen, 
of being able always to be seen, that maintains the disciplined 
individual in his subjection.
