The solemn appearance of the sovereign 
brought with it something of the consecration, the coronation, the 
return from victory; even the funeral ceremony took place with all 
the spectacle of power deployed.Discipline, however, had its own 
type of ceremony.It was not the triumph, but the review, the 
‘parade’, an ostentatious form of the examination.In it the ‘subjects’ 
were presented as ‘objects’ to the observation of a power that was 
manifested only by its gaze.They did not receive directly the image 
of the sovereign power; they only felt its effects - in replica, as it 
were - on their bodies, which had become precisely legible and 
docile.
