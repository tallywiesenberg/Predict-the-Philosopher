On 15 March 1666, Louis XIV took his first military review: 
18,000 men, ‘one of the most sjjectacular actions of the reign’, which 
was supposed to have ‘kept all Europe in disquiet’.Several years 
later, a medal was struck to commemorate the event (cf.Jucquiot, 
50-54).It bears the exergue, ‘Disciplina militaris restitua and the 
legend ‘Prolusio ad victorias'.On the right, the king, right foot 
forward, commands the exercise itself with a stick.
