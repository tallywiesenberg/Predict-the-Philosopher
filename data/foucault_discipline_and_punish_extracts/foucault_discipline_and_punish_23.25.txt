On the left, 
several ranks of soldiers are shown full face and aligned in depth; 
they have raised their right arms to shoulder height and are holding 
their rifles exactly vertical, their right legs are slightly forward and 
their left feet turned outwards.On the ground, lines intersect at 
right angles, to form, beneath the soldiers’ feet, broad rectangles 
that serve as references for different phases and positions of the 
exercise.In the background is a piece of classical architecture.The 
columns of the palace extend those formed by the ranks of men and 
the erect rifles, just as the paving no doubt extends the lines of the 
exercise.But above the balustrade that crowns the building are 
statues representing dancing figures: sinuous lines, rounded ges¬ 
tures, draperies.
