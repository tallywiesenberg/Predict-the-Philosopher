A ‘power of writing’ was con¬ 
stituted as an essential part in the mechanisms of discipline.On many 
points, it was modelled on the traditional methods of administrative 
documentation, though with particular techniques and important 
innovations.Some concerned methods of identification, signalling 
or description.This was the problem in the army, where it was 
necessary to track down deserters, avoid repeating enrolments, 
correct fictitious ‘information’ presented by officers, know the ser¬ 
vices and value of each individual, establish with certainty 
the balance-sheet of those who had disappeared or died.It was the 
problem of the hospitals, where it was necessary to recognize 
the patients, expel shammers, follow the evolution of diseases, study 
the effectiveness of treatments, map similar cases and the beginnings 
of epidemics.
