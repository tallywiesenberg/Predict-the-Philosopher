It was the problem of the teaching establishments, 
where one had to define the aptitude of each individual, situate his 
level and his abilities, indicate the possible use that might be made 
of them: ‘The register enables one, by being available in time and 
place, to know the habits of the children, their progress in piety, 
in catechism, in the letters, during the time they have been at the 
School’ (M.I.D.B., 64).Hence the formation of a whole series of codes of disciplinary

the physical code of signalling, the medical code of symptoms, the 
educational or military code of conduct or performance.These 
codes were still very crude, both in quality and quantity, but they 
marked a first stage in the ‘formalization’ of the individual within 
power relations.The other innovations of disciplinary writing concerned the 
correlation of these elements, the accumulation of documents, their 
seriation, the organization of comparative fields making it possible 
to classify, to form categories, to determine averages, to fix norms.The hospitals of the eighteenth century, in particular, were great 
laboratories for scriptuary and documentary methods.
