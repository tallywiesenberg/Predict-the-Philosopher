The keeping 
of registers, their specification, the modes of transcription from one 
to the other, their circulation during visits, their comparison during 
regular meetings of doctors and administrators, the transmission of 
their data to centralizing bodies (either at the hospital or at the 
central office of the poorhouses), the accountancy of diseases, cures, 
deaths, at the level of a hospital, a town and even of the nation as a 
whole formed an integral part of the process by which hospitals 
were subjected to the disciplinary regime.Among the fundamental 
conditions of a good medical ‘discipline’, in both senses of the word, 
one must include the procedures of writing that made it possible to 
integrate individual data into cumulative systems in such a way that 
they were not lost; so to arrange things that an individual could be 
located in the general register and that, conversely, each datum of 
the individual examination might affect overall calculations.Thanks to the whole apparatus of writing that accompanied it, the 
examination opened up two correlative possibilities; firstly, the 
constitution of the individual as a describable, analysable object, not 
in order to reduce him to ‘specific’ features, as did the naturalists in 
relation to living beings, but in order to maintain him in his indivi¬ 
dual features, in his particular evolution, in his own aptitudes or 
abilities, under the gaze of a permanent corpus of knowledge; and, 
secondly, the constitution of a comparative system that made 
possible the measurement of overall phenomena, the description of 
groups, the characterization of collective facts, the calculation of the 
gaps between individuals, their distribution in a given ‘population’.These small techniques of notation, of registration, of constituting 
files, of arranging facts in columns and tables that are so familiar

to us now, were of decisive importance in the epistemological ‘thaw’ 
of the sciences of the individual.One is no doubt right to pose the 
Aristotelean problem: is a science of the individual possible and 
legitimate.^ A great problem needs great solutions perhaps.
