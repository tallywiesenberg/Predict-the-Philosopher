But 
there is the small historical problem of the emergence, towards the 
end of the eighteenth century, of what might generally be termed 
the ‘clinical’ sciences; the problem of the entry of the individual (and > 

no longer the species) into the field of knowledge; the problem of 
the entry of the individual description, of the cross-examination, of 
anamnesis, of the ‘file’ into the general functioning of scientific dis¬ 
course.To this simple question of fact, one must no doubt give an 
answer lacking in ‘nobility’: one should look into these procedures 
of writing and registration, one should look into the mechanisms of 
examination, into the formation of the mechanisms of discipline, and 
of a new type of power over bodies.Is this the birth of the sciences 
of man.^ It is probably to be found in these ‘ignoble’ archives, where 
the modern play of coercion over bodies, gestures and behaviour 
has its beginnings.3.The examination, surrounded by all its documentary techniques, 
makes each individual a 'case': a case which at one and the same time 
constitutes an object for a branch of knowledge and a hold for a 
branch of power.
