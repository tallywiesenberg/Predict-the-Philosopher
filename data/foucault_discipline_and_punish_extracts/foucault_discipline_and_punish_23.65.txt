The case is no longer, as in casuistry or juris¬ 
prudence, a set of circumstances defining an act and capable of 
modifying the application of a rule; it is the individual as he may be 
described, judged, measured, compared with others, in his very 
individuality; and it is also the individual who has to be trained or 
corrected, classified, normalized, excluded, etc.For a long time ordinary individuality - the everyday individual¬ 
ity of everybody - remained below the threshold of description.To be looked at, observed, described in detail, followed from day 
to day by an uninterrupted writing was a privilege.The chronicle of 
a man, the account of his life, his historiography, written as he lived 
out his life formed part of the rituals of his power.The disciplinary 
methods reversed this relation, lowered the threshold of describable 
individuality and made of this description a means of control and a 
method of domination.
