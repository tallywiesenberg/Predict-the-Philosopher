to become, with increasing ease from the eighteenth century and 
according to a curve which is that of the mechanisms of discipline, 
the object of individual descriptions and biographical accounts.This turning of real lives into writing is no longer a procedure of 
heroization; it functions as a procedure of objectification and sub¬ 
jection.The carefully collated life of mental patients or delinquents 
belongs, as did the chronicle of kings or the adventures of the great 
popular bandits, to a certain political function of writing; but in a 
quite different technique of power.The examination as the fixing, at once ritual and ‘scientific’, of 
individual differences, as the pinning down of each individual in his 
own particularity (in contrast with the ceremony in which status, 
birth, privilege, function are manifested with all the spectacle of 
their marks) clearly indicates the appearance of a new modality of 
power in which each individual receives as his status his own indivi¬ 
duality, and in which he is linked by his status to the features, the 
measurements, the gaps, the ‘marks’ that characterize him and make 
him a ‘case’.
