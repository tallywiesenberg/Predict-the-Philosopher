Finally, the examination is at the centre of the procedures that 
constitute the individual as effect and object of power, as effect and 
object of knowledge.It is the examination which, by combining 
hierarchical surveillance and normalizing judgement, assures the 
great disciplinary functions of distribution and classification, maxi¬ 
mum extraction of forces and time, continuous genetic accumula¬ 
tion, optimum combination of aptitudes and, thereby, the fabrication 
of cellular, organic, genetic and combinatory individuality.With it 
are ritualized those disciplines that may be characterized in a word 
by saying that they are a modality of power for which individual 
difference is relevant.The disciplines mark the moment when the reversal of the political 
axis of individualization - as one might call it - takes place.In 
certain societies, of which the feudal regime is only one example, 
it may be said that individualization is greatest where sovereignty 
is exercised and in the higher echelons of power.
