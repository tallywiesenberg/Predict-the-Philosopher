It is often said that the model of a society that has individuals 
as its constituent elements is borrowed from the abstract juridical 
forms of contract and exchange.Mercantile society, according to 
this view, is represented as a contractual association of isolated 
juridical subjects.Perhaps.Indeed, the political theory of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries often seems to follow this 
schema.But it should not be forgotten that there existed at the same 
period a technique for constituting individuals as correlative eleÂ¬ 
ments of power and knowledge.
