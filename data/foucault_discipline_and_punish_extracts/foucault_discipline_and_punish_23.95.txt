The individual is no doubt the 
fictitious atom of an ‘ideological’ representation of society; but he is 
also a reality fabricated by this specific technology of power that I 
have called ‘discipline’.We must cease once and for all to describe 
the effects of power in negative terms: it ‘excludes’, it ‘represses’, 
it ‘censors’, it ‘abstracts’, it ‘masks’, it ‘conceals’.In fact, power 
produces; it produces reality; it produces domains of objects and 
rituals of truth.The individual and the knowledge that may be 
gained of him belong to this production.Is it not somewhat excessive to derive such power from the petty 
machinations of discipline.^ How could they achieve effects of such 
scope.^
