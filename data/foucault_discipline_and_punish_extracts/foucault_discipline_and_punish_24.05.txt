If it is absolutely necessary 
to leave the house, it will be done in turn, avoiding any meeting.Only the intendants, syndics and guards will move about the 
streets and also, between the infected houses, from one corpse to 
another, the ‘crows’, who can be left to die: these are ‘people of little 
substance who carry the sick, bury the dead, clean and do many vile 
and abject offices’.It is a segmented, immobile, frozen space.Each 
individual is fixed in his place.And, if he moves, he does so at the 
risk of his life, contagion or punishment.
