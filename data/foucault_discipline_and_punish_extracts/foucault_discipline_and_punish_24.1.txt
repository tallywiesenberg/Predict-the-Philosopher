of substance’, guards at the gates, at the town hall and in every 
quarter to ensure the prompt obedience of the people and the most 
absolute authority of the magistrates, ‘as also to observe all disorder, 
theft and extortion’.At each of the town gates there will be an 
observation postj at the end of each street sentinels.Every day, the 
intendant visits the quarter in his charge, inquires whether the 
syndics have carried out their tasks, whether the inhabitants have 
anything to complain of; they ‘observe their actions’.Every day, 
too, the syndic goes into the street for which he is responsible; 
stops before each house: gets all the inhabitants to appear at the 
windows (those who live overlooking the courtyard will be allo¬ 
cated a window looking onto the street at which no one but they 
may show themselves); he calls each of them by name; informs 
himself as to the state of each and every one of them — ‘in which 
respect the inhabitants will be compelled to speak the truth under 
pain of death’; if someone does not appear at the window, the syndic 
must ask why: ‘In this way he will find out easily enough whether 
dead or sick are being concealed.’ Everyone locked up in his 
cage, everyone at his window, answering to his name and showing 
himself when asked - it is the great review of the living and the 
dead.
