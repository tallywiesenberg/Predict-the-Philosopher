This surveillance is based on a system of permanent registration: 
reports from the syndics to the intendants, from the intendants to 
the magistrates or mayor.At the beginning of the ‘lock up’, the role 
of each of the inhabitants present in the town is laid down, one by 
one; this document bears ‘the name, age, sex of everyone, notwith¬ 
standing his condition’: a copy is sent to the intendant of the quarter, 
another to the office of the town hall, another to enable the syndic 
to make his daily roll call.Everything that may be observed during 
the course of the visits - deaths, illnesses, complaints, irregularities - 
is noted down and transmitted to the intendants and magistrates.The magistrates have complete control over medical treatment; they 
have appointed a physician in charge; no other practitioner may 
treat, no apothecary prepare medicine, no confessor visit a sick 
person without having received from him a written note ‘to prevent 
anyone from concealing and dealing with those sick of the contagion, 
unknown to the magistrates’.The registration of the pathological 
must be constantly centralized.
