This enclosed, segmented space, observed at every point, in 
which the individuals are inserted in a fixed place, in which the 
slightest movements are supervised, in which all events are recorded, 
in which an uninterrupted work of writing links the centre and 
periphery, in which power is exercised without division, according 
to a continuous hierarchical figure, in which each individual is conÂ¬ 
stantly located, examined and distributed among the living beings, 
the sick and the dead - all this constitutes a compact model of the 
disciplinary mechanism.The plague is met by order; its function is 
to sort out every possible confusion: that of the disease, which is 
transmitted when bodies are mixed together; that of the evil, which 
is increased when fear and death overcome prohibitions.It lays 
down for each individual his place, his body, his disease and his 
death, his well-being, by means of an omnipresent and omniscient 
power that subdivides itself in a regular, uninterrupted way even 
to the ultimate determination of the individual, of what characterizes 
him, of what belongs to him, of what happens to him.Against the 
plague, which is a mixture, discipline brings into play its power, 
which is one of analysis.A whole literary fiction of the festival grew 
up around the plague: suspended laws, lifted prohibitions, the 
frenzy of passing time, bodies mingling together without respect, 
individuals unmasked, abandoning their statutory identity and the 
figure under which they had been recognized, allowing a quite 
different truth to appear.
