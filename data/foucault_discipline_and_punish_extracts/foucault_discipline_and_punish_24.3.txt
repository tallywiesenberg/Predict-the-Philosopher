plague, which was exactly its reverse: not the collective festival, 
but strict divisions; not laws transgressed, but the penetration of 
regulation into even the smallest details of everyday life through the 
mediation of the complete hierarchy that assured the capillary func¬ 
tioning of power; not masks that were put on and taken off, but the 
assignment to each individual of his ‘true’ name, his ‘true’ place, his 
‘true’ body, his ‘true’ disease.The plague as a form, at once real 
and imaginary, of disorder had as its medical and political correlative 
discipline.Behind the disciplinary mechanisms can be read the 
haunting memory of ‘contagions’, of the plague, of rebellions, 
crimes, vagabondage, desertions, people who appear and disappear, 
live and die in disorder.If it is true that the leper gave rise to rituals of exclusion, which to 
a certain extent provided the model for and general form of the 
great Confinement, then the plague gave rise to disciplinary pro¬ 
jects.Rather than the massive, binary division between one set of 
people and another, it called for multiple separations, individualizing 
distributions, an organization in depth of surveillance and control, 
an intensification and a ramification of power.
