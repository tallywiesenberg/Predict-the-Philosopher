The leper was caught 
up in a practice of rejection, of exile-enclosure; he was left to his 
doom in a mass among which it was useless to differentiate; those 
sick of the plague were caught up in a meticulous tactical partitionÂ¬ 
ing in which individual differentiations were the constricting effects 
of a power that multiplied, articulated and subdivided itself; the great 
confinement on the one hand; the correct training on the other.The leper and his separation; the plague and its segmentations.The 
first is marked; the second analysed and distributed.The exile of 
the leper and the arrest of the plague do not bring with them the 
same political dream.The first is that of a pure community, the 
second that of a disciplined society.
