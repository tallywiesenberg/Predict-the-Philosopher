They are different projects, then, but not incompatible ones.We 
see them coming slowly together, and it is the peculiarity of the 
nineteenth century that it applied to the space of exclusion of which 
the leper was the symbolic inhabitant (beggars, vagabonds, madmen 
and the disorderly formed the real population) the technique of 
power proper to disciplinary partitioning.Treat ‘lepers’ as ‘plague 
victims’, project the subtle segmentations of discipline onto the 
confused space of internment, combine it with the methods of analy¬ 
tical distribution proper to power, individualize the excluded, but 
use procedures of individualization to mark exclusion - this is what 
was operated regularly by disciplinary power from the beginning 
of the nineteenth century in the psychiatric asylum, the penitentiary, 
the reformatory, the approved school and, to some extent, the 
hospital.Generally speaking, all the authorities exercising individual 
control function according to a double mode; that of binary division 
and branding (mad/sane; dangerous/harmless; normal/abnormal); 
and that of coercive assignment, of differential distribution (who he 
is; where he must be; how he is to be characterized; how he is to be 
recognized; how a constant surveillance is to be exercised over him 
in an individual way, etc.).On the one hand, the lepers are treated as 
plague victims; the tactics of individualizing disciplines are imposed 
on the excluded; and, on the other hand, the universality of disci¬ 
plinary controls makes it possible to brand the ‘leper’ and to bring 
into play against him the dualistic mechanisms of exclusion.
