of religion and repentance that he gave’; the man who had shown 
the most marked signs of contrition throughout the journey to the 
scaffold, but who, when placed alive on the wheel, ‘did not cease 
to let forth the most horrible cries’; or again the woman who ‘had 
preserved her calm up to the moment when the sentence was read, 
but whose wits then began to turn; she was quite mad by the time 
she was hanged’ (Hardy, I, 13; IV, 42; V, 134). 

We have come full circle: from the judicial torture to the execu¬ 
tion, the body has produced and reproduced the truth of the crime 
-or rather it constitutes the element which, through a whole set of 
rituals and trials, confesses that the crime took place, admits that the 
accused did indeed commit it, shows that he bore it inscribed in 
himself and on himself, supports the operation of punishment and 
manifests its effects in the most striking way. The body, several 
times tortured, provides the synthesis of the reality of the deeds and 
the truth of the investigation, of the documents of the case and the 
statements of the criminal, of the crime and the punishment. It is an 
essential element, therefore, in a penal liturgy, in which it must 
serve as the partner of a procedure ordered around the formidable 
rights of the sovereign, the prosecution and secrecy. 

The public execution is to be understood not only as a judicial, 
but also as a political ritual. It belongs, even in minor cases, to the 
ceremonies by which power is manifested. 

An offence, according to the law of the classical age, quite apart 
from the damage it may produce, apart even from the rule that it 
breaks, offends the rectitude of those who abide by the law: ‘If one 
commits something that the law forbids, even if there is neither harm 
nor injury to the individual, it is an offence that demands reparation, 
because the right of the superior man is violated and because it 
offends the dignity of his character’ (Risi, 9). Besides its immediate 
victim, the crime attacks the sovereign: it attacks him personally, 
since the law represents the will of the sovereign; it attacks him 
physically, since the force of the law is the force of the prince. 
‘For a law to be in force in this kingdom, it must necessarily have 
emanated directly from the sovereign, or at least been confirmed by 
the seal of his authority’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv). The inter¬ 
vention of the sovereign is not, therefore, an arbitration between
