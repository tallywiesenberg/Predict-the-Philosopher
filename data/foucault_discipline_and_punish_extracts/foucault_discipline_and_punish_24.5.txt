The 
constant division between the normal and the abnormal, to which 
every individual is subjected, brings us back to our own time, by 
applying the binary branding and exile of the leper to quite different

derive.Bentham’s Panopticon is the architectural figure of this composi¬ 
tion.We know the principle on which it was based: at the periphery, 
an annular building; at the centre, a tower; this tower is pierced with 
wide windows that open onto the inner side of the ring; the peri¬ 
pheric building is divided into cells, each of which extends the whole 
width of the building; they have two windows, one on the inside, 
corresponding to the windows of the tower; the other, on the out¬ 
side, allows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other.All that is needed, then, is to place a supervisor in a central tower 
and to shut up in each cell a madman, a patient, a condemned man, 
a worker or a schoolboy.
