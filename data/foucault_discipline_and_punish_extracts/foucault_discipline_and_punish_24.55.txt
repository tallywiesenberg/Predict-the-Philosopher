By the effect of backlighting, one can 
observe from the tower, standing out precisely against the light, 
the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery.They are 
like so many cages, so many small theatres, in which each actor is 
alone, perfectly individualized and constantly visible.The panoptic 
mechanism arranges spatial unities that make it possible to see con¬ 
stantly and to recognize immediately.In short, it reverses the prin¬ 
ciple of the dungeon; or rather of its three functions - to enclose, to 
deprive of light and to hide - it preserves only the first and elimin¬ 
ates the other two.Full lighting and the eye of a supervisor capture 
better than darkness, which ultimately protected.
