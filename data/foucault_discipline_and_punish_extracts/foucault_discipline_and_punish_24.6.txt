Visibility is a trap.To begin with, this made it possible - as a negative effect - to 
avoid those compact, swarming, howling masses that were to be 
found in places of confinement, those painted by Goya or described 
by Howard.Each individual, in his place, is securely confined to a 
cell from which he is seen from the front by the supervisor; but the 
side walls prevent him from coming into contact with his companÂ¬ 
ions.He is seen, but he does not see; he is the object of information, 
never a subject in communication.The arrangement of his room, 
opposite the central tower, imposes on him an axial visibility; but 
the divisions of the ring, those separated cells, imply a lateral 
invisibility.
