And this invisibility is a guarantee of order.If the in¬ 
mates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at 
collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad 
reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of

contagion; if they are madmen theie is no risk of their committing 
violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no 
copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, 
there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those dis¬ 
tractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or 
cause accidents.The crowd, a compact mass, a locus of multiple 
exchanges, individualities merging together, a collective effect, is 
abolished and replaced by a collection of separated individualities.From the point of view of the guardian, it is replaced by a multipli¬ 
city that can be numbered and supervised; from the point of view of 
the inmates, by a sequestered and observed solitude (Bentham, 
60-64).Hence the major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate 
a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the auto¬ 
matic functioning of power.
