So to arrange things that the surveilÂ¬ 
lance is permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its 
action; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual 
exercise unnecessary; that this architectural apparatus should be a 
machine for creating and sustaining a power relation independent 
of the person who exercises it; in short, that the inmates should be 
caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the 
bearers.To achieve this, it is at once too much and too little that the 
prisoner should be constantly observed by an inspector: too little, 
for what matters is that he knows himself to be observed; too much, 
because he has no need in fact of being so.In view of this, Bentham 
laid down the principle that power should be visible and unveri- 
fiable.Visible: the inmate will constantly have before his eyes the 
tall outline of the central tower from which he is spied upon.Unverifiable: the inmate must never know whether he is being 
looked at at any one moment; but he must be sure that he may always 
be so.
