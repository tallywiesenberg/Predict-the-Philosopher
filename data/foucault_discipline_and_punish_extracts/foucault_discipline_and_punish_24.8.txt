Any individual, taken almost at random, can operate the 
machine: in the absence of the director, his family, his friends, his 
visitors, even his servants (Bentham, 45).Similarly, it does not 
matter what motive animates him: the curiosity of the indiscreet, the 
malice of a child, the thirst for knowledge of a philosopher who 
wishes to visit this museum of human nature, or the perversity of 
those who take pleasure in spying and punishing.The more 
numerous those anonymous and temporary observers are, the greater 
the risk for the inmate of being surprised and the greater his anxious 
awareness of being observed.The Panopticon is a marvellous 
machine which, whatever use one may wish to put it to, produces 
homogeneous effects of power.A real subjection is born mechanically from a fictitious relation.
