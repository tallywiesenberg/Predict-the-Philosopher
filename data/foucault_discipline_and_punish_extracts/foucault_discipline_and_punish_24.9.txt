By this very fact, the external power may 
throw off its physical weight; it tends to the non-corporal; and, the 
more it approaches this limit, the more constant, profound and 
permanent are its effects; it is a perpetual victory that avoids any 
physical confrontation and which is always decided in advance.Bentham does not say whether he was inspired, in his project, by 
Le Vaux’s menagerie at Versailles: the first menagerie in which the 
different elements are not, as they traditionally were, distributed in 
a park (Loisel, 104-7).At the centre was an octagonal pavilion 
which, on the first floor, consisted of only a single room, the king’s 
salon-, on every side large windows looked out onto seven cages 
(the eighth side was reserved for the entrance), containing different 
species of animals.By Bentham’s time, this menagerie had dis¬ 
appeared.But one finds in the programme of the Panopticon a 
similar concern with individualizing observation, with characteriza¬ 
tion and classification, with the analytical arrangement of space.
