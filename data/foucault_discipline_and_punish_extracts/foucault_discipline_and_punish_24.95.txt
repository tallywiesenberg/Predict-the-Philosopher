The 
Panopticon is a royal menagerie; the animal is replaced by man, 
individual distribution by specific grouping and the king by the 
machinery of a furtive power.With this exception, the Panopticon 
also does the work of a naturalist.It makes it possible to draw up 
differences: among patients, to observe the symptoms of each indivi¬ 
dual, without the proximity of beds, the circulation of miasmas, the 
effects of contagion confusing the clinical tables; among school- 
children, it makes it possible to observe performances (without 
there being any imitation or copying), to map aptitudes, to assess 
characters, to draw up rigorous classifications and, in relation to 
normal development, to distinguish ‘laziness and stubbornness’ from 
‘incurable imbecility’; among workers, it makes it possible to note 
the aptitudes of each worker, compare the time he takes to perform 
a task, and if they are paid by the day, to calculate their wages 
(Bentham, 60-64)., So much for the question of observation.But the Panopticon was 
also a laboratory; it could be used as a machine to carry out experi¬ 
ments, to alter behaviour, to train or correct individuals.
