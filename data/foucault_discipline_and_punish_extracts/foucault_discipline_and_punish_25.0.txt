respect for the rights of the individual; it is a direct reply to the 
person who has oflFended him. There can be no doubt that ‘the 
exercise of the sovereign power in the punishment of crime is one 
of the essential parts of the administration of justice’ (Jousse, vii). 
Punishment, therefore, cannot be identified with or even measured 
by the redress of the injury; in punishment, there must always be a 
portion that belongs to the prince, and, even when it is combined 
with the redress laid down, it constitutes the most important element 
in the penal liquidation of the crime. Now, this portion belonging 
to the prince is not in itself simple: on the one hand, it requires 
redress for the injury that has been done to his kingdom (as an 
element of disorder and as an example given to others, this con¬ 
siderable injury is out of all proportion to that which has been 
committed upon a private individual); but it also requires that the 
king take revenge for an affront to his very person. 

The right to punish, therefore, is an aspect of the sovereign’s 
right to make war on his enemies: to punish belongs to ‘that 
absolute power of life and death which Roman law calls merum 
imperium, a right by virtue of which the prince sees that his law is 
respected by ordering the punishment of crime’ (Muyart de Vou- 
glans, xxxiv). But punishment is also a way of exacting retribution 
that is both personal and public, since the physico-political force 
of the sovereign is in a sense present in the law: ‘One sees by the 
very definition of the law that it tends not only to prohibit, but also 
to avenge contempt for its authority by the punishment of those who 
violate its prohibitions’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv). In the execu¬ 
tion of the most ordinary penalty, in the most punctilious respect of 
legal forms, reign the active forces of revenge. 

The public execution, then, has a juridico-political function. It is 
a ceremonial by which a momentarily injured sovereignty is recon¬ 
stituted. It restores that sovereignty by manifesting it at its most 
spectacular. The public execution, however hasty and everyday, 
belongs to a whole series of great rituals in which power is eclipsed 
and restored (coronation, entry of the king into a conquered city, 
the submission of rebellious subjects); over and above the crime 
that has placed the sovereign in contempt, it deploys before all eyes 
an invincible force. Its aim is not so much to re-establish a balance
