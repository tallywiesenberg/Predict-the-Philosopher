The Panopticon is a privileged place for 
experiments on men, and for analysing with complete certainty the 
transformations that may be obtained from them.The Panopticon 
may even provide an apparatus for supervising its own mechanisms.In this central tower, the director may spy on all the employees that 
he has under his orders: nurses, doctors, foremen, teachers, war¬ 
ders; he will be able to judge them continuously, alter their be¬ 
haviour, impose upon them the methods he thinks best; and it will 
even be possible to observe the director himself.An inspector 
arriving unexpectedly at the centre of the Panopticon will be able to 
judge at a glance, without anything being concealed from him, how 
the entire establishment is functioning.And, in any case, enclosed 
as he is in the middle of this architectural mechanism, is not the 
director’s own fate entirely bound up with it.^ The incompetent 
physician who has allowed contagion to spread, the incompetent 
prison governor or workshop manager will be the first victims of an 
epidemic or a revolt.
