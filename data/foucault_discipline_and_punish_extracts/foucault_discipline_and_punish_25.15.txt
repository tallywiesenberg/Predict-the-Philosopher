In the 
first case, there is an exceptional situation: against an extraordinary 
evil, power is mobilized; it makes itself everywhere present and 
visible; it invents new mechanisms; it separates, it immobilizes, it 
partitions; it constructs for a time what is both a counter-city and 
the perfect society; it imposes an ideal functioning, but one that is 
reduced, in the final analysis, like the evil that it combats, to a simple 
dualism of life and death: that which moves brings death, and one 
kills that which moves.The Panopticon, on the other hand, must 
be understood as a generalizable model of functioning; a way of 
defining power relations in terms of the everyday life of men.No 
doubt Bentham presents it as a particular institution, closed in upon 
itself.Utopias, perfectly closed in upon themselves, are common 
enough.As opposed to the ruined prisons, littered with mechanisms 
of torture, to be seen in Piraneseâ€™s engravings, the Panopticon 
presents a cruel, ingenious cage.
