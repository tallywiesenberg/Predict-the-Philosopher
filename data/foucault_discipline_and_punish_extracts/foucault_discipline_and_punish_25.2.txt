The fact that it should have given 
rise, even in our own time, to so many variations, projected or 
realized, is evidence of the imaginary intensity that it has possessed 
for almost two hundred years.But the Panopticon must not be 
understood as a dream building: it is the diagram of a mechanism of 
power reduced to its ideal form; its functioning, abstracted from any 
obstacle, resistance or friction, must be represented as a pure archi¬ 
tectural and optical system: it is in fact a figure of political technology 
that may and must be detached from any specific use.It is polyvalent in its applications; it serves to reform prisoners, 
but also to treat patients, to instruct schoolchildren, to confine the 
insane, to supervise workers, to put beggars and idlers to work.It is 
a type of location of bodies in space, of distribution of individuals 
in relation to one another, of hierarchical organization, of disposi¬ 
tion of centres and channels of power, of definition of the instru¬ 
ments and modes of intervention of power, which can be implemen¬ 
ted in hospitals, workshops, schools, prisons.Whenever one is 
dealing with a multiplicity of individuals on whom a task or a 
particular form of behaviour must be imposed, the panoptic schema 
may be used.
