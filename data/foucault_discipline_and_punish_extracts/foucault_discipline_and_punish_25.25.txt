to be covered or commanded by buildings, a number of persons are 
meant to be kept under inspection’ (Bentham, 40; although Bentham 
takes the penitentiary house as his prime example, it is because it has 
many different functions to fulfil - safe custody, confinement, 
solitude, forced labour and instruction).In each of its applications, it makes it possible to perfect the exer¬ 
cise of power.It does this in several ways: because it can reduce the 
number of those who exercise it, while increasing the number of 
those on whom it is exercised.Because it is possible to intervene at 
any moment and because the constant pressure acts even before the 
offences, mistakes or crimes have been committed.Because, in these 
conditions, its strength is that it never intervenes, it is exercised 
spontaneously and without noise, it constitutes a mechanism whose 
effects follow from one another.
