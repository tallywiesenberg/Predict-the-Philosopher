Because, without any physical 
instrument other than architecture and geometry, it acts directly on 
individuals; it gives ‘power of mind over mind’.The panoptic 
schema makes any apparatus of power more intense: it assures its 
economy (in material, in personnel, in time); it assures its efficacity 
by its preventative character, its continuous functioning and its 
automatic mechanisms.It is a way of obtaining from power ‘in 
hitherto unexampled quantity’, ‘a great and new instrument of 
government ...; its great excellence consists in the great strength 
it is capable of giving to any institution it may be thought proper to 
apply it to’ (Bentham, 66).It’s a case of ‘it’s easy once you’ve thought of it’ in the political 
sphere.It can in fact be integrated into any function (education, 
medical treatment, production, punishment); it can increase the 
effect of this function, by being linked closely with it; it can consti¬ 
tute a mixed mechanism in which relations of power (and of know¬ 
ledge) may be precisely adjusted, in the smallest detail, to the pro¬ 
cesses that are to be supervised; it can establish a direct proportion 
between ‘surplus power’ and ‘surplus production’.
