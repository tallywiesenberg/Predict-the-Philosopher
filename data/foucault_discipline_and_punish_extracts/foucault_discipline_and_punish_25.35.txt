In short, it 
arranges things in such a way that the exercise of power is not 
added on from the outside, like a rigid, heavy constraint, to the 
functions it invests, but is so subtly present in them as to increase 
their efficiency by itself increasing its own points of contact.The 
panoptic mechanism is not simply a hinge, a point of exchange 
between a mechanism of power and a function; it is a way of making

power relations function in a function, and of making a function 
function through these power relations.Bentham’s Preface to 
Panopticon opens with a list of the benefits to be obtained from his 
‘inspection-house’: 'Morals reformed — health preserved — industry 
invigorated- instruction diffused - public burthens lightened - Economy 
seated, as it were, upon a rock - the gordian knot of the Poor-Laws 
not cut, but untied - all by a simple idea in architecture!’ (Bentham, 
39 )- 

Furthermore, the arrangement of this machine is such that its 
enclosed nature does not preclude a permanent presence from the 
outside: we have seen that anyone may come and exercise in the cen¬ 
tral tower the functions of surveillance, and that, this being the case, 
he can gain a clear idea of the way in which the surveillance is practised.In fact, any panoptic institution, even if it is as rigorously closed 
as a penitentiary, may without difficulty be subjected to such irregu¬ 
lar and constant inspections: and not only by the appointed inspec¬ 
tors, but also by the public; any member of society will have the 
right to come and see with his own eyes how the schools, hospitals, 
factories, prisons function.There is no risk, therefore, that the 
increase of power created by the.panoptic machine may degenerate 
into tyranny; the disciplinary mechanism will be democratically 
controlled, since it will be constantly accessible ‘to the great tribun^ 
committee of the world’.
