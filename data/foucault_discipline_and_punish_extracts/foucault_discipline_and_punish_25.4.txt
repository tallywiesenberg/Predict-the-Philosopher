* This Panopticon, subtly arranged so that 
an observer may observe, at a glance, so many different individuals, 
also enables everyone to come and observe any of the observers.The seeing machine was once a sort of dark room into which 
individuals spied; it has become a transparent building in which the 
exercise of power may be supervised by society as a whole.The panoptic schema, without disappearing as such or losing any 
of its properties, was destined to spread throughout the social body; 
its vocation was to become a generalized function.The plague- 
stricken town provided an exceptional disciplinary model: perfect, 
but absolutely violent; to the disease that brought death, power 
opposed its perpetual threat of death; life inside it was reduced to 
its simplest expression; it was, against the power of death, the metiÂ¬ 
culous exercise of the right of the sword.The Panopticon, on the 
other hand, has a role of amplification; although it arranges power, 
although it is intended to make it more economic and more effective.
