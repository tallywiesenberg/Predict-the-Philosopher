Discipline 


it does so not for power itself, nor for the immediate salvation of a 
threatened society: its aim is to strengthen the social forces - to 
increase production, to develop the economy, spread education, 
raise the level of public morality; to increase and multiply.How is power to be strengthened in such a way that, far from 
impeding progress, far from weighing upon it with its rules and 
regulations, it actually facilitates such progress.^ What intensificator 
of power will be able at the same time to be a multiplicator of pro¬ 
duction.^ How will power, by increasing its forces, be able to increase 
those of society instead of confiscating them or impeding them.^ The 
Panopticon’s solution to this problem is that the productive increase 
of power can be assured only if, on the one hand, it can be exercised 
continuously in the very foundations of society, in the subtlest 
possible way, and if, on the other hand, it functions outside these 
sudden, violent, discontinuous forms that are bound up with the 
exercise of sovereignty.The body of the king, with its strange 
material and physical presence, with the force that he himself deploys 
or transmits to some few others, is at the opposite extreme of this 
new physics of power represented by panopticism; the domain of 
panopticism is, on the contrary, that whole lower region, that region 
of irregular bodies, with their details, their multiple movements, 
their heterogeneous forces, their spatial relations; what are required 
are mechanisms that analyse distributions, gaps, series, combina¬ 
tions, and which use instruments that render visible, record, 
differentiate and compare: a physics of a relational and multiple 
power, which has its maximum intensity not in the person of the 
king, but in the bodies that can be individualized by these relations.At the theoretical level, Bentham defines another way of analysing 
the social body and the power relations that traverse it; in terms of 
practice, he defines a procedure of subordination of bodies and forces 
that must increase the utility of power while practising the economy 
of the prince.Panopticism is the general principle of a new ‘political 
anatomy’ whose object and end are not the relations of sovereignty 
but the relations of discipline.
