There are two images, then, of discipline.At one extreme, the 
discipline-blockade, the enclosed institution, established on the 
edges of society, turned inwards towards negative functions: 
arresting evil, breaking communications, suspending time.At the 
other extreme, with panopticism, is the discipline-mechanism: a 
functional mechanism that must improve the exercise of power by 
making it lighter, more rapid, more effective, a design of subtle 
coercion for a society to come.The movement from one project 
to the other, from a schema of exceptional discipline to one of 
a generalized surveillance, rests on a historical transformation: 
the gradual extension of the mechanisms of discipline throughout 
the seventeenth and eighteenth cenmries, their spread throughout the 
whole social body, the formation of what might be called in general 
the disciplinary society.A whole disciplinary generalization - the Benthamite physics of 
power represents an acknowledgement of this - had operated 
throughout the classical age.
