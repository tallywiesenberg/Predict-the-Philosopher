Military discipline is no longer a mere means of preventing looting, 
desertion or failure to obey orders among the troops; it has become 
a basic technique to enable the army to exist, not as an assembled 
crowd, but as a unity that derives from this very unity an increase 
in its forces; discipline increases the skill of each individual, co¬ 
ordinates these skills, accelerates movements, increases fire power, 
broadens the fronts of attack without reducing their vigour, in¬ 
creases the capacity for resistance, etc.The discipline of the work¬ 
shop, while remaining a way of enforcing respect for the regulations 
and authorities, of preventing thefts or losses, tends to increase 
aptitudes, speeds, output and therefore profits; it still exerts a moral 
influence over behaviour, but more and more it treats actions in 
terms of their results, introduces bodies into a machinery, forces into 
an economy.When, in the seventeenth century, the provincial 
schools or the Christian elementary schools were founded, the 
justifications given for them were above all negative: those poor 
who were unable to bring up their children left them ‘in ignorance 
of their obligations: given the difficulties they have in earning a 
living, and themselves having been badly brought up, they are 
unable to communicate a sound upbringing that they themselves 
never had’; this involves three major inconveniences: ignorance of 
God, idleness (with its consequent drunkenness, impurity, larceny, 
brigandage); and the formation of those gangs of beggars, always 
ready to stir up public disorder and ‘virtually to exhaust the funds 
of the Hotel-Dieu’ (Demia, 60-61).Now, at the beginning of the 
Revolution, the end laid down for primary education was to be, 
among other things, to ‘fortify’, to ‘develop the body’, to prepare

the child ‘for a future in some mechanical work’, to give him ‘an 
observant eye, a sure hand and prompt habits’ (Talleyrand’s Report 
to the Constituent Assembly, to September 1791, quoted by Leon, 
106).The disciplines function increasingly as techniques for making 
useful individuals.
