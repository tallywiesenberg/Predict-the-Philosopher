Hence their emergence from a marginal position 
on the confines of society, and detachment from the forms of 
exclusion or expiation, confinement or retreat.Hence the slow 
loosening of their kinship with religious regularities and enclosures.Hence also their rooting in the most important, most central and 
most productive sectors of society.They become attached to some 
of the great essential functions: factory production, the transmission 
of knowledge, the diffusion of aptitudes and skills, the war-machine.Hence, too, the double tendency one sees developing throughout 
the eighteenth century to increase the number of disciplinary instiÂ¬ 
tutions and to discipline the existing apparatuses.
