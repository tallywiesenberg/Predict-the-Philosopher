2.The swarming of disciplinary mechanisms.While, on the one 
hand, the disciplinary establishments increase, their mechanisms 
have a certain tendency to become ‘de-institutionalized’, to emerge 
from the closed fortresses in which they once functioned and to 
circulate in a ‘free’ state; the massive, compact disciplines are broken 
down into flexible methods of control, which may be transferred 
and adapted.Sometimes the closed apparatuses add to their internal 
and specific function a role of external surveillance, developing 
around themselves a whole margin of lateral controls.Thus the 
Christian School must not simply train docile children; it must also 
make it possible to supervise the parents, to gain information as to 
their way of life, their resources, their piety, their morals.
