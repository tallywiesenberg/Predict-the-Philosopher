One has only to cite by way of example the 
regulations for the charity associations in the Paris parishes.The 
territory to be covered was divided into quarters and cantons and 
the members of the associations divided themselves up along the 
same lines.These members had to visit their respective areas 
regularly.‘They will strive to eradicate places of ill-repute, tobacco 
shops, life-classes, gaming house, public scandals, blasphemy, im¬ 
piety, and any other disorders that may come to their knowledge.* 
They will also have to make individual visits to the poor; and the 
information to be obtained is laid down in regulations: the stability 
of the lodging, knowledge of prayers, attendance at the sacraments, 
knowledge of a trade, morality (and ‘whether they have not fallen 
into poverty through their own fault’); lastly, ‘one must learn by 
skilful questioning in what way they behave at home.
