Radzinovitz, 203-14); in France, 
although a part of this role remained in the hands of parish guilds 
or charity associations, another - and no doubt the most important 
part - was very soon taken over by the police apparatus.The organization of a centralized police had long been regarded, 
even by contemporaries, as the most direct expression of royal 
absolutism; the sovereign had wished to have ‘his own magistrate to 
whom he might directly entrust his orders, his commissions, inten¬ 
tions, and who was entrusted with the execution of orders and 
orders under the King’s private seal’ (a note by Duval, first secretary 
at the police magistrature, quoted in Funck-Brentano, i).In effect, 
in taking over a number of pre-existing functions - the search for 
criminals, urban surveillance, economic and political supervision - 
the police magistratures and the magistrature-general that presided 
over them in Paris transposed them into a single, strict, administra¬ 
tive machine: ‘All the radiations of force and information that 
spread from the circumference culminate in the magistrate-general....It is he who operates all the wheels that together produce order 
and harmony.
