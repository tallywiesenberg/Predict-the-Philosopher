Sometimes questions of precedence and ceremonial were settled by 
the court itself: ‘The officers will ride according to the following 
order: namely, at the head two police sergeants; then the patient; 
after the patient, Bonfort and Le Corre on his left will walk together, 
followed by the clerk of the court and in this manner shall go to the 
market square at which place the judgement shall be carried out’ 
(quoted in Corre, 7). Now, this meticulous ceremonial was not only 
legal, but quite explicitly military. The justice of the king was 
shown to be an armed justice. The sword that punished the guilty 
was also the sword that destroyed enemies. A whole military machine 
surrounded the scaffold: cavalry of the watch, archers, guardsmen, 
soldiers. This was intended, of course, to prevent any escape or 
show of force; it was also to prevent any outburst of sympathy or 
anger on the part of the people, any attempt to save the condemned 
or to have them immediately put to death; but it was also a reminder 
that every crime constituted as it were a rebellion against the law 
and that the criminal was an enemy of the prince. All these reasons - 
whether a matter of precaution in particular circumstances or a 
functional element in the performance of the ritual - made the public 
execution more than an act of justice; it was a manifestation of 
force; or rather, it was justice as the physical, material and awesome 
force of the sovereign deployed there. The ceremony of the public 
torture and execution displayed for all to see the power relation 
that gave his force to the law. 

As a ritual of armed law, in which the prince showed himself, 
indissociably, both as head of justice and head of war, the public 
execution had two aspects: one of victory, the other of struggle. 
It brought to a solemn end a war, the outcome of which was 
decided in advance, between the criminal and the sovereign; it had 
to manifest the disproportion of power of the sovereign over those 
whom he had reduced to impotence. The dissymmetry, the irre¬ 
versible imbalance of forces were an essential element in the public 
execution. A body effaced, reduced to dust and thrown to the winds, 
a body destroyed piece by piece by the infinite power of the sover¬ 
eign constituted not only the ideal, but the real limit of punishment. 
Take the celebrated torture and execution of Massola, which took

indignation of contemporaries. This was an apparently paradoxical 
ceremony, since it took place almost entirely after death, and since
