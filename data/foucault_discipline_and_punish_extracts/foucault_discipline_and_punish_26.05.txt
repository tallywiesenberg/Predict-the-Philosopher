And, in order to be exercised, this power had to be given the 
instrument of permanent, exhaustive, omnipresent surveillance, 
capable of making all visible, as long as it could itself remain invisi¬ 
ble.It had to be like a faceless gaze that transformed the whole 
social body into a field of perception: thousands of eyes posted 
everywhere, mobile attentions ever on the alert, a long, hierarchized 
network which, according to Le Maire, comprised for Paris the 
forty-eight commissaires, the twenty inspecteurs, then the ‘observers’, 
who were paid regularly, the ‘basses mouches', or secret agents, who 
were paid by the day, then the informers, paid according to the job 
done, and finally the prostitutes.And this unceasing observation 
had to be accumulated in a series of reports and registers; throughout 
the eighteenth century, an immense police text increasingly covered 
society by means of a complex documentary organization (on the 
police registers in the eighteenth century, cf.Chassaigne).And, 
unlike the methods of judicial or administrative writing, what was 
registered in this way were forms of behaviour, attitudes, possibili¬ 
ties, suspicions - a permanent account of individuals’ behaviour.
