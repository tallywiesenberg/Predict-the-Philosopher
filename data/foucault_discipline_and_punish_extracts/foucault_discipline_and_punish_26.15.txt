The organization of the police apparatus in the eighteenth century 
sanctioned a generalization of the disciplines that became co-exten- 
sive with the state itself.Although it was linked in the most explicit 
way with everything in the royal power that exceeded the exercise 
of regular justice, it is understandable why the police offered such 
slight resistance to the rearrangement of the judicial power; and why 
it has not ceased to impose its prerogatives upon it, with ever- 
increasing weight, right up to the present day; this is no doubt 
because it is the secular arm of the judiciary; but it is also because, 
to a far greater degree than the judicial institution, it is identified, 
by reason of its extent and mechanisms, with a society of the 
disciplinary type.Yet it would be wrong to believe that the dis¬ 
ciplinary functions were confiscated and absorbed once and for all 
by a state apparatus.‘Discipline’ may be identified neither with an institution nor with 
an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, com¬ 
prising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of 
application, targets; it is a ‘physics’ or an ‘anatomy’ of power, a 
technology.And it may be taken over either by ‘specialized’ institu¬ 
tions (the penitentiaries or ‘houses of correction’ of the nineteenth 
centiuy), or by institutions that use it as an essential instrument for a 
particular end (schools, hospitals), or by pre-existing authorities 
that find in it a means of reinforcing or reorganizing their internal 
mechanisms of power (one day we should show how intra-familial 
relations, essentially in the parents-children cell, have become ‘disci¬ 
plined’, absorbing since the classical age external schemata, first

which have made the family the privileged locus of emergence for 
the disciplinary question of the normal and the abnormal); or by 
apparatuses that have made discipline their principle of internal 
functioning (the disciplinarization of the administrative apparatus 
from the Napoleonic period), or finally by state apparatuses whose 
major, if not exclusive, function is to assure that discipline reigns 
over society as a whole (the police).
