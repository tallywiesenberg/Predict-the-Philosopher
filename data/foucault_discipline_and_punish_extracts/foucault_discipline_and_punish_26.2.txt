On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a 
disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from the 
enclosed disciplines, a sort of social ‘quarantine’, to an indefinitely 
generalizable mechanism of ‘panopticism’.Not because the disci¬ 
plinary modality of power has replaced all the others; but because 
it has infiltrated the others, sometimes undermining them, but 
serving as an intermediary between them, linking them together, 
extending them and above all making it possible to bring the effects 
of power to the most minute and distant elements.It assures an 
infinitesimal distribution of the power relations.A few years after Bentham, Julius gave this society its birth 
certificate (Julius, 384-6).Speaking of the panoptic principle, he 
said that there was much more there than architectural ingenuity: 
it was an event in the ‘history of the human mind’.
