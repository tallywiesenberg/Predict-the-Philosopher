In appearance, 
it is merely the solution of a technical problem; but, through it, a 
whole type of society emerges.Antiquity had been a civilization of 
spectacle.‘To render accessible to a multitude of men the inspection 
of a small number of objects’: this was the problem to which the 
architecture of temples, theatres and circuses responded.With 
spectacle, there was a predominance of public life, the intensity of 
festivals, sensual proximity.In these rituals in which blood flowed, 
society found new vigour and formed for a moment a single great 
body.
