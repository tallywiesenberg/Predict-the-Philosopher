The modem age poses the opposite problem: ‘To procure 
for a small number, or even for a single individual, the instantaneous 
view of a great multitude.’ In a society in which the principal 
elements are no longer the community and public life, but, on the 
one hand, private individuals and, on the other, the state, relations 
can be regulated only in a form that is the exact reverse of the 
spectacle: ‘It was to the modern age, to the ever-growing influence 
of the state, to its ever more profound intervention in all the details

and all the relations of social life, that was reserved the task of 
increasing and perfecting its guarantees, by using aind directing 
towards that great aim the building and distribution of buildings 
intended to observe a great multitude of men at the same time.’ 

Julius saw as a fulfilled historical process that which Bentham had 
described as a technical programme.Our society is one not of 
spectacle, but of surveillance; under the surface of images, one 
invests bodies in depth; behind the great abstraction of exchange, 
there continues the meticulous, concrete training of useful forces; 
the circuits of communication are the supports of an accumulation 
and a centralization of knowledge; the play of signs defines the 
anchorages of power; it is not that the beautiful totality of the 
individual is amputated, repressed, altered by our social order, it is 
rather that the individual is carefully fabricated in it, according to a 
whole technique of forces and bodies.We are much less Greeks than 
we believe.We are neither in the amphitheatre, nor on the stage, 
but in the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which 
we bring to ourselves since we are part of its mechanism.The 
importance, in historical mythology, of the Napoleonic character 
probably derives from the fact that it is at the point of junction of 
the monarchical, ritual exercise of sovereignty and the hierarchical, 
permanent exercise of indefinite discipline.
