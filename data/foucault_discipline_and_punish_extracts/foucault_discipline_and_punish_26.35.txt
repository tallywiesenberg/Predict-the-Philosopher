He is the individual who 
looms over everything with a single gaze which no detail, however 
minute, can escape: ‘You may consider that no part of the Empire 
is without surveillance, no crime, no offence, no contravention that 
remains unpunished, and that the eye of the genius who can en¬ 
lighten all embraces the whole of this vast machine, without, how¬ 
ever, the slightest detail escaping his attention’ (Treilhard, 14).At 
the moment of its full blossoming, the disciplinary society still 
assumes with the Emperor the old aspect of the power of spectacle.As a monarch who is at one and the same time a usurper of the 
ancient throne and the organizer of the new state, he combined 
into a single symbolic, ultimate figure the whole of the long process 
by which the pomp of sovereignty, the necessarily spectacular 
manifestations of power, were extinguished one by one in the daily 
exercise of surveillance, in a panopticism in which the vigilance of 
intersecting gazes was soon to render useless both the eagle and 
the sun.217

and, lastly, scientific - of which it forms part.I.
