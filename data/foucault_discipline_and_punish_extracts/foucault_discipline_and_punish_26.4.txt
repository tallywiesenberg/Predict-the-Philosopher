Generally speaking, it might be said that the disciplines are 
techniques for assuring the ordering of human multiplicities.It is 
true that there is nothing exceptional or even characteristic in this; 
every system of power is presented with the same problem.But the 
peculiarity of the disciplines is that they try to define in relation to 
the multiplicities a tactics of power that fulfils three criteria: firstly, 
to obtain the exercise of power at the lowest possible cost (economic¬ 
ally, by the low expenditure it involves; politically, by its discretion, 
its low exteriorization, its relative invisibility, the little resistance it 
arouses); secondly, to bring the effects of this social power to their 
maximum intensity and to extend them as far as possible, without 
either failure or interval; thirdly, to link this ‘economic’ growth of 
power with the output of the apparatuses (educational, military, 
industrial or medical) within which it is exercised; in short, to 
increase both the docility and the utility of all the elements of the 
system.This triple objective of the disciplines corresponds to a 
well-known historical conjuncture.One aspect of this conjuncture 
was the large demographic thrust of the eighteenth century; an 
increase in the floating population (one of the primary objects of 
discipline is to fix; it is an anti-nomadic technique); a change of 
quantitative scale in the groups to be supervised or manipulated 
(from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the eve of the 
French Revolution, the school population had been increasing 
rapidly, as had no doubt the hospital population; by the end of the 
eighteenth century, the peace-time army exceeded 200,000 men).
