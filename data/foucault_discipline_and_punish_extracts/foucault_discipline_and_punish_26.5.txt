For the old principle 
of ‘levying-violence’, which governed the economy of power, the 
disciplines substitute the principle of ‘mildness-production-profit’.These are the techniques that make it possible to adjust the multi¬ 
plicity of men and the multiplication of the apparatuses of produc¬ 
tion (and this means not only ‘production’ in the strict sense, but 
also the production of knowledge and skills in the school, the 
production of health in the hospitals, the production of destructive 
force in the army).In this task of adjustment, discipline had to solve a number of 
problems for which the old economy of power was not sufficiently 
equipped.It could reduce the inefficiency of mass phenomena: 
reduce what, in a multiplicity, makes it much less manageable than 
a unity; reduce what is opposed to the use of each of its elements 
and of their sum; reduce everything that may counter the advantages 
of number.That is why discipline fixes; it arrests or regulates 
movements; it clears up confusion; it dissipates compact groupings 
of individuals wandering about the country in unpredictable ways; 
it establishes calculated distributions.
