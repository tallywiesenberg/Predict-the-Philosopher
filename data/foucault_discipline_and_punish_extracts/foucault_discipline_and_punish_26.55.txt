It must also master all the 
forces that are formed from the very constitution of an organized 
multiplicity; it must neutralize the effects of counter-power that 
spring from them and which form a resistance to the power that 
wishes to dominate it: agitations, revolts, spontaneous organizations, 
coalitions - anything that may establish horizontal conjunctions.219 




Discipline 


Hence the fact that the disciplines use procedures of partitioning 
and verticality, that they introduce, between the different elements 
at the same level, as solid separations as possible, that they define 
compact hierarchical networks, in short, that they oppose to the 
intrinsic, adverse force of multiplicity the technique of the continu¬ 
ous, individualizing pyramid.They must also increase the particular 
utility of each element of the multiplicity, but by means that are the 
most rapid and the least costly, that is to say, by using the multi¬ 
plicity itself as an instrument of this growth.Hence, in order to 
extract from bodies the maximum time and force, the use of those 
overall methods known as time-tables, collective training, exercises, 
total and detailed surveillance.Furthermore, the disciplines must 
increase the effect of utility proper to the multiplicities, so that each 
is made more useful than the simple sum of its elements: it is in 
order to increase the utilizable effects of the multiple that the disci¬ 
plines define tactics of distribution, reciprocal adjustment of bodies, 
gestures and rhythms, differentiation of capacities, reciprocal co¬ 
ordination in relation to apparatuses or tasks.
