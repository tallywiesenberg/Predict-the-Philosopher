Lastly, the disciplines 
have to bring into play the power relations, not above but inside 
the very texture of the multiplicity, as discreetly as possible, as well 
articulated on the other functions of these multiplicities and also in 
the least expensive way possible: to this correspond anonymous 
instruments of power, coextensive with the multiplicity that they 
regiment, such as hierarchical surveillance, continuous registration, 
perpetual assessment and classification.In short, to substitute for a 
power that is manifested through the brilliance of those who exercise 
it, a power that insidiously objectifies those on whom it is applied; 
to form a body of knowledge about these individuals, rather than to 
deploy the ostentatious signs of sovereignty.In a word, the disciÂ¬ 
plines are the ensemble of minute technical inventions that made it 
possible to increase the useful size of multiplicities by decreasing the 
inconveniences of the power which, in order to make them useful, 
must control them.A multiplicity, whether in a workshop or a 
nation, an army or a school, reaches the threshold of a discipline 
when the relation of the one to the other becomes favourable.If the economic take-off of the West began with the techniques 
that made possible the accumulation of capital, it might perhaps be 
said that the methods for administering the accumulation of men

costly, violent forms of power, which soon fell into disuse and were 
superseded by a subtle, calculated technology of subjection.
