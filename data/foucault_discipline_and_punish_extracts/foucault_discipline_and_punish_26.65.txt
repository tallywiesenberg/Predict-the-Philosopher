In fact, 
the two processes - the accumulation of men and the accumulation 
of capital - cannot be separated; it would not have been possible 
to solve the problem of the accumulation of men without the growth 
of an apparatus of production capable of both sustaining them and 
using them; conversely, the techniques that made the cumulative 
multiplicity of men useful accelerated the accumulation of capital.At a less general level, the technological mutations of the apparatus 
of production, the division of labour and the elaboration of the 
disciplinary techniques sustained an ensemble of very close relations 
(cf.Marx, Capital, vol.i, chapter XIII and the very interesting 
analysis in Guerry and Deleule).Each makes the other possible and 
necessary; each provides a model for the other.
