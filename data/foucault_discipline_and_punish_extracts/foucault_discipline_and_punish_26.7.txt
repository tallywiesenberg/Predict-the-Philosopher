The disciplinary 
pyramid constituted the small cell of power within which the 
separation, coordination and supervision of tasks was imposed and 
made efficient; and analytical partitioning of time, gestures and 
bodily forces constituted an operational schema that could easily be 
transferred from the groups to be subjected to the mechanisms of 
production; the massive projection of military methods onto indus¬ 
trial organization was an example of this modelling of the division 
of labour following the model laid down by the schemata of power.But, on the other hand, the technical analysis of the process of 
production, its ‘mechanical’ breaking-down, were projected onto 
the labour force whose task it was to implement it: the constitution 
of those disciplinary machines in which the individual forces that 
they bring together are composed into a whole and therefore 
increased is the effect of this projection.Let us say that discipline 
is the unitary technique by which the body is reduced as a ‘political’ 
force at the least cost and maximized as a useful force.The growth 
of a capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality of disci¬ 
plinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting 
forces and bodies, in short, ‘political anatomy’, could be operated 
in the most diverse political regimes, apparatuses or institutions.2.
