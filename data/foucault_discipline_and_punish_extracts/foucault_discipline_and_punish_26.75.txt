juridico-political structures of a society; it is nonetheless not 
absolutely independent.Historically, the process by which the 
bourgeoisie became in the course of the eighteenth century the politi¬ 
cally dominant class was masked by the establishment of an explicit, 
coded and formally egalitarian juridical framework, made possible 
by the organization of a parliamentary, representative regime.But 
the development and generalization of disciplinary mechanisms 
constituted the other, dark side of these processes.The general 
juridical form that guaranteed a system of rights that were egali¬ 
tarian in principle was supported by these tiny, everyday, physical 
mechanisms, by all those systems of micro-power that are essentially 
non-egalitarian and asymmetrical that we call the disciplines.And 
although, in a formal way, the representative regime makes it pos¬ 
sible, directly or indirectly, with or without relays, for the will of 
all to form the fundamental authority of sovereignty, the disciplines 
provide, at the base, a guarantee of the submission of forces and 
bodies.
