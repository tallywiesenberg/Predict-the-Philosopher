The real, corporal disciplines constituted the foundation of 
the formal, juridical liberties.The contract may have been regarded 
as the ideal foundation of law and political power; panopticism 
constituted the technique, universally widespread, of coercion.It continued to work in depth on the juridical structures of society, 
in order to make the effective mechanisms of power function in 
opposition to the formal framework that it had acquired.The 
‘Enlightenment’, which discovered the liberties, also invented the 
disciplines.In appearance, the disciplines constitute nothing more than an 
infra-law.
