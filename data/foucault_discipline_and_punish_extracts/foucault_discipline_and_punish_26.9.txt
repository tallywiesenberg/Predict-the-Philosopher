We know, for example, how many real procedures undermine the 
legal fiction of the work contract: workshop discipline is not the 
least important.Moreover, whereas the juridical systems define 
juridical subjects according to universal norms, the disciplines 
characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, 
around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another 
and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate.In any case, in the space 
and during the time in which they exercise their control and bring 
into play the asymmetries of their power, they effect a suspension 
of the law that is never total, but is never annulled either.Regular 
and institutional as it may be, the discipline, in its mechanism, is a 
‘counter-law’.And, although the universal juridicism of modem 
society seems to fix limits on the exercise of power, its universally 
widespread panopticism enables it to operate, on the underside of 
the law, a machinery that is both immense and minute, which sup¬ 
ports, reinforces, multiplies the asymmetry of power and under¬ 
mines the limits that are traced around the law.
