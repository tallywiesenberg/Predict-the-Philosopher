The minute disci¬ 
plines, the panopticisms of every day may well be below the level 
of emergence of the great apparatuses and the great political 
struggles.But, in the genealogy of modern society, they have been, 
with the class domination that traverses it, the political counterpart 
of the juridical norms according to which power was redistributed.Hence, no doubt, the importance that has been given for so long 
to the small techniques of discipline, to those apparently insignificant 
tricks that it has invented, and even to those ‘sciences’ that give it a 
respectable face; hence the fear of abandoning them if one cannot 
find any substitute; hence the affirmation that they are at the very 
foundation of society, and an element in its equilibrium, whereas 
they are a series of mechanisms for unbalancing power relations 
definitively and everywhere; hence the persistence in regarding them 
as the humble, but concrete form of every morality, whereas they 
are a set of physico-political techniques.223 


Discipline 


To return to the problem of legal punishments, the prison witli 
all the corrective technology at its disposal is to be resituated at the 
point where the codified power to punish turns into a disciplinary 
power to observe; at the point where the universal punishments of 
the law are applied selectively to certain individuals and always the 
same ones; at the point where the redefinition of the juridical subject 
by the penalty becomes a useful training of the criminal; at the point 
where the law is inverted and passes outside itself, and where the 
counter-law becomes the effective and institutionalized content of 
the juridical forms.What generalizes the power to punish, then, is 
not the universal consciousness of the law in each juridical subject; 
it is the regular extension, the infinitely minute web of panoptic 
techniques.
