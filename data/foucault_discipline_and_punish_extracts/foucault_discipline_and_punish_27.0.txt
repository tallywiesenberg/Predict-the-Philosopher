3.Taken one by one, most of these techniques have a long 
history behind them.But what was new, in the eighteenth century, 
was that, by being combined and generalized, they attained a level 
at which the formation of knowledge and the increase of power 
regularly reinforce one another in a circular process.At this point, 
the disciplines crossed the ‘technological’ threshold.First the 
hospital, then the school, then, later, the workshop were not sim¬ 
ply ‘reordered’ by the disciplines; they became, thanks to them, 
apparatuses such that any mechanism of objectification could be 
used in them as an instrument of subjection, and any growth of 
power could give rise in them to possible branches of knowledge; 
it was this link, proper to the technological systems, that made 
possible within the disciplinary element the formation of clinical 
medicine, psychiatry, child psychology, educational psychology, 
the rationalization of labour.
