There were many reasons why it received little praise; the most 
obvious is that the discourses to which it gave rise rarely acquired, 
except in the academic classifications, the status of sciences; but the 
real reason is no doubt that the power that it operates and which it 
augments is a direct, physical power that men exercise upon one 
another.An inglorious culmination had an origin that could be 
only grudgingly acknowledged.But it would be unjust to compare 
the disciplinary techniques with such inventions as the steam engine 
or Amici’s microscope.They are much less; and yet, in a way, they 
are much more.If a historical equivalent or at least a point of 
comparison had to be found for them, it would be rather in the 
‘inquisitorial’ technique.
