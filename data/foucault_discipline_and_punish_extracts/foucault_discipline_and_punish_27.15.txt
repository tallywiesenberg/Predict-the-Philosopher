The eighteenth century invented the techniques of discipline and 
the examination, rather as the Middle Ages invented the judicial 
investigation.But it did so by quite different means.The investiga¬ 
tion procedure, an old fiscal and administrative technique, had 
developed above all with the reorganization of the Church and the 
increase of the princely states in the twelfth and thirteenth cen¬ 
turies.At this time it permeated to a very large degree the juris¬ 
prudence first of the ecclesiastical courts, then of the lay courts.The investigation as an authoritarian search for a truth observed 
or attested was thus opposed to the old procedures of the oath, 
the ordeal, the judicial duel, the judgement of God or even of the 
transaction between private individuals.
