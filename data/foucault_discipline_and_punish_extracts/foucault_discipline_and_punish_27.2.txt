The investigation was the 
sovereign power arrogating to itself the right to establish the truth 
by a number of regulated techniques.Now, although the investiga¬ 
tion has since then been an integral part of western justice (even up 
to our own day), one must not foi^et either its political origin, its 
link with the birth of the states and of monarchical sovereignty, or 
its later extension and its role in the formation, of knowledge.In 
fact, the investigation has been the no doubt crude, but fundamental 
element in the constitution of the empirical sciences; it has been the 
juridico-political matrix of this experimental knowledge, which, as 
we know, was very rapidly released at the end of the Middle Ages.Discipline 


It is perhaps true to say that, in Greece, mathematics were bom 
from techniques of measurement; the sciences of nature, in any case, 
were born, to some extent, at the end of the Middle Ages, from the 
practices of investigation.The great empirical knowledge that 
covered the things of the world and transcribed them into the 
ordering of an indefinite discourse that observes, describes and 
establishes the ‘facts’ (at a time when the western world was begin¬ 
ning the economic and political conquest of this same world) had 
its operating model no doubt in the Inquisition - that immense 
invention that our recent mildness has placed in the dark recesses 
of our memory.
