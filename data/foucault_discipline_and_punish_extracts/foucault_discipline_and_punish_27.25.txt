But what this politico-juridical, administrative and 
criminal, religious and lay, investigation was to the sciences of 
nature, disciplinary analysis has been to the sciences of man.These 
sciences, which have so delighted our ‘humanity’ for over a century, 
have their technical matrix in the petty, malicious minutiae of the 
disciplines and their investigations.These investigations are perhaps 
to psychology, psychiatry, pedagogy, criminology, and so many 
other strange sciences, what the terrible power of investigation was 
to the calm knowledge of the animals, the plants or the earth.Another power, another knowledge.On the threshold of the classi¬ 
cal age.
