Bacon, lawyer and statesman, tried to develop a methodology 
of investigation for the empirical sciences.What Great Observer 
will produce the methodology of examination for the human 
sciences.^ Unless, of course, such a thing is not possible.For, 
although it is true that, in becoming a technique for the empirical 
sciences, the investigation has detached itself from the inquisitorial 
procedure, in which it was historically rooted, the examination has 
remained extremely close to the disciplinary power that shaped it.It has always been and still is an intrinsic element of the disciplines.Of course it seems to have undergone a speculative purification by 
integrating itself with such sciences as psychology and psychiatry.
