All the great movements of extension that 
characterize modern penality - the problematization of the criminal 
behind his crime, the concern with a punishment that is a correction, 
a therapy, a normalization, the division of the act of judgement 
between various authorities that are supposed to measure, assess, 
diagnose, cure, transform individuals - all this betrays the penetra¬ 
tion of the disciplinary examination into the judicial inquisition.What is now imposed on penal justice as its point of application, 
its ‘useful’ object, will no longer be the body of the guilty man set 
up against the body of the king; nor will it be the juridical subject 
of an ideal contract; it will be the disciplinary individual.The 
extreme point of penal justice under the Ancien Regime was the 
infinite segmentation of the body of the regicide: a manifestation 
of the strongest power over the body of the greatest criminal, 
whose total destruction made the crime explode into its truth.The 
ideal point of penality today would be an indefinite discipline; an 
interrogation without end, an investigation that would be extended 
without limit to a meticulous and ever more analytical observation, 
a judgement that would at the same time be the constitution of a file 
that was never closed, the calculated leniency of a penalty that would 
be interlaced with the ruthless curiosity of an examination, a proce¬ 
dure that would be at the same time the permanent measure of a 
gap in relation to an inaccessible norm and the asymptotic move¬ 
ment that strives to meet in infinity.The public execution was the 
logical culmination of a procedure governed by the Inquisition.
