The prison form antedates its systematic use in the penal 
system.It had already been constituted outside the legal apparatus 
when, throughout the social body, procedures were being elaborated 
for distributing individuals, fixing them in space, classifying them, 
extracting from them the maximum in time and forces, training their 
bodies, coding their continuous behaviour, maintaining them in 
perfect visibility, forming around them an apparatus of observation, 
registration and recording, constituting on them a body of knowÂ¬ 
ledge that is accumulated and centralized.The general form of an 
apparatus intended to render individuals docile and useful, by means 
of precise work upon their bodies, indicated the prison institution, 
before the law ever defined it as the penalty par excellence.At the 
turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was, it is true, 
a penality of detention; and it was a new thing.But it was really the 
opening up of penality to mechanisms of coercion already elaborated 
elsewhere.
