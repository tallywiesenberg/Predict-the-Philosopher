One can understand the self-evident character that prison punish¬ 
ment very soon assumed.In the first years of the nineteenth century, 
people were still aware of its novelty; and yet it appeared so bound 
up and at such a deep level with the very functioning of soci¬ 
ety that it banished into oblivion all the other punishments that 
the eighteenth-century reformers had imagined.It seemed to have 
no alternative, as if carried along by the very movement of histor)^ 
‘It is not chance, it is not the whim of the legislator that have made 
imprisonment the base and almost the entire edifice of our present 
penal scale: it is the progress of ideas and the improvement in 
morals’ (Van Meenan, 529-30).And, although, in a little over a 
century, this self-evident character has become transformed, it has 
not disappeared.We are aware of all the inconveniences of prison, 
and that it is dangerous when it is not useless.
