And yet one cannot 
‘see’ how to replace it.It is the detestable solution, which one seems 
unable to do without.This ‘self-evident’ character of the prison, which we find so diffi¬ 
cult to abandon, is based first of all on the simple form of ‘depriva¬ 
tion of liberty’.How could prison not be the penalty par excellence 
in a society in which liberty is a good that belongs to all in the same 
way and to which each individual is attached, as Duport put it, by 
a ‘universal and constant’ feeling.^ Its loss has therefore the same 
value for all; unlike the fine, it is an ‘egalitarian’ punishment.The 
prison is the clearest, simplest, most equitable of penalties.
