The prison is 
‘namral’, just as the use of time to measure exchanges is ‘natural’ 
in our society.^ 

But the self-evidence of the prison is also based on its role, 
supposed or demanded, as an apparatus for transforming individuals.How could the prison not be immediately accepted when, by locking 
up, retraining and rendering docile, it merely reproduces, with a 
little more emphasis, all the mechanisms that are to be found in the 
social body?The prison is like a rather disciplined barracks, a strict 
school, a dark workshop, but not qualitatively different.This double 
foundation - juridico-economic on the one hand, technico-disciplin- 
ary on the other - made the prison seem the most immediate and 
civilized form of all penalties.And it is this double functioning that 
immediately gave it its solidity.
