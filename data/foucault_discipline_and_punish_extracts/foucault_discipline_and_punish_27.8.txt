One thing is clear: the prison was 
not at first a deprivation of liberty to which a technical function of 
correction was later added; it was from the outset a form of ‘legal 
detention’ entrusted with an additional corrective task, or an enter¬ 
prise for reforming individuals that the deprivation of liberty 
allowed to function in the legal system.In short, penal imprison¬ 
ment, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, covered both 
the deprivation of liberty and the technical transformation of 
individuals.Let us remember a number of facts.In the codes of 1808 and i8io, 
and the measures that immediately preceded or followed them, 
imprisonment was never confused with mere deprivation of liberty.It was, or in any case had to be, a differentiated and finalized mechan¬ 
ism.
