Differentiated because it had to have the same form, whether 
the prisoner had been sentenced or was merely accused, whether he 
was a minor offender or a criminal: the various types of prison - 
maison d’arret, maison de correction, maison centrale — ought in

reward, they will acquire the habit, the taste, the need for occupa¬ 
tion; let them give each other the example of a laborious life; it will 
soon become a pure life; soon they will begin to know regret for the 
past, the first harbinger of a love of duty.’* The techniques of cor¬ 
rection immediately form part of the institutional framework of 
penal detention.
