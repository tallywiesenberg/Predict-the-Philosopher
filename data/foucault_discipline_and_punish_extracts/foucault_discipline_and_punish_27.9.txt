One should also recall that the movement for reforming the pri¬ 
sons, for controlling their functioning is not a recent phenomenon.It does not even seem to have originated in a recognition of failure.Prison ‘reform’ is virtually contemporary with the prison itself: it 
constitutes, as it were, its programme.From the outset, the prison 
was caught up in a series of accompanying mechanisms, whose 
purpose was apparently to correct it, but which seem to form part 
of its very functioning, so closely have they been bound up with its 
existence throughout its long history.There was, at once, a prolix 
technology of the prison.
