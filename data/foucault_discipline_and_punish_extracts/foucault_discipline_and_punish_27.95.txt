There were inquiries: that of Chaptal in 
i8oi (whose task it was to discover what could be used to introduce 
the modern prison system into France), that of Decazes in 1819, 
Villerme’s work published in 1820, the report on the maisons cen¬ 
trales drawn up by Martignac in 1829, the inquiries carried out in 
the United States by Beaumont and Tocqueville in 1831, by Demetz 
and Blouet in 1835, the questionnaires addressed by Montalivet to 
the directors of the maisons centrales and to the general councils of 
the dipartements during the debate on solitary confinement.There 
were societies for supervising the functioning of the prisons and for 
suggesting improvements: in 1818, the very official SocUti pour 
Vamelioration des prisons, a little later the Sociiti des prisons and 
various philanthropic groups.Innumerable measures - orders.234

instructions or laws: from the reform that the first Restoration had 
envisaged in September 1814, and which was never implemented, to 
the law of 1844, drawn up by Tocqueville, which ended for a time 
the long debate on the means of making imprisonment effective.There were programmes drawn up to improve the functioning of 
the machine-prison:® programmes for the treatment of the prisoners, 
models for material improvement, some of these, like those of 
Danjou and Harou-Romain, remaining no more than projects, 
others becoming embodied in instructions (like the circular of 9 
August 1841 on the building of maisons d’arret), others becoming 
actual buildings, such as the Petite Roquette in which cellular 
imprisonment was organized for the first time in France.
