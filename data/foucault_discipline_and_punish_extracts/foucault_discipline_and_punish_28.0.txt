To these should be added the publications that sprang more or 
less directly from the prison and were drawn up either by philan¬ 
thropists like Appert, or a little later by ‘specialists’ (such as the 
Armales de la CharidY or, again, by former prisoners; Pauvre 
Jacques at the end of the Restoration, or the Gazette de Sainte- 
Pilagie at the beginning of the July monarchy.® 

The prison should not be seen as an inert institution, shaken at 
intervals by reform movements.The ‘theory of the prison’ was its 
constant set of operational instructions rather than its incidental 
criticism - one of its conditions of functioning.The prison has 
always formed part of an active field in which projects, improve¬ 
ments, experiments, theoretical statements, personal evidence and 
investigations have proliferated.The prison institution has always 
been a focus of concern and debate.Is the prison still, then, a dark, 
abandoned region.^ Is the fact that one has ceased to say so for 
almost 200 years sufficient proof that it is not.^ In becoming a legal 
punishment, it weighted the old juridico-political question of the 
right to punish with all the problems, all the agitations that have 
surrounded the corrective technologies of the individual.
