It must be the most powerful machinery for imposing 
a new form on the perverted individual; its mode of action is the 
constraint of a total education: ‘In prison the government may 
dispose of the liberty of the person and of the time of the prisoner; 
from then on, one can imagine the power of the education which, 
not only in a day, but in the succession of days and even years, may 
regulate for man the time of waking and sleeping, of activity and rest, 
the number and duration of meals, the quality and ration of food, 
the nature and product of labour, the time of prayer, the use of 
speech and even, so to speak, that of thought, that education which, 
in the short, simple journeys from refectory to workshop, from 
workshop to the cell, regulates the movements of the body, and even 
in moments of rest, determines the use of time, the time-table, this 
education, which, in short, takes possession of man as a whole, of 
all the physical and moral faculties that are in him and of the time 
in which he is himself’ (Lucas, II, 123-4).This complete ‘reforma¬ 
tory’ lays down a recoding of existence very different from the mere 
juridical deprivation of liberty and very different, too, from the 
simple mechanism of exempla imagined by the reformers at the time 
of the ideologues.I.The first principle was isolation.The isolation of the convict 
from the external world, from everything that motivated the offence, 
from the complicities that facilitated it.
