Lastly, 
and perhaps above all, the isolation of the convicts guarantees that 
it is possible to exercise over them, with maximum intensity, a 
power that will not be overthrown by any other influence; solitude 
is the primary condition of total submission: ‘Just imagine,’ said 
Charles Lucas, referring to the role of the governor, the instructor, 
the chaplain and other ‘charitable persons’ as regards the isolated 
convict, ‘just imagine the power of human speech intervening in 
the midst of the terrible discipline of silence to speak to the heart, 
to the soul, to the human person’ (Lucas, I, 167).Isolation provides 
an intimate exchange between the convict and the power that is 
exercised over him.It is at this point that the debate on the two American systems of 
imprisonment, that of Auburn and that of Philadelphia, was situated.In fact, this debate, which was so wide-ranging and long drawn out,*

concerned only the way in which isolation should be used, it being 
accepted by all.The Auburn model prescribed the individual cell during the 
night, work and meals in common, but under the rule of absolute 
silence, the convicts being allowed to speak only to the warders, 
with their permission and in a low voice.
