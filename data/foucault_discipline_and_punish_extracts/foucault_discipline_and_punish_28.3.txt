It was a clear reference to 
the monastic model; a reference, too, to the discipline of the work¬ 
shop.The prison must be the microcosm of a perfect society in 
which individuals are isolated in their moral existence, but in which 
they come together in a strict hierarchical framework, with no 
lateral relation, communication being possible only in a vertical 
direction.The advantage of the Auburnian system, according to its 
advocates, was that it formed a duplication of society itself.Con¬ 
straint was assured by material means, but above all by a rule that 
one had to learn to respect and which was guaranteed by surveillance 
and punishment.Rather than keep the convicts ‘under lock and key 
like wild beasts in their cages’, they must be brought together, 
‘made to join together in useful exercises, forced together to adopt 
good habits, preventing moral contagion by active surveillance, 
maintaining reflection by the rule of silence’; this rule accustoms the 
convict ‘to regard the law as a sacred precept whose violation brings 
just and legitimate harm’ (Mittermaier, in Revue fran<iaise et itrangere 
de Ugislation, 1836).
