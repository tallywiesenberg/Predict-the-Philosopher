At Cherry 
Hill, ‘the walls are the punishment of the crime; the cell confronts 
the convict with himself; he is forced to listen to his conscience’.Hence work there is more in the nature of a consolation than an 
obligation; supervisors do not have to exert force - this is assured 
by the materiality of things - and consequently, their authority may 
be accepted: ‘At each visit, a few benevolent words flow from this 
honest mouth and bring to the heart of the inmate gratitude, hope 
and consolation; he loves his warder; and he loves him because he 
is gentle and sympathetic.Walls are terrible, but man is good’ 
(Blouet).In this closed cell, this temporary sepulchre, the myths of 
resurrection arise easily enough.After night and silence, the regener¬ 
ated life.
