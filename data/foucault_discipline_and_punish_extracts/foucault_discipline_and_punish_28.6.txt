This is to be found as early as the code of 1808: ‘Although the 
penalty inflicted by the law has as its aim the reparation of a crime, 
it is also intended to reform the convict, and this double aim will 
be fulfilled if the malefactor is snatched from that fatal idleness 
which, having brought him to prison, meets him again within its 
walls and, seizing hold of him, brings him to the ultimate degree of 
depravity.’® Work is neither an addition nor a corrective to the 
regime of detention; whether it is a question of forced labour, 
reclusion or imprisonment, it is conceived, by the legislator himself, 
as necessarily accompanying it.But the necessity involved is pre¬ 
cisely not the necessity of which the eighteenth-century reformers 
spoke, when they wished to make imprisonment either an example 
for the public or a useful reparation for society.In the carceral 
regime, the link between work and punishment is of another type.Several polemics that took place under the Restoration and the 
July Monarchy throw light on the function attributed to penal 
labour.First, there was the debate on the subject of wages.
