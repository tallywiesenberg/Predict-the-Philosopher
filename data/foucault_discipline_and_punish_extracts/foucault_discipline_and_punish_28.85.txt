Penal labour cannot be 
criricized for any unemployment it may give rise to: with its limited 
extent, and its low output, it cannot have a general effect on the 
economy.It is intrinsically useful, not as an activity of production, 
but by virtue of the effect it has on the human mechanism.It is a 
principle of order and regularity; through the demands that it 
imposes, it conveys, imperceptibly, the forms of a rigorous power; 
it bends bodies to regular movements, it excludes agitation and 
distraction, it imposes a hierarchy and a surveillance that are all the 
more accepted, and which will be inscribed all the more deeply in 
the behaviour of the convicts, in that they form part of its logic: 
with work ‘the rule is introduced into a prison, it reigns there with¬ 
out effort, without the use of any repressive and violent means.By occupying the convict, one gives him habits of order and obedi¬ 
ence; one makes the idler that he was diligent and active ... with 
time, he finds in the regular movement of the prison, in the manual 
labours to which he is subjected ... a certain remedy against the 
wanderings of his imagination’ (B 4 renger).Penal labour must be 
seen as the very machinery that transforms the violent, agitated, 
unreflective convict into a part that plays its role with perfect 
regularity.
