The prison is not a workshop; it is, it must be of itself, 
a machine whose convict-workers are both the cogs and the pro¬ 
ducts; it ‘occupies them continually, with the sole aim of filling their 
moments.When the body is agitated, when the mind applies itself 
to a particular object, importunate ideas depart, calm is born once 
again in the soul’ (Danjou, 180).If, in the final analysis, the work of 
the prison has an economic effect, it is by producing individuals 
mechanized according to the general norms of an industrial society: 
‘Work is the providence of the modern peoples; it replaces morality, 
fills the gap left by beliefs and is regarded as the principle of all good.Work must be the religion of the prisons.For a machine-society, 
purely mechanical means of reform are required’ (Faucher, 64; in 
England the ‘treadmill’ and the pump provided a disciplinary 
mechanization of the inmates, with no end product).
