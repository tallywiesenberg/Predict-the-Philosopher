atrocity: it must bring it to light by confessions, statements, inscrip¬ 
tions that make it public; it must reproduce it in ceremonies that 
apply it to the body of the guilty person in the form of humiliation 
and pain. Atrocity is that part of the crime that the punishment 
turns back as torture in order to display it in the full light of day: 
it is a figure inherent in the mechanism that produces the visible 
truth of the crime at the very heart of the punishment itself. The 
public execution formed part of the procedure that established the 
reality of what one punished. Furthermore, the atrocity of a crime 
was also the violence of the challenge flung at the sovereign; it was 
that which would move him to make a reply whose function was to 
go further than this atrocity, to master it, to overcome it by an 
excess that annulled it. The atrocity that haunted the public execu¬ 
tion played, therefore, a double role: it was the principle of the 
communication between the crime and the punishment, it was also 
the exacerbation of the punishment in relation to the crime. It pro¬ 
vided the spectacle with both truth and power; it was the culmina¬ 
tion of the ritual of the investigation and the ceremony in which the 
sovereign triumphed. And it joined both together in the tortured 
body. The punitive practice of the nineteenth century was to strive 
to put as much distance as possible between the ‘serene’ search for 
truth and the violence that cannot be entirely effaced from punish¬ 
ment. It set out to mark the heterogeneity that separates the c“ime 
that is to be punished and the punishment imposed by the public 
power. Between truth and punishment, there should no longer be 
any other relation than one of legitimate consequence. The punish¬ 
ing power should not soil its hands with a crime greater than the 
one it wished to punish. It should remain innocent of the penalty

that it inflicts. ‘Let us hasten to proscribe such tortures. They were 
worthy only of the crowned monsters who governed the Romans’ 
(Pastoret, on the subject of the punishment of regicides, II, 6i). But, 
according to the penal practice of the preceding period, the proxim¬ 
ity in the public execution of the sovereign and the crime, the mix¬ 
ture that was produced in it of ‘demonstration’ and punishment, 
were not the result of a barbarous confusion; what joined them 
together was the mechanism of atrocity and its necessary concatena¬ 
tions. The atrocity of the expiation organized the ritual destruction 
of infamy by omnipotence. 

The fact that the crime and the punishment were related and 
bound up in the form of atrocity was not the result of some ob¬
