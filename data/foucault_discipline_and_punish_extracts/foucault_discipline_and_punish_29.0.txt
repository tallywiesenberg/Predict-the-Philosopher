November 1845); they also teach those who have lived in dissipa¬ 
tion the virtues of thrift and foresight (Lucas; a third of the prisoner’s 
daily wages was set aside for the day when he left the prison); lastly, 
by proposing a quantity of work to be carried out, they make it 
possible to express quantitatively the convict’s zeal and the progress 
of his improvement (Ducp^tiaux, 30-31).The wages of penal labour 
do not reward production; they function as a motive and measure 
of individual transformation: it is a legal fiction, since it does not 
represent the ‘free’ granting of labour power, but an artifice that 
is presumed to be effective in the techniques of correction.What, then, is the use of penal labour.^ Not profit; nor even the 
formation of a useful skill; but the constitution of a power relation, 
an empty economic form, a schema of individual submission and of 
adjustment to a production apparatus.The perfect image of prison labour was the women’s workshop 
at Clairvaux; the silent precision of the human machinery is reminis¬ 
cent of the regulated rigour of the convent: ‘On a throne, above 
which is a crucifix, a sister is sitting; before her, arranged in two 
rows, the prisoners are carrying out the task imposed on them, and, 
as needlework accounts for almost all the work, the strictest silence 
is constantly maintained..
