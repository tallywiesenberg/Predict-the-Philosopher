3.But prison goes beyond the mere privation of liberty in a 
more important way.It becomes increasingly an instrument for the 
modulation of the penalty; an apparatus which, through the execu¬

right, in part at least, to assume its principle.Of course, the prison 
institution was not given this ‘right’ in the nineteenth century or 
even in the twentieth, except in a fragmentary form (through the 
oblique way of release on licence, semi-release, the organization of 
reformatories).But it should be noted that it was claimed very 
early on by those responsible for prison administration, as the very 
condition of the good functioning of a prison, and of its efficiency 
in the task of reformation that the law itself had given it.
