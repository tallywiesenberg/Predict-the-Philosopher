The same goes for the duration of the punishment; it makes it 
possible to quantify the penalties exactly, to graduate them accord¬ 
ing to circumstances and to give to legal punishment the more or less 
explicit form of wages; but it also runs the risk of having no correc¬ 
tive value, if it is fixed once and for all in the sentence, The length 
of the penalty must not be a measurement of the ‘exchange value’ 
of the offence; it must be adjusted to the ‘useful’ transformation of 
the inmate during his term of imprisonment.It is not a time- 
measure, but a time finalized.The form of the operation, rather 
than the form of the wages.‘Just as the prudent physician ends his 
medication or continues it according to whether the patient has 
or has not arrived at a perfect cure, so, in the first of these two 
hypotheses, expiation ought to end with the complete reform of the 
prisoner; for, in this case, all detention has become useless, and from 
then on as inhuman to the reformed individual as it is vainly burden¬ 
some for the State.’*® The correct duration of the penalty must be 
calculated, therefore, not only according to the particular crime and

its circumstances, but also according to the penalty itself as it takes 
place in actual fact.This amounts to saying that, although the 
penalty must be individualized, it is so not on the basis of the 
individual-offender, the juridical subject of his act, the responsible 
author of the offence, but on the basis of the individual punished, 
the object of a supervised transformation, the individual in detention 
inserted in the prison apparatus, modified by it or reacting to it.
