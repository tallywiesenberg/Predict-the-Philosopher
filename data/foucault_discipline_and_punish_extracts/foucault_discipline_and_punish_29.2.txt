‘It 
is a question only of reforming the evil-doer.Once this reform has 
come about, the criminal must return to society’ (C. Lucas, quoted 
in the Gazette des tribunaux, 6 April 1837).The quality and content of detention should no longer be deter¬ 
mined by the nature of the offence alone.The juridical gravity of a 
crime does not at all have the value of a univocal sign for the 
character of the convict, whether or not he is capable of reform.In 
particular the crime-offence distinction, which the penal code 
recognized in drawing the corresponding distinction between mere 
imprisonment and imprisonment with hard labour, is not opera¬ 
tional in terms of reform.
