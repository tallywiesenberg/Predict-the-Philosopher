This was the almost universal opinion 
expressed by the directors of the maisons centrales, during an inquiry 
carried out by the ministry in 1836: ‘The minor offenders are gener¬ 
ally the most vicious...Among the criminals, one meets many 
men who have given in to the violence of their passions and to the 
needs of a large family.’ ‘The behaviour of criminals is much better 
than that of the minor offenders; the former are more submissive, 
harder-working than the latter, who, in general, are pickpockets, 
debauchees and idlers.’*' Hence the idea that punitive rigour must 
not be in direct proportion to the penal importance of the offence - 
nor determined once and for all.As an operation of correction, imprisonment has its own require¬ 
ments and dangers.
