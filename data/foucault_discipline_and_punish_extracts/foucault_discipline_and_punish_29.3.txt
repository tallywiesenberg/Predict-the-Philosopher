It is its effects that must determine its stages, its 
temporary increases, its successive reductions, in severity; what 
Charles Lucas called the ‘mobile classification of moralities’.The 
progressive system applied at Geneva since 1825 was often advo¬ 
cated in France (Fresnel, 29-31).It took the form, for example, of 
three areas; a trial area for prisoners in general, a punishment area 
and a reward area for those who had embarked on the way of reform 
(Lucas, II, 440).Or it took the form of four phases: a period of 
intimidation (deprivation of work and of any internal or external

phase of forced idleness, would be welcomed as a benefit); a regime 
of moralization (more or less frequent ‘lectures’ from the directors 
and official visitors); a period of work in common (Duras).Although 
the principle of the penalty was certainly a legal decision, its 
administration, its quality and its rigours must belong to an autono¬ 
mous mechanism that supervises the effects of punishment within the 
very apparatus that produces them.
