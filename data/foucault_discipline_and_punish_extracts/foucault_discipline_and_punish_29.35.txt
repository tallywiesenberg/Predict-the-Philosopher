A whole regime of punishments 
and rewards that is a way not simply of gaining respect for the prison 
regulations, but of making the action of the prison on the inmates 
effective.The legal authority itself came to accept this: ‘One should 
not be surprised, said the supreme court of appeal, when consulted 
on the subject of a bill concerning the prisons, at the idea of granting 
rewards, which might consist either for the most part in money, or 
in a better diet, or even in a reduction of the duration of the penalty.If anything can awaken in the minds of convicts the notions of good 
and evil, bring them to moral reflections and raise them to some 
extent in their own eyes, it is the possibility of obtaining some 
reward’ (Lucas, II, 441-2).And it must be admitted that the legal authorities can have no 
immediate control over all these procedures that rectify the penalty 
as it proceeds.It is a question, in effect, of measures that by 
definition can intervene only after the sentence and can bear only on 
something other than the offences.
