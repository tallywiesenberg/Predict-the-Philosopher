Those who administer detention 
must therefore have an indispensable autonomy, when it comes to 
the question of individualizing and varying the application of the 
penalty: supervisors, a prison governor, a chaplain or an instructor 
are more capable of exercising this corrective function than those 
who hold the penal power.It is their judgement (understood as

called upon to reign as sovereign in the prison ... who, in order not 
to fall short in his mission, must combine the most eminent virtue 
with a profound knowledge of mankind’ (Berenger).
