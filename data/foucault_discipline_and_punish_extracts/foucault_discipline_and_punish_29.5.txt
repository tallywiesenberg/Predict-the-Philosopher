the very functioning of the prison.The sign of this autonomy is 
very apparent in the ‘useless’ acts of violence perpetrated by warders 
or in the despotism of an administration that has all the privileges of 
an enclosed community.Its roots lie elsewhere: precisely in the fact 
that the prison is required to be ‘useful’, that the deprivation of 
liberty — that juridical levying on an ideal property - must, from 
the outset, have exercised a positive technical role, operating trans¬ 
formations on individuals.And, for this operation, the carceral 
apparatus has recourse to three great schemata: the politico-moral 
schema of individual isolation and hierarchy; the economic model 
of force applied to compulsory work; the technico-medical model 
of cure and normalization.
