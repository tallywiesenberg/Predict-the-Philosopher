scurely accepted law of retaliation. It was the effect, in the rites of 
punishment, of a certain mechanism of power: of a power that not 
only did not hesitate to exert itself directly on bodies, but was 
exalted and strengthened by its visible manifestations; of a power 
that asserted itself as an armed power whose functions of maintain¬ 
ing order were not entirely unconnected with the functions of war; 
of a power that presented rules and obligations as personal bonds, a 
breach of which constituted an offence and called for vengeance; 
of a power for which disobedience was an act of hostility, the first 
sign of rebellion, which is not in principle different from civil war; 
of a power that had to demonstrate not why it enforced its laws, 
but who were its enemies, and what unleashing of force threatened 
them; of a power which, in the absence of continual supervision, 
sought a renewal of its effect in the spectacle of its individual mani¬ 
festations; of a power that was recharged in the ritual display of its 
reality as ‘super-power’. 

Of all the reasons why punishment that was not in the least 
ashamed of being ‘atrocious’ was replaced by punishment that was 
to claim the honour of being ‘humane’ there is one that must be 
analysed at once, for it is internal to the public execution itself: at 
once an element of its functioning and the principle of its perpetual 
disorder. 

In the ceremonies of the public execution, the main character was 
the people, whose real and immediate presence was required for the 
performance. An execution that was known to be taking place, but

which did so in secret, would scarcely have had any meaning. The 
aim was to make an example, not only by making people aware that 
the slightest offence was likely to be punished, but by arousing 
feelings of terror by the spectacle of power letting its anger fall upon 
the guilty person: ‘In criminal matters, the most difficult point is 
the imposition of the penalty: it is the aim and the end of the 
procedure, and its only fruit, by example and terror, when it is well 
applied to the guilty person’ (Bruneau, unnumbered preface to the 
first part). 

But, in this scene of terror, the role of the people was an ambigu¬ 
ous one. People were summoned as spectators: they were assembled 
to observe public exhibitions and amendes honorables; pillories,
