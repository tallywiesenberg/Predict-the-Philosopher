But 
very soon - and this is a characteristic fact - these debates were to 
become a battle for appropriating control of this additional peni¬ 
tentiary element; the judges were to demand a right of inspection 
over the carceral mechanisms: ‘The moral enlightenment of the 
inmates requires innumerable cooperators; it is only by visits of 
inspection, commissions of surveillance and charity associations that 
this may be accomplished.Auxiliaries, then, are needed and it is the 
judges who must provide them’ (Ferrus, viii; an ordinance of 1847 
had set up commissions of surveillance).From this period, the 
penitentiary order had become sufficiently well established for there 
to be no question of dismantling it; the question was how to get 
control of it.This gave rise to the figure of the judge obsessed by a 
desire for prison.A century later, this was to give birth to a bastard, 
yet deformed child: the magistrate entrusted with the determination 
of penalties.
