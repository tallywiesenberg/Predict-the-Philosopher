It must be possible to hold the 
prisoner under permanent observation; every report that can be 
made about him must be recorded and computed.The theme of the 
Panopticon - at once surveillance and observation, security and 
knowledge, individualization and totalization, isolation and trans¬ 
parency - found in the prison its privileged locus of realization.Although the panoptic procedures, as concrete forms of the exercise 
of power, have become extremely widespread, at least in their less 
concentrated forms, it was really only in the penitentiary institu¬ 
tions that Bentham’s utopia could be fully expressed in a material 
form.In the 1830s, the Panopticon became the architectural pro¬ 
gramme of most prison projects.It was the most direct way of 
expressing ‘the intelligence of discipline in stone’ (Lucas, I, 69); of 
making architecture transparent to the administration of power;^® 
of making it possible to substitute for force or other violent con¬ 
straints the gentle efficiency of total surveillance; of ordering space 
according to the recent humanization of the codes and the new 
penitentiary theory: ‘The authorities, on the one hand, and the 
architect, on the other, must know, therefore, whether the prisons 
are to be based on the principle of milder penalties or on a system 
of reforming convicts, in accordance with legislation which, by 
getting to the root cause of the people’s vices, becomes a principle 
that will regenerate the virtues that they must practice’ (Baltard, 4-5).
