The more accurate and easy the 
surveillance, the less need will there be to seek in the strength of the 
building guarantees against attempted escape and communication 
between the inmates.But surveillance will be perfect if from a central 
hall the director or head-warder sees, without moving and without 
b«ng seen, not only the entrances of all the cells and even the inside 
of most of them when the unglazed door is open, but also the 
warders guarding the prisoners on every floor... With the formula 
of circular or semi-circular prisons, it would be possible to see from 
a single centre all the prisoners in their cells and the warders in the 
inspection galleries’ (Ducatel, 9).But the penitentiary Panopticon was also a system of individual¬ 
izing and permanent documentation.The same year in which 
variants of the Benthamite schema were recommended for the 
building of prisons, the system of ‘moral accounting’ was made 
compulsory: an individual report of a uniform kind in every prison, 
on which the governor or head-warder, the chaplain and the 
instructor had to fill in their observations on each inmate: ‘It is in a 
way the vade mecum of prison administration, making it possible to 
assess each case, each circumstance and, consequently, to know 
what treatment to apply to each prisoner individually’ (Ducpetiaux, 
56-7).Many other, much more complete, systems of recording were 
planned or tried out (cf., for example, Gregory, i99ff; Grellet- 
Wammy, 23-5 and 199-203).
