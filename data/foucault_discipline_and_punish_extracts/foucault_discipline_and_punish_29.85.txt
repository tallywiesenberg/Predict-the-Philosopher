The overall aim was to make the 
prison a place for the constitution of a body of knowledge that 
would regulate the exercise of penitentiary practice.The prison has 
not only to know the decision of the judges and to apply it in terms

of the established regulations: it has to extract unceasingly from the 
inmate a body of knowledge that will make it possible to transform 
the penal measure into a penitentiary operation; which will make of 
the penalty required by the offence a modification of the inmate that 
will be of use to society.The autonomy of the carceral regime and 
the knowledge that it creates make it possible to increase the utility 
of the penalty, which the code had made the very principle of its 
punitive philosophy: ‘The governor must not lose sight of a single 
inmate, because in whatever part of the prison the inmate is to be 
found, whether he is entering or leaving, or whether he is staying 
there, the governor must also justify the motives for his staying in 
a particular classification or for his movement from one to another.He is a veritable accountant.Each inmate is for him, in the sphere 
of individual education, a capital invested with penitentiary interest’ 
(Lucas, II, 449-50).
