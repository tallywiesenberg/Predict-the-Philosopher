As a highly efficient technology, penitentiary 
practice produces a return on the capital invested in the penal system 
and in the building of heavy prisons.Similarly, the offender becomes an individual to know.This 
demand for knowledge was not, in the first instance, inserted into 
the legislation itself, in order to provide substance for the sentence 
and to determine the true degree of guilt.It is as a convict, as a point 
of application for punitive mechanisms, that the offender is conÂ¬ 
stituted himself as the object of possible knowledge.But this implies that the penitentiary apparatus, with the whole 
technological programme that accompanies it, brings about a 
curious substitution: from the hands of justice, it certainly receives 
a convicted person; but what it must apply itself to is not, of course, 
the offence, nor even exactly the offender, but a rather different 
object, one defined by variables which at the outset at least were not 
taken into account in the sentence, for they were relevant only for 
a corrective technology.
