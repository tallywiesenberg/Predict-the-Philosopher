I have translated the word by ‘torture’, ‘public execution’ or ‘scaffold’. 
The author also refers to another form of torture, 'la question', the extrac¬

References to other works are usually given not in footnotes but in an 
abbreviated form in the text itself. These references, in brackets, consist 
of the author’s name and a page number; dates of publication are used to 
distinguish more than one work by an author, and roman numerals refer 
to volume numbers. Full references are to be found in the Bibliography.

horses and his limbs and body consumed by fire, reduced to ashes 
and his ashes thrown to the winds’ {Pieces originales ..., 372-4). 

‘Finally, he was quartered,’ recounts the Gaiette d’Amsterdam of 
I April 1757. ‘This last operation was very long, because the horses 
used were not accustomed to drawing; consequently, instead of 
four, six were needed; and when that did not suffice, they were 
forced, in order to cut off the wretch’s thighs, to sever the sinews 
and hack at the joints...
