Knowledge of the 
offence, knowledge of the offender, knowledge of the law: these 
three conditions made it possible to ground a judgement in truth.But now a quite different question of truth is inscribed in the course 
of the penal judgement.The question is no longer simply: ‘Has the 
act been established and is it punishable!*’ But also: ‘What is this act, 
what is this act of violence or this murder.^ To what level or to what 
field of reality does it belong.^ Is it a phantasy, a psychotic reaction, a 
delusional episode, a perverse action.^’ It is no longer simply: ‘Who 
committed it.^’ But: ‘How can we assign the causal process that 
produced it.^ Where did it originate in the author himself.’ Instinct, 
unconscious, environment, heredity.’’ It is no longer simply: ‘What 
law punishes this offence.’’ But: ‘What would be the most appropriate 
measures to take.’ How do we see the future development of the 
offender.’ What would be the best way of rehabilitating him.’’ A 
whole set of assessing, diagnostic, prognostic, normative judge¬ 
ments concerning the criminal have become lodged in the frame¬ 
work of penal judgement.Another truth has penetrated the truth 
that was required by the legal machinery; a truth which, entangled 
with the first, has turned the assertion of guilt into a strange 
scientifico-juridical complex.
