Not only the 
examination of the criminal suspected of insanity, but the very 
effects of this examination had to be external and anterior to the 
sentence.But, very soon, the courts of the nineteenth century began 
to misunderstand the meaning of article 64.Despite several decisions 
of the supreme court of appeal confirming that insanity could not 
result either in a light penalty, or even in an acquittal, but required 
that the case be dismissed, the ordinary courts continued to bring 
the question of insanity to bear on their verdicts.They accepted 
that one could be both guilty and mad; less guilty the madder one 
was; guilty certainly, but someone to be put away and treated rather 
than punished; not only a guilty man, but also dangerous, since 
quite obviously sick, etc.From the point of view of the penal code, 
the result was a mass of juridical absurdities.
