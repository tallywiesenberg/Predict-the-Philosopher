But this was the starting 
point of an evolution that jurisprudence and legislation itself was to 
precipitate in the course of the next 150 years: already the reform 
of 1832, introducing attenuating circumstances, made it possible to 
modify the sentence according to the supposed degrees of an illness 
or the forms of a semi-insanity.And the practice of calling on 
psychiatric expertise, which is widespread in the assize courts and 
sometimes extended to courts of summary jurisdiction, means that 
the sentence, even if it is always formulated in terms of legal punish¬ 
ment, implies, more or less obscurely, judgements of normality, 
attributions of causality, assessments of possible changes, anticipa¬ 
tions as to the offender’s future.It would be wrong to say that all 
these operations give substance to a judgement from the outside; 
they are directly integrated in the process of forming the sentence.Instead of insanity eliminating the crime according to the original 
meaning of article 64, every crime and even every offence now 
carries within it, as a legitimate suspicion, but also as a right that may 
be claimed, the hypothesis of insanity, in any case of anomaly.And 
the sentence that condemns or acquits is not simply a judgement of 
guilt, a legal decision that lays down punishment; it bears within it

an assessment of normality and a technical prescription for a possible 
normalization.
