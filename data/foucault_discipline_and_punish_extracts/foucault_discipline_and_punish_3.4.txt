The whole machinery that has been developing for years around 
the implementation of sentences, and their adjustment to individuals, 
creates a proliferation of the authorities of judicial decision-making 
and extends its powers of decision well beyond the sentence.The 
psychiatric experts, for their part, may well refrain from judging.Let us examine the three questions to which, since the 1958 ruling, 
they have to address themselves: Does the convicted person repre¬ 
sent a danger to society.^ Is he susceptible to penal punishment.^ Is he 
curable or readjustable.^ These questions have nothing to do with 
article 64, nor with the possible insanity of the convicted person at 
the moment of the act.They do not concern ‘responsibility’.They 
concern nothing but the administration of the penalty, its necessity, 
its usefulness, its possible effectiveness; they make it possible to 
show, in an almost transparent vocabulary, whether the mental hos¬ 
pital would be a more suitable place of confinement than the prison,

whether this confinement should be short or long, whether medical 
treatment or security measures are called for.
