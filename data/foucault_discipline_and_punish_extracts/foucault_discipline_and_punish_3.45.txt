What, then, is the role 
of the psychiatrist in penal matters?He is not an expert in responsi¬ 
bility, but an adviser on punishment; it is up to him to say whether 
the subject is ‘dangerous’, in what way one should be protected 
from him, how one should intervene to alter him, whether it would 
be better to try to force him into submission or to treat him.At the 
very beginning of its history, psychiatric expertise was called upon 
to formulate ‘true’ propositions as to the part that the liberty of the 
offender had played in the act he had committed; it is now called 
upon to suggest a prescription for what might be called his ‘medico- 
judicial treatment’.To sum up, ever since the new penal system - that defined by the 
great codes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries - has been in 
operation, a general process has led judges to judge something 
other than crimes; they have been led in their sentences to do some¬ 
thing other than judge; and the power of judging has been trans¬ 
ferred, in part, to other authorities than the judges of the offence.The whole penal operation has taken on extra-juridical elements and 
personnel.
