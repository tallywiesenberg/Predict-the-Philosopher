It will be said that there is nothing extraordinary in this, 
that it is part of the destiny of the law to absorb little by little 
elements that are alien to it.But what is odd about modern criminal 
justice is that, although it has taken on so many extra-juridical 
elements, it has done so not in order to be able to define them 
juridically and gradually to integrate them into the actual power to 
punish: on the contrary, it has done so in order to make them func¬ 
tion within the penal operation as non-juridical elements; in order 
to stop this operation being simply a legal punishment; in order to 
exculpate the judge from being purely and simply he who punishes, 
‘Of course, we pass sentence, but this sentence is not in direct 
relation to the crime.It is quite clear that for us it functions as a way 
of treating a criminal.We punish, but this is a way of saying that 
we wish to obtain a cure.’ Today, criminal justice functions and 
justifies itself only by this perpetual reference to something other 
than itself, by this unceasing reinscription in non-juridical systems.Its fate is to be redefined by knowledge.
