Analyse punitive methods not simply as consequences of 
legislation or as indicators of social structures, but as techniques 
possessing their own specificity in the more general field of other 
ways of exercising power.Regard punishment as a political tactic.3.Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of 
the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears 
to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing 
or useful effect, according to one’s point of view, see whether there 
is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive 
from a single process of ‘epistemologico-juridical’ formation; in 
short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the 
humanization of the penal system and Of the knowledge of man.23
