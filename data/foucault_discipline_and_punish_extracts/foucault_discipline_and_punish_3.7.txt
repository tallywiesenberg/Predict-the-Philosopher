Try to discover whether this entry of the soul on to the scene 
of penal justice, and with it the insertion in legal practice of a whole 
corpus of ‘scientific’ knowledge, is not the effect of a transformation 
of the way in which the body itself is invested by power relations.In short, try to study the metamorphosis of punitive methods on 
the basis of a political technology of the body in which might be 
read a common history of power relations and object relations.Thus, by an analysis of penal leniency as a technique of power, 
one might understand both how man, the soul, the normal or 
abnormal individual have come to duplicate crime as objects of 
penal intervention; and in what way a specific mode of subjection 
was able to give birth to man as an object of knowledge for a dis¬ 
course with a ‘scientific’ status.But I am not claiming to be the first to have worked in this 
direction.^ 

Rusche and Kirchheimer’s great work.Punishment and Social 
Structures, provides a number of essential reference points.
