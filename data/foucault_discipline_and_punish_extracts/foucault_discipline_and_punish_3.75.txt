We must 
first rid ourselves of the illusion that penality is above all (if not 
exclusively) a means of reducing crime and that, in this role, accord¬ 
ing to the social forms, the political systems or beliefs, it may be 
severe or lenient, tend towards expiation of obtaining redress, to¬ 
wards the pursuit of individuals or the attribution of collective 
responsibility.We must analyse rather the ‘concrete systems of 
punishment’, study them as social phenomena that cannot be 
accounted for by the juridical structure of society alone, nor by its 
fundamental ethical choices; we must situate them in their field of 
operation, in which the punishment of crime is not the sole element; 
we must show that punitive measures are not simply ‘negative’ 
mechanisms that make it possible to repress, to prevent, to exclude, 
to eliminate; but that they are linked to a whole series of positive 
and useful effects which it is their task to support (and, in this sense, 
although legal punishment is carried out in order to punish offences, 
one might say that the definition of offences and their prosecution 
are carried out in turn in order to maintain the punitive mechanisms 
and their functions).From this point of view, Rusche and Kirch- 
heimer relate the different systems of punishment with the systems 
of production within which they operate: thus, in a slave economy.24 




The body of the condemned 


punitive mechanisms serve to provide an additional labour force - 
and to constitute a body of‘civil’ slaves in addition to those provided 
by war or trading; with feudalism, at a time when money and pro¬ 
duction were still at an early stage of development, we find a sudden 
increase in corporal punishments - the body being in most cases the 
only property accessible; the penitentiary (the Hdpital General, the 
Spinhuis or the Rasphuis), forced labour and the prison factory 
appear with the development of the mercantile economy.But the 
industrial system requires a free market in labour andj in the nine¬ 
teenth century, the role of forced labour in the mechanisms of 
punishment diminishes accordingly and ‘corrective’ detention takes 
its place.
