There are no doubt a number of observations to be made 
about such a strict correlation.But we can surely accept the general proposition that, in our 
societies, the systems of punishment are to be situated in a certain 
‘political economy’ of the body: even if they do not make use of 
violent or bloody punishment, even when they use ‘lenient’ methods 
involving confinement or correction, it is always the body that is at 
issue - the body and its forces, their utility and their docility, their 
distribution and their submission.It is certainly legitimate to write 
a history of punishment against the background of moral ideas or 
legal structures.But can one write such a history against the back¬ 
ground of a history of bodies, when such systems of punishment 
claim to have only the secret souls of criminals as their objective.^ 

Historians long ago began to write the history of the body.They 
have studied the body in the field of historical demography or 
pathology; they have considered it as the seat of needs and appetites, 
as the locus of physiological processes and metabolisms, as a target 
for the attacks of germs or viruses; they have shown to what extent 
historical processes were involved in what might seem to be the 
purely biological base of existence; and what place should be given 
in the history of society to biological ‘events’ such as the circulation 
of bacilli, or the extension of the life-span (cf.
