relations have an immediate hold upon it; they invest it, mark it, 
train it, torture it, force it to carry out tasks, to perform ceremonies, 
to emit signs.This political investment of the body is bound up, 
in accordance with complex reciprocal relations, with its economic

use; it is largely as a force of production that the body is invested 
with relations of power and domination; but, on the other hand, its 
constitution as labour power is possible only if it is caught up in a 
system of subjection (in which need is also a political instrument 
meticulously prepared, calculated and used); the body becomes a 
useful force only if it is both a productive body and a subjected body.This subjection is not only obtained by the instruments of violence 
or ideology; it can also be direct, physical, pitting force against 
force, bearing on material elements, and yet without involving 
violence; it may be calculated, organized, technically thought out; 
it may be subtle, make use neither of weapons nor of terror and yet 
remain of a physical order.That is to say, there may be a ‘knowledge’ 
of the body that is not exactly the science of its functioning, and a 
mastery of its forces that is more than the ability to conquer them: 
this knowledge and this mastery constitute what might be called the 
political technology of the body.
