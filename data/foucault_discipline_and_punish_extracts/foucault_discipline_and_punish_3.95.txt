What the apparatuses and institu¬ 
tions operate is, in a sense, a micro-physics of power, whose field 
of validity is situated in a sense between these great functionings 
and the bodies themselves with their materiality and their forces.Now, the study of this micro-physics presupposes that the power 
exercised on the body is conceived not as a property, but as a 
strategy, that its effects of domination are attributed not to ‘appro¬ 
priation’, but to dispositions, manoeuvres, tactics, techniques, 
functionings; that one should decipher in it a network of relations, 
constantly in tension, in activity, rather than a privilege that one 
might possess; that one should take as its model a perpetual battle 
rather than a contract regulating a transaction or the conquest of a 
territory.In short this power is exercised rather than possessed; 
it is not the ‘privilege’, acquired or preserved, of the dominant 
class, but the overall effect of its strategic positions - an effect that

is manifested and sometimes extended by the position of those who 
are dominated.Furthermore, this power is not exercised simply as 
an obligation or a prohibition on those who ‘do not have it’; it 
invests them, is transmitted by them and through them; it exerts 
pressure upon them, just as they themselves, in their struggle against 
it, resist the grip it has on them.This means that these relations go 
right down into the depths of society, that they are not localized in 
the relations between the state and its citizens or on the frontier 
between classes and that they do not merely reproduce, at the level 
of individuals, bodies, gestures and behaviour, the general form of 
the law or government; that, although there is continuity (they are 
indeed articulated on this form through a whole series of complex 
mechanisms), there is neither analogy nor homology, but a specific¬ 
ity of mechanism and modality.
