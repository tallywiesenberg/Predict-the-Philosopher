The 
observation of the delinquent ‘should go back not only to the 
circumstances, but also to the causes of his crime; they must be 
sought in the story of his life, from the triple point of view of 
psychology, social position and upbringing, in order to discover the 
dangerous proclivities of the first, the harmful predispositions of the 
second and the bad antecedents of the third.This biographical 
investigation is an essential part of the preliminary investigation for 
the classification of penalities before it becomes a condition for the 
classification of moralities in the penitentiary system.It must 
accompany the convict from the court to the prison, where the 
governor’s task is not only to receive it, but also to complete, super¬ 
vise and rectify its various factors during the period of detention’ 
(Lucas, II, 440-42).Behind the offender, to whom the investigation 
of the facts may attribute responsibility for an offence, stands the 
delinquent whose slow formation is shown in a biographical 
investigation.The introduction of the ‘biographical’ is important 
in the history of penality.
