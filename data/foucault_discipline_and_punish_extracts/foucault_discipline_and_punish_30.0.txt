gallows and scaffolds were erected in public squares or by the road¬ 
side; sometimes the corpses of the executed persons were displayed 
for several days near the scenes of their crimes. Not only must 
people know, they must see with their own eyes. Because they must 
be made to be afraid; but also because they must be the witnesses, 
the guarantors, of the punishment, and because they must to a 
certain extent take part in it. The right to be witnesses was one that 
they possessed and claimed; a hidden execution was a privileged 
execution, and in such cases it was often suspected that it had not 
taken place with all its customary severity. There were protests 
when at the last moment the victim was taken away out of sight. 
The senior postal official who had been put on public exhibition 
for killing his wife was later taken away from the crowd. ‘He was 
put into a hired coach; it was thought that if he had not been well 
escorted, it would have been difficult to protect him from being 
ill-treated by the populace, who yelled and jeered at him’ (Hardy, I, 
328). When the woman Lescombat was hanged, care was taken to 
hide her face; she had ‘a kerchief over her neck and head, which 
made the public murmur and say that it was not Lescombat’ 
(Anchel, 70-71). The people claimed the right to observe the execu¬ 
tion and to see who was being executed. The first time the guillotine 
was used the Chronique de Paris reported that people complained 
that they could not see anything and chanted, ‘Give us back our 
gallows’ (Lawrence, yiff). The people also had a right to take part. 
The condemned man, carried in procession, exhibited, humiliated, 
with the horror of his crime recalled in innumerable ways, was

The spectacle of the scaffold 


offered to the insults, sometimes to the attacks of the spectators. 
The vengeance of the people was called upon to become an un¬ 
obtrusive part of the vengeance of the sovereign. Not that it was 
in any way fundamental, or that the king had to express in his own 
way the people’s revenge; it was rather that the people had to bring 
its assistance to the king when the king undertook ‘to be avenged 
on his enemies’, especially when those enemies were to be found 
among the people. It was rather like a ‘scaffold service’ that the 
people owed the king’s vengeance. This ‘service’ had been specified 
in the old ordinances; the edict of 1347 concerning blasphemers 
stipulated that they would be exhibited at the pillory ‘from the hour 
of prime, to that of their deaths. And mud and other refuse, though 
no stone or anything injurious, could be thrown at their faces. . .
