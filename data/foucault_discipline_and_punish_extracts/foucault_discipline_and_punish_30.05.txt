Because it establishes the ‘criminal’ as 
existing before the crime and even outside it.And, for this reason, 
a psychological causality, duplicating the juridical attribution of 
responsibility, confuses its effects.At this point one enters the 
‘criminological’ labyrinth from which we have certainly not yet 
emerged: any determining cause, because it reduces responsibility, 
marks the author of the offence with a criminality all the more for¬ 
midable and demands penitentiary measures that are all the more 
strict.As the biography of the criminal duplicates in penal practice 
the analysis of circumstances used in gauging the crime, so one sees 
penal discourse and psychiatric discourse crossing each other’s 
frontiers; and there, at their point of junction, is formed the notion 
of the ‘dangerous’ individual, which makes it possible to draw up a 
network of causality in terms of an entire biography and to present 
a verdict of punishment-correction.**
