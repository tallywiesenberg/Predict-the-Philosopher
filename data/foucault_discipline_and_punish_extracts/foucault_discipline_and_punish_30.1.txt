The penitentiary technique bears not on the 
relation between author and crime, but on the criminal’s affinity with 
his crime.The delinquent, the strange manifestation of an overall 
phenomenon of criminality, is to be found in quasi-natural classes, 
each endowed with its own characteristics and requiring a specific 
treatment, what Marquet-Wasselot called in 1841 the ‘ethnography 
of the prisons’; ‘The convicts are ... another people within the 
same people; with its own habits, instincts, morals’ (Marquet- 
Wasselot, 9).We are still very close here to the ‘picturesque’ 
descriptions of the world of the malefactors - an old tradition that 
goes back a long way and gained new vigour in the early nineteenth 
century, at a time when the perception of another form of life was 
being articulated upon that of another class and another human 
species.A zoology of social sub-species and an ethnology of the 
civilizations of malefactors, with their own rites and language, was 
beginning to emerge in a parody form.But an attempt was also 
being made to constitute a new objectivity in which the criminal 
belongs to a typology that is both natural and deviant.
