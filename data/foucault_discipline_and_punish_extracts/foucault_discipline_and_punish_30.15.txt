Delinquency, 
a pathological gap in the human species, may be analysed as morbid 
syndromes or as great teratological forms.With Ferrus’s classifica¬ 
tion, we probably have one of the first conversions of the old 
‘ethnography’ of crime into a systematic typology of delinquents.The analysis is slender, certainly, but it reveals quite clearly the 
principle that delinquency must be specified in terms not so much 
of the law as of the norm.There are three types of convict; there are 
those who are endowed ‘with intellectual resources above the average 
of intelligence that we have established’, but who have been perverted 
either by the ‘tendencies of their organization’ and a ‘native pre¬ 
disposition’, or by ‘pernicious logic’, an ‘iniquitous morality’, a 
‘dangerous attitude to social duties’.Those that belong to this cat¬ 
egory require isolation day and night, solitary exercise, and, when one 
is forced to bring them into contact with the others, they should 
wear ‘a light mask made of metal netting, of the kind used for stone¬ 
cutting or fencing’.
