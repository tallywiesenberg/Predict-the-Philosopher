The second category is made up of ‘vicious, stupid 
or passive convicts, who have been led into evil by indifference to

either shame or honour, through cowardice, that is to say, laziness, 
and because of a lack of resistance to bad incitements’; the regime 
suitable to them is not so much that of punishment as of education, and 
if possible of mutual education: isolation at night, work in common 
during the day, conversations permitted provided they are conducted 
aloud, reading in common, followed by mutual questioning, for which 
rewards may be given.Lastly, there are the ‘inept or incapable 
convicts’, who are ‘rendered incapable, by an incomplete organiza¬ 
tion, of any occupation requiring considered effort and consistent 
will, and who are therefore incapable of competing in work with 
intelligent workers and who, having neither enough education to 
know their social duties, nor enough intelligence to understand this 
fact or to struggle against their personal instincts, are led to evil by 
their very incapacity.For these, solitude would merely encourage 
their inertia; they must therefore live in common, but in such a way 
as to form small groups, constantly stimulated by collective 
operations, and subjected to rigid surveillance’ (Ferrus, iSzff and 
zySff).Thus a ‘positive’ knowledge of the delinquents and their 
species, very different from the juridical definition of offences and 
their circumstances, is gradually established; but this knowledge is 
also distinct from the medical knowledge that makes it possible to 
introduce the insanity of the individual and, consequently, to efface 
the criminal character of the act.Ferrus states the principle quite 
clearly: ‘Considered as a whole, criminals are nothing less than 
madmen; it would be unjust to the latter to confuse them with 
consciously perverted men.’ The task of this new knowledge is to 
define the act ‘scientifically’ qua offence and above all the individual 
qua delinquent.
