Criminology is thus made possible.The correlative of penal justice may well be the offender, but the 
correlative of the penitentiary apparatus is someone other; this is the 
delinquent, a biographical unity, a kernel of danger, representing a 
type of anomaly.And, although it is true that to a detention that 
deprives of liberty, as defined by law, the prison added the addi¬ 
tional element of the penitentiary, this penitentiary element intro¬ 
duced in turn a third character who slipped between the individual 
condemned by the law and the individual who carries out this law.At the point that marks the disappearance of the branded, dis¬ 
membered, burnt, annihilated body of the tortured criminal, there

appeared the body of the prisoner, duplicated by the individuality 
of the ‘delinquent’, by the little soul of the criminal, which the very 
apparatus of punishment fabricated as a point of application of the 
power to punish and as the object of what is still called today 
penitentiary science.It is said that the prison fabricated delinquents; 
it is true that it brings back, almost inevitably, before the courts those 
who have been sent there.
