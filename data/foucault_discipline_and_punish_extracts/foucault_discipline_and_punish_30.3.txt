But it also fabricates them in the sense 
that it has introduced into the operation of the law and the offence, 
the judge and the offender, the condemned man and the executioner, 
the non-corporal reality of the delinquency that links them together 
and, for a century and a half, has caught them in the same trap.The penitentiary technique and the delinquent are in a sense twin 
brothers.It is not true that it was the discovery of the delinquent 
through a scientific rationality that introduced into our old prisons 
the refinement of penitentiary techniques.Nor is it true that the 
internal elaboration of penitentiary methods has finally brought to 
light the ‘objective’ existence of a delinquency that the abstraction 
and rigidity of the law were unable to perceive.They appeared 
together, the one extending from the other, as a technological 
ensemble that forms and fragments the object to which it applies its 
instruments.
