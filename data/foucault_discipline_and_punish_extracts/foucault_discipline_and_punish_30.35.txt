And it is this delinquency, formed in the foundations 
of the judicial apparatus, among the ‘basses oeuvres', the servile tasks, 
from which justice averts its gaze, out of the shame it feels in punish¬ 
ing those it condemns, it is this delinquency that now comes to 
haunt the untroubled courts and the majesty of the laws; it is this 
delinquency that must be known, assessed, measured, diagnosed, 
treated when sentences are passed.It is now this delinquency, this 
anomaly, this deviation, this potential danger, this illness, this form 
of existence, that must be taken into account when the codes are 
rewritten.Delinquency is the vengeance of the prison on justice.It is a revenge formidable enough to leave the judge speechless.It is at this point that the criminologists raise their voices.
