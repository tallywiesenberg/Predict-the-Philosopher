But pne 
thing may be noted at the outset; the penal justice defined in the 
eighteenth century by the reformers traced two possible but diver¬ 
gent lines of objectification of the criminal; the first was the series 
of ‘monsters’, moral or political, who had fallen outside the social 
pact; the second was that of the juridical subject rehabilitated by 
punishment.Now the ‘delinquent’ makes it possible to join the two 
lines and to constitute under the authority of medicine, psychology 
or criminology, an individual in whom the offender of the law and 
the object of a scientific technique are superimposed - or almost - 
one upon the other.That the grip of the prison on the penal system 
should not have led to a violent reaction of rejection is no doubt 
due to many reasons.One of these is that, in fabricating delinquency, 
it gave to criminal justice a unitary field of objects, authenticated 
by the ‘sciences’, and thus enabled it to function on a general 
horizon of ‘truth’.The prison, that darkest region in the apparatus of justice, is the 
place where the power to punish, which no longer dares to manifest 
itself openly, silently organizes a field of objectivity in which 
punishment will be able to function openly as treatment and the 
sentence be inscribed among the discourses of knowledge.
