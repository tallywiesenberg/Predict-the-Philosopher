The transition from the 
public execution, with its spectacular rituals, its art mingled with the 
ceremony of pain, to the penalties of prisons buried in architectural 
masses and guarded by the secrecy of administrations, is not a 
transition to an undifferentiated, abstract, confused penality; it is the 
transition from one art of punishing to another, no less skilful one.It is a technical mutation.From this transition spring a symptom and 
a symbol: the replacement, in 1837, of the chain-gang by the police 
carriage.The chain-gang, a tradition that went back to the time of the 
galley slaves, was still surviving under the July monarchy.The 
importance it seems to have assumed as a spectacle at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century may be bound up with the fact that it 
combined in a single manifestation the two modes of punishment: 
the way to detention unfolded as a ceremonial of torture.
