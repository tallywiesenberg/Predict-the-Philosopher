(Faucher 
remarked that the chain-gang was a popular spectacle ‘especially 
since the scaffolds were almost entirely abolished’.)The accounts of 
the ‘last chain-gangs’ — those that crossed France in the summer of 
1836 - and of its scandals allow us to rediscover this functioning, so 
alien to the rules of ‘penitentiary science’.It began with a scaffold 
ritual: the fixing of iron collars and chains in the courtyard of 
Bicetre prison.The convict’s neck was thrown back upon a block; 
but this time the art of the executioner was to strike without crush¬ 
ing the head - an inverted skill that knew how not to deliver the 
death blow.‘The courtyard of Bicetre displays its instruments of 
torture: several rows of chains with their iron-collars.
