Here they are in 
the attitude of sacrifice.They are stitting on the ground, coupled at 
random by the waist; the chains they must carry, each weighing 
eight pounds, rest heavily on their knees.The operator inspects 
them, measuring heads and adapting the enormous inch-thick 
collars.It takes three men to rivet an iron-collar; the first holds up 
the block, the second holds the two branches of the iron-collar 
together and, with his two outstretched arms, secures the patientâ€™s 
head; the third strikes with repeated blows and flattens the bolt 
under his huge hammer.Each blow shakes the head and the body.
