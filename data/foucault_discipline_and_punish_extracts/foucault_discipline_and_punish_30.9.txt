They started to 
fight amongst themselves’ {Gaiette des tribimaux, 20 July 1836).Between Bicetre and Sevres a considerable number of houses were 
looted as the chain-gang passed by (La Phalange, i August 1836).In this festival of the departing convicts, there was something of 
the rites of the scapegoat that is struck as it is chased away, some¬ 
thing of the festival of fools, in which the reversal of roles is prac¬ 
tised, something of the old ceremonies of the scaffold, in which the 
truth must burst forth in the full light of day, something, too, of 
those popular spectacles, in which famous characters or traditional 
types were recognized: the play of truth and infamy, the procession 
of notoriety and shame, invective against the guilty who have been 
unmasked and, on the other hand, the joyous avowal of crimes.One 
sought to rediscover the face of the criminals who had had their 
glory; broadsheets recalled the crimes of those one saw pass; news¬ 
paper^ provided their names and recounted their lives; sometimes 
they provided a description of their persons and dress, so that their 
identity might not pass unnoticed: like programmes for spectators.* 
People also came to examine different types of criminals, trying to 
decide, according to facial appearance or dress, the ‘profession’ of 
the convict, whether he was a murderer or thief: it was a game of 
masquerades and marionnettes, which was also, for more educated 
eyes, something of an empirical ethnography of crime.
