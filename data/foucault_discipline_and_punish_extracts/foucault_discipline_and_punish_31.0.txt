The great travelling fair of crime had its tumblers and its mummers, 
in which the comic affirmation of truth answered curiosity and invec¬ 
tive.A whole series of scenes, in this summer of 1836, took place 
around Delacollonge: his crime (he had cut his pregnant mistress 
into pieces) was made much more spectacular by the fact that he 
was a priest; this fact had also saved him from the scaffold.It seems 
that he aroused considerable hate among the people.Earlier, in the 
cart that had brought him to Paris in June 1836, he had been insulted 
and had been unable to hold back his tears; however, he had 
expressed a wish not to be conveyed in a closed carriage, believing 
that the humiliation formed part of his punishment.As he left 
Paris, ‘one cannot imagine the virtuous indignation, the moral anger 
and base actions unleashed by the crowd on this man; he was 
covered with earth and mud; stones and insults rained down upon 
him from the furious bystanders.
