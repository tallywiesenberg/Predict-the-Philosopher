Between the criminals and their judges, the day of 
the great reverse judgement will come; â€˜The contempt of men 
belongs to us convicts.The gold they worship is also ours.One day, 
this gold will pass into our hands.We will buy it with our lives.Others will seize these chains that today you make us bear; they will 
become slaves.
