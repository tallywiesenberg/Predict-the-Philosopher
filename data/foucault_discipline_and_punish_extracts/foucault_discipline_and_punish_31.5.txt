As we break out of our shackles, the star of liberty 
will shine for us...Farewell, for we brave both your chains and 
your laws.’® The pious theatre imagined by the broadsheets, in 
which the convict exhorted the crowd never to imitate him, was 
becoming a threatening scene in which the crowd was asked to 
choose between the barbarity of the executioners, the injustice of the 
judges and the misfortune of convicts who, though defeated today, 
would triumph one day.The great spectacle of the chain-gang was linked with the old 
tradition of the public execution; it was also linked with that multiple 
representation of crime that gave rise at the time to newspapers, 
broadsheets, mountebanks and street theatres;’ but it was also linked 
with the confrontations and struggles whose first rumblings it con¬ 
veyed; it gave them a kind of symbolic outlet: though vanquished 
by the law, the army of disorder promised to return; what the 
violence of order had driven away would overthrow that order and 
bring liberty on its return.
