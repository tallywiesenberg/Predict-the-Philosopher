agitation that had always surrounded the public executions now 
found an echo in precise threats.One can see why the July monarchy 
decided to abolish the chain-gang for the same - but more pressing - 
reasons that brought about, in the eighteenth century, the abolition 
of the public executions: ‘It is no part of our morality to treat men 
in this way; one must avoid providing in the towns that the convoy 
passes through so hideous a spectacle, which, in any case, teaches 
the population nothing’ (Gaiette des tribuneaux, 19 July 1836).It 
was necessary, therefore, to break with these public rites; to subject 
the movements of convicts to the same mutation as the punishments 
themselves; and to bring them, too, under the veil of administrative 
decency.But what, in June 1837, was adopted to replace the chain-gang was 
not the simple covered cart, which had been suggested at one time, 
but a machine that had been very meticulously designed: a carriage 
conceived as a moving prison, a mobile equivalent of the Panopticon.
