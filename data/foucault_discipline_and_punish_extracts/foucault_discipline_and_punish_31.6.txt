A central corridor divided it along its entire length: on either side 
were six cells in which the two rows of convicts sat facing one 
another.Their feet were placed in rings that were lined on the inside 
with wool and linked together by chains eighteen inches long; the 
legs were secured in metal knee-guards.The convict sat on a kind 
of ‘zinc and oak funnel that emptied onto the public way’.The cell 
had no window onto the outside; it was completely lined with sheet 
iron; only a ventilator, also of sheet-iron, with holes pierced in it, 
allowed a ‘suitable flow of air’.On the corridor side, the door of 
each cell was provided with a hatch, divided into two compartments: 
one for food, the other, covered by a grill, for surveillance.
