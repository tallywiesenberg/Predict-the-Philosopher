‘The 
opening and the oblique direction of the hatches were so arranged 
that the warders had the prisoners constantly in view and heard 
every word they spoke, though the prisoners themselves were 
unable to see or hear one another.’ In this way, ‘the same carriage 
may, without the slightest inconvenience, contain at one and the 
same time a convict and a simple offender, men and women, children 
and adults.Whatever the length of the journey, all would be 
brought to their destination without having been able to perceive 
one another or to speak to one another.’ Lastly, the constant sur¬ 
veillance of the two warders, who were each armed with a small oak 
club, ‘with thick nails of crushed diamond’ made it possible to

operate a whole system of punishments in conformity with the 
internal regulation of the carriage: a diet of bread and water, thumb¬ 
screws, lack of a cushion that would allow one to sleep, chains on 
both arms.‘Any reading other than that of books of morality is 
forbidden.’ 

If only for its mildness and speed, this machine ‘would have done 
honour to the sensibility of its author’; but its merit lay in the fact 
that it was a veritable penitentiary carriage.By its external effects, 
it had a quite Benthamite perfection: ‘In the rapid passage of this 
mobile prison which, on its dark, silent flanks, bears no other 
inscription than the following words - Transport of Convicts - 
there is something mysterious and gloomy, which Bentham requires 
in the carrying out of criminal sentences and which leaves in the 
minds of onlookers a more salutary and lasting impression than the 
sight of those cynical and joyous travellers’ {Gaiette des tribimaux, 
15 June 1837).It also had internal effects; even in a journey lasting 
only a few days (during which the inmates had not been detached 
for a single moment), it functioned as an apparams of correction.
