One emerged from it astonishingly calm: ‘From a moral point of 
view, this transportation, which lasts no more than seventy-two 
hours, is a terrible torture whose effects on the prisoner seem to be 
lasting.’ The convicts themselves support this view: ‘In the cell 
carriage, when you don’t sleep, you can only think.And when I 
thought, I came to regret what I had done; in the end, you see, I 
would have been afraid to mend my ways and I don’t want to.’® 

The panoptic carriage had only a short history.Yet the way in 
which it replaced the chain-gang and the reasons for this replacement 
recapitulated the whole process by which in eighty years penal 
detention replaced public execution as a calculated technique for 
altering individual behaviour.The cell-carriage was an apparatus of 
reform.What replaced the public execution was not a massive 
enclosure, it was a carefully articulated disciplinary mechanism - at 
least in principle.
