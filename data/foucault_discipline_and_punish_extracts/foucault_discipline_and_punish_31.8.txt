The means of repression at one’s disposal are; 
the scaffold, the iron-collar, three convict-ships, 19 maisons centrales, 
86 maisons de justice, 362 maisons d’arret, 2,800 cantonal prisons, 
2,238 cells in police stations.Despite all these, vice goes unchecked.The number of crimes is not diminishing... the number of recidiv¬ 
ists is increasing, rather than declining’ {La Fraterniti, no.10, 
February 1842).- Detention causes recidivism; those leaving prison have more 
chance than before of going back to it; convicts are, in a very high 
proportion, former inmates; 38 per cent of those who left the maisons 
centrales were convicted again and 33 per cent of those sent to con¬ 
vict-ships (a figure given by G. de Rochefoucauld during the debate 
on the reform of the penal code, 2 December 1831, Archives parle- 
mentaires, LXXII, 209-10); between 1828 and 1834, out of almost 
35,000 convicted of crime, about 7,400 were recidivists (that is, 
I out of 4-7 of those convicted); out of over 200,000 correctionels, 
or petty offenders, almost 35,000 were also recidivists (i out of 6); 
in all, one recidivist out of 5 -8 of those convicted (Ducpetiaux, 1837,
