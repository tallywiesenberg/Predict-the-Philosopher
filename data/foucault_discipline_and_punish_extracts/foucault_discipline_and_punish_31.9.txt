- The prison cannot fail to produce delinquents.It does so by 
the very type of existence that it imposes on its inmates: whether 
they are isolated in cells or whether they are given useless work, 
for which they will find no employment, it is, in any case, not ‘to 
think of man in society; it is to create an unnatural, useless and dan¬ 
gerous existence’; the prison should educate its inmates, but can a 
system of education addressed to man reasonably have as its object 
to act against the wishes of nature.^ (Lucas, I, 127 and 130).The 
prison also produces delinquents by imposing violent constraints 
on its inmates; it is supposed to apply the law, and to teach respect 
for it; but all its functioning operates in the form of an abuse of 
power.The arbitrary power of administration: ‘The feeling of in¬ 
justice that a prisoner has is one of the causes that may make his 
character untamable.When he sees himself exposed in this way to 
suffering, which the law has neither ordered nor envisaged, he 
becomes habitually angry against everything around him; he sees 
every agent of authority as an executioner; he no longer thinks that 
he was guilty: he accuses justice itself’ (Bigot Preameneu).
