but a woman, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to stick a needle into 
the wicked master, was banished for three years (Anchel, 226). 

One remembers the great legal affairs of the eighteenth century, 
when enlightened opinion intervened in the persons of the philoso- 
phes and certain magistrates: Galas, Sirven and the Chevalier de La 
Barre, for instance. But less attention is given to the popular agita¬ 
tions caused by punitive practice. Indeed, they seldom spread be¬ 
yond a town, or even a district. Yet they did have a real importance. 
Sometimes these movements, which originated from below, spread 
and attracted the attention of more highly placed persons who, 
taking them up, gave them a new dimension (in the years preceding 
the Revolution, the affair of Catherine Espinas, falsely convicted of 
parricide in 1785, or the case of the three men of Chaumont, con¬ 
demned to the wheel, for whom Dupaty, in 1786, wrote his cele¬ 
brated memoir, or that of Marie Fran^oise Salmon, whom the 
parlement of Rouen in 1782 had condemned to the stake, for poison¬ 
ing, but who in 1786 had still not been executed). More usually, 
those disturbances had maintained around penal justice and its 
manifestations, which ought to have been exemplary, a state of 
permanent unrest. How often had it proved necessary, in order to

The spectacle of the scaffold 

ensure order around the scaffolds, to take steps that were ‘distressing 
to the people’ and ‘humiliating for the authorities’ (Argenson, 241)? 
It was evident that the great spectacle of punishment ran the risk 
of being rejected by the very people to whom it was addressed. In 
fact, the terror of the public execution created centres of illegality: 
on execution days, work stopped, the taverns were full, the authori¬ 
ties were abused, insults or stones were thrown at the executioner, 
the guards and the soldiers; attempts were made to seize the con¬ 
demned man, either to save him or to kill him more surely; fights 
broke out, and there was no better prey for thieves than the curious 
throng around the scaffold. (Hardy recounts a number of cases like 
the important theft that was committed in the very house in which 
the police magistrate was lodging - IV, 56.) But above all - and this 
was why these disadvantages became a political danger - the people 
never felt closer to those who paid the penalty than in those rituals 
intended to show the horror of the crime and the invincibility of 
power; never did the people feel more threatened, like them, by a 
legal violence exercised without moderation or restraint. The solid¬ 
arity of a whole section of the population with those we would call 
petty offenders - vagrants, false beggars, the indigent poor, pick¬ 
pockets, receivers and dealers in stolen goods - was constantly
