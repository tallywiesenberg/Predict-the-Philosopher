And it multiplies 
them across France in such a way that, where there is a prison, 
there is an association ... and as many anti-social clubs’ (Moreau- 
Christophe, 7).And it is in these clubs that the education of the 
young first offender takes place; ‘The first desire that is born within 
him will be to learn from his cleverer seniors how to escape the 
rigours of the law; the first lesson will be derived from the strict 
logic of thieves who regard society as an enemy; the morality will 
be the informing and spying honoured in our prisons; the first 
passion to be aroused in him will be to frighten the young mind by 
these monsters that must have been born in the dungeon and which 
the pen refuses to name...Henceforth he has broken with every¬ 
thing that has bound him to society’ {L'Almanack populaire de 
France, 49-56).
