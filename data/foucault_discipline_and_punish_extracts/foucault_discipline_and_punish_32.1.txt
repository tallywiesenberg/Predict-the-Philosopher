Faucher spoke of ‘barracks of crime’.- The conditions to which the free inmates are subjected neces¬ 
sarily condemn them to recidivism: they are under the surveillance 
of the police; they are assigned to a particular residence, or forbidden 
others; ‘they leave prison with a passport that they must show every¬ 
where they go and which mentions the sentence that they have 
served’ (Barbe Marbois, 17).Being on the loose, being unable to find 
work, leading the life of a vagabond are the most frequent factors in 
recidivism.The Gaiette des tribunaux, but also the workers’ news¬ 
papers, regularly cited cases like that of the worker convicted of 
theft, placed under surveillance at Rouen, caught again for theft, 
and whom no lawyers would defend; so he took it upon himself to 
speak before the court, told the story of his life, explained how, on 
leaving prison and forced to reside in a particular place, he was 
unable to take up his trade as a gilder, since as an ex-convict he was

turned down wherever he went; the police refused him the right to 
seek work elsewhere: he found himself unable to leave Rouen, with 
nothing to do but die of hunger and poverty as a result of this 
terrible surveillance.He went to the town hall and asked for work; 
for eight days he was given work in the cemeteries for fourteen sous 
a day: ‘But,’ he said, ‘I am young, I have a good appetite, I eat more 
than two pounds of bread a day at five sous a pound; what can I do 
with fourteen sous to feed myself, wash my clothes and find lodging.^ 
I was driven to despair, I wanted to become an honest man again; 
the surveillance plunged me back into misfortune.
