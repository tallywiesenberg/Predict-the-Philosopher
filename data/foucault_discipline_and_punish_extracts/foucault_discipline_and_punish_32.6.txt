Illegalities and delinquency 


One must not, therefore, regard the prison, its ‘failure’ and its 
more or less successful reform as three successive stages.One 
should think rather of a simultaneous system that historically has 
been superimposed on the juridical deprivation of liberty; a fourfold 
system comprising; the additional, disciplinary element of the prison 
- the element of ‘super-power’; the production of an objectivity, a 
technique, a penitentiary ‘rationality’ - the element of auxiliary 
knowledge; the de facto reintroduction, if not actual increase, of a 
criminality that the prison ought to destroy - the element of in¬ 
verted efficiency; lastly, the repetition of a ‘reform’ that is isomor¬ 
phic, despite its ‘idealism’, with the disciplinary functioning of the 
prison - the element of utopian duplication.It is this complex 
ensemble that constitutes the ‘carceral system’, not only the institu¬ 
tion of the prison, with its walls, its staff, its regulations and its 
violence.The carceral system combines in a single figure discourses 
and architectures, coercive regulations and scientific propositions, 
real social effects and invincible utopias, programmes for correcting 
delinquents and mechanisms that reinforce delinquency.Is not the 
supposed failure part of the functioning of the prison.^ Is it not to 
be included among those effects of power that discipline and the 
auxiliary technology of imprisonment have induced in the apparatus 
of justice, and in society in general, and which may be grouped 
together under the name of ‘carceral system’.^ If the prison-institu¬ 
tion has survived for so long, with such immobility, if the principle 
of penal detention has never seriously been questioned, it is no 
doubt because this carceral system was deeply rooted and carried 
out certain very precise functions.
