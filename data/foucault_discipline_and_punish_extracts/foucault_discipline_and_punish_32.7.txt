But perhaps one should reverse the problem and ask oneself what 
is served by the failure of the prison; what is the use of these different 
phenomena that are continually being criticized; the maintenance of 
delinquency, the encouragement of recidivism, the transformation of 
the occasional offender into a habitual delinquent, the organization 
of a closed milieu of delinquency.Perhaps one should look for what 
is hidden beneath the apparent cynicism of the penal institution, 
which, after purging the convicts by means of their sentence, con¬ 
tinues to follow them by a whole series of‘brandings’ (a surveillance 
that was once de jure and which is today de facto-, the police record 
that has taken the place of the convict’s passport) and which thus 
pursues as a ‘delinquent’ someone who has acquitted himself of his 
punishment as an offender.^ Can we not see here a consequence 
rather than a contradiction.^ If so, one would be forced to suppose 
that the prison, and no doubt punishment in general, is not intended 
to eliminate offences, but rather to distinguish them, to distribute 
them, to use them; that it is not so much that they render docile 
those who are liable to transgress the law, but that they tend to 
assimilate the transgression of the laws in a general tactics of subjec¬ 
tion.Penality would then appear to be a way of handling illegalities, 
of laying down the limits of tolerance, of giving free rein to some, 
of putting pressure on others, of excluding a particular section, of 
making another useful, of neutralizing certain individuals and of 
profiting from others.In short, penality does not simply ‘check’ 
illegalities; it ‘differentiates’ them, it provides them with a general 
‘economy’.And, if one can speak of justice, it is not only because 
the law itself or the way of applying it serves the interests of a class, it 
is also because the differential administration of illegalities through 
the mediation of penality forms part of those mechanisms of domina¬ 
tion.
