Legal punishments are to be resituated in an overall strategy 
of illegalities.The ‘failure’ of the prison may be understood on this 
basis.272 




Illegalities and delinquency 


The general schema of penal reform had taken shape at the end of 
the eighteenth cenmry in the struggle against illegalities: a whole 
equilibrium of tolerance, mutual support and interests which, under 
the Ancien Regime, had maintained the illegalities of different social 
strata side by side, was disturbed.There then emerged the utopia of 
a universally and publicly punitive society in which ceaselessly 
active penal mechanisms would function without delay, mediation 
or uncertainty; one law, doubly ideal because perfect in its calcula¬ 
tions and engraven on the minds of each citizen would stop, at their 
very origin, all practices of illegality.Now, at the turn of the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and against the new codes, the 
danger of a new popular illegality arose.
