Or, to be more precise, 
perhaps the popular illegalities began to develop according to new 
dimensions: those that were introduced by the movements which, 
from the 1780s to the Revolutions of 1848, linked together social 
conflicts, the struggles against the political regimes, the resistance 
to the movement of industrialization, the effects of the economic 
crises.Broadly speaking, there were three characteristic processes.First, the development of the political dimension of the popular 
illegalities.This occurred in two ways: hitherto localized practices, 
limited in some sense to themselves (like the refusal to pay taxes and 
rents or to comply with conscription; the violent confiscation of 
hoarded goods; the looting of shops and the forced selling of pro¬ 
ducts at a ‘fair price’; confrontations with the representatives of 
power), were able during the Revolution to lead to directly political 
struggles, whose aim was not simply to extract concessions from the 
state or to rescind some intolerable measure, but to change the 
government and the very structure of power.On the other hand, 
certain political movements were explicitly based on existing forms 
of illegality (for example, the royalist agitation of the west and south 
of France used the peasants’ rejection of the new laws on property, 
religion and conscription); this political dimension of illegality was 
to become more complex and more marked in the relations between 
the workers’ movement and the republican parties in the nineteenth 
century, in the passage from the workers’ struggles (strikes, pro¬ 
hibited coalitions, illegal associations) to political revolution.
