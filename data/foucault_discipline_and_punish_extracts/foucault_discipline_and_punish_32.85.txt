In any 
case, on the horizon of these illegal practices - which multiplied with 
ever more restrictive legislation - there emerged struggles of a

strictly political kind; the possible overthrow of power was not 
present in all of them, far from it; but a good many were able to turn 
themselves to account in overall political struggles and sometimes 
even to lead directly to them.On the other hand, through the rejection of the law or other 
regulations, it is easy enough to recognize the struggles against those 
who set them up in their own interests: people were no longer 
fighting against the tax farmers, financiers, the king’s agents, pre¬ 
varicating magistrates or bad ministers - all the agents of injustice - 
but against the law itself and the justice whose task it was to apply 
it; against local landowners who introduced new rights; against 
employers who worked together, but forbade workers’ coalitions; 
against entrepreneurs who introduced more machines, lower wages 
and longer working hours, and made the factory regulations more 
and more strict.It was against the new regime of landed property - 
set up by a bourgeoisie that profited from the Revolution - that a 
whole peasant illegality developed.This no doubt assumed its most 
violent forms between Thermidor and the Consulate, but it did not 
disappear then; it was against the new system of the legal exploita¬ 
tion of labour that workers’ illegalities at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century developed: from the most violent such as machine¬ 
breaking, or the most lasting such as the formation of associations, 
to the most everyday, such as absenteeism, abandoning work, 
vagabondage, pilfering raw materials, deception as to the quantity 
and quality of the work completed.A whole series of illegalities 
was inscribed in struggles in which those struggling knew that 
they were confronting both the law and the class that had im¬ 
posed it.
