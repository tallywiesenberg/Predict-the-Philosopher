Lastly, although it is true that, during the eighteenth century, 
criminality tended towards more specialized forms, inclining more 
and more to the skilful theft, and became, to some extent, the prac¬ 
tice of men on the fringes of society, isolated from a population that 
was hostile to them - one sees, in the last years of the eighteenth 
century, the reconstitution of certain links or the establishment of 
new relations; not, as contemporaries said, that the leaders of popular 
agitation had been criminals, but because the new forms of law, 
the rigours of the labour regulations, the demands either of the 
state, or of the landowners, or of the employers, and the mos;

Illegalities and delinquency 


detailed techniques of surveillance, increased the occasions of 
offences, and threw to the other side of the law many individuals, who, 
in other conditions, would not have gone over to specialized 
criminality; it is against the background of the new laws of property, 
against the background, too, of unacceptable conscription that a 
peasant illegality developed in the last years of the Revolution, with 
a consequent increase in violence, acts of aggression, thefts, looting 
and even the greater forms of ‘political brigandage’; it was also 
against a background of legislation or very heavy regulations (con¬ 
cerning the livret, or service certificate, rents, hours, absences from 
work) that a workers’ vagabondage developed that often crossed 
the boundary into actual delinquency.A whole series of illegal 
practices, which during the previous century had tended to remain 
isolated from one another, now seemed to come together to form a 
new threat.There was a threefold diffusion of popular illegalities at the turn 
of the century (quite apart from a quantitative extension that is 
problematic and still uncalculated): their insertion in a general 
political outlook; their explicit articulation on social struggles; a 
communication between different forms and levels of offences.These processes may not have reached their full development; 
certainly there did not develop at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century a massive movement of illegality that was both political and 
social.But, in their emerging form and despite their dispersal, they 
were sufficiently marked to serve as a support for the ‘great fear’ 
of a people who were believed to be criminal and seditious as a 
whole, for the myth of a barbaric, immoral and outlaw class which, 
from the empire to the July monarchy, haunted the discourse of 
legislators, philanthropists and investigators into working-class life.
