It is these processes that are to be found behind a whole series of 
affirmations that are quite alien to the penal theory of the eighteenth 
century: that crime is not a potentiality that interests or passions 
have inscribed in the hearts of all men, but that it is almost exclu¬ 
sively committed by a certain social class; that criminals, who were 
once to be met with in every social class, now emerged ‘almost all 
from the bottom rank of the social order’ (Comte, 49); that ‘nine 
tenths of murderers, thieves and idlers come from what we have 
called the social base’ (Lauvergne, 337); that it is not crime that

alienates an individual from society, but that crime is itself due rather 
to the fact that one is in society as an alien, that one belongs to that 
‘bastardized race’, as Target called it, to that ‘class degraded by 
misery whose vices stand like an invincible obstacle to the generous 
intentions that wish to combat it’ (Bure, 391); that, this being the 
case, it would be hypocritical or naive to believe that the law was 
made for all in the name of all; that it would be more prudent to 
recognize that it was made for the few and that it was brought to 
bear upon others; that in principle it applies to all citizens, but that 
it is addressed principally to the most numerous and least enlight¬ 
ened classes; that, unlike political and civil laws, their application 
does not concern everybody equally (Rossi, I, 32); that in the courts 
society as a whole does not judge one of its members, but that a 
social category with an interest in order judges another that is 
dedicated to disorder: ‘Visit the places where people are judged, 
imprisoned or executed...One thing will strike you everywhere; 
everywhere you see two quite distinct classes of men, one of which 
always meets on the seats of the accusers and judges, the other on 
the benches of the accused’, which is explained by the fact that the 
latter, for lack of resources and education, do not know ‘how to 
remain within the limits of legal probity’ (Lucas, II, 82); so that the 
language of the law, which is supposed to be universal, is, in this 
respect, inadequate; it must, if it is to be effective, be the discourse 
of one class to another, which has neither the same ideas as it nor 
even the same words: ‘How are we, with our prudish, contemptuous 
languages, overloaded with formality, to make ourselves uhderstood 
by those who have never heard anything but the crude, poor, 
irregular, but lively, frank, picturesque dialect of the market, the 
tavern and the fair... What language, what method should we use 
when drawing up laws that will act effectively on the uneducated 
minds of those less capable of resisting the temptations of crime.^’ 
(Rossi, I, 33).
