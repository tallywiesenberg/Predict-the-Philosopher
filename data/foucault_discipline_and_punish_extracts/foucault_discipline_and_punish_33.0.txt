crowd to the University and to the Cordeliers Cemetery. His 
servant was also beaten and, with bruises on his head and body, was 
taken to the hospital where he died some days later. However, some 
strangers and unknown people mounted the ladder and cut the rope 
while others caught the hanged man from below after he had been 
hanging there longer than it took to say a full Miserere. The crowd 
then smashed the gallows and broke the executioner’s ladder into 
pieces. . . Children carried off the gallows and threw it into the 
Rhone.’ The condemned man was then taken to a cemetery ‘so that 
he should not be recaptured by the law and from there to the church 
of Sainte-Antoine’. The archbishop gave him his pardon, had him 
taken to the hospital and asked that particular care be taken of him. 
Lastly, adds the writer of the account, ‘we had a new suit, two pairs 
of stockings and shoes made for him. We dressed him in new 
clothes from head to toe. Our colleagues gave him shirts, breeches 
and a wig’ (Duhamel, 5-6; scenes of this kind were still taking

The spectacle of the scaffold

The other event took place in Paris, a century later. It was in 1775, 
shortly after the com riot. Because of the state of extreme tension 
among the people, the authorities wanted the execution to take 
place without interruption. Between the scaffold and the public, 
kept at a safe distance, two ranks of soldiers stood on guard, one 
facing the execution that was about to take place, the other facing 
the people in case of riot. Contact was broken: it was a public 
execution, but one in which the element of spectacle was neutralized, 
or rather reduced to abstract intimidation. Protected by force of 
arms, on an empty square, justice quietly did its work. If it showed 
the death that it had dealt, it was from high and far: ‘The two 
gallows, which were eighteen feet high, no doubt by way of an 
example, were not set up until three o’clock in the afternoon. From 
two o’clock, the Place de Gr^ve and all the surrounding streets had 
been filled with detachments of different troops, some on foot, some 
on horse; the Swiss and the French guards continued to patrol the 
adjacent streets. No one was allowed on to the Greve during the 
execution, and all around one could see a double row of soldiers, 
bayonets at the ready, standing back to back, so that some looked 
outwards and some into the square; the two wretches ... cried out 
all the way that they were innocent and continued to protest in like 
manner as they mounted the ladder’ (Hardy, III, 67). Whatever the
