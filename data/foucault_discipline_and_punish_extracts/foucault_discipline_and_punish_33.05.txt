No doubt delinquency is a form of illegality; certainly 
it has its roots in illegality; but it is an illegality that the ‘carceral 
system’, with all its ramifications, has invested, segmented, isolated, 
penetrated, organized, enclosed in a definite milieu, and to which it 
has given an instrumental role in relation to the other illegalities.In short, although the juridical opposition is between legality and 
illegal practice, the strategic opposition is between illegalities and 
delinquency.For the observation that prison fails to eliminate crime, one should 
perhaps substitute the hypothesis that prison has succeeded ex¬ 
tremely well in producing delinquency, a specific type, a politically 
or economically less dangerous — and, on occasion, usable - form 
of illegality; in producing delinquents, in an apparently marginal, 
but in fact centrally supervised milieu; in producing the delinquent 
as a pathologized subject.The success of the prison, in the struggles 
around the law and illegalities, has been to specify a ‘delinquency’.We have seen how the carceral system substituted the ‘delinquent’ 
for the offender, and also superimposed upon juridical practice a 
whole horizon of possible knowledge.
