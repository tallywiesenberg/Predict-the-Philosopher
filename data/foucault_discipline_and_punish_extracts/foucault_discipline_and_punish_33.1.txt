Now this process that con¬ 
stitutes delinquency as an object of knowledge is one with the 
political operation that dissociates illegalities and isolates delin¬ 
quency from them.The prison is the hinge of these two mechanisms; 
it enables them to reinforce one another perpetually, to objectify the 
delinquency behind the offence, to solidify delinquency in the move¬ 
ment of illegalities.So successful has the prison been that, after a 
century and a h^lf of ‘failures’, the prison still exists, producing the 
same results, and there is the greatest reluctance to dispense 
with it.277 




Prison 


The penality of detention seems to fabricate - hence no doubt its 
longevity - an enclosed, separated and useful illegality.The circuit 
of delinquency would seem to be not the sub-product of a prison 
which, while punishing, does not succeed in correcting; it is rather 
the direct effect of a penality which, in order to control illegal 
practices, seems to invest certain of them in a mechanism of ‘punish¬ 
ment-reproduction’, of which imprisonment is one of the main 
parts.
