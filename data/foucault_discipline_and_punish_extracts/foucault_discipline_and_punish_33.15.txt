But why and how is the prison called upon to participate in 
the fabrication of a delinquency that it is supposed to combat.^ 

The establishment of a delinquency that constitutes something 
like an enclosed illegality has in fact a number of advantages.To 
begin with, it is possible to supervise it (by locating individuals, 
infiltrating the group, organizing mutual informing): for the vague, 
swarming mass of a population practising occasional illegality, which 
is always likely to spread, or again for those loose bands of vaga¬ 
bonds, recruiting as they move from place to place, and according 
to circumstances, from the unemployed, beggars, ‘bad characters’ 
of all kinds, which sometimes reach such proportions - as we saw at 
the end of the eighteenth century - as to form formidable forces for 
looting and rioting, is substituted a relatively small and enclosed 
group of individuals on whom a constant surveillance may be kept.Moreover, it is possible to divert this self-absorbed delinquency to 
forms of illegality that are less dangerous: maintained by the pres¬ 
sure of controls on the fringes of society, reduced to precarious 
conditions of existence, lacking links with the population that would 
be able to sustain it (as was once the case with smugglers or certain 
forms of bandits - cf.Hobsbawm), delinquents inevitably fell back 
on a localized criminality, limited in its power to attract popular 
support, politically harmless and economically negligible.Now this 
concentrated, supervised and disarmed illegality is directly useful.
