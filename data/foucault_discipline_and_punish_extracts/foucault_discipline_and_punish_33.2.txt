It may be useful in relation to other illegalities: isolated from them, 
turned inwards upon its own internal organization, dedicated to a 
violent criminality, of which the poorer classes are often the first 
victims, hemmed in on every side by the police, exposed to long 
prison sentences, followed by a permanently ‘specialized’ life - 
delinquency - this alien, dangerous and often hostile world obstructs 
or at least maintains at a sufficiently low level everyday illegal 
practices (petty thefts, minor acts of violence, routine acts of law-

Illegalities and delinquency 


breaking); it prevents them from leading to broader, more obvious 
forms, rather as though the exemplary effect once expected of the 
spectacle of the scaffold was now sought not so much in the rigour 
of the punishments, as in the visible, branded existence of delin¬ 
quency itself: while differentiating itself from other popular illegali¬ 
ties, delinquency serves to keep them in check.But delinquency has other direct uses.The example of coloniza¬ 
tion comes to mind.Yet it is not the most convincing example; 
indeed, although the deportation of criminals was demanded on 
several occasions under the Restoration, either by the Chamber of 
Deputies or by the General Councils, this was essentially in order 
to lighten the financial burdens imposed by the whole apparatus of 
detention; and, despite all the projects that were drawn up under the 
July monarchy for delinquents, undisciplined soldiers, prostitutes 
and orphans to take part in the colonization of Algeria, that colony 
was formally excluded, by the law of 1854, from becoming one of 
the overseas penal colonies; in fact, deportation to Guiana or later 
to New Caledonia had no real economic importance, despite the 
obligation imposed on the convicts to remain in the colony where 
they had served their sentence for a number of years equal to their 
time of detention (in certain cases, they even had to spend the rest 
of their lives there).^* In fact, the use of delinquency as a milieu 
that was both separate and manipulable took place above all on the 
fringes of legality, that is to say, a sort of subordinate illegality was 
also set up in the nineteenth century whose organization as delin¬ 
quency, with all the surveillance that this implies, provided a guaran¬ 
tee of docility.Delinquency, controlled illegality, is an agent for the 
illegality of the dominant groups.
