The setting up of prostitution 
networks in the nineteenth century is characteristic in this respect;*® 
police checks and checks on the prostitutes’ health, their regular 
stay in prison, the large-scale organization of the maisons closes, or 
brothels, the strict hierarchy that was maintained in the prostitution 
milieu, its control by delinquent-informers, all this made it possible 
to canalize and to recover by a whole series of intermediaries the 
enormous profits from a sexual pleasure that an ever-more insistent 
everyday moralization condemned to semi-clandestinity and naturally 
made expensive; in setting up a price for pleasure, in creating a 
profit from repressed sexuality and in collecting this profit, the

delinquent milieu was in complicity with a self-interested puritan- 
ism: an illicit fiscal agent operating over illegal practices.^® Arms 
trafficking, the illegal sale of alcohol in prohibition countries, or 
more recently drug trafficking show a similar functioning of this 
‘useful delinquency’: the existence of a legal prohibition creates 
around it a field of illegal practices, which one manages to supervise, 
while extracting from it an illicit profit through elements, themselves 
illegal, but rendered manipulable by their organization in delin¬ 
quency.This organization is an instrument for administering and 
exploiting illegalities.It is also an instrument for the illegality with which the very 
exercise of power surrounds itself.The political use of delinquents - 
as informers and agents provocateurs — was a fact well before the 
nineteenth century.But, after the Revolution, this practice 
acquired quite different dimensions: the infiltration of political 
parties and workers’ associations, the recruitment of thugs against 
strikers and rioters, the organization of a sub-police - working 
directly with the legal police and capable if necessary of becoming a 
sort of parallel army - a whole extra-legal functioning of power was 
partly assured by the ^ mass of reserve labour constituted by the 
delinquents: a clandestine police force and standby army at the 
disposal of the state.It seems that, in France, it was around the 
Revolution of 1848 and Louis Napoleon’s seizure of power that 
these practices reached their height (Marx, Eighteenth Brumaire ..., 
63-5).
