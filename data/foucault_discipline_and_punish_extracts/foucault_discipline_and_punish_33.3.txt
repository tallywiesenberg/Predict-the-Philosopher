Delinquency, solidified by a penal system centred upon the 
prison, thus represents a diversion of illegality for the illicit circuits 
of profit and power of the dominant class.The organization of an isolated illegality, enclosed in delinquency, 
would not have been possible without the development of police 
supervision.General surveillance of the population, ‘silent, mysteri¬ 
ous, unperceived vigilance... it is the eye of the government cease¬ 
lessly open and watching without distinction over ail citizens, yet 
without subjecting them to any measure of coercion whatever...It 
does not need to be written into the law’ (Bonneville, 1847, 397-9).Surveillance of individuals, envisaged by the code of 1810, of ex¬ 
convicts and of all those who, having appeared before the courts on 
serious charges, were legally presumed to represent a new threat to 
the peace of society.
