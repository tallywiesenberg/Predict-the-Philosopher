But surveillance, too, of milieux and groups

Illegalities and delinquency 


regarded as dangerous by informers, almost all of whom were 
former delinquents, supervised as such by the police: delinquency, 
an object among others of police surveillance, is also one of its 
privileged instruments.All these surveillances presuppose the 
organization of a hierarchy, partly official, partly secret (in the Paris 
police, this was essentially the ‘security service’, which comprised, 
apart from its ‘open agents’ - inspectors and sergeants - its ‘secret 
agents’ and informers, who were motivated by fear of punishment 
or the prospect of reward: cf.Fregier, I, 142-8).They also presup¬ 
pose the setting up of a documentary system, the heart of which 
would be the location and identification of criminals: compulsory 
description of the criminal combined with arrest warrants issued by 
the assize courts, a description included in prison committal registers, 
copies of the registers of assize courts and courts of summary 
jurisdiction sent each month to the Ministries of Justice and of 
General Police, the organization a little later at the Ministry of the 
Interior of a criminal records office with an alphabetical index con¬ 
taining summaries of these registers, the use in about 1833, according 
to the method of ‘naturalists, librarians, merchants, businessmen’ of 
a system of individual cards or reports, which facilitated the integra¬ 
tion of new data and, at the same time, together with the name of the 
individual under investigation, all the information that might con¬ 
cern him (Bonneville, 1844,92-3) - the appearance of the card-index 
and the constitution of the human sciences are another invention 
that historians have taken little note of).Delinquency, with the 
secret agents that it procures, but also with the generalized policing 
that it authorizes, constitutes a means of perpetual surveillance of 
the population: an apparatus that makes it possible to supervise, 
through the delinquents themselves, the whole social field.
