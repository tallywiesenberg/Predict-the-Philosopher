Prison and police form a twin mechanism; together they 
assure in the whole field of illegalities the differentiation, isolation 
and use of delinquency.In the illegalities, the police-prison system 
segments a manipulable delinquency.This delinquency, with its 
specificity, is a result of the system; but it also becomes a part and 
an instrument of it.So that one should speak of an ensemble whose 
three terms (police-prison-delinquency) support one another and 
form a circuit that is never interrupted.Police surveillance provides 
the prison with offenders, which the prison transforms into delinÂ¬ 
quents, the targets and auxiliaries of police supervisions, which 
regularly send back a certain number of them to prison.
