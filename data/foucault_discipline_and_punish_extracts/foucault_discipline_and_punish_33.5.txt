There is no penal justice intended to prosecute ail illegal practices 
which, to do so, would use the police as an auxiliary and prison as a 
punitive instrument, and not leave in its wake the unassimilable 
residue of ‘delinquency’.One should regard this justice as an instru¬ 
ment for the differential supervision of illegalities.In relation to this 
instrument, criminal justice plays the role of legal surety and prin¬ 
ciple of transmission.It is a relay in a general economy of illegalities, 
whose other elements are (not below it, but beside it) the police, the 
prison and delinquency.Police encroachment on justice and the 
force of inertia that the carceral institution opposes to justice are not 
new, nor are they the result of a sclerosis or of a gradual shift in 
power; it is a structural feature that characterizes punitive mechan¬ 
isms in modern societies.
