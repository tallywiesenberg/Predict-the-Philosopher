The magistrates can say what they like; 
penal justice, with all its theatrical apparatus, is intended to respond 
to the daily demand of an apparatus of supervision half submerged 
in the darkness in which police and delinquency are brought to¬ 
gether.Judges are the scarcely resisting employees of this appara- 
tus.i® They assist as far as they can in the constitution of delinquency, 
that is to say, in the differentiation of illegalities, in the supervision, 
colonization and use of certain of these illegalities by the illegality 
of the dominant class.Two figures stand out as representative of this process, which 
developed in the first thirty or forty years of the nineteenth century.First, there was Vidocq (cf.his Memoires and Histoire de Vidocq 
racontee par lid-meme).
