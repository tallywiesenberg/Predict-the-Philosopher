Illegalities and delinquency 


Bias of the other end of the century, who soon took a turn for the 
worse: disturbances, adventures, swindlings, of which he was 
usually himself the victim, brawls and duels; successive enlistments 
and desertions, contacts with prostitution, gambling, pickpocketing 
and soon large-scale brigandage.But the almost mythical importance 
that he assumed in the eyes of his contemporaries was based not on 
this, perhaps embellished past; it was not even based on the fact that, 
for the first time in history, a former inmate of a convict-ship, 
redeemed or quite simply bought, became a chief of police, but 
rather on the fact that, in him, delinquency visibly assumed its 
ambiguous status as an object and instrument for a police apparatus 
that worked both against it and with it.Vidocq marks the moment 
when deliquency, detached from other illegalities, was invested by 
power and turned inside out.It was then that the direct, institutional 
coupling of police and delinquency took place: the disturbing 
moment when criminality became one of the mechanisms of power.A figure had haunted earlier times, that of the monstrous king, the 
source of all justice and yet besmirched with crime; another fear 
now appeared, that of some dark, secret understanding between 
those who enforced the law and those who violated it.
