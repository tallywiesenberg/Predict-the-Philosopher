The Shake¬ 
spearian age when sovereignty confronted abomination in a single 
character had gone; the everyday melodrama of police power and of 
the complicities that crime formed with power was soon to begin.Opposite Vidocq stood his contemporary, Lacenaire.His pres¬ 
ence, assured for ever in the paradise of the aesthetes of crime, is 
surprising enough: despite all his good will, his neophyte’s zeal, he 
was only able to commit, and even then with a singular lack of skill, 
no more than a few minor crimes; he was so strongly suspected of 
being a police spy that the administration had to protect him against 
his fellow prisoners, who tried to kill him (the charge was formally 
taken up by Canler, 15), and it was the fashionable society of Louis- 
Philippe’s Paris that gave him, before his execution, a feast beside 
which many a later literary resurrection has been little more than 
academic homage.His fame owed nothing either to the extent of his 
crimes or to the art of their conception; it was their ineptitude that 
gave cause for surprise.But it did owe a great deal to the visible 
play, in what he did and what he said, between illegality and delin¬ 
quency.
