of friendships made in prison, mutual blackmail, recidivism, up to 
the last, failed attempt at murder - Lacenaire is the typical ‘delin¬ 
quent’.But he brought with him, at least potentially, a horizon of 
illegalities that had, until quite recently, represented a threat: this 
ruined petty bourgeois, of good education, would, a generation 
earlier,have been a revolutionary, a Jacobin, a regicide;^® had he been 
a contemporary of Robespierre, his rejection of the law would have 
taken a directly political form.Born in 1800, at more or less the 
same time as Stendhal’s Julien Sorel, his character bears the trace 
of these possibilities; but they took the form of theft, murder and 
denunciation.All these potentialities became a delinquency of no 
great moment: in this sense, Lacenaire is a reassuring character.And if these potentialities reappear, it is in what he says about the 
theory of crime.
