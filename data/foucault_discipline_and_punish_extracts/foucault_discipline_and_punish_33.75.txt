At the moment of his death, Lacenaire manifested 
the triumph of delinquency over illegality, or rather the figure of an 
illegality, on the one hand, dragged down into delinquency, and, 
on the other, displaced towards an aesthetics of crime, that is to say, 
towards an art of the privileged classes.There is a symmetry be¬ 
tween Lacenaire and Vidocq, who in the same period, made it 
possible to turn delinquency in upon itself by constituting it as an 
enclosed, observable milieu and by displacing towards police tech¬ 
niques a whole delinquent practice that was becoming the licit 
illegality of power.That the Parisian bourgeoisie should have 
feasted Lacenaire, that his cell should have been open to famous 
visitors, that he should have been showered with praise during the 
last days of his life, he whose death his plebeian fellow prisoners had 
demanded before his judges had done so, he who had done every¬ 
thing, in court, to bring his accomplice Frangois to the scaffold, 
there was a reason for all this: what was being celebrated was the 
symbolic figure of an illegality kept within the bounds of delin¬ 
quency and transformed into discourse - that is to say, made doubly 
inoffensive; the bourgeoisie had invented for itself a new pleasure, 
which it has still far from outgrown.It should not be forgotten that 
Lacenaire’s celebrated death succeeded in muffling the echoes of 
Fieschi’s attempt on the life of Louis-Philippe; Fieschi, one of the 
most recent of the regicides, represented the converse figure of a 
petty criminality leading to political violence.Nor should we forget 
that it took place a few months before the departure of the last
