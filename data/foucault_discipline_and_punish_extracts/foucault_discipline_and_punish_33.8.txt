These two festivals overlapped in history; and, indeed, Fran5ois, 
Lacenaire’s accomplice, was one of the best-known characters in the 
chain-gang of 19 July.®* The one extended the ancient rituals of the 
public execution at the risk of reactivating popular illegalities around 
the criminals.It was to be prohibited, for the criminal was no longer 
to occupy any other space than that appropriate to delinquency.The other inaugurated the theoretical play of an illegality of the 
privileged; or rather it marked the moment when the political and 
economic illegalities actually practised by the bourgeoisie were to 
be duplicated in theoretical and aesthetic representation: the ‘Meta¬ 
physics of crime’, a term often associated with Lacenaire.The French 
translation of De Quincey’s Murder Considered as One of the Fine 
Arts was published in 1849.This production of delinquency and its investment by the penal 
apparatus must be taken for what they are: not results acquired once 
and for all, but tactics that shift according to how closely they reach 
their target.
