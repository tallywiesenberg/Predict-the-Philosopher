way in which it is turned back upon them, its colonization by the 
dominant illegality - these all appear clearly in the way in which the 
police-prison system functions; yet they have always met with 
resistance; they have given rise to struggles and provoked reaction.Erecting the barrier to separate delinquents from all the lower strata 
of the population from which they sprang and with which they 
remained linked has been a difficult task, especially no doubt in 
urban milieux.®^ It has been a long and arduous undertaking.It has 
involved the use of the general principles of the ‘moralization’ of the 
poorer classes that elsewhere has had such crucial importance both
