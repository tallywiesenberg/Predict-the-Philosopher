Workersâ€™ action was regularly accused of being 
animated, if not manipulated, by mere criminals (cf., for example.Monfalcon, 142).Verdicts were often more severe against workers 
than against thieves (cf.L'Atelier, October 1840, or La Fraternite, 
July-August 1847).The two categories of convict were mixed in 
the prisons and preferential treatment given to common-law 
offenders, while convicted journalists and politicians usually enjoyed 
the right to separate treatment.
