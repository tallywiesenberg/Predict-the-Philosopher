In short, a whole tactic of confusion 
aimed at maintaining a permanent state of conflict.To this was added a patient attempt to impose a highly specific 
grid on the common perception of delinquents: to present them as 
close by, everywhere present and everywhere to be feared.This was 
the function of the_/a/t divers, which invaded a part of the press and 
which began to have its own newspapers.** The criminal divers, 
by its everyday redundancy, makes acceptable the system of judicial 
and police supervisions that partition society; it recounts from day 
to day a sort of internal battle against the faceless enemy; in this war, 
it constitutes the daily bulletin of alarm or victory.The crime novel, 
which began to develop in the broadsheet and in mass-circulation 
literature, assumed an apparently opposite role.
