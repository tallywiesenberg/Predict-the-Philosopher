speech of the criminal. Justice required these apocrypha in order to 
be grounded in truth. Its decisions were thus surrounded by all 
these posthumous ‘proofs’. Sometimes, too, accounts of crimes and 
infamous lives were published, simply as propaganda, before any 
trial had taken place, in order to force the hand of a court that was 
suspected of being too tolerant. In order to discredit smugglers, the 
Compagnie des Fermes published ‘bulletins’ recounting their 
crimes: in 1768, it distributed broadsheets against a certain Mon- 
tagne, the leader of a gang, of whom the writer himself says: ‘Some 
thefts have been ascribed to him the truth of which is somewhat 
uncertain ...; Montagne has been depicted as a wild beast, a second 
hyena to be hunted down; given the hotheads of the Auvergne, this 
idea has caught on’ (cf. Juillard, 24).

The spectacle of the scaffold 


But the effect, like the use, of this literature was equivocal. The 
condemned man found himself transformed into a hero by the sheer 
extent of his widely advertised crimes, and sometimes the affirmation 
of his belated repentance. Against the law, against the rich, the 
powerful, the magistrates, the constabulary or the watch, against 
taxes and their collectors, he appeared to have waged a struggle 
with which one all too easily identified. The proclamation of these 
crimes blew up to epic proportions the tiny struggle that passed 
unperceived in everyday life. If the condemned man was shown to 
be repentant, accepting the verdict, asking both God and man for 
forgiveness for his crimes, it was as if he had come through some 
process of purification: he died, in his own way, like a saint. But 
indomitability was an alternative claim to greatness: by not giving 
in under torture, he gave proof of a strength that no power had 
succeeded in bending: ‘On the day of the execution - this will seem 
scarcely credible -1 showed no trace of emotion, as I performed my 
amende honorable^ and when I finally lay down on the cross I showed 
no fear’ (the Complainte of J.-D. Langlade, executed at Avignon 
12 April 1768). Black hero or reconciled criminal, defender of the 
true right or an indomitable force, the criminal of the broadsheets, 
pamphlets, almanacs and adventure stories brought with him, be¬ 
neath the apparent morality of the example not to be followed, a 
whole memory of struggles and confrontations. A convicted criminal 
could become after his death a sort of saint, his memory honoured 
and his grave respected. (This was the case of Tanguy, executed in 
Brittany about 1740. Before being convicted, it is true, he had begun 
a long penitence ordered by his confessor. Was this a conflict
