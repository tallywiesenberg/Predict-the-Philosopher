the highest of walls, the prison finally closed in on an unpopular 
people’ (Perrot).Yet it certainly cannot be said that this tactic triumphed or that 
it brought about a total break between the delinquents and the lower 
classes.The relations between the poorer classes and illegality, the 
reciprocal position of the proletariat and the urban plebs has yet to 
be studied.But one thing is certain: delinquency and repression 
were regarded, in the workers’ movements of the years 1830-50, 
as an important issue.
