There was no doubt hostility towards the 
delinquents; but it was a battle around penality.The workers’ news¬ 
papers often proposed a political analysis of criminality that con¬ 
tradicted term by term the description familiar to the philanthropists 
(poverty - dissipation - laziness - drunkenness - vice - theft - 
crime).They assigned the origin of delinquency not to the indivi¬ 
dual criminal (he was merely the occasion or the first victim), but 
to society: ‘The man who kills you is not free not to kill you.It is 
society or, to be more precise, bad social organization that is 
responsible’ {UHumanitaire, August 1841).This is so either because 
society is incapable of providing its fundamental needs, or because 
it destroys or effaces in him possibilities, aspirations or needs that 
later emerge in crime: ‘Bad education, unused aptitudes and forces, 
the intelligence and the heart crushed by forced labour at too tender 
an age’ (Za Fraternite, November 1845).
