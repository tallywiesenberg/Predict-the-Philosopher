It bears 
within it a figure and a future.‘The social order dominated by 
the fatality of its repressive principle continues to kill through the 
executioner or through the prisons those whose natural robustness 
rejects or disdains its prescriptions, those who, too strong to remain 
enclosed within its tight swaddling-clothes, break from them and 
tear them to pieces, men who do not wish to remain children’ (Za 
Phalange, lo January 1837).There is not, therefore, a criminal 
nature, but a play of forces which, according to the class to which 
individuals belong,*® will lead them to power or to prison: if bom 
poor, today’s magistrates would no doubt be in the convict-ships; 
and the convicts, if they had been well born, ‘would be presiding 
in the courts and dispensing justice’ {La Phalange, 1 December 
1838).At bottom, the existence of crime manifests ‘a fortunate 
irrepressibility of human nature’; it should be seen not so much as 
a weakness or a disease, as an energy that is reviving, an ‘outburst 
of protest in the name of human individuality’, which no doubt 
accounts for its strange power of fascination.‘Without crime, which 
awakens in us a mass of torpid feelings and half distinguished 
passions, we would remain still longer in disorder, in weakness’ 
{La Phalange, 10 January 1837).
