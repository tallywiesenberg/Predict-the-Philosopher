He made only a short appearance; his notoriety lasted hardly more 
than a day.He was merely the passing figure of minor illegalities: a 
child of thirteen, without home or family, charged with vagabond¬ 
age and whom a two-year sentence had no doubt long placed in the 
circuits of delinquency.He would certainly have passed without 
trace, had he not opposed to the discourse of the law that made him 
delinquent (in the name of the disciplines, even more than in the 
terms of the code) the discourse of an illegality that remained resist¬ 
ant to these coercions and which revealed indiscipline in a systematic¬ 
ally ambiguous manner as the disordered order of society and as the 
affirmation of inalienable rights.All the illegalities that the court 
defined as offences the accused reformulated as the affirmation of a 
living force: the lack of a home as vagabondage, the lack of a master 
as independence, the lack of work as freedom, the lack of a time-table 
as the fullness of days and nights.This confrontation of illegality 
with the discipline-penality-delinquency system was perceived by 
contemporaries or rather by the journalist who happened to be there 
as the comic effect of the criminal law at grips with the petty details 
of indiscipline.
