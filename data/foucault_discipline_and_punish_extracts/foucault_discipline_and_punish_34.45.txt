And it was true: the affair itself and the verdict that 
followed represented the heart of the problem of legal punishment 
in the nineteenth century.The irony with which the judge tried to 
envelop indiscipline in the majesty of the law and the insolence 
with which the accused reinscribed indiscipline among the funda¬ 
mental rights represent for penality an exemplary scene.This, no doubt, is the value of the account published in the 
Gaiette des tribunaux for August 1840: ‘The judge: One must sleep 
at home.— Beasse: Have I got a home.^ - You live in perpetual vaga¬ 
bondage.- I work to earn my living.
