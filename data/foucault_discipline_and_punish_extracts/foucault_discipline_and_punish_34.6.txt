Let’s be off, then.’’ ’ 

It was this scene that La Phalange took up.And the importance 
that the newspaper gave it, the extremely slow, careful analysis, 
shows that the Fourierists saw in such an everyday affair a play of 
fundamental forces.On the one hand, that of ‘civilization’, repre¬ 
sented by the judge, ‘living legality, the spirit and letter of the law’.It had its own system of coercion, which seemed to be the code, 
but which in fact was discipline.There had to be a place, a location, 
a compulsory insertion: ‘One sleeps at home, said the judge, because 
in fact, for him, everything must have a home, some dwelling, how¬ 
ever magnificent or mean; his task is not to provide one, but to 
force every individual to live in one.’ Moreover, one must have a 
station in life, a recognizable identity, an individuality fixed once 
and for all: ‘What is your station.^ This question is the simplest 
expression of the established order in society; such vagabondage is 
repugnant to it, disturbs it; one must have a stable, continuous long¬ 
term station, thoughts of the future, of a secure future, in order to 
reassure it against all attacks.’ In short, one should have a master, 
be caught up and situated within a hierarchy; one exists only when 
fixed in definite relations of domination: ‘Who do you work with.^ 
That is to say, since you are not a master, you must be a servant, 
whatever your station; it is not a question of your satisfactoriness as 
an individual; it is a question of order to be maintained.’ Confronted 
with discipline on the face of the law, there is illegality, which puts 
itself forward as a right; it is indiscipline, rather than the criminal 
offence, that causes the rupture.
