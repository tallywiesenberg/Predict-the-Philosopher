..He prefers 
liberty; what does he care if others see it as disorder.^ It is liberty, 
that is to say, the most spontaneous development of his individual¬ 
ity, a wild development and, consequently, brutal and limited, but a 
natural, instinctive development.’ Indiscipline in family relations; 
it does not matter whether this lost child was abandoned or freed 
himself voluntarily, for ‘he would have been unable to bear the 
slavery of education either at his parents’ or with strangers’.And 
through all these minute disciplines it is ultimately ‘civilization’ as a 
whole that is rejected and ‘wildness’ that emerges: ‘It is work, it is 
laziness, it is thoughtlessness, it is debauchery: it is everything except 
order; the difference in occupations and debauches aside, it is the 
life of the savage, living from day to day and with no tomorrow’ 
{La Phalange, 15 August 1840).No doubt the analyses of La Phalange cannot be regarded as 
representative of the discussions that took place in the workers’ press 
at this time on crime and penality.
