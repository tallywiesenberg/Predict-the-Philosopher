Nevertheless, they are situated in 
the context of this polemic.The lessons of La Phalange were not 
quite wasted.They found an echo when, in the second half of the 
nineteenth century, taking the penal apparatus as their point of 
attack, the anarchists posed the political problem of delinquency; 
when they thought to recognize in it the most militant rejection of 
the law; when they tried not so much to heroize the revolt of the 
delinquents as to disentangle delinquency from the bourgeois legality 
and illegality that had colonized it; when they wished to re-establish 
or constitute the political unity of popular illegalities.292 




3- The carceral 


Were I to fix the date of completion of the carceral system, I would 
choose not i8io and the penal code, nor even 1844, when the law 
laying down the principle of cellular internment was passed; I might 
not even choose 1838, when books on prison reform by Charles 
Lucas, Moreau-Christophe and Faucher were published.The date I 
would choose would be 22 January 1840, the date of the official 
opening of Mettray.
