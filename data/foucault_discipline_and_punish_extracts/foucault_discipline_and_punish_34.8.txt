Or better still, perhaps, that glorious day, 
unremarked and unrecorded, when a child in Mettray remarked as 
he lay dying: ‘What a pity I left the colony so soon’ (Ducpetiaux, 
1852, 383).This marked the death of the first penitentiary saint.Many of the blessed no doubt went to join him, if the former 
inmates of the penal colonies are to be believed when, in singing 
the praises of the new punitive policies of the body, they remarked: 
‘We preferred the blows, but the cell suits us better.’ 

Why Mettray.^ Because it is the disciplinary form at its most 
extreme, the model in which are concentrated all the coercive 
technologies of behaviour.In it were to be found ‘cloister, prison, 
school, regiment’.The small, highly hierarchized groups, into which 
the inmates were divided, followed simultaneously five models: that 
of the family (each group was a ‘family’ composed of ‘brothers’ and 
two ‘elder brothers’); that of the army (each family, commanded by 
a head, was divided into two sections, each of which had a second 
in command; each inmate had a number and was taught basic 
military exercises; there was a cleanliness inspection every day, an 
inspection of clothing every week; a roll-call was taken three times 
a day); that of the workshop, with supervisors and foremen, who 
were responsible for the regularity of the work and for the appren¬ 
ticeship of the younger inmates; that of the school (an hour or an 
hour and a half of lessons every day; the teaching was given by the

instructor and by the deputy-heads); lastly, the judicial model (each 
day ‘justice’ was meted out in the parlour: ‘The least act of dis¬ 
obedience is punished and the best way of avoiding serious offences 
is to punish the most minor offences very severely: at Mettray, a use¬ 
less word is punishable’; the principal punishment inflicted was 
confinement to one’s cell; for ‘isolation is the best means of acting on 
the moral nature of children; it is there above all that the voice of 
religion, even if it has never spoken to their hearts, recovers all its 
emotional power’ - Ducpetiaux, 1852, 377); the entire parapenal 
institution, which is created in order not to be a prison, culminates 
in the cell, on the walls of which are written in black letters: ‘God 
sees you.’ 

This superimposition of different models makes it possible to 
indicate, in its specific features, the function of ‘training’.
