The chiefs 
and their deputies at Mettray had to be not exactly judges, or 
teachers, or foremen, or non-commissioned officers, or ‘parents’, 
but something of all these things in a quite specific mode of inter¬ 
vention.They were in a sense technicians of behaviour: engineers 
of conduct, orthopaedists of individuality.Their task was to produce 
bodies that were both docile and capable; they supervised the nine 
or ten working hours of every day (whether in a workshop or in 
the fields); they directed the orderly movements of groups of in¬ 
mates, physical exercises, military exercises, rising in the morning, 
going to bed at night, walks to the accompaniment of bugle and 
whistle; they taught gymnastics;* they checked cleanliness, super¬ 
vised bathing.Training was accompanied by permanent observa¬ 
tion; a body of knowledge was being constantly built up from the 
everyday behaviour of the inmates; it was organized as an instrument 
of perpetual assessment: ‘On entering the colony, the child is sub¬ 
jected to a sort of interrogation as to his origins, the position of his 
family, the offence for which he was brought before the courts and 
all the other offences that make up his short and often very sad 
existence.This information is written down on a board on which 
everything concerning each inmate is noted in turn, his stay at the 
colony and the place to which he is sent when he leaves’ (Ducpeti¬ 
aux, 1851, 61).
