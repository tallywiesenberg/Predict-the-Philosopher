But it cannot not be identified abso¬ 
lutely with them.Nor with administration in the strict sense.Heads 
or deputy-heads of ‘families’, monitors and foremen, had to live in 
close proximity to the inmates; their clothes were ‘almost as humble’ 
as those of the inmates themselves; they practically never left their 
side, observing them day and night; they constituted among them 
a network of permanent observation.And, in order to train them 
themselves, a specialized school had been organized in the colony.The essential element of its programme was to subject the future 
cadres to the same apprenticeships and to the same coercions as the 
inmates themselves: they were ‘subjected as pupils to the discipline 
that, later, as instructors, they would themselves impose’.
