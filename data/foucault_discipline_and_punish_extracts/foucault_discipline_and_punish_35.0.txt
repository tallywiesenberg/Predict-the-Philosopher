And they disappeared as a whole new literature of crime deve¬ 
loped: a literature in which crime is glorified, because it is one of the 
fine arts, because it can be the work only of exceptional natures, 
because it reveals the monstrousness of the strong and powerful, 
because villainy is yet another mode of privilege: from the adventure 
story to de Quincey, or from the Castle of Otranto to Baudelaire, 
there is a whole aesthetic rewriting of crime, which is also the 
appropriation of criminality in acceptable forms. In appearance, it is 
the discovery of the beauty and greatness of crime; in fact, it is the 
affirmation that greatness too has a right to crime and that it even

The spectacle of the scaffold 


becomes the exclusive privilege of those who are really great. The 
great murders are not for the pedlars of petty crime. While, from 
Gaboriau onwards, the literature of crime follows this first shift: by 
his cunning, his tricks, his sharp-wittedness, the criminal represented 
in this literature has made himself impervious to suspicion; and the 
struggle between two pure minds - the murderer and the detective - 
will constitute the essential form of the confrontation. We are far 
removed indeed from those accounts of the life and misdeeds of the 
criminal in which he admitted his crimes, and which recounted in 
detail the tortures of his execution: we have moved from the 
exposition of the facts or the confession to the slow process of 
discovery; from the execution to the investigation; from the phy¬ 
sical confrontation to the intellectual struggle between criminal and 
investigator. It was not only the broadsheets that disappeared with 
the birth of a literature of crime; the glory of the rustic malefactor 
and his sombre transformation into a hero by the process of torture 
and execution went with them. The man of the people was now 
too simple to be the protagonist of subtle truths. In this new genre, 
there were no more popular heroes or great executions; the criminal 
was wicked, of course, but he was also intelligent; and although he 
was punished, he did not have to suffer. The literature of crime 
transposes to another social class the spectacle that had surrounded 
the criminal. Meanwhile the newspapers took over the task of 
recounting the grey, unheroic details of everyday crime and punish¬ 
ment. The split was complete; the people was robbed of its old 
pride in its crimes; the great murders had become the quiet game of 
the well behaved.
