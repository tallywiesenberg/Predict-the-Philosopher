taught the art of power relations.It was the first training college in 
pure discipline: the ‘penitentiary’ was not simply a project that 
sought its justification in ‘humanity’ or its foundations in a ‘science’, 
but a technique that was learnt, transmitted and which obeyed 
general norms.The practice that normalized by compulsion the 
conduct of the undisciplined or dangerous could, in turn, by 
technical elaboration and rational reflection, be ‘normalized’.The 
disciplinary technique became a ‘discipline’ which also had its 
school.It so happens that historians of the human sciences date the birth 
of scientific psychology at this time: during these same years, it 
seems, Weber was manipulating his little compass for the measure¬ 
ment of sensations.
