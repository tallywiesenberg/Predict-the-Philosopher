What took place at Mettray (and in other 


295 



Prison 


European countries sooner or later) was obviously of a quite differ¬ 
ent order.It was the emergence or rather the institutional specifica¬ 
tion, the baptism as it were, of a new type of supervision - both 
knowledge and power - over individuals who resisted disciplinary 
normalization.And yet, in the formation and growth of psychology, 
the appearance of these professionals of discipline, normality and 
subjection surely marks the beginning of a new stage.It will be said 
that the quantitative assessment of sensorial responses could at least 
derive authority from the prestige of the emerging science of 
physiology and that for this alone it deserves to feature in the 
history of the sciences.But the supervision of normality was firmly 
encased in a medicine or a psychiatry that provided it with a sort 
of ‘scientificity’; it was supported by a judicial apparatus which, 
directly or indirectly, gave it legal justification.
