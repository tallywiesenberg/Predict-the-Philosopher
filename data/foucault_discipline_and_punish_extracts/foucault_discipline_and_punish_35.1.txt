Thus, in the shelter 
of these two considerable protectors, and, indeed, acting as a link 
between them, or a place of exchange, a carefully worked out 
technique for the supervision of norms has continued to develop 
right up to the present day.The specific, institutional supports of 
these methods have proliferated since the founding of the small 
school at Mettray; their apparatuses have increased in quantity and 
scope; their auxiliary services have increased, with hospitals, schools, 
public administrations and private enterprises; their agents have 
proliferated in number, in power, in technical qualification; the 
technicians of indiscipline have founded a family.In the normaliza¬ 
tion of the power of normalization, in the arrangement of a power- 
knowledge over individuals, Mettray and its school marked a new 
era.But why choose this moment as the point of emergence of the 
formation of an art of punishing that is still more or less our own.^ 
Precisely because this choice is somewhat ‘unjust’.Because it 
situates the ‘end’ of the process in the lower reaches of criminal law.
