(A whole study remains to be done of the 
debates that took place during the Revolution concerning family 
courts, paternal correction and the right of parents to lock up their 
children.)And, if the apparatus of the great classical form of con¬ 
finement was partly (and only partly) dismantled, it was very soon 
reactivated, rearranged, developed in certain directions.But what is 
still more important is that it was homogenized, through the media¬ 
tion of the prison, on the one hand with legal punishments and, on 
the other, with disciplinary mechanisms.The frontiers between 
confinement, judicial punishment and institutions of discipline, 
which were already blurred in the classical age, tended to disappear 
and to constitute a great carceral continuum that diffused peniten¬ 
tiary techniques into the most innocent disciplines, transmitting 
disciplinary norms into the very heart of the penal system and 
placing over the slightest illegality, the smallest irregularity, devia¬ 
tion or anomaly, the threat of delinquency.A subtle, graduated 
carceral net, with compact institutions, but also separate and diffused 
methods, assumed responsibility for the arbitrary, widespread, 
badly integrated confinement of the classical age.
