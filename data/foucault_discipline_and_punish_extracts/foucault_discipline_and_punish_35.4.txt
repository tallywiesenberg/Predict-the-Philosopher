A continuity of the punitive criteria and mechanisms, which on the 
basis of a mere deviation gradually strengthened the rules and 
increased the punishment.A continuous gradation of the established, 
specialized and competent authorities (in the order of knowledge 
and in the order of power) which, without resort to arbitrariness, 
but strictly according to the regulations, by means of observation 
and assessment hierarchized, differentiated, judged, punished and 
moved gradually from the correction of irregularities to the punish¬ 
ment of crime.The ‘carceral’ with its many diffuse or compact 
forms, its institutions of supervision or constraint, of discreet sur¬ 
veillance and insistent coercion, assured the communication of 
punishments according to quality and quantity; it connected in 
series or disposed according to subtle divisions the minor and the 
serious penalties, the mild and the strict forms of treatment, bad 
marks and light sentences.You will end up in the convict-ship, the 
slightest indiscipline seems to say; and the harshest of prisons says 
to the prisoners condemned to life: I shall note the slightest irregu¬ 
larity in your conduct.The generality of the punitive function that 
the eighteenth century sought in the ‘ideological’ technique of 
representations and signs now had as its support the extension, the 
material framework, complex, dispersed, but coherent, of the various 
carceral mechanisms.
