The carceral, with its far-reaching networks, allows the re¬ 
cruitment of major ‘delinquents’.It organizes what might be called 
‘disciplinary careers’ in which, through various exclusions and 
rejections, a whole process is set in motion.In the classical period, 
there opened up in the confines or interstices of society the confused, 
tolerant and dangerous domain of the ‘outlaw’ or at least of that 
which eluded the direct hold of power: an uncertain space that was 
for criminality a training ground and a region of refuge; there 
poverty, unemployment, pursued innocence, cunning, the struggle 
against the powerful, the refusal of obligations and laws, and organ¬ 
ized crime all came together as chance and fortune would dictate; 
it was the domain of adventure that Gil Bias, Sheppard or Mandrin, 
each in his own way, inhabited.Through the play of disciplinary 
differentiations and divisions, the nineteenth century constructed 
rigorous channels which, within the system, inculcated docility and 
produced delinquency by the same mechanisms.There was a sort of 
disciplinary ‘training’, continuous and compelling, that had some¬ 
thing of the pedagogical curriculum and something of the profes¬ 
sional network.
