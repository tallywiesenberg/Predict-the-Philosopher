It is unwilling to waste even what it has decided to 
disqualify.In this panoptic society of which incarceration is the 
omnipresent armature, the delinquent is not outside the law; he is, 
from the very outset, in the law, at the very heart of the law, or at 
least in the midst of those mechanisms that transfer the individual 
imperceptibly from discipline to the law, from deviation to offence.Although it is true that prison punishes delinquency, delinquency 
is for the most part produced in and by an incarceration which, 
ultimately, prison perpetuates in its turn.The prison is merely the 
natural consequence, no more than a higher degree, of that hierÂ¬ 
archy laid down step by step.The delinquent is an institutional 
product.
