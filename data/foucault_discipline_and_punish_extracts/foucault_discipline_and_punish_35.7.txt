It is no use being surprised, therefore, that in a consider¬ 
able proportion of cases the biography of convicts passes through 
all these mechanisms and establishments, whose purpose, it is widely 
believed, is to lead away from prison.That one should find in them 
what one might call the index of an irrepressibly delinquent ‘char¬ 
acter’: the prisoner condemned to hard labour was meticulously pro¬ 
duced by a childhood spent in a reformatory, according to the lines 
of force of the generalized carceral system.Conversely, the lyricism 
of marginality may find inspiration in the image of the ‘outlaw’, the 
great social nomad, who prowls on the confines of a docile, fright¬ 
ened order.But it is not on the fringes of society and through succes¬ 
sive exiles that criminality is bom, but by means of ever more 
closely placed insertions, under ever more insistent surveillance, by 
an accumulation of disciplinary coercion.In short, the carceral 
archipelago assures, in the depths of the social body, the formation 
of delinquency on the basis of subtle illegalities, the overlapping of the 
latter by the former and the establishment of a specified criminality.
