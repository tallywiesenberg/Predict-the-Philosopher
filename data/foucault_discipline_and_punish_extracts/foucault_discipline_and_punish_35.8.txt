Throughout this network, which comprises so 
many ‘regional’ institutions, relatively autonomous and independent, 
is transmitted, with the ‘prison-form’, the model of justice itself.The regulations of the disciplinary establishments may reproduce 
the law, the punishments imitate the verdicts and penalties, the 
surveillance repeat the police model; and, above all these multiple 
establishments, the prison, which in relation to them is a pure form, 
unadulterated and unmitigated, gives them a sort of official sanction.The carceral, with its long gradation stretching from the convict- 
ship or imprisonment with hard labour to diffuse, slight limitations, 
communicates a type of power that the law validates and that justice 
uses as its favourite weapon.How could the disciplines and the 
power that functions in them appear arbitrary, when they merely 
operate the mechanisms of justice itself, even with a view to mitigat¬ 
ing their intensity.^ When, by generalizing its effects and trans¬ 
mitting it to every level, it makes it possible to avoid its full rigour.^ 
Carceral continuity and the fusion of the prison-form make it 
possible to legalize, or in any case to legitimate disciplinary power, 
which thus avoids any element of excess or abuse it may entail.But, conversely, the carceral pyramid gives to the power to 
inflict legal punishment a context in which it appears to be free of all 
excess and all violence.
