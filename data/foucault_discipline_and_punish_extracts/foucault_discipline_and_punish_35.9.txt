By 
means of a carceral continuum, the authority that sentences infil¬ 
trates all those other authorities that supervise, transform, correct, 
improve.It might even be said that nothing really distinguishes 
them any more except the singularly ‘dangerous’ character of the 
delinquents, the gravity of their departures from normal behaviour 
and the necessary solemnity of the ritual.But, in its function, the 
power to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or 
educating.It receives from them, and from their lesser, smaller task, 
a sanction from below; but one that is no less important for that, 
since it is the sanction of technique and rationality.The carceral 
‘naturalizes’ the legal power to punish, as it ‘legalizes’ the technical 
power to discipline.
