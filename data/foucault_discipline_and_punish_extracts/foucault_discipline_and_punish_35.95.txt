In thus homogenizing them, effacing what may 
be violent in one and arbitrary in the other, attenuating the effects of 
revolt that they may both arouse, thus depriving excess in either of 
any purpose, circulating the same calculated, mechanical and dis¬ 
creet methods from one to the other, the carceral makes it possible 
to carry out that great ‘economy’ of power whose formula the 
eighteenth century had sought, when the problem of the accumula¬ 
tion and useful administration of men first emerged.By operating at every level of the social body and by mingling 
ceaselessly the art of rectifying and the right to punish, the universal¬ 
ity of the carceral lowers the level from which it becomes natural 
and acceptable to be punished.The question is often posed as to 
how, before and after the Revolution, a new foundation was given 
to the right to punish.And no doubt the answer is to be found in 
the theory of the contract.But it is perhaps more important to ask 
the reverse question: how were people made to accept the power to 
punish, or quite simply, when punished, tolerate being so.
