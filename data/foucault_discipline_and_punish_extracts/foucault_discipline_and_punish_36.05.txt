In view of this, it is useless to believe in the good 
or bad consciences of judges, or even of their unconscious.Their 
immense ‘appetite for medicine’ which is constantly manifested - 
from their appeal to psychiatric experts, to their attention to the 
chatter of criminology - expresses the major fact that the power 
they exercise has been ‘denatured’; that it is at a certain level governed 
by laws; that at another, more fundamental level it functions as a 
normative power; it is the economy of power that they exercise, 
and not that of their scruples or their humanism, that makes them 
pass ‘therapeutic’ sentences and recommend ‘rehabilitating’ periods 
of imprisonment.But, conversely, if the judges accept ever more 
reluctantly to condemn for the sake of condemning, the activity of 
judging has increased precisely to the extent that the normalizing 
power has spread.Borne along by the omnipresence of the mechan¬ 
isms of discipline, basing itself on all the carceral apparatuses, it has 
become one of the major functions of our society.The judges of 
normality are present everywhere.
