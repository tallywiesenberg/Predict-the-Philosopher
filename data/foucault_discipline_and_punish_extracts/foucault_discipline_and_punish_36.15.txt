By virtue of its methods of fixing, 
dividing, recording, it has been one of the simplest, crudest, also 
most concrete, but perhaps most indispensable conditions for the 
development of this immense activity of examination that has objec¬ 
tified human behaviour.If, after the age of ‘inquisitorial’ justice, we 
have entered the age of ‘examinatory’ justice, if, in an even more 
general way, the method of examination has been able to spread so 
widely throughout society, and to give rise in part to the sciences 
of man, one of the great instruments for this has been the multiplicity 
and close overlapping of the various mechanisms of incarceration.I am not saying that the human sciences emerged from the prison.But, if they have been able to be formed and to produce so many 
profound changes in the episteme, it is because they have been 
conveyed by a specific and new modality of power: a certain policy 
of the body, a certain way of rendering the group of men docile and 
useful.This policy required the involvement of definite relations of 
knowledge in relations of power; it called for a technique of over¬ 
lapping subjection and objectification; it brought with it new pro¬ 
cedures of individualization.
