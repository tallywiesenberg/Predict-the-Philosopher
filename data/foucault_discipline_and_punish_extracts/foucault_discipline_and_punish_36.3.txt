The first is that which reduces the utility (or increases 
its inconveniences) of a delinquency accommodated as a specific 
illegality, locked up and supervised; thus the growth of great 
national or international illegalities directly linked to the political 
and economic apparatuses (financial illegalities, information services, 
arms and drugs trafficking, property speculation) makes it clear that 
the somewhat rustic and conspicuous work force of delinquency is 
proving ineffective; or again, on a smaller scale, as soon as the 
economic levy on sexual pleasure is carried out more efficiently by 
the sale of contraceptives, or obliquely through publications, films 
or shows, the archaic hierarchy of prostitution loses much of its 
former usefulness.The second process is the growth of the disci¬ 
plinary networks, the multiplication of their exchanges with the 
penal apparatus, the ever more important powers that are given 
them, the ever more massive transference to them of judicial func¬ 
tions; now, as medicine, psychology, education, public assistance, 
‘social work’ assume an ever greater share of the powers of super¬ 
vision and assessment, the penal apparatus will be able, in turn, to 
become medicalized, psychologized, educationalized; and by the 
same token that turning-point represented by the prison becomes 
less useful when, through the gap between its penitentiary discourse 
and its effect of consolidating delinquency, it articulates the penal 
power and the disciplinary power.In the midst of all these mechan¬ 
isms of normalization, which are becoming ever more rigorous in 
their application, the specificity of the prison and its role as link are 
losing something of their purpose.If there is an overall political issue around the prison, it is not 
therefore whether it is to be corrective or not; whether the judges, 
the psychiatrists or the sociologists are to exercise more power in it 
than the administrators or supervisors; it is not even whether we 
should have prison or something other than prison.At present, the 
problem lies rather in the steep rise in the use of these mechanisms 
of normalization and the wide-ranging powers which, through the 
proliferation of new disciplines, they bring with them.
