The carceral 


In 1836, a correspondent wrote to La Phalange: ‘Moralists, 
philosophers, legislators, flatterers of civilization, this is the plan of 
your Paris, neatly ordered and arranged, here is the improved plan 
in which all like things are gathered together.At the centre, and 
within a first enclosure; hospitals for all diseases, almshouse» for 
all types of poverty, madhouses, prisons, convict-prisons for men, 
women and children.Around the first enclosure, barracks, court¬ 
rooms, police stations, houses for prison warders, scaffolds, houses 
for the executioner and his assistants.At the four corners, the 
Chamber of Deputies, the Chamber of Peers, the Institute and the 
Royal Palace.Outside, there are the various services that supply 
the central enclosure, commerce, with its swindlers and its bank¬ 
ruptcies; industry and its furious struggles; the press, with its 
sophisms; the gambling dens; prostitution, the people dying of 
hunger or wallowing in debauchery, always ready to lend an ear 
to the voice of the Genius of Revolutions; the heartless rich.
