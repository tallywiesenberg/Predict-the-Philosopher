..Lastly the ruthless war of all against all’ {La Phalange, 10 August 
1836).I shall stop with this anonymous text.We are now far away from 
the country of tortures, dotted with wheels, gibbets, gallows, 
pillories; we are far, too, from that dream of the reformers, less 
than fifty years before: the city of punishments in which a thousand 
small theatres would have provided an endless multicoloured repre¬ 
sentation of justice in which the punishments, meticulously pro¬ 
duced on decorative scaffolds, would have constituted the permanent 
festival of the penal code.
