The carceral city, with its imaginary 
‘geo-politics’, is governed by quite different principles.The extract 
from La Phalange reminds us of some of the more important ones: 
that at the centre of this city, and as if to hold it in place, there is, 
not the ‘centre of power’, not a network of forces, but a multiple 
network of diverse elements - walls, space, institution, rules, dis¬ 
course; that the model of the carceral city is not, therefore, the body 
of the king, with the powers that emanate from it, nor the contrac¬ 
tual meeting of wills from which a body that was both individual 
and collective was born, but a strategic distribution of elements of 
different natures and levels.That the prison is not the daughter of 
laws, codes or the judicial apparatus; that it is not subordinated to 
the court and the docile or clumsy instrument of the sentences that

it hands out and of the results that it would like to achieve; that it is 
the court that is external and subordinate to the prison.That in the 
central position that it occupies, it is not alone, but linked to a whole 
series of ‘carceral’ mechanisms which seem distinct enough - since 
they are intended to alleviate pain, to cure, to comfort - but which 
all tend, like the prison, to exercise a power of normalization.That 
these mechanisms are applied not to transgressions against a ‘central’ 
law, but to the apparatus of production - ‘commerce’ and ‘industry’ 
- to a whole multiplicity of illegalities, in all their diversity of nature 
and origin, their specific role in profit and the different ways in 
which they are dealt with by the punitive mechanisms.
