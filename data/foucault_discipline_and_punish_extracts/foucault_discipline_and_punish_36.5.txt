And that 
ultimately what presides over all these mechanisms is not the unitary 
functioning of an apparatus or an institution, but the necessity of 
combat and the rules of strategy.That, consequently, the notions of 
institutions of repression, rejection, exclusion, marginalization, are 
not adequate to describe, at the very centre of the carceral city, the 
formation of the insidious leniencies, unavowable petty cruelties, 
small acts of cunning, calculated methods, techniques, ‘sciences’ 
that permit the fabrication of the disciplinary individual.In this 
central and centralized humanity, the effect and instrument of com¬ 
plex power relations, bodies and forces subjected by multiple 
mechanisms of ‘incarceration’, objects for discourses that are in 
themselves elements for this strategy, we must hear the distant roar 
of battle.At this point I end a book that must serve as a historical back¬ 
ground to various studies of the power of normalization and the 
formation of knowledge in modern society.308
