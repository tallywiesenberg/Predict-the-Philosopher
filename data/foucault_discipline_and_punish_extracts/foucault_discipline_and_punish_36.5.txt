Generalized punishment 


today whenever the problem of an economy of punishment is posed. 
It is as if the eighteenth century had opened up the crisis of this 
economy and, in order to resolve it, proposed the fundamental law 
that punishment must have ‘humanity’ as its ‘measure’, without any 
definitive meaning being given to this principle, which nevertheless 
is regarded as insuperable. We must, therefore, recount the birth 
and early days of this enigmatic ‘leniency’. 

Homage is paid to the ‘great reformers’ - Beccaria, Servan, 
Dupaty, Lacretelle, Duport, Pastoret, Target, Bergasse, the com¬ 
pilers of the Cahiers, or petitions, and the Constituent Assembly - 
for having imposed this leniency on a legal machinery and on 
‘classical’ theoreticians who, at the end of the eighteenth century, 
were still rejecting it with well-formulated arguments. (Cf., in par¬ 
ticular, Muyart de Vouglans’s polemic against Beccaria - Muyart, 
1766.) 

Yet this reform must be situated in a process that historians have 
recently uncovered through the study of legal archives: the relaxa¬ 
tion of penality in the eighteenth century or, to be more precise, 
the double movement by which, during this period, crimes seemed 
to lose their violence, while punishments, reciprocally, lost some of 
their intensity, but at the cost of greater intervention. From the end 
of the seventeenth century, in fact, one observes a considerable 
diminution in murders and, generally speaking, in physical acts of 
aggression; offences against property seem to take over from crimes 
of violence; theft and swindling, from murder and assault; the 
diffuse, occasional, but frequent delinquency of the poorest classes 
was superseded by a limited, but ‘skilled’ delinquency; the criminals 
of the seventeenth century were ‘harassed men, ill-fed, quick to act, 
quick to anger, seasonal criminals’; those of the eighteenth, ‘crafty, 
cunning, sly, calculating’ criminals on the fringes of society (Chaunu, 
1962, 236 and 1966, 107-8). Lastly, the internal organizations of 
delinquency altered; the great gangs of malefactors (looters working 
in small, armed units, groups of smugglers firing on the agents of the 
tax authorities, disbanded soldiers or deserters who roamed the 
countryside together) tended to break up; tracked down more 
efficiently and forced to work in smaller groups - often no more 
than half-a-dozen men - in order to pass undetected, they contented
