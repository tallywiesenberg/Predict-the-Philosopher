Bernard of Pavia does not refer 
to it, but it is mentioned by Hostiemis.Crater’s definition is character¬ 
istic: 'Aut legitime convictus out sponte confessus.’

Notes 


In medieval law, the confession was valid only when made by an 
adult and before the adversary.Cf.L^vy.3 The Gazette tribunaiix, 6 July 1837, reports, from a Gloucester news¬ 
paper, the ‘atrocious and disgusting’ conduct of an executioner who 
after hanging a condemned man ‘took the corpse by the shoulders, 
violently turned it round and struck it several times saying: “Are you 
dead enough now?’’ then, turning towards the crowd, laughing and 
jeering, he made several indecent remarks’.
