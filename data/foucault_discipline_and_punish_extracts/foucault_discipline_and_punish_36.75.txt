The crowd, having discovered an informer, killed him ‘with an 
inhumanity carried to the farthest excess’ and ‘dragged him after his 
death, a rope around his neck, to M. Berryer’s door’.Now, this 
informer was a thief who would have been broken on the wheel with 
his accomplice Raffiat, had he not agreed to act as an informer; he was 
greatly appreciated by the police on account of his knowledge of all 
the intricacies of the plot; and he was ‘highly regarded in his new 
trade’.We have an example here that is interesting on a number of 
counts: a movement of revolt triggered off by a relatively new means 
of repression, which was not penal justice, but the police; a case of that 
technical collaboration between delinquents and police, which was to 
become normal from the eighteenth century onwards; a riot in which 
people took it upon themselves to torture a condemned man who had 
unjustly escaped the scaffold.5 Those whom R. Mandrou calls the two great ones: Cartouche and 
Mandrin, to whom one should add Guilleri (Mandrou, 112).In Eng¬ 
land, Jonathan Wild, Jack Sheppard and Claude Duval played a some¬ 
what similar role.
