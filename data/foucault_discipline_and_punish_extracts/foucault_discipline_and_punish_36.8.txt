6 This title is to be found not only in the Bibliotheque de Troyes, but 
also in the Bibliotheque de Normandie (cf.Helot).7 Cf., for example, Lacretelle: ‘In order to satisfy this need for strong 
emotion, in order to deepen the impression of a great example, one 
allows these terrible stories to circulate.The poets of the people take 
them up and spread their fame to every part of the land.One day a 
family hears at its door the story in song of the crime and execution 
of its sons’ (Lacretelle, 106).
