1 Mogensen, 326.The author shows that in Auge crimes of violence 
were four times less numerous on the eve of the Revolution than at the 
end of the reign of Louis XIV.Generally speaking, the work directed 
by Pierre Chaunu on criminality in Normandy shows the same rise in 
fraud at the expense of violence.Cf.articles by B. Boutelet, J. C. 
Gegot and V. Boucheron in the Annales de Normandie of 1962, 1966 
and 1971.
