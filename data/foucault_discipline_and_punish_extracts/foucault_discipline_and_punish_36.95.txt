between 1750 and 1755,5 per cent of those convicted for stealing food 
were sent to the galleys, but 15 per cent between 1775 and 1790: ‘The 
courts became more severe as time went on...The values useful to a 
society that wished to be ordered and respectful of property were 
under threat’ (Farge, 130-42).3 On this criticism of ‘excessive power’ and of its bad distribution in the 
judicial apparatus, cf.in particular Dupaty, 1788, Lacretelle and 
Target.4 Cf.
