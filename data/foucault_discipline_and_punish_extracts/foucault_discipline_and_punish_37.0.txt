themselves with more furtive operations, with a more modest 
deployment of forces and less risk of bloodshed; ‘The physical 
destruction or institutional dislocation of large gangs ... left the 
field free for an anti-property form of delinquency practised by 
individuals or very small groups of robbers and pickpockets, seldom 
more than four in number’ (Le Roy-Ladurie). A general movement 
shifted criminality from the attack of bodies to the more or less 
direct seizure of goods; and from a ‘mass criminality’ to a ‘marginal 
criminality’, partly the preserve of professionals. It was as if there 
had been a gradual lowering of level - ‘a defusion of the tensions 
that dominate human relations, — a better control of violent 
impulses’^ - and as if the illegal practices had themselves slackened 
their hold on the body and turned to other targets. Crime became 
less violent long before punishment became less severe. But this 
transformation cannot be separated from several underlying pro¬ 
cesses. The first of these, as P. Chaunu observes, was a change in 
the operation of economic pressures, a general rise in the standard 
of living, a large demographic expansion, an increase in wealth and 
property and ‘a consequent need for security’ (Chaunu, 1971, 56). 
Furthermore, throughout the eighteenth century, one can observe a 
certain increased severity in the law: in England, out of the 223 
capital crimes in force at the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
156 had been introduced during the preceding hundred years 
(Buxton, XXXIX); in France, the legislation on vagabondage had 
been revised in the direction of greater severity on several occasions 
since the seventeenth century; a tighter, more meticulous implemen¬ 
tation of the law tended to take account of a mass of minor offences 
that it once allowed to escape more easily: ‘in the eighteenth century, 
the law became slower, heavier, harder on theft, whose relative 
frequency had increased, and towards which it now assumed the 
bourgeois appearances of a class justice’;* the growth in France 
above all, and especially in Paris, of a police apparatus that prevented 
the development of organized, open criminality, shifted it towards 
more discreet forms; to this set of precautions, one should add the 
very widespread belief in a constant and dangerous rise in crime. 
Whereas the historians of today observe a diminution in the great 
gangs of malefactors, Le Trosne saw them roaming the French 
countryside like swarms of locusts: ‘It is these voracious insects who
