‘free labour that belongs exclusively to free men’ (Archives Parlemen- 
taires, XXVI, yioff).312

3 Part of this code was translated in the introduction to the French

tions of the warders, the security of the premises and the inability of 
prisoners to communicate among themselves.For example, the 
judgement of the Dijon Parlement of 21 September 1706.
