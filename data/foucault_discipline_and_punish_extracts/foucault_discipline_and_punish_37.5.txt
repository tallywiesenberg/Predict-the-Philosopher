living as they wish, as in a conquered country, exacting levies under 
the name of alms.’ They cost the poorest peasants more than taxes: 
the richer peasants had to pay anything up to a third of their 
incomes (Le Trosne, 1764,4). Most observers maintained that crime 
was increasing - they included, of course, those who advocated 
sterner measures; they also included those who thought that a law 
that was more restrained in its use of violence would be more 
effective, less liable to retreat before its own consequences (cf., for 
example, Dupaty, 247); and they included the magistrates who 
claimed to be swamped by the number of trials: ‘the misery of the 
people and the corruption of morals have increased the number of 
crimes and convicted criminals’ (one of the judges of the Chambre 
de la Toumelle in an address to the king, 2 August 1768, quoted 
in Farge, 66); in any case, that crime was on the increase was shown 
by the real practice of the courts. ‘The revolutionary and imperial 
era could already be sensed in the last years of the Ancien Regime. 
One is struck, in the trials of 1782-9, by the increase in tension. 
There is a new severity towards the poor, a concerted rejection of 
evidence, a rise in mutual mistrust, hatred and fear’ (Chaunu, 1966, 
108). 

In fact, the shift from a criminality of blood to a criminality of 
fraud forms part of a whole complex mechanism, embracing the 
development of production, the increase of wealth, a higher juridical 
and moral value placed on property relations, stricter methods of 
surveillance, a tighter partitioning of the population, more efficient 
techniques of locating and obtaining information: the shift in illegal 
practices is correlative with an extension and a refinement of puni¬ 
tive practices. 

Was this a general change of attitude, a ‘change that belongs to 
the domain of the spirit and the subconscious’ (the expression is 
Mogensen’s).^ Perhaps, but more certainly and more immediatel} 
it was an effort to adjust the mechanisms of power that frame th< 
everyday lives of individuals; an adaptation and a refinement of thf 
machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under Surveil¬ 
lance their everyday behaviour, their identity, their activity, their 
apparently unimportant gestures; another policy for that multiplicity
