The frequency 
of the penalty of banishment emphasized still further the relations 
between crime and vagabondage.In 1771, the States of Flanders 
remarked that ‘penalties of banishment imposed on beggars remained 
ineffectual, in view of the fact that the States send to one another 
subjects that they find pernicious at home.As a result, a beggar, 
chased in this way from place to place, will finally get himself hanged, 
whereas, if he had been given the habit of work, he would not have 
embarked on his evil path’ (Stoobant, 228).313
