12 B.Rush, who was one of the inspectors, notes after a visit to Walnut 
Street: ‘Moral cares: preaching, reading of good books, cleanliness of 
clothes and rooms, baths; one does not raise one’s voice, little wine, 
as little tobacco as possible, little obscene or profane conversation.Constant work: the gardens taken care of; it is beautiful: 1,200 head of 
cabbage’ (in Teeters, 1935, 50).13 Rush, 14.This idea of an apparatus for transforming human beings 
is already to be found in Hanway’s project for a ‘reformatory’: ‘The 
idea of a hospital and that of a malefactor are incompatible; but let us 
try to make the prison an authentic and effective reformatory, instead 
of it being like the others a school of vice’ (Hanway, 52).
