minor criminals - as a tendency towards a more finely tuned justice, 
towards a closer penal mapping of the social body. Following a 
circular process, the threshold of the passage to violent crimes rises, 
intolerance to economic offences increases, controls become more 
thorough, penal interventions at once more premature and more 
numerous. 

If one compares this process with the critical discourse of the 
reformers, a remarkable strategic coincidence emerges. What they 
were attacking in traditional justice, before they set out the prin¬ 
ciples of a new penality, was certainly the excessive nature of the 
punishments; but an excess that was bound up with an irregularity 
even more than with an abuse of the power to punish. On 24 March 
1790, Thouret opened the debate in the Constituent Assembly on 
the new organization of the judicial power. In his view, this power 
had become ‘denatured’ in France in three ways. By private appro¬ 
priation: the offices of judge were sold; they were hereditary; they 
had a commercial value and, for that reason, the justice that was 
handed out was onerous. By a confusion between two types of 
power: that which dispenses justice and formulates a sentence by 
applying the law and that which creates the law itself. Lastly, by the 
existence of a whole series of privileges that made the implementa¬ 
tion of the law inconsistent: there were courts, procedures, litigants, 
even offences that were ‘privileged’ and fell outside common law 
{Archives parlementaires, XII, 344). This was only one of the many 
criticisms that had been levied at the legal system for the past fifty 
years at least, all of which denounced in this denaturation the 
principle of an irregular justice. Penal justice was irregular first of 
all by virtue of the multiplicity of courts responsible for assuring it, 
without ever forming a single and continuous pyramid (cf. Linguet 
or Boucher d’Argis, 1789). Quite apart from the ecclesiastical juris¬ 
dictions, we must take into account the discontinuities, overlappings 
and conflicts between the different legal systems: those of the 
nobility, which still played an important role in judging petty 
offences; those of the king, which were themselves numerous and 
badly coordinated (the sovereign courts were often in conflict with

the bailiffs’ courts and above all with the presidial courts, which had 
recently been created as intermediary instances); those which, de jure 
or de facto, were administered by governmental authorities (such as 
the intendants, or provincial administrators) or police authorities 
(such as the provosts and police magistrates); to these should also
