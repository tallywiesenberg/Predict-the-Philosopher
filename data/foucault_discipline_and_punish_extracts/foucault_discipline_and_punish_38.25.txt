This regula¬

same period and earlier.316 



Notes 


2 In the Postscript to the Panopticon, *791* Bentham adds dark inspec¬ 
tion galleries painted in black around the inspector’s lodge, each 
making it possible to observe two storeys of cells.3 In his first version of the Panopticon, Bentham had also imagined an 
acoustic surveillance, operated by means of pipes leading from the 
cells to the central tower.In the Postscript he abandoned the idea, 
perhaps because he could not introduce into it the principle of dis¬ 
symmetry and prevent the prisoners from hearing the inspector as well 
as the inspector hearing them.Julius tried to develop a system of dis¬ 
symmetrical listening (Julius, i8).
