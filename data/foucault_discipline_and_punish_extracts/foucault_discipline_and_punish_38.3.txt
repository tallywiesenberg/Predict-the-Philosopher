4 Imagining this continuous flow of visitors entering the central tower 
by an underground passage and then observing the circular landscape 
of the Panopticon, was Bentham aware of the Panoramas that Barker 
was constructing at exactly the same period (the first seems to have 
dated from 1787) and in which the visitors, occupying the central 
place, saw unfolding around them a landscape, a city or a battle.The 
visitors occupied exactly the place of the sovereign gaze.5 In the second half of the eighteenth century, it was often suggested 
that the army should be used for the surveillance and general partitionÂ¬ 
ing of the population.The army, as yet to undergo discipline in the 
seventeenth century, was regarded as a force capable of instilling it.Cf., for example, Servan, Le Soldat citoyen, 1780.
