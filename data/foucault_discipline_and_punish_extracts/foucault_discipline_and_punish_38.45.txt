The surest ways of making individuals better are work and 
education.’ Education consists not only in reading and arithmetic, but 
also in reconciling the prisoners with ‘ideas of order, morality, respect 
for themselves and for others’ (Beugnot, prefect of Seine-Inferieure, 
order issued Frimaire, Year X).In the reports that Chaptal demanded 
from the General Councils of the dipartements, over a dozen asked for 
prisons in which the inmates could be made to work.3 The most important were no doubt those proposed by Lucas, Marquet- 
Wasselot, Faucher, Bonneville, and a little later by Ferrus.It should 
be noted that most of them were not philanthropists, criticizing the 
carceral institution from the outside, but were bound up, in one way or 
another, with the administration of the prisons.They were official 
technicians.
