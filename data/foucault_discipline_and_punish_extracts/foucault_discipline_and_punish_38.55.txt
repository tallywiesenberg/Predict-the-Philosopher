Pauvre Jacques will draw the attention of its readers to places of 
reclusion and detention, prisons and almshouses; it will not keep silent 
on places where the guilty man is handed over to torture when the law 
condemns him only to work ...’ {Pauvre Jacques, ist year, no.7).Similarly, the Gaiette de Sainte-Pelagie campaigned for a penitentiary 
system whose aim would be ‘the amelioration of the species’, any other 
being ‘the expression of a still barbarous society’ (21 March 1833).6 The discussion that began in France about 1830 was still continuing in 
1850; Charles Lucas, the advocate of Auburn, was the inspiration 
behind the order of 1839 on the running of the maisons centrales (work 
in common and absolute silence).The wave of revolt that followed 
and perhaps the general agitation in the country in the years 1842-3 
resulted in the adoption in 1844 of the Pennsylvanian regime of 
absolute isolation, advocated by Demetz, Blouet and Tocqueville.
