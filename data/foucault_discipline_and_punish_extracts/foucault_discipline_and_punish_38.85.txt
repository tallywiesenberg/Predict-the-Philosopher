This part of the spectacle, in 1836, was 
no longer public; only a few privileged spectators were admitted to it.The account of the riveting of the convicts’ chains to be found in the 
Revue de Paris corresponds exactly - to the point even of using the 
same words - with that of the Dernier jour d’un condamne, 1829.2 The Gaiette des trihunaux regularly published these lists and these 
‘criminal’ notices.From the following description people would be 
able to recognize Delacollonge: ‘Old cloth trousers over a pair of 
boots, a peaked cap of the same stuff and a grey overall.. .A coat of 
blue stuff’ (6 June 1836).
