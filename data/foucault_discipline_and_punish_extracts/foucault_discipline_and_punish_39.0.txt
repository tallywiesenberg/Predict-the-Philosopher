The convicts’ Sabbath is described in the Dernier jour d’un 
condamne: ‘Society was represented there by the gaolers and the horri¬ 
fied and curious bystanders.The criminal defined the intentions of 
society and made of this horrible punishment a family festival.’

Notes 


6 A song of the same kind is quoted by the Gcqette des tribunaux of 
10 April 1836.It was sung to the tune of the ‘Marseillaise’.The 
patriotic war song clearly became the song of the social war: ‘What do 
these stupid people want of us, do they come to insult us in our mis¬ 
fortune.^ They stare at us calmly.Our butchers do not horrify them.’ 

7 There is a class of writers who ‘have striven to glorify the crimes of 
certain exceptionally skilled malefactors, give them the leading roles 
and expose the agents of authority to their sallies, their jeers and their 
ill-disguised mockery.
