Whoever has seen a performance oiAuberge des 
Adrets or Robert Macaire, a drama celebrated among the people, will 
recognize without difficulty the correctness of my observations.It is 
the triumph, the apotheosis, of audacity and crime.Honest folk and 
the forces of public order are ridiculed from beginning to end’ (Fregier, 
II, 187-8).8 Gaiette des tribunaux, 23 July 1837.On 9 August, the Gaiette reported 
that the carriage had overturned on the outskirts of Guingamp: 
instead of mutinying, the prisoners, ‘helped their guardians to put 
their common vehicle back on its wheels’.
