11 This campaign was very vigorous before and after the passing of new 
regulations for the maisons centrales in 1839.The regulations were 
severe (silence, abolition of wine and tobacco, reduction in food) and 
they were followed by revolts.On 3 October 1840, Le Moruteur 
wrote: ‘It was scandalous to see prisoners gorging themselves with 
wine, meat, game, delicacies of all kinds and treating prison as a 
convenient hostelry where they could procure all the comforts that 
the state of liberty often refused them.’ 

12 In 1826, many of the General Councils demanded that deportation be 
substituted for constant and ineffective incarceration.In 1842, the 
General Council of the Hautes-Alpes demanded that the prisons 
become ‘truly expiatory’; those of Drome, Eure-et-Loir, Ni^vre, 
Rhone and Seine-et-Oise made similar demands.321
