The director of the maison centrale of Embrun 
remarked: ‘The excessive comfort in the prisons probably contributes 
a great deal to the terrible increase in the number of recidivists.’ While 
the director at Eysses remarked; ‘The present regime is not severe 
enough, and if one thing is certain it is that for many of the inmates 
prison has its attractions and that they find in prison depraved pleasures 
that are entirely to their liking.’ The director at Limoges: ‘The 
present regime of the maisons centrales which, for the recidivists, are in 
fact little more than boarding houses, is in no way repressive’ (Cf.Moreau-Christophe, 1840, 86).Compare these remarks with declara¬ 
tions made, in July 1974, by the leaders of the union of prison workers 
concerning the effects of liberalization in prisons.14 On the problem of deportation, cf.Barbe-Marbois and the discussion 
between Blosseville and La Pilorgerie (on the subject of Botany Bay).
