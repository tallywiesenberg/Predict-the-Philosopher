Bure, Marengo and L. de Carn6, among others, drew up plans for the 
colonization of Algeria with delinquents.15 One of the first episodes was the organization under police supervision 
of the maisons de tolerance (1823), which went well beyond the pro¬ 
visions of the law of 14 July 1791, concerning surveillance in brothels.Cf.on this subject the manuscripts collected by the Prefecture of 
police (20-26).In particular, the following circular from the Prefect of 
police, dated 14 June 1823: ‘The establishment of houses of prostitu¬ 
tion ought naturally to be regarded with displeasure by any man who 
is concerned with public morality; I am not surprised that the Com¬ 
missioners of police oppose to the utmost of their powers the estab¬ 
lishment of houses in their various quarters.
