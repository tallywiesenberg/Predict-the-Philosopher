after his appointment in 1825, in which he sought to differentiate 
himself from his predecessors: ‘Legal ways are open to us... Brought 
up in the school of law, educated in the school of so worthy a magis-

very interesting pamphlet by Molene, De la libeni.19 For contemporary views of Lacenaire, see the dossier drawn up by 
M. Lebailly in his edition of Lacenaire’s Memoires, 1968, 297-304.20 The circle of the years 1835-6: Fieschi, who served the penalty com¬

discourse of crime and on crime.21 At the end of the eighteenth century Colquhoun gave some idea of the 
difficulty of the task for a city like London (Colquhoun, 27-9; 293-4).
