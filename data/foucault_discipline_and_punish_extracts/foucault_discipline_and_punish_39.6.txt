In La Ruche populaire (December 1839) Vingard replied to an 
article by Balzac published in Le Siicle.Balzac had said that a charge 
of theft was to be made with prudence and discretion when it concerned 
a rich man whose slightest dishonesty immediately became known: 
‘Say, Monsieur, with your hand on your conscience, whether the con¬ 
trary does not occur every day whether, with a great fortune and an 
elevated rank in society, one does not hnd a thousand solutions, a 
thousand means to hush up some unfortunate affair.’ 

27 In La Fratemiti, March 1847, there is a discussion of the Drouillard 
affair and reference is made to thefts in the naval administration at 
Rochefort.In June 1847, there was an article on the Boulmy trial and 
on the Cubi^re-Pellaprat affair; and, in July-August 1847, on the 
Benier-Lagrange-Jussieu affair, which involved misappropriation of 
public funds.28 ‘Licensed prostitution, direct material theft, house-breaking, murder, 
brigandage for the lower classes; while skilful spoliation, indirect, 
refined theft, clever exploitation of human cattle, carefully planned 
and brilliantly executed betrayals, transcendent pieces of sharp practice 
in short, all the truly elegant vices and lucrative crimes which the law 
is far too polite to interrupt remain the monopoly of the upper classes’ 
(i December 1838).29 Cf., for example, what La Phalange said of Delacollonge or of Elira- 
bide on i August 183d and 2 October 1840.
