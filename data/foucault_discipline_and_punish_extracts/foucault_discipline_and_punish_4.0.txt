Lastly, they are not univocal; they 
define innumerable points of confrontation, focuses of instability, 
each of which has its own risks of conflict, of struggles, and of an 
at least temporary inversion of the power relations.The overthrow 
of these ‘micro-powers’ does not, then, obey the law of all or 
nothing; it is not acquired once and for all by a new control of the 
apparatuses nor by a new functioning or a destruction of the in¬ 
stitutions; on the other hand, none of its localized episodes may be 
inscribed in history except by the effects that it induces on the entire 
network in which it is caught up.Perhaps, too, we should abandon a whole tradition that allows 
us to imagine that knowledge can exist only where the power rela¬ 
tions are suspended and that knowledge can develop only outside its 
injunctions, its demands and its interests.Perhaps we should aban¬ 
don the belief that power makes mad and that, by the same token, 
the renunciation of power is one of the conditions of knowledge.We should admit rather that power produces knowledge (and not 
simply by encouraging it because it serves power or by applying it 
because it is useful); that power and knowledge directly imply one 
another; that there is no power relation without the correlative 
constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that does 
not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations.
