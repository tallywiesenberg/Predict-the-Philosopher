These ‘power-knowledge relations’ are to be analysed, therefore, 
not on the basis of a subject of knowledge who is or is not free in 
relation to the power system, but, on the contrary, the subject who

knows, the objects to be known and the modalities of knowledge 
must be regarded as so many effects of these fundamental implica¬ 
tions of power-knowledge and their historical transformations.In 
short, it is not the activity of the subject of knowledge that pro¬ 
duces a corpus of knowledge, useful or resistant to power, but 
power-knowledge, the processes and struggles that traverse it and 
of which it is made up, that determines the forms and possible 
domains of knowledge.To analyse the political investment of the body and the micro¬ 
physics of power presupposes, therefore, that one abandons - where 
power is concerned - the violence-ideology opposition, the meta¬ 
phor of property, the model of the contract or of conquest; that - 
where knowledge is concerned - one abandons the opposition 
between what is ‘interested’ and what is ‘disinterested’, the model of 
knowledge and the primacy of the subject.Borrowing a word from 
Petty and his contemporaries, but giving it a different meaning from 
the one current in the seventeenth century, one might imagine a 
political ‘anatomy’.This would not be the study of a state in terms of 
a ‘body’ (with its elements, its resources and its forces), nor would 
it be the study of the body and its surroundings in terms of a small 
state.
