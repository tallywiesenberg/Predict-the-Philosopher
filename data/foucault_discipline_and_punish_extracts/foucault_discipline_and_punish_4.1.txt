One would be concerned with the ‘body politic’, as a set of 
material elements and techniques that serve as weapons, relays, 
communication routes and supports for the power and knowledge 
relations that invest human bodies and subjugate them by turning 
them into objects of knowledge.It is a question of situating the techniques of punishment - 
whether they seize the body in the ritual of public torture and 
execution or whether they are addressed to the soul - in the history 
of this body politic; of considering penal practices less as a conse¬ 
quence of legal theories than as a chapter of political anatomy.Kantorowitz gives a remarkable analysis of ‘The King’s Body’: 
a double body according to the juridical theology of the Middle 
Ages, since it involves not only the transitory element that is born 
and dies, but another that remains unchanged by time and is main¬ 
tained as the physical yet intangible support of the kingdom; 
around this duality, which was originally close to the Christological 
model, are organized an iconography, a political theory of monarchy, 
legal mechanisms that distinguish between as well as link the person

of the king and the demands of the Crown, and a whole ritual that 
reaches its height in the coronation, the funeral and the ceremonies 
of submission.At the opposite pole one might imagine placing the 
body of the condemned man; he, too, has his legal status; he gives 
rise to his own ceremonial and he calls forth a whole theoretical 
discourse, not in order to ground the ‘surplus power’ possessed by 
the person of the sovereign, but in order to code the ‘lack of power’ 
with which those subjected to punishment are marked.In the darkest 
region of the political field the condemned man represents the sym¬ 
metrical, inverted figure of the king.
