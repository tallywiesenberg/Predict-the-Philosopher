We should analyse what might 
be called, in homage to Kantorowitz, ‘the least body of the con¬ 
demned man’.If the surplus power possessed by the king gives rise to the 
duplication of his body, has not the surplus power exercised on the 
subjected body of the condemned man given rise to another type of 
duplication.^ That of a ‘non-corporal’, a ‘soul’, as Mably called it.The history of this ‘micro-physics’ of the punitive power would then 
be a genealogy or an element in a genealogy of the modern ‘soul’.Rather than seeing this soul as the reactivated remnants of an ideo- 
one would see it as the present correlative of a certain tech¬ 
nology of power over the body.It would be wrong to say that the 
soul is an illusion, or an ideological effect.
