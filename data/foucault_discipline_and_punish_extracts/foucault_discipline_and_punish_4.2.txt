On the contrary, it exists, 
it has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within the 
body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those 
punished - and, in a more general way, on those one supervises, 
trains and corrects, over madmen, children at home and at school, 
the colonized, over those who are stuck at a machine and supervised 
for the rest of their lives.This is the historical reality of this soul, 
which, unlike the soul represented by Christian theology, is not 
born in sin and subject to punishment, but is born rather out of 
methods of punishment, supervision and constraint.This real, nonÂ¬ 
corporal soul is not a substance; it is the element in which are 
articulated the effects of a certain type of power and the reference 
of a certain type of knowledge, the machinery by which the power 
relations give rise to a possible corpus of knowledge, and knowledge 
extends and reinforces the effects of this power.On this reality- 
reference, various concepts have been constructed and domains of 
analysis carved out: psyche, subjectivity, personality, consciousness.29
