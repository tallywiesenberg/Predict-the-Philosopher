; on it have been built scientific techniques and discourses, 
and the moral claims of humanism.But let there be no misunder¬ 
standing: it is not that a real man, the object of knowledge, philo¬ 
sophical reflection or technical intervention, has been substituted 
for the soul, the illusion of the theologians.The man described for 
us, whom we are invited to free, is already in himself the effect of a 
subjection much more profound than himself.A ‘soul’ inhabits him 
and brings him to existence, which is itself a factor in the mastery 
that power exercises over the body.The soul is the effect and 
instrument of a political anatomy; the soul is the prison of the body.
