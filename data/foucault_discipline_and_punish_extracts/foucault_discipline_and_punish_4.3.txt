That punishment in general and the prison in particular belong 
to a political technology of the body is a lesson that I have learnt 
not so much from history as from the present.In recent years, 
prison revolts have occurred throughout the world.There was cer¬ 
tainly something paradoxical about their aims, their slogans and the 
way they took place.They were revolts against an entire state of 
physical misery that is over a century old: against cold, suffocation 
and overcrowding, against decrepit walls, hunger, physical mal¬ 
treatment.But they were also revolts against model prisons, tran¬ 
quillizers, isolation, the medical or educational services.
