Were they 
revolts whose aims were merely material.^ Or contradictory revolts: 
against the obsolete, but also against comfort; against the warders, 
but also against the psychiatrists.^ In fact, all these movements - and 
the innumerable discourses that the prison has given rise to since 
the early nineteenth century - have been about the body and 
material things.What has sustained these discourses, these mem¬ 
ories and invectives are indeed those minute material details.One 
may, if one is so disposed, see them as no more than blind demands 
or suspect the existence behind them of alien strategies.In fact, they 
were revolts, at the level of the body, against the very body of the 
prison.What was at issue was not whether the prison environment 
was too harsh or too aseptic, too primitive or too efficient, but its 
very materiality as an instrument and vector of power; it is this 
whole technology of power over the body that the technology of 
the ‘soul’ - that of the educationalists, psychologists and psychia¬ 
trists - fails either to conceal or to compensate, for the simple reason 
that it is one of its tools.
