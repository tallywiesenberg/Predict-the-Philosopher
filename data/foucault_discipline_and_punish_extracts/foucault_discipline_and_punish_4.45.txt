The spectacle of the scaffold 


The ordinance of 1670 regulated the general forms of penal practice 
up to the Revolution.It laid down the following hierarchy of 
penalties: ‘Death, judicial torture pending proof, penal servitude, 
flogging, amende honorable, banishment.’ A high proportion of 
physical punishment.Customs, the nature of the crimes, the status 
of the condemned accounted for still more variations.‘Capital 
punishment comprises many kinds of death: some prisoners may be 
condemned to be hanged, others to having their hands cut off or 
their tongues cut out or pierced and then to be hanged; others, for 
more serious crimes, to be broken alive and to die on the wheel, 
after having their limbs broken; others to be broken until they die 
a natural death, others to be strangled and then broken, others to 
be burnt alive, others to be burnt after first being strangled; others 
to be drawn by four horses, others to have their heads cut off, and 
others to have their heads broken’ (Soulatges, 169-71).And Sou- 
latges adds, almost in passing, that there are also lighter penalties 
not mentioned by the ordinance: satisfaction to the injured party, 
warning, reprimand, a short period of imprisonment, prohibition 
from entering a certain area and, lastly, pecuniary punishments - 
fines or confiscation.
