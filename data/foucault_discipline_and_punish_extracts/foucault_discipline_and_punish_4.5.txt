But we must not be misled.There was a considerable gap between 
this arsenal of horrors and everyday penal practice.Public torture 
and execution was by no means the most frequent form of punish¬ 
ment.To us today the proportion of death sentences in the penal 
practice of the classical age may seem high: at the Chatelet^ during 
the period 1755-85 under 10 per cent of the sentences passed in¬ 
volved capital punishment: the wheel, the gallows or the stake 
(Petrovitch, 226flf); the Parlement of Flanders passed thirty-nine 
death sentences, out of a total of 260 sentences, between 1721 and
