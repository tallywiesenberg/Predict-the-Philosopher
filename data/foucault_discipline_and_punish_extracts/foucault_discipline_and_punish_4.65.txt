Torture correlates the type of corporal effect, the 
quality, intensity, duration of pain, with the gravity of the crime, 
the person of the criminal, the rank of his victims.There is a legal 
code of pain; when it involves torture, punishment does not fall 
upon the body indiscriminately or equally; it is calculated according 
to detailed rules: the number of lashes of the whip, the positioning 
of the branding iron, the duration of the death agony on the stake 
or the wheel (the court decides whether the criminal is to be 
strangled at once or allowed to die slowly,, and the points at which 
this gesture of pity must occur), the type of mutilation to be used 
(hand cut off, lips or tongue pierced).All these various elements 
multiply the punishments and are combined according to the court 
and the crime.‘The poetry of Dante put into laws,’ was how Rossi 
described it; a long course in physico-penal knowledge, in any case.Furthermore, torture forms part of a ritual.
