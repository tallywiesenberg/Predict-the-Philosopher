It is an element in the 
liturgy of punishment and meets two demands.It must mark the 
victim: it is intended, either by the scar it leaves on the body, or by 
the spectacle that accompanies it, to brand the victim with infamy; 
even if its function is to ‘purge’ the crime, torture does not recon¬ 
cile; it traces around or, rather, on the very body of the condemned 
man signs that must not be effaced; in any case, men will remember 
public exhibition, the pillory, torture and pain duly observed.And, 
from the point of view of the law that imposes it, public torture and 
execution must be spectacular, it must be seen by all almost as its 
triumph.The very excess of the violence employed is one of the 
elements of its glory: the fact that the guilty man should moan and 
cry out under the blows is not a shameful side-effect, it is the very 
ceremonial of justice being expressed in all its force.Hence no doubt 
those tortures that take place even after death: corpses burnt, ashes 
thrown to the winds, bodies dragged on hurdles and exhibited at 
the roadside.
