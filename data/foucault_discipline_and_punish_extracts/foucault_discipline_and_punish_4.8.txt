In France, as in most European countries, with the notable 
exception of England, the entire criminal procedure, right up to the 
sentence, remained secret: that is to say, opaque, not only to the 
public but also to the accused himself.It took place without him, 
or at least without his having any knowledge either of the charges 
or of the evidence.In the order of criminal justice, knowledge was 
the absolute privilege of the prosecution.The preliminary investiga¬ 
tion was carried out ‘as diligently and secretly as may be’, as the edict 
of 1498 put it.According to the ordinance of 1670, which confirmed 
and, on certain points, reinforced the severity of the preceding 
period, it was impossible for the accused to have access to the docu¬ 
ments of the case, impossible to know the identity of his accusers, 
impossible to know the nature of the evidence before objecting to 
witnesses, impossible to make use, until the last moments of the 
trial, of the documents in proof, impossible to have a lawyer, either 
to ensure the proper conduct of the case, or to take part, on the 
main issue, in the defence.
