Even in the eighteenth century, it was still common to 
meet distinctions like the following: true, direct, or legitimate proof 
(that provided by witnesses, for example) and indirect, conjeictural, 
artificial proof (obtained by argument); or, again, manifest proof, 
considerable proof, imperfect or slight (Jousse, 660); or, again, 
‘urgent or necessary’ proof that did not allow one to doubt the 
truth of the deed (this was ‘full’ proof: thus two irreproachable wit¬ 
nesses affirming that they saw the accused, carrying an unsheathed 
and bloody sword, leave the place where, some time later, the body 
of the dead man was found with stab wounds); approximate or semi¬ 
full proof, which may be regarded as true as long as the accused does 
not destroy it with evidence to the contrary (the evidence of a single 
eye-witness or death threats preceding a murder); lastly, distant or 
'adminicule' clues, which consisted only of opinion (rumour, the 
flight of the suspect, his manner when questioned, etc.- Muyart de 
Vouglans, 1757, 345-7)- Now, these distinctions are not simply 
theoretical subtleties.They have an operational function.First, 
because each of these kinds of evidence, taken in isolation, may have 
a particular type of judicial effect: ‘full’ proof may lead to any 
sentence; ‘semi-full’ proof may lead to any of the 'peines afflictives’, 
or heavy penalties, except death; imperfect and slight clues are 
enough for the suspect to have a writ issued against him, to have 
the case deferred for further inquiry or to have a fine imposed on 
him.Secondly, because they are combined according to precise 
arithmetical rules: two ‘semi-full’ proofs may make a complete proof; 
‘adminicuhs’, providing there are several of them and they concur.
