universality and necessity; to insert the power to punish more deeply 
into the social body. 

The conjuncture that saw the binh of reform is not, therefore, 
that of a new sensibility, but that of another policy with regard to 
illegalities. 

Roughly speaking, one might say that, under the Ancien Regime 
each of the different social strata had its margin of tolerated illega¬ 
lity: the non-application of the rule, the non-observance of the 
innumerable edicts or ordinances were a condition of the political 
and economic functioning of society. This feature may not have 
been peculiar to the Ancien Regime. But illegality was so deeply 
rooted and so necessary to the life of each social stratum, that it had 
in a sense its own coherence and economy. Sometimes it took on an 
absolutely statutory form - as with the privileges accorded certain 
individuals and groups - which made it not so much an illegality 
as a regular exemption. Sometimes it took the form of a massive 
general non-observance, which meant that for decades, sometimes 
for centuries, ordinances could be published and constantly renewed 
without ever being implemented. Sometimes it was a matter of laws 
gradually falling into abeyance, then suddenly being reactivated; 
sometimes of silent consent on the part of the authorities, neglect, or 
quite simply the actual impossibility of imposing the law and appre¬ 
hending offenders. The least-favoured strata of the population did 
not have, in principle, any privileges: but they benefited, within the 
margins of what was imposed on them by law and custom, from a 
space of tolerance, gained by force or obstinacy; and this space was 
for them so indispensable a condition of existence that they were 
often ready to rise up to defend it; the attempts that were made 
periodically to reduce it, by reviving old laws or by improving the 
methods of apprehending, provoked popular disturbances, just as

attempts to reduce certain privileges disturbed the nobility, the 
clergy and the bourgeoisie. 

This necessary illegality, of which eyery social stratum bore 
within itself specific forms, was caught up in a series of paradoxes. 
In its lower regions, it was identified with criminality, from which 
it was difficult to distinguish it juridically, if not morally: from fiscal 
illegality to customs illegality, to smuggling, to looting, to the
