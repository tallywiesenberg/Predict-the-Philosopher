armed struggle against the government’s taxation agents, then 
against the soldiers themselves and, finally, to rebellion, there was 
a continuity, in which it was difficult to mark the frontiers; or, again, 
vagabondage (severely punished according to the terms of ordin¬ 
ances that were never implemented) with the pillage, aggravated 
theft, even murder that went with it, provided a welcome environ¬ 
ment to the unemployed, to workers who had left their employers 
in irregular circumstances, to domestic servants who had some 
reason to flee their masters, to ill-treated apprentices, to deserting 
soldiers, to all those who wished to escape the press-gang. So 
criminality merged into a wider illegality, to which the lower strata 
were attached as to conditions of existence; and, conversely, this 
illegality was a perpetual factor in the increase of crime. Hence an 
ambiguity in popular attitudes: on the one hand, the criminal - 
especially when he happened to be a smuggler or a peasant who had 
fled from the exactions of a master - benefited from a spontaneous 
wave of sympathy: his acts of violence were seen as descending 
directly from old struggles. On the other hand, a man who, under 
cover of an illegality accepted by the population, committed crimes 
at the expense of this population, the vagrant beggar, for example, 
who robbed and murdered, easily became the object of a special hate: 
he had redirected upon the least favoured illegality that was integral 
to their conditions of existence. Thus there grew up around crimes 
a network of glorification and blame; effective help and fear alter¬ 
nated with regard to this shifting population, which one knew was 
very near, but from which one felt that crime could emerge. 
Popular illegality enveloped a whole nucleus of criminality that was 
both its extreme form and its internal danger. 

Between this illegality of the depths and those of the other social 
castes, there was neither an exact convergence nor a profound opposi¬ 
tion. Generally speaking, the different illegalities proper to each

group maintained relations with one another that involved not only 
rivalry, competition and conflicts of interest, but also mutual help 
and complicity: the peasants’ refusal to pay certain state or eccle¬ 
siastical rents was not necessarily disapproved of by the landowners; 
the non-application by artisans of manufacturing regulations was 
often encouraged by the new entrepreneurs; smuggling - the story 
of Mandrin, welcomed by the entire population, received in castles 
and protected by parUmentaires proves this - was very widely
