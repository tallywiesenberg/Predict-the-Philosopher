supported. At most, one had seen in the seventeenth century the 
different fiscal refusals coalesce in serious revolts among widely 
separated social strata. In short, the reciprocal interplay of illegali¬ 
ties formed part of the political and economic life of society. Or 
rather, a number of transformations (the abe5^nce into which 
Colbert’s regulations had fallen, for example, the non-observance 
of customs barriers within the kingdom, the breakdown of guild 
practices) had operated in the breach that was being widened every 
day by popular illegality; the bourgeoisie had needed these trans¬ 
formations; and economic growth was due, in part, to them. 
Tolerance then became encouragement. 

In the second half of the eighteenth cenmry, the process tended to 
be reversed. First, with the general increase in wealth, but also with 
the sudden demographic expansion, the principal target of popular 
illegality tended to be not so much rights, as goods: pilfering 
and theft tended to replace smuggling and the armed struggle 
against the tax agents. And, in this respect, the peasants, farmers 
and artisans were often its principal victims. Le Trosne was no 
doubt exaggerating a real tendency when he described the peasants’ 
suffering under the exactions of vagabonds, even more than they 
had suffered under feudal demands: thieves now attacked them like 
a cloud of maleficent insects, devouring crops and depleting the 
granaries (Le Trosne, 1764, 4). It might be said that gradually in 
the eighteenth century a crisis of popular illegality had occurred; 
and neither the movements at the beginning of the Revolution 
(around the refusal of seigniorial rights), nor those later movements, 
in which the struggle against property rights, political and religious 
protests and the refusal of conscription came together, recombined 
illegality in its old, welcoming form. Furthermore, although a large 
part of the bourgeoisie had accepted, without too much trouble.

the illegality of rights, it found it difficult to support illegality when 
it was a question of its own property rights. Nothing could be more 
typical of this than the problem of peasant delinquency at the end 
of the eighteenth century and especially after the Revolution 
(Berce, i6i). The transition to an intensive agriculture exercised, 
over the rights to use common lands, over various tolerated prac¬ 
tices, over small accepted illegalities, a more and more restrictive 
pressure. Furthermore, as it was acquired in part by the bourgeoisie, 
now free of the feudal burdens that once weighed upon it, landed
