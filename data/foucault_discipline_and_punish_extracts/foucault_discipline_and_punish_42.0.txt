docks, then passed on to the receivers - wholesale receivers, 
specializing in certain kinds of commodity, and retail receivers 
whose stalls offered a ‘wretched display of old iron, rags and worn 
clothes, whereas at the back of the shop were hidden naval munitions 
of great value, copper bolts and nails, pieces of cast iron and precious 
metals, produce from the West Indies, furniture and all kinds of 
goods bought from the labourers’ — then on to dealers and pedlars 
who distributed the stolen goods far into the countryside (Colqu¬ 
houn, 1797; in chapters VII, VIII and XV, he gives a very detailed 
account of this process); third, counterfeiting (it seems that there 
were between forty and fifty mints producing counterfeit money 
throughout England, in permanent operation). But what facilitated 
the work of this huge undertaking, involving both depredation and 
competition, was a whole set of tolerances: some amounted almost 
to acquired right (the right, for example, to collect bits of iron or 
rope around ships or to resell the sugar sweepings); others were of 
the nature of a moral acceptance; the pilferers themselves regarded 
their work as a kind of smuggling, which ‘they did not regard as a 
serious offence’. 

It proved necessary, therefore, to control these illicit practices 
and introduce new legislation to cover them. The offences had to be 
properly defined and more surely punished; out of this mass of 
irregularities, sometimes tolerated and sometimes punished with a 
severity out of all proportion to the offence, one had to determine 
what was an intolerable offence, and the offenders had to be appre¬ 
hended and punished. With the new forms of capital accumulation, 
new relations of production and the new legal status of property, 
all the popular practices that belonged, either in a silent, everyday.

tolerated form, or in a violent form, to the illegality of rights were 
reduced by force to an illegality of property. In that movement 
which transformed a society of juridico-political levies into a society 
of the appropriation of the means and products of labour, theft 
tended to become the first of the great loopholes in legality. Or, to 
put it another way, the economy of illegalities was restructured 
with the development of capitalist society. The illegality of property 
was separated from the illegality of rights. This distinction repre¬ 
sents a class opposition because, on the one hand, the illegality 
that was to be most accessible to the lower classes was that of 
property - the violent transfer of ownership - and because, on the
