midst of society without being members of it’, who wage ‘a veritable 
war on all citizens’, and who are in the midst of us ‘in that state that 
one supposes existed before the establishment of civil society’. 
Against them, he demanded the most severe penalties (character¬ 
istically, he expressed surprise that one should be more indulgent 
towards them than to smugglers); he wanted the police to be rein¬ 
forced, the mounted constabulary to hunt them down with the help 
of the population that suffered from their depredations; he demanded 
that these useless and dangerous people should be ‘acquired by the 
state and that they should belong to it as slaves to their masters’; 
and if necessary one should organize collective round-ups in the 
woods to drive them out, and anyone making a capture should be 
paid: ‘A reward of ten pounds is given for anyone who kills a wolf. 
A vagabond is infinitely more dangerous for society’ (Le Trosne, 
1764, 8, 50, 54, 61-2). In 1777 in f^ues sur la justice criminelle, the 
same Le Trosne demanded that the prerogatives of the Crown be 
reduced, that the accused be regarded as innocent until proved 
guilty, that the judge be a just arbiter between them and society, 
that laws be ‘fixed, constant, determined in the most precise way’, 
so that subjects know ‘to what they are exposed’ and that magis¬ 
trates be nothing more than the ‘organ of the law’ (Le Trosne, 1777, 
31, 37, 103-6). For Le Trosne, as for so many others at that time, 
the struggle for the delimitation of the power to punish was articu¬ 
lated directly on the need to subject popular illegality to a stricter 
and more constant control. It is understandable that the criticism

Generalized punishment 


of the public execution should have assumed such importance in 
penal reform: for it was the form in which, in the most visible way, 
the unlimited power of the sovereign and the ever-active illegality 
of the people came together. Humanity in the sentences was the 
rule given to a system of punishment that must fix their limits on 
both. The ‘man’ that must be respected in the sentence was the 
juridical and moral form given to this double delimitation. 

But, although it is true that reform, as a penal theory and as a 
strategy of the power to punish, took shape at the point of coinci¬ 
dence of these two objectives, its stability in the future was due to 
the fact that, for a long time, priority was given to the second. It was 
because the pressure on popular illegalities had become, at the period 
of the Revolution, then under the Empire, and finally throughout 
the nineteenth century, an essential imperative, that reform was able
