enemy. Indeed, he is worse than an enemy, for it is from within 
society that he delivers his blows - he is nothing less than a traitor, 
a ‘monster’. How could society not have an absolute right over him.^ 
How could it not demand, quite simply, his elimination.^ And, 
although it is true that the principle of punishment must be sub¬ 
scribed to in the pact, must not each citizen, logically, accept the 
extreme penalty for those of them who attack them as a body. 
‘Every malefactor, by attacking the social rights, becomes, by his 
crimes, a rebel and a traitor to his country; by violating its laws he 
ceases to be a member of it; he even makes war upon it. In such a 
case the preservation of the state is inconsistent with his own, and 
one or the other must perish; in putting the guilty to death we slay 
not so much the citizen as the enemy.’® The right to punish has been 
shifted from the vengeance of the sovereign to the defence of 
society. But it now finds itself recombined with elements so strong 
that it becomes almost more to be feared. The malefactor has been 
saved from a threat that is by its very nature excessive, but he is 
exposed to a penalty that seems to be without bounds. It is a return 
to a terrible ‘super-power’. It brings with it the need to establish a 
principle of moderation for the power of punishment. 

‘Who does not shudder with horror when reading in history of so 
many terrible and useless torments, invented and coldly applied by 
monsters who took upon themselves the name of sage.®’ (Beccaria,

87). Or again: ‘The laws summon me to the greatest punishment 
of crimes. I go with all the fury that it has inspired in me. But 
what is this.^ They even go beyond it. .. God, who has imprinted 
in our hearts an aversion to pain for ourselves and for our fellow 
men, are they then those same beings, whom thou hast created so 
weak and so sensible, who have invented such barbarous, such 
refined torturesi*’ (Lacretelle, 129). The principle of moderation in 
punishment, even when it is a question of punishing the enemy of 
the social body, is articulated first as a discourse of the heart. Or 
rather, it leaps forth like a cry from the body, which is revolted at 
the sight or at the imagination of too much cruelty. The formulation 
of the principle that penality must remain ‘humane’ is expressed by 
the reformers in the first person. It is as if the sensibility of the 
speaker were being expressed direcdy; as if the body of the philoso¬ 
pher or theoretician had come, between executioner and victim, to 
affirm his own law and to impose it finally on the entire economy 
of punishment. Does this lyricism express an inability to find a
