that the machinery of justice must be duplicated by an organ of 
surveillance that would work side by side with it, and which would 
make it possible either to prevent crimes, or, if committed, to arrest 
their authors; police and justice must work together as two comple¬ 
mentary actions of the same process - the police assuring ‘the action 
of society on each individual’, justice ‘the rights of individuals 
against society’ (Duport, Archives parlementaires, XXI, 45). Thus 
every crime will come to the light of day and be punished in all 
certainty. But it is also necessary that the legal procedures should 
not remain secret, that the reasons why a defendant is condemned or 
acquitted should be known to all, and each individual must be able 
to recognize the reasons for a penalty: ‘Let the magistrate speak his 
opinion aloud, let him be obliged to read in his judgement the text 
of the law that condemns the defendant. . . Let the procedures that 
are buried mysteriously in the obscurity of the records office be 
opened to all citizens who are concerned at the fate of the con¬ 
demned’ (Mably, 348). 

The rule of common truth. Beneath this ordinary-seeming principle 
is hidden an important transformation. The old system of legal

proofs, the use of torture, the extraction of confessions, the use of 
the public execution, the body and spectacle for the reproduction 
of truth had long isolated penal practice from the common forms of 
demonstration: semi-proofs produced semi-truths and semi-guilty 
persons, words extracted by pain had greater authenticity, presump¬ 
tion involved a degree of punishment. The heterogeneity of this 
system with the ordinary system of proof really constituted a scandal 
only when the power to punish needed, for its own economy, a 
climate of irrefutable certainty. How can one link absolutely in the 
minds of men the idea of crime and the idea of punishment, if the 
reality of the punishment does not follow, in all cases, the reality 
of the offence.^ To establish the offence, in all evidence, and accord¬ 
ing to* the means valid for all, becomes a task of first importance. 
The verification of the crime must obey the general criteria for all 
truth. In the arguments it employs, in the proofs it provides, legal 
judgement must be homogeneous with judgement in general. There 
is, therefore, an abandonment of legal proof, a rejection of torture, 
the need for a complete demonstration of the truth, an effacement 
of all correlation between degrees of suspicion and degrees of 
punishment. Like a mathematical truth, the truth of the crime will
