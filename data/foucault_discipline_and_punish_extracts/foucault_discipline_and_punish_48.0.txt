Linguet, 8.) But the same imperative need for a total coincidence 
between all possible offences and the effects-signs of punishment 
forces one to go further. The idea of the same punishment does not 
have the same effect on everyone: the rich do not fear fines nor the 
notorious infamy. The injury caused by an offence and its value as 
example differ according to the status of the offender; a crime 
committed by a noble is more injurious to society than one com¬ 
mitted by a man of the people (Lacretelle, 144). Lastly, since punish¬ 
ment must prevent a repetition of the offence, it must take into 
account the profound nature of the criminal himself, the presumable 
degree of his wickedness, the intrinsic quality of his will; ‘Of two 
men who have committed the same theft, how much less guilty is he 
who scarcely had the necessities of life than he who overflowed with 
excess.^ Of two perjurers, how much more criminal is he on whom 
one has striven from his childhood to impress feelings of honour 
than he who, abandoned to nature, never received the benefit of 
education’ (Marat, 34). One sees the emergence at the same time of

Generalized punishment 


the need for a parallel classification of crimes and punishments, the 
need for an individualization of sentences, in accordance with the 
particular characteristics of each criminal. This individualization was 
to weigh very heavily throughout the history of modern penal law; 
it is rooted precisely here: in terms of the theory of law and accord¬ 
ing to the requirements of everyday practice, it is no doubt in 
radical opposition to the principle of codification; but from the 
standpoint of the economy of the power to punish, and of the 
techniques by which one wishes to circulate throughout the social 
body precisely calibrated signs of punishment, with neither excesses 
nor loopholes, with neither a useless ‘expenditure’ of power nor with 
timidity, it becomes evident that the codification of the offences- 
punishments system and the modulation of the criminal-punish¬ 
ment dyad go side by side, each requiring the other. Individualiza¬ 
tion appears as the ultimate aim of a precisely adapted code. 

But this individualization is very different in its nature from the 
modulations of punishment to be found in the old jurisprudence. 
The old system - and on this point it followed Christian peniten¬ 
tiary practice - used two series of variables to adjust the punishment, 
those of‘circumstances’ and those of‘intention’; elements, that is to 
say, that made it possible to qualify the act itself. The modulation 
of the penalty belonged to ‘casuistry’ in the broad sense. (On the
