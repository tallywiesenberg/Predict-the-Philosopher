repetition of the crime, what one was aiming at was not the author 
of an act defined by law, but the delinquent subject himself, a certain 
will that manifested his intrinsically criminal character. Gradually, 
as criminality, rather than crime, became the object of penal inter¬ 
vention, the opposition between first oflFender and recidivist tended 
to become more important. And on the basis of this opposition, 
reinforcing it on several points, one sees at the same period the 
formation of the notion of the 'crime passioneV - an involuntary, 
unpremeditated crime, bound up with extraordinary circumstances, 
which, while not offering the same excuse as madness, nevertheless 
prevented it from being regarded as an ordinary crime. As early as 
1791, Le Peletier remarked that the subtle gradation of penalties 
that he had presented to the Constituent Assembly might dissuade 
from crime ‘the evil-doer who plans a wicked action in cold blood’, 
and who may be restrained by thoughts of the penalty; but, on the

other hand, it was powerless against crimes due to ‘violent passions 
that have no regard to consequences’; this, however, was unimport¬ 
ant, since such crimes revealed in their authors ‘no reasoned wicked¬ 
ness.’** 

Beneath the humanization of the penalties, what one finds are all 
those rules that authorize, or rather demand, ‘leniency’, as a calcu¬ 
lated economy of the power to punish. But they also provoke a 
shift in the point of application of this power: it is no longer the 
body, with the ritual play of excessive pains, spectacular brandings 
in the ritual of the public execution; it is the mind or rather a play 
of representations and signs circulating discreetly but necessarily 
and evidently in the minds of all. It is no longer the body, but the 
soul, said Mably. And we see very clearly what he meant by this 
term; the correlative of a technique of power. Old ‘anatomies’ of 
punishment are abandoned. But have we really entered the age of 
non-corporal punishment.^ 

At the point of departure, then, one may place the political 
project of rooting out illegalities, generalizing the punitive function 
and delimiting, in order to control it, the power to punish. From 
this there emerge two lines of objectification of crime and of the 
criminal. On the one hand, the criminal designated as the enemy of 
all, whom it is in the interest of all to track down, falls outside the 
pact, disqualifies himself as a citizen and emerges, bearing within
