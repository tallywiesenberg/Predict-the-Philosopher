The spectacle of the scaffold 


may be combined to form a semi-proof; but, however many there 
may be of them, they can never, of themselves, constitute a complete 
proof.We have, then, a penal arithmetic that is meticulous on many 
points, but which still leaves a margin for a good deal of argument; in 
order for a capital sentence to be passed, is a single full proof enough 
or must it be accompanied by other slighter clues.^ Are two approxi¬ 
mate proofs always equivalent to a full proof Should not three be 
required or two plus distant clues.^ Are there elements that may be 
regarded as clues only for certain crimes, in certain circumstances 
and in relation to certain persons (thus evidence is disregarded if it 
comes from a vagabond; it is reinforced, on the contrary, if it is 
provided by ‘a considerable person’ or by a master in the case of a 
domestic offence).It is an arithmetic modulated by casuistry, whose 
function is to define how a legal proof is to be constructed.On the 
one hand, this system of ‘legal proofs’ makes truth in the penal 
domain the result of a complex art; it obeys rules known only to 
specialists, and, consequently, it reinforces the principle of secrecy.‘It is not enough that the judge should have the conviction that any 
reasonable man may have.
