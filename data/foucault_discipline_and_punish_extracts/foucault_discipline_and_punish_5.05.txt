..Nothing is more incorrect than this 
way of judging, which, in truth, is no other than a more or less well- 
founded opinion.’ But, on the other hand, it is a severe constraint 
for the magistrate; in the absence of this regularity, ‘every sentence 
would be reckless, and in a sense it may be said that it is unjust even 
when, in truth, the accused is guilty’ (Poullain du Parc, 112-13 ~ see 
also Esmein, 260-83 Mittermaier, 15-19).The day will come 
when the singularity of this judicial truth will appear scandalous; 
as if the law did not have to obey the rules of common truth.‘What 
would be said of a semi-proof in the sciences capable of demonstra¬ 
tion.^ What would a geometrical or algebraic semi-proof amount 
to.^’ (Seigneux de Correvon, 63).
