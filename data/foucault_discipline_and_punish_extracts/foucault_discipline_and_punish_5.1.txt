But it should not be forgotten 
that these formal constraints on legal proof were a mode of regula¬ 
tion internal to absolute power and exclusive of knowledge.Written, secret, subjected, in order to construct its proofs, to 
rigorous rules, the penal investigation was a machine that might 
produce the truth in the absence of the accused.And by this very 
fact, though the law strictly speaking did not require it, this pro¬ 
cedure was to tend necessarily to the confession.And for two 
reasons; first, because the confession constituted so strong a proof

that there was scarcely any need to add others, or to enter the diffi¬ 
cult and dubious combinatory of clues; the confession, provided it 
was obtained in the correct manner, almost discharged the prosecu¬ 
tion of the obligation to provide further evidence (in any case, the 
most difficult evidence).Secondly, the only way that this procedure 
might use all its unequivocal authority, and become a real victory 
over the accused, the only way in which the truth might exert all its 
power, was for the criminal to accept responsibility for his own 
crime and himself sign what had been skilfully and obscurely 
constructed by the preliminary investigation.
