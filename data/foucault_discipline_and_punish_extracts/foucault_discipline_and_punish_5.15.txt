‘It is not enough’, as 
Ayrault, who did not care for these secret procedures, remarked, 
‘that wrong-doers be justly punished.They must if possible judge 
and condemn themselves’ (Ayrault, i. I, chapter 14).Within the 
crime reconstituted by writing, the criminal who confessed came to 
play the role of living truth.The confession, an act of the criminal, 
responsible and speaking subject, was the complement to the written, 
secret preliminary investigation.Hence the importance that all this 
procedure of an inquisitorial tyjje accorded to the confession.
