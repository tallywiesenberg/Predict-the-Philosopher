Hence, too, the ambiguities of its role.On the one hand, an 
attempt was made to introduce it into the general arithmetic of 
evidence; it was stressed that it was no more than one proof among 
many.It was not the evidentia rev, nor was it the strongest of the 
proofs, it was not in itself enough to bring conviction, it had to be 
accompanied by additional, circumstantial evidence; for it is a well- 
known fact that the accused sometimes declare themselves to be 
guilty of crimes that they have not committed; the examining magis¬ 
trate had therefore to carry out additional investigations if he 
possessed no more than the confession of the accused.But, on the 
other hand, the confession had priority over any other kind of 
evidence.To a certain extent, it transcended all other evidence; an 
element in the calculation of the truth, it was also the act by which 
the accused accepted the charge and recognized its truth; it trans¬ 
formed an investigation carried out without him into a voluntary 
affirmation.
