* Through the confession, the accused committed himself to the 
procedure; he signed the truth of the preliminary investigation.This double ambiguity of the confession (an element of proof and 
the counterpart of preliminary investigation; the effect of constraint 
and a semi-voluntary transaction) explains the two great means used 
by classical criminal law to obtain it: the oath that the accused was 
asked to make before his interrogatory (and therefore under threat 
of perjury before both human and divine justice; and, at the same 
time, a ritual act of commitment); judicial torture (physical violence 
to obtain truth, which, in any case, had then to be repeated before 
the judges, as a ‘spontaneous’ confession, if it were to constitute 
proof).At the end of the eighteenth century, torture was to be 
denounced as a survival of the barbarities of another age: the mark 
of a savagery that was denounced as ‘Gothic’.It is true that the 
practice of torture is of ancient origin: it goes back at least as far 
as the Inquisition, of course, and probably to the torture of slaves.But it did not figure in classical law as a survival or defect.
