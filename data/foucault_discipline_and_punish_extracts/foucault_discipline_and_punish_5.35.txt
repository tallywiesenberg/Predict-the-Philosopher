It occu¬ 
pied a strict place in a complex penal mechanism, in which the 
procedure of an inquisitorial type was reinforced with elements of 
the accusatory system; in which the written demonstration required 
an oral correlative; in which the techniques of proof administered 
by the magistrates were mingled with the methods of the ordeal to 
which the accused was challenged; in which he was called upon — if 
necessary by the most violent persuasion - to play the role of 
voluntary partner in the procedure; in which it was a question, in 
short, of producing truth by a mechanism consisting of two ele¬ 
ments - that of the investigation carried out in secret by the judicial 
authority and that of the act ritually performed by the accused.The

body of the accused, the speaking and, if necessary, suffering body, 
assured the interlocking of these two mechanisms; that is why, 
until the classical system of punishment was re-examined from top 
to bottom, there were so few r^ical criticisms of torture (the most 
famous being Nicolas’s Si la tohure est im moyen a verifier les crimes 
of 1682).Much more frequent were simple recommendations of 
prudence: ‘Judicial torture is a dangerous means of arriving at 
knowledge of the truth; that is why judges must not resort to it with¬ 
out due consideration.Nothing is more equivocal.There are guilty 
men who have enough firmness to hide a true crime... and innocent 
victims who are made to confess crimes of which they were not 
guilty’ (Ferriere, 612).
