On this basis one may see the functioning of judicial torture, or 
interrogation under torture, as a torture of the truth.To begin with, 
judicial torture was not a way of obtaining the truth at all costs; it 
was not the unrestrained torture of modern interrogations; it was 
certainly cruel, but it was not savage.It was a regulated practice, 
obeying a well-defined procedure; the various stages, their duration, 
the instruments used, the length of ropes and the heaviness of the 
weights used, the number of interventions made by the interrogating 
magistrate, all this was, according to the different local practices, 
carefully codified (In 1729, Aguesseau ordered an investigation into 
the means and rules of torture used in France.For a summary of the 
findings, cf.Joly de Fleury, 322-8.)
