Torture was a strict judicial 
game.And, as such, it was linked to the old tests or trials - ordeals, 
judicial duels, judgements of God - that were practised in accusatory 
procedures long before the techniques of the Inquisition.Something 
of the joust survived, between the judge who ordered the judicial 
torture and the suspect who was tortured; the ‘patient’ - this is the 
term used to designate the victim - was subjected to a series of trials, 
graduated in severity, in which he succeeded if he ‘held out’, or 
failed if he confessed.(The first degree of torture was the sight of 
the instruments.In the case of children or of persons over the age 
of seventy, one did not go beyond this stage.)
