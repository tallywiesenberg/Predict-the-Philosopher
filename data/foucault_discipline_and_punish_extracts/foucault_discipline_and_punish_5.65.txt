How can one treat as a punishment what ought to be a method of 
demonstration.^ The reason is to be found in the way in which 
criminal justice, in the classical period, operated the production of 
truth.The different pieces of evidence did not constitute so many 
neutral elements, until such time as they could be gathered together 
into a single body of evidence that would bring the final certainty 
of guilt.Each piece of evidence aroused a particular degree of 
abomination.Guilt did not begin when all the evidence was gathered 
together; piece by piece, it was constituted by each of the elements 
that made it possible to recognize a guilty person.Thus a semiÂ¬ 
proof did not leave the suspect innocent until such time as it was 
completed; it made him semi-guilty; slight evidence of a serious 
crime marked someone as slightly criminal.
