In short, penal demon¬ 
stration did not obey a dualistic system: true or false; but a 
principle of continuous gradation; a degree reached in the demon¬ 
stration already formed a degree of guilt and consequently involved 
a degree of punishment.The suspect, as such, always deserved a 
certain punishment; one could not be the object of suspicion and be 
completely innocent.Suspicion implied an element of demonstration 
as regards the judge, the mark of a certain degree of guilt as regards 
the suspect and a limited form of penalty as regards punishment.A 
suspect, who remained a suspect, was not for all that declared inno¬ 
cent, but was partially punished.When one reached a certain degree 
of presumption, one could then legitimately bring into play a 
practice that had a dual role; to begin the punishment in pursuance 
of the information already collected and to make use of this first 
stage of punishment in order to extort the truth that was still miss¬ 
ing.
