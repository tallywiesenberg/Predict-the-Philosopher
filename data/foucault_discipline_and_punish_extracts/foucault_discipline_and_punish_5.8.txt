His body, displayed, exhibited in procession, 
tortured, served as the public support of a procedure that had 
hitherto remained in the shade; in him, on him, the sentence had to 
be legible for all.This immediate, striking manifestation of the 
truth in the public implementation of penalties assumed, in the 
eighteenth century, several aspects.1.It made the guilty man the herald of his own condemnation.He was given the task, in a sense, of proclaiming it and thus attesting 
to the truth of what he had been charged with: the procession 
through the streets, the placard attached to his back, chest or head 
as a reminder of the sentence; the halts at various crossroads, the 
reading of the sentence, the amende honorable performed at the doors 
of churches, in which the condemned man solemnly acknowledged 
his crime: ‘Barefoot, wearing a shirt, carrying a torch, kneeling, to 
say and to declare that wickedly, horribly, treacherously, he has 
committed the most detestable crime, etc.’; exhibition at a stake 
where his deeds and the sentence were read out; yet another reading 
of the sentence at the foot of the scaffold; whether he was to go 
simply to the pillory or to the stake and the wheel, the condemned 
man published his crime and the justice that had been meted out to 
him by bearing them physically on his body.
