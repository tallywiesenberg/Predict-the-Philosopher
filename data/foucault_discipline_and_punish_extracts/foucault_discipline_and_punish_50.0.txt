representations as a principle in a politics of bodies that was much 
more effective than the ritual anatomy of torture and execution. The 
thought of the Ideologues was not only a theory of the individual 
and society; it developed as a technology of subtle, effective, 
economic powers, in opposition to the sumptuous expenditure of 
the power of the sovereign. Let us hear once more what Servan has 
to say; the ideas of crime and punishment must be strongly linked 
and ‘follow one another without interruption. . . When you have 
thus formed the chain of ideas in the heads of your citizens, you will 
then be able to pride yourselves on guiding them and being their 
masters. A stupid despot may constrain his slaves with iron chains; 
but a true politician binds them even more strongly by the chain of

their own ideas; it is at the stable point of reason that he secures the 
end of the chain; this link is all the stronger in that we do not know 
of what it is made and we believe it to be our own work; despair 
and time eat away the bonds of iron and steel, but they are power¬ 
less against the habitual union of ideas, they can only tighten it still 
more; and on the soft fibres of the brain is founded the unshakable 
base of the soundest of Empires’ (Servan, 35). 

It is this semio-technique of punishments, this ‘ideological 
power’ which, partly at least, will remain in suspense and will be 
superseded by a new political anatomy, in which the body, once 
again, but in a new form, will be the principal character. And this 
new political anatomy will permit the intersection of the two 
divergent lines of objectification that are to be seen emerging in the 
eighteenth century: that which rejects the criminal ‘from the other 
side’ - from the side of a nature against nature; and that which seeks 
to control delinquency by a calculated economy of punishments. A 
glance at the new art of punishing clearly reveals the supersession 
of the punitive semio-technique by a new politics of the body.
