triumph of justice, it is also the triumph of liberty, for then penalties 
no longer proceed from the will of the legislator, but from the nature 
of things; one no longer sees man committing violence on man’ 
(Marat, 33). In analogical punishment, the power that punishes is 
hidden. 

The reformers proposed a whole panoply of penalties that were 
natural by institution and which represented in their form the 
content of the crime. Take Vermeil, for example: those who abuse 
public liberty will be deprived of their own; those who abuse the 
benefits of law and the privileges of public office will be deprived of 
their civil rights; speculation and usury will be punished by fines; 
theft will be punished by confiscation; ‘vainglory’ by humiliation; 
murder by death; fire-raising by the stake. In the case of the poi¬ 
soner, ‘the executioner will present him with a goblet the contents 
of which will be thrown into his face; thus he will be made to feel 
the horror of his crime by being offered an image of it; he will then 
be thrown into a cauldron of boiling water’ (Vermeil, 68-145; cf. 
also Dufriche de Valaze, 349) Mere day-dreaming.^ Perhaps. But 
the principle of a symbolic communication was clearly formulated 
by Le Peletier, when in 1791 he presented the new criminal legisla¬ 
tion: ‘Exact relations are required between the nature of the offence 
and the nature of the punishment’; he who has used violence in his 
crime must be subjected to physical pain; he who has been lazy 
must be sentenced to hard labour; he who has acted despicably will 
be subjected to infamy (Le Peletier, 321-2). 

Despite cruelties that are strongly reminiscent of the tortures of 
the Ancien Regime, a quite different mechanism is at work in these 
analogical penalties. Horror is not opposed to horror in a joust of

power; it is no longer the symmetry of vengeance, but the trans¬ 
parency of the sign to that which it signifies; what is required is to 
establish, in the theatre of punishments, a relation that is immedi¬ 
ately intelligible to the senses and on which a simple .calculation may 
be based: a sort of reasonable aesthetic of punishment. ‘It is not only 
in the fine arts that one must follow nature faithfully; political 
institutions, at least those that display wisdom and permanence, are 
founded on nature’ (Beccaria, 114). The punishment must proceed 
from the crime; the law must appear to be a necessity of things, and 
power must act while concealing itself beneath the gentle force of 
nature.
