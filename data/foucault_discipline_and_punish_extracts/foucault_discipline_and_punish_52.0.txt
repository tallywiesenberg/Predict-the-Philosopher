Reanimate the useful, virtuous interest that has been so weakened 
by the crime. The feeling of respect for property - for wealth, but 
also for honour, liberty, life - this the criminal loses when he robs, 
calumniates, abducts or kills. So he must be taught this feeling 
once again. And one will begin by teaching it to him for his own 
benefit; one will show him what it is to lose the freedom to dispose 
as one wishes of one’s own wealth, honour, time and body, so that 
he may respect it in others (Pastoret, I, 49). The penalty that forms 
stable and easily legible signs must also recompose the economy of 
interests and the dynamics of passions. 

3. Consequently, one must use a temporal modulation. The 
penalty transforms, modifies, establishes signs, arranges obstacles. 
What use would it be if it had to be permanent.^ A penalty that had 
no end would be contradictory; all the constraints that it imposes on 
the convict and of which, having become virtuous once more, he 
would never be able to take advantage, would be little better than 
torture; and the effort made to reform him would be so much 
trouble and expense lost by society. If incorrigibles there be, one 
must be determined to eliminate them. But, for all the others, 
punishment can function only if it comes to an end. This analysis 
was accepted by the Constituent Assembly: the code of 1791 lays 
down the death penalty for traitors and murderers; all other penalties 
must have an end (the maximum is twenty years). 

But above all the role of duration must be integrated into the 
economy of the penalty. In its very violence, the public execution 
tended to have the following result: the more serious the crime, the 
shorter the punishment. Duration certainly intervened in the old

system of penalties; days at the pillory, years of banishment, hours 
spent dying on the wheel. But it was a time of ordeal, not of con¬ 
certed transformation. Duration must now facilitate the proper 
action of the punishment: ‘A prolonged succession of painful priva¬ 
tions, sparing mankind the horror of torture, has much more effect 
on the guilty party than a passing moment of pain... It constantly 
renews in the eyes of the people that witness it the memory of 
vengeful laws and revives in all the moments of a salutary terror.’* 
Time, operator of punishment. 

But the delicate mechanism of the passions must not be con¬
