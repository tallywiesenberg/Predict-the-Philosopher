that would be more or less extended according to the nature of his 
crime’; France has all too many impracticable roads that impede 
trade; thieves who also obstruct the free circulation of goods could 
be put to rebuilding the highways. Far more telling than death 
would be ‘the example of a man who is ever before one’s eyes, whom 
one has deprived of liberty and who is forced to spend the rest of 
his days repairing the loss that he has caused society’ (Boucher 
d’Argis, 1781, 139). 

In the old system, the body of the condemned man became the 
king’s property, on which the sovereign left his mark and brought 
down the effects of his power. Now he will be rather the property 
of society, the object of a collective and useful appropriation. This 
explains why the reformers almost always proposed public works 
as one of the best possible penalties; in this, they were supported by 
the Cahiers de doleancesi ‘Let those condemned to penalties short of 
death be put to the public works of the country for a time propor¬ 
tionate to their crime.’* Public works meant two things: the collec¬ 
tive interest in the punishment of the condemend man and the 
visible, verifiable character of the punishment. Thus the convict 
pays twice; by the labour he provides and by the signs that he 
produces. At the heart of society, on the public squares or highways, 
the convict is a focus of profit and signification. Visibly, he is 
serving everyone; but, at the same time, he lets slip into the minds 
of all the crime-punishment sign: a secondary, purely moral, but 
much more real utility.

torture, the example was based on terror: physical fear, collective 
horror, images that must be engraved on the memories of the specta¬ 
tors, like the brand on the cheek or shoulder of the condemned man. 
The example is now based on the lesson, the discourse, the decipher¬ 
able sign, the representation of public morality. It is no longer the 
terrifying restoration of sovereignty that will sustain the ceremony 
of punishment, but the reactivation of the code, the collective rein¬ 
forcements of the link between the idea of crime and the idea of 
punishment. In the penalty, rather than seeing the presence of the 
sovereign, one will read the laws themselves. The laws associated 
a particular crime with a particular punishment. As soon as the 
crime is committed, the punishment will follow at once, enacting the
