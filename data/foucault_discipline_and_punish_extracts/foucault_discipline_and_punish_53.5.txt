discourse of the law and showing that the code, which links ideas, 
also links realities. The junction, immediate in the text, must be 
immediate in acts. ‘Consider those first movements in which the 
news of some horrible act spreads through our towns and country¬ 
side; the citizens are like men who see lightning falling about them; 
everyone is moved by indignation and horror. . . That is the 
moment to punish the crime: do not let it slip by; hasten to prove 
it and judge it. Set up scaffolds, stakes, drag out the guilty man to 
the public squares, summon the people with great cries; you will 
then hear them applaud the proclamation of your judgements, as the 
proclamation of peace and liberty; you will see them run to these 
terrible spectacles as to the triumph of the laws’ (Servan, 35-6). 
Public punishment is the ceremony of immediate recoding. 

The law is re-formed: it takes up its place on the side of the crime 
that violated it. The criminal, on the other hand, is detached from 
society, he leaves it. But not in those ambiguous festivals of the 
Ancien Regime in which the people inevitably took part, either in 
the crime or in the execution, but in a ceremony of mourning. The 
society that has rediscovered its laws has lost the citizen who vio¬ 
lated them. Public punishment must manifest this double affliction: 
that a citizen should have been capable of ignoring the law and that 
one should have been obliged to separate oneself from a citizen. 
‘Associate the scaffold with the most lugubrious and most moving 
ceremonies; let this terrible day be a day of mourning for the nation; 
let the general sorrow be painted everywhere in bold letters... Let 
the magistrate, wearing black, funereal crepe, announce the crime

The gentle way in punishment 


and the sad necessity of a legal vengeance to the people. Let the 
different scenes of this tragedy strike all the senses, stir all gentle, 
honest affections’ (Dufau, 688). 

The meaning of this mourning must be clear to all; each element 
of its ritual must speak, repeat the crime, recall the law, show the 
need for punishment and justify its degree. Posters, placards, signs, 
symbols must be distributed, so that everyone may learn their 
significations. The publicity of punishment must not have the 
physical effect of terror; it must open up a book to be read. Le 
Peletier suggested that, once a month, the people should be allowed 
to visit convicts, ‘in their mournful cells: they will read, written in 
bold letters above the door, the name of the convict, his crime and
