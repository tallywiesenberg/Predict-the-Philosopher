his sentence" (Le Peletier, 329-30). And in the simple, military style 
of the imperial ceremonies, Bexon was to imagine some years later a 
whole tableau of penal heraldry: ‘The prisoner condemned to death 
will be taken to the scaffold in a cart “hung or painted in black and 
red”; if he is a traitor, he will wear a red coat on which will be 
inscribed, in front and behind, the word “traitor”; if he is a parri¬ 
cide, his head will be covered with a black veil and on his shirt will 
be embroidered daggers or whatever instruments of death he used; 
if he is a poisoner, his red shirt will be decorated with snakes and 
other venomous animals’ (Bexon, 24-3 - this project was presented 
to the King of Bavaria). 

This legible lesson, this ritual recoding, must be repeated as often 
as possible; the punishments must be a school rather than a festival; 
an ever-open book rather than a ceremony. The duration that makes 
the punishment effective for the guilty is also useful for the specta¬ 
tors. They must be able to consult at each moment the permanent 
lexicon of crime and punishment. A secret punishment is a punish¬ 
ment half wasted. Children should be allowed to come to the places 
where the penalty is being carried out; there they will attend their 
classes in civics. And grown men will periodically relearn the laws. 
Let us conceive of places of punishment as a Garden of the Laws 
that families would visit on Sundays. ‘I propose that, from time to 
rime, after preparing people’s minds with a reasoned discourse on 
the preservation of the social order, on the utility of punishment, 
men as well as boys should be taken to the mines and to the work 
camps and contemplate the frightful fate of these outlaws. Such

pilgrimages would be more useful than the pilgrimages made by the 
Turks to Mecca’ (Brissot). And Le Peletier considered that this 
visibility of punishment was one of the fundamental principles of the 
new penal code: ‘Often, at certain special times, the presence of 
the people must bring down shame upon the heads of the guilty; and 
the presence of the guilty person in the pitiful state to which his crime 
has reduced him must bring useful instruction to the souls of the 
people’ (Le Peletier, 322). Long before he was regarded as an object 
of science, the criminal was imagined as a source of instruction. 
Once one made charitable visits to prisoners to share in their suffer¬ 
ings (the seventeenth century had invented or revived this practice); 
now it was being suggested that children should come and learn how 
the benefits of the law are applied to crime - a living lesson in the 
museum of order.
