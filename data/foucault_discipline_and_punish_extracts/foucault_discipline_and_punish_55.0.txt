clearer. From where the public is sitting, it is possible to believe in 
the existence of certain cruelties which, in fact, do not take place. 
But the essential point, in all these real or magnified severities, is 
that they should all, according to a strict economy, teach a lesson: 
that each punishment should be a fable. And that, in counterpoint 
with all the direct examples of virtue, one may at each moment 
encounter, as a living spectacle, the misfortunes of vice. Around 
each of these moral ‘representations’, schoolchildren will gather 
with their masters and adults will learn what lessons to teach their 
offspring. The great terrifying ritual of the public execution gives 
way, day after day, street after street, to this serious theatre, with its 
multifarious and persuasive scenes. And popular memory will 
reproduce in rumour the austere discourse of the law. But perhaps 
it will be necessary, above these innumerable spectacles and narra¬ 
tives, to place the major sign of punishment for the most terrible 
of crimes: the keystone of the penal edifice. In any case. Vermeil had 
imagined the scene of absolute punishment that should dominate all 
the theatres of everyday punishment: the only case in which one 
had to seek to reach an infinity of punishment, something equivalent 
in the new penal system to what regicide had been in the old. The 
man found guilty of this crime would have his eyes put out; he 
would be put into an iron cage, suspended in the air, above a public 
square; he would be completely naked; he would be attached to the

bars of the cage by an iron belt around his waist; to the end of his 
days, he would be fed on bread and water. ‘Thus he would be 
exposed to all the rigours of the seasons, sometimes his head would 
be covered with snow, sometimes burnt by a scorching sun. It is 
in this energetic torture, presenting rather the extension of a painful 
death than that of a painful life, that one would truly recognize a 
villain deserving of the horror of nature in its entirety, condemned 
to see no longer the heaven that he has outraged and to live no 
longer on the earth that he has sullied’ (Vermeil, 148-9). Above the 
punitive city hangs this iron spider; and the criminal who is to be 
thus crucified by the new law is the parricide. 

There is a whole new arsenal of picturesque punishments. ‘Avoid 
inflicting the same punishments,’ said Mably. The idea of a uniform 
penalty, modulated only according to the gravity of the crime is 
banished. To be more precise: the use of imprisonment as a general 
form of punishment is never presented in these projects for specific,
