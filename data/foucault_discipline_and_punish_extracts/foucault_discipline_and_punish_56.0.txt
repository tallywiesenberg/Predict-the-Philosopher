convict-ship is an open-air prison. Detention, reclusion, imprison¬ 
ment for a minor offence are in a sense merely different names for 
one and the same punishment’ (Remusat, 185). And the Empire 
decided at once to translate this imprisonment, envisaged by the 
law, into reality, according to a whole penal, administrative, geo¬ 
graphical hierarchy; at the lowest degree, associated with each 
justice of the peace, municipal maisons de police-, in each arrondisse- 
ment, maisons d’arriv, in each departement, a maison de correction-, 
at the summit, several maisons centrales for convicted criminals or 
correctionels serving sentences of over one year; lastly, in a few ports, 
convict-ships. A great prison structure was planned, whose different 
levels would correspond exactly to the levels of the centralized 
administration. The scaffold, where the body of the tortured 
criminal had been exposed to the ritually manifested force of the 
sovereign, the punitive theatre in which the representation of 
punishment was permanently available to the social body, was 
replaced by a great enclosed, complex and hierarchized structure

that was integrated into the very body of the state apparatus. A 
quite different materiality, a quite different physics of power, a quite 
different way of investing men’s bodies had emerged. During the 
Restoration and the July monarchy, there were, apart from a few 
exceptional moments, between 40,000 and 43,000 prisoners in 
French gaols (approximately one prisoner per 600 inhabitants). 
The high wall, no longer the wall that surrounds and protects, no 
longer the wall that stands for power and wealth, but the meticu¬ 
lously sealed wall, uncrossable in either direction, closed in upon the 
now mysterious work of punishment, will become, near at hand, 
sometimes even at the very centre of the cities of the nineteenth 
century, the monotonous figure, at onc^ material and symbolic, of 
the power to punish. Already under the Consulate, the Minister of 
the Interior had been appointed to investigate the different ‘places 
of safety’ that were already functioning and which could be used in 
different towns. A few years later, sums had been allocated for the 
construction, in keeping with the power that they were to represent 
and serve, of these new castles of the new civil order. The empire 
used them in fact, for another war (cf. Decazes), A less extravagant, 
but more obstinate economy continued to build them throughout 
the nineteenth century. 

In under twenty years, in any case, the principle so clearly
