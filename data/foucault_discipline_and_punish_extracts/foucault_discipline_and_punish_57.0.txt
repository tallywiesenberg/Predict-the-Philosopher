code given by Joseph II to Austria; and yet both legislations made 
imprisonment - modulated according to its duration and aug¬ 
mented in certain cases by branding or the use of irons - an almost 
uniform penalty: at least thirty years’ detention for an attempt on 
the sovereign’s life, for counterfeiting and for murder with robbery; 
fifteen to thirty years for voluntary homicide or armed robbery; one 
month to five years for simple theft, etc.® 

But if this colonization of the penalty by the prison is surprising, 
it is because imprisonment was not, as one might imagine, a punish¬ 
ment that was already securely established in the penal system, just 
below the death penalty, and which naturally occupied the place left 
vacant by the disappearance of public torture. In fact, imprisonment

Punishment 


-and on this point many countries were in the same situation as 
France - had only a limited and marginal position in the system of 
penalties. This is shown by the texts themselves. The ordinance of 
1670 does not include detention among the peines afflictives, or 
serious penalties. Perpetual or temporary imprisonment was no 
doubt included among certain local customs and practices (cf., for 
example, Coquille). But contemporary writers maintained that it was 
falling into disuse together with other forms of torture: ‘There were 
formerly penalties that are no longer practised in France, such as 
writing a condemned man’s penalty on his face or forehead and 
perpetual imprisonment, just as one no longer condemns a criminal 
to be exposed to wild beasts or sent down the mines’ (Rousseaud de 
la Combe, 3). In fact, it is certain that imprisonment had survived 
tenaciously as a punishment for less serious offences, according to 
local customs and practices. In this sense, Soulatges spoke of the 
‘light penalties’ that the ordinance of 1670 had not mentioned: 
reprimand, admonition, banishment from a certain place, satisfaction 
to the injured party and a term of imprisonment. In certain regions, 
especially those that had most preserved their legal p>eculiarities, the 
penalty of imprisonment was still widespread, but this had its 
difficulties, as in the recently annexed province of Roussillon. 

Yet, despite these divergencies, jurists held firmly to the principle 
that ‘imprisonment is not to be regarded as a penalty in our civil 
law’ (Serpillon, 1095 - however, one does find in Serpillon the idea 
that the rigour of imprisonment is the beginning of a penalty). Its 
role is rather that of holding the person and his body as security:
