to the state (it was estimated that this would save over 100,000 
pounds in Flanders); this would make it unnecessary to return 
money paid in taxes to the owners of woods ruined by vagabonds; 
it would create a mass of new workers, which would help ‘by com¬ 
petition to bring down the cost of labour’; lastly, it would enable the 
true poor to benefit, to the full, from necessary charity (Vilan, 68).

Punishment 


This useful pedagogy would revive for the lazy individual a liking 
for work, force him back into a system of interests in which labour 
would be more advantageous than laziness, form around him a 
small, miniature, simplified, coercive society in which the maxim, 
'he who wants to live must work’, would be clearly revealed. Work 
would be compulsory, but so too would be remuneration, which 
enables the prisoner to improve his lot during and after detention. 
‘The man who does not find his subsistence must be made to desire 
to procure it for himself by work; he is offered it by supervision and 
discipline; in a sense, he is forced to acquire it; he is then tempted 
by the bait of gain; corrected in his morals, accustomed to work, 
his anxiety aroused by the little money he has kept for his release,’ 
he has learned a trade ‘that will guarantee a subsistence without 
danger’ (Vilan, 107). This reconstruction of homo oeconomicus ex¬ 
cluded the use of penalties that were too short - this would prevent 
the acquisition of habits and skills of work - or too long - which 
would make any apprenticeship useless. ‘The term of six months 
is too short to correct criminals, and to bring them to the spirit of 
work’; on the other hand, ‘a life sentence throws them into despair; 
they become indifferent to the correction of their morals and to the 
spirit of work; they become concerned only with plans to escape 
and to rebel; and since the judgements that were passed on them 
did not deprive them of life, why should one seek to render it 
unbearable for them.^’ (Vilan, 102-3). The duration of the penalty 
has meaning only in relation to possible correction, and to an 
economic use of the corrected criminal. 

To the principle of work, the English models added, as an 
essential addition to correction, isolation. The outlines had been 
provided in 1775, by Hanway, who justified it first with negative 
reasons: promiscuity in the prison provided bad examples and possi¬ 
bilities of escape in the short term and of blackmail or complicity in 
the long term. The prison would be too much like a factory if one 
left the prisoners to work together. The positive reasons followed:
