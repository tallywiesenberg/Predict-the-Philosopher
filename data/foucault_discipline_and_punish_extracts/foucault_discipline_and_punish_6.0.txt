The amende honorable was first abolished in France in 1791, then 
again in 1830 after a brief revival; the pillory was abolished in 
France in 1789 and in England in 1837. The use of prisoners in 
public works, cleaning city streets or repairing the highways, was 
practised in Austria, Switzerland and certain of the United States, 
such as Pennsylvania. These convicts, distinguished by their 
‘infamous dress’ and shaven heads, ‘were brought before the public. 
The sport of the idle and the vicious, they often become incensed, 
and naturally took violent revenge upon the aggressors. To prevent 
them from returning injuries which might be inflicted on them, 
they were encumbered with iron collars and chains to which bomb¬ 
shells were attached, to be dragged along while they performed their 
degrading service, under the eyes of keepers armed with swords, 
blunderbusses and other weapons of destruction’ (Roberts Vaux, 
Notices, 21, quoted in Teeters, 1937,24). This practice was abolished 
practically everywhere at the end of the eighteenth or the beginning 
of the nineteenth century. The public exhibition of prisoners was 
maintained in France in 1831, despite violent criticism - ‘a disgust¬ 
ing scene’, said Real (cf. Bibliography); it was finally abolished in 
April 1848. While the chain-gang, which had dragged convicts

across the whole of France, as far as Brest and Toulon, was replaced 
in 1837 by inconspicuous black-painted cell-carts. Punishment had 
gradually ceased to be a spectacle. And whatever theatrical elements 
it still retained were now downgraded, as if the functions of the 
penal ceremony were gradually ceasing to be understood, as if this 
rite that ‘concluded the crime’ was suspected of being in some 
undesirable way linked with it. It was as if the punishment was 
thought to equal, if not to exceed, in savagery the crime itself, to 
accustom the spectators to a ferocity from which one wished to 
divert them, to show them the frequency of crime, to make the 
executioner resemble a criminal, judges murderers, to reverse roles 
at the last moment, to make the tortured criminal an object of pity 
or admiration. As early as 1764, Beccaria remarked: ‘The murder 
that is depicted as a horrible crime is repeated in cold blood, 
remorselessly’ (Beccaria, loi). The public execution is now seen as 
a hearth in which violence bursts again into flame. 

Punishment, then, will tend to become the most hidden part of 
the penal process. This has several consequences: it leaves the 
domain of more or less everyday perception and enters that of 
abstract consciousness; its effectiveness is seen as resulting from its
