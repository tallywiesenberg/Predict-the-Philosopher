Thus justice had the crime re¬ 
enacted before the eyes of all, publishing it in its truth and at the 
same time annulling it in the death of the guilty man.Even as late 
in the eighteenth century as 1772, one finds sentences like the follow¬ 
ing: a servant girl at Cambrai, having killed her mistress, was con¬ 
demned to be taken to the place of her execution in a cart ‘used to 
collect rubbish at the crossroads’; there a gibbet was to be set up 
‘at the foot of which will be placed the same chair in which the said 
Laleu, her mistress, was sitting at the time of the murder; and having 
seated the criminal there, the executioner of the High Court of 
Justice will cut off her right hand, throw it in her presence into the 
fire, and, immediately afterwards, will strike her four blows with 
the cleaver with which she murdered the said Laleu, the first and 
second being on the head, the third on the left forearm and the 
fourth on the chest; this done, she will be hung and strangled on the 
said gibbet until she be dead; and when two hours have elapsed her 
dead body will be removed and the head separated from it at the 
foot of the said gibbet on the said scaffold, with the same cleaver 
she used to murder her mistress, and the same head exhibited 
on a pole twenty feet high outside the gates of the said Cambrai, 
within reach of the road that leads to Douai, and the rest of the body 
put in a sack, and buried near the said pole at a depth of ten feet’ 
(quoted in Dautricourt, 269-70).4.Lastly, the slowness of the process of torture and execution, 
its sudden dramatic moments, the cries and sufferings of the con¬ 
demned man serve as an ultimate proof at the end of the judicial 
ritual.Every death agony expresses a certain truth: but, when it 
takes place on the scaffold, it does so with more intensity, in that it

Torture 


is hastened by pain; with more rigour, because it occurs exactly at 
the juncture between the judgement of men and the judgement of 
God; with more ostentation, because it takes place in public.
