The 
sufferings of the condemned man are an extension of those of the 
judicial torture that precedes them; in the judicial torture, however, 
the game was not yet over and one could still save one’s life; now 
one will die, without any doubt, and it is one’s soul that one must 
save.The eternal game has already begun: the torture of the execu¬ 
tion anticipates the punishments of the beyond; it shows what they 
are; it is the theatre of hell; the cries of the condemned man, his 
struggles, his blasphemies, already signify his irremediable destiny.But the pains here below may also be counted as penitence and so 
alleviate the punishments of the beyond: God will not fail to take 
such a martyrdom into account, providing it is borne with resigna¬ 
tion.The cruelty of the earthly punishment will be deducted from 
the punishment to come: in it is glimpsed the promise of forgive¬ 
ness.But, it might be said, are not such terrible sufferings a sign 
that God has abandoned the guilty man to the mercy of his fellow 
creatures.^ And, far from securing future absolution, do they not 
prefigure imminent damnation; so that, if the condemned man dies 
quickly, without a prolonged agony, is it not proof that God wishes 
to protect him and to prevent him from falling into despairi* There 
is, therefore, an ambiguity in this suffering that may signify equally 
well the truth of the crime or the error of the judges, the goodness 
or the evil of the criminal, the coincidence or the divergence between 
the judgement of men and that of God.
