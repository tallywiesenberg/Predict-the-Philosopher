Hence the insatiable curiosity 
that drove the spectators to the scaffold to witness the spectacle of 
sufferings truly endured; there one could decipher crime and inno¬ 
cence, the past and the future, the here below and the eternal.It was 
a moment of truth that all the spectators questioned: each word, each 
cry, the duration of the agony, the resisting body, the life that clung 
desperately to it, all this constituted a sign.There was the man who 
survived ‘six hours on the wheel, and did not want the executioner, 
who consoled and heartened him no doubt as best he could, to leave 
him for a moment’; there was the man who died ‘with true Christian 
feeling, and who manifested the most sincere repentance’; the man 
who ‘expired on the wheel an hour after being put there; it is said 
that the spectators of his torture were moved by the outward signs

of religion and repentance that he gave’; the man who had shown 
the most marked signs of contrition throughout the journey to the 
scaffold, but who, when placed alive on the wheel, ‘did not cease 
to let forth the most horrible cries’; or again the woman who ‘had 
preserved her calm up to the moment when the sentence was read, 
but whose wits then began to turn; she was quite mad by the time 
she was hanged’ (Hardy, I, 13; IV, 42; V, 134).We have come full circle: from the judicial torture to the execu¬ 
tion, the body has produced and reproduced the truth of the crime 
-or rather it constitutes the element which, through a whole set of 
rituals and trials, confesses that the crime took place, admits that the 
accused did indeed commit it, shows that he bore it inscribed in 
himself and on himself, supports the operation of punishment and 
manifests its effects in the most striking way.The body, several 
times tortured, provides the synthesis of the reality of the deeds and 
the truth of the investigation, of the documents of the case and the 
statements of the criminal, of the crime and the punishment.
