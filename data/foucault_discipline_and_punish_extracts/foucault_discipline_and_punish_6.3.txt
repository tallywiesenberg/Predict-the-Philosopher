It is an 
essential element, therefore, in a penal liturgy, in which it must 
serve as the partner of a procedure ordered around the formidable 
rights of the sovereign, the prosecution and secrecy.The public execution is to be understood not only as a judicial, 
but also as a political ritual.It belongs, even in minor cases, to the 
ceremonies by which power is manifested.An offence, according to the law of the classical age, quite apart 
from the damage it may produce, apart even from the rule that it 
breaks, offends the rectitude of those who abide by the law: ‘If one 
commits something that the law forbids, even if there is neither harm 
nor injury to the individual, it is an offence that demands reparation, 
because the right of the superior man is violated and because it 
offends the dignity of his character’ (Risi, 9).Besides its immediate 
victim, the crime attacks the sovereign: it attacks him personally, 
since the law represents the will of the sovereign; it attacks him 
physically, since the force of the law is the force of the prince.
