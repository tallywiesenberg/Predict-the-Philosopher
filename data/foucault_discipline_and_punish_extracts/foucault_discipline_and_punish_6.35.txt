‘For a law to be in force in this kingdom, it must necessarily have 
emanated directly from the sovereign, or at least been confirmed by 
the seal of his authority’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv).The inter¬ 
vention of the sovereign is not, therefore, an arbitration between

two adversaries; it is much more, even, than an action to enforce 
respect for the rights of the individual; it is a direct reply to the 
person who has oflFended him.There can be no doubt that ‘the 
exercise of the sovereign power in the punishment of crime is one 
of the essential parts of the administration of justice’ (Jousse, vii).Punishment, therefore, cannot be identified with or even measured 
by the redress of the injury; in punishment, there must always be a 
portion that belongs to the prince, and, even when it is combined 
with the redress laid down, it constitutes the most important element 
in the penal liquidation of the crime.Now, this portion belonging 
to the prince is not in itself simple: on the one hand, it requires 
redress for the injury that has been done to his kingdom (as an 
element of disorder and as an example given to others, this con¬ 
siderable injury is out of all proportion to that which has been 
committed upon a private individual); but it also requires that the 
king take revenge for an affront to his very person.
