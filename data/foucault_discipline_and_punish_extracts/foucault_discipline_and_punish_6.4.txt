The right to punish, therefore, is an aspect of the sovereign’s 
right to make war on his enemies: to punish belongs to ‘that 
absolute power of life and death which Roman law calls merum 
imperium, a right by virtue of which the prince sees that his law is 
respected by ordering the punishment of crime’ (Muyart de Vou- 
glans, xxxiv).But punishment is also a way of exacting retribution 
that is both personal and public, since the physico-political force 
of the sovereign is in a sense present in the law: ‘One sees by the 
very definition of the law that it tends not only to prohibit, but also 
to avenge contempt for its authority by the punishment of those who 
violate its prohibitions’ (Muyart de Vouglans, xxxiv).In the execu¬ 
tion of the most ordinary penalty, in the most punctilious respect of 
legal forms, reign the active forces of revenge.The public execution, then, has a juridico-political function.It is 
a ceremonial by which a momentarily injured sovereignty is recon¬ 
stituted.
