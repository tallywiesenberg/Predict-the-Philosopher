It restores that sovereignty by manifesting it at its most

the subject who has dared to violate the law and the all-powerful 
sovereign who displays his strength.Although redress of the private 
injury occasioned by the offence must be proportionate, although the 
sentence must be equitable, the punishment is carried out in such a

of the sovereign beating down upon the body of his adversary and 
mastering it: by breaking the law, the offender has touched the very 
person of the prince; and it is the prince - or at least those to whom 
he has delegated his force - who seizes upon the body of the con¬ 
demned man and displays it marked, beaten, broken.
