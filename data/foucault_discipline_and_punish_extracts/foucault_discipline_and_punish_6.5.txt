The ceremony 
of punishment, then, is an exercise of ‘terror’.When the jurists of 
the eighteenth century began their polemic with the reformers, they 
offered a restrictive, ‘modernist’ interpretation of the physical 
cruelty of the penalties imposed by the law: if severe penalties are 
required, it is because their example must be deeply inscribed in the 
hearts of men.Yet, in fact, what had hitherto maintained this 
practice of torture was not an economy of example, in the sense in 
which it was to be understood at the time of the idiologues (that the 
representation of the penalty should be greater than the interest of 
the crime), but a policy of terror: to make everyone aware, through 
the body of the criminal, of the unrestrained presence of the sover¬ 
eign.The public execution did not re-establish justice; it reactivated 
power.In the seventeenth century, and even in the early eighteenth 
century, it was not, therefore, with all its theatre of terror, a linger¬ 
ing hang-over from an earlier age.
