Now, this meticulous ceremonial was not only 
legal, but quite explicitly military.The justice of the king was 
shown to be an armed justice.The sword that punished the guilty 
was also the sword that destroyed enemies.A whole military machine 
surrounded the scaffold: cavalry of the watch, archers, guardsmen, 
soldiers.This was intended, of course, to prevent any escape or 
show of force; it was also to prevent any outburst of sympathy or 
anger on the part of the people, any attempt to save the condemned 
or to have them immediately put to death; but it was also a reminder 
that every crime constituted as it were a rebellion against the law 
and that the criminal was an enemy of the prince.
