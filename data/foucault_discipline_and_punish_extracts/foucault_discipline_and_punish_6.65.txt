All these reasons - 
whether a matter of precaution in particular circumstances or a 
functional element in the performance of the ritual - made the public 
execution more than an act of justice; it was a manifestation of 
force; or rather, it was justice as the physical, material and awesome 
force of the sovereign deployed there.The ceremony of the public 
torture and execution displayed for all to see the power relation 
that gave his force to the law.As a ritual of armed law, in which the prince showed himself, 
indissociably, both as head of justice and head of war, the public 
execution had two aspects: one of victory, the other of struggle.It brought to a solemn end a war, the outcome of which was 
decided in advance, between the criminal and the sovereign; it had 
to manifest the disproportion of power of the sovereign over those 
whom he had reduced to impotence.The dissymmetry, the irreÂ¬ 
versible imbalance of forces were an essential element in the public 
execution.
