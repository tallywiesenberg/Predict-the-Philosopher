indignation of contemporaries.This was an apparently paradoxical 
ceremony, since it took place almost entirely after death, and since 
justice did little more than deploy its magnificent theatre, the ritual 
praise of its force, on a corpse.The condemned man was blind¬

with iron hooks.‘The confessor whispered in the patient’s ear and, 
after he had given him the blessing, the executioner, who had an 
iron bludgeon of the kind used in slaughter houses, delivered a blow 
with all his might on the temple of the wretch, who fell dead: the 
mortis exactor, who had a large knife, then cut his throat, which 
spattered him with blood; it was a horrible sight to see; he severed 
the sinews near the two heels, and then opened up the belly from 
which he drew the heart, liver, spleen and lungs, which he stuck on 
an iron hook, and cut and dissected into pieces, which he then stuck 
on the other hooks as he cut them, as one does with an animal.
