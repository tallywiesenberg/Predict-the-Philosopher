Look who can at such a sight’ (Bruneau, 259).In the explicit 
reference to the butcher’s trade, the infinitesimal destruction of the 
body is linked here with spectacle: each piece is placed on display.The execution was accompanied by a whole ceremonial of 
triumph; but it also included, as a dramatic nucleus in its monotonous 
progress, a scene of confrontation: this was the immediate, direct 
action of the executioner on the body of the ‘patient’.It was a coded 
action, of course, since custom and, often quite explicitly, the sen¬ 
tence prescribed its principal episodes.Nevertheless, it did preserve 
something of the battle.
