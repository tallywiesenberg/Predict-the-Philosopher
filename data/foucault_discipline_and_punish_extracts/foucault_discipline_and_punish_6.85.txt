(A scene observed by T. S. Gueulette, at the execution of 
Montigny in 1737 - cf.Anchel, <>2-9.)Conversely, if he failed, if he 
did not succeed in killing the ‘patient’ as required, he was liable to 
punishment.This was the case of Damiens’s executioner who, being 
unable to quarter his patient according to the rules, had to cut him 
up with a knife; as a result, Damiens’s hair, which had been prom¬ 
ised to him, was confiscated and the money obtained from the sale 
given to the poor.Some years later, an executioner at Avignon 
caused excessive pain to three bandits, who were nevertheless 
formidable characters, whom he had to hang; the spectators became 
angry; they denounced him; in order to punish him and also to 
protect him from mob violence, he was put into prison (Duhamel, 
23).
