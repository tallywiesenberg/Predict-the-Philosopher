And, behind this punishment of the unskilful executioner, 
stands a tradition, which is still close to us, according to which the 
condemned man should be pardoned if the execution happened to 
fail.It was a custom clearly established in certain countries: in 
Burgundy, for instance (cf.Chassanee, 53).The people often 
expected it to be applied, and would sometimes protect a condemned 
man who had escaped death in this way.In order to abolish both 
custom and expectation, they had to revive the adage, ‘the gibbet 
does not lose its prey’, to introduce explicit instructions in capital 
sentences, such as ‘hanged by the neck until he be dead’.
