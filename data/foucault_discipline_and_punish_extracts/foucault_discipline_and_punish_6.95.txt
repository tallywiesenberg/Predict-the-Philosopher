And jurists 
like Serpillon or Blackstone were insisting in the middle of the 
eighteenth century that a failure on the part of the executioner did 
not mean that the condemned man’s life was spared (Serpillon, III, 
1100).In his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Blackstone 
remarks: ‘It is clear, that if, upon judgement to be hanged by the 
neck till he is dead, the criminal be not thoroughly killed, but 
revives, the sheriff must hang him again.For the former hanging 
was no execution of the sentence; and, if a false tenderness were to 
be indulged in such cases, a multimde of collusions might ensue’ 
(Blackstone, 199).There was something of the ordeal and something 
of God’s judgement that was still indecipherable in the ceremony of 
execution.In his confrontation with the condemned man, the execu¬ 
tioner was a little like the king’s champion.
