innovations of the American system and also because it was not, 
like the others, doomed to immediate failure and abandonment; it 
was continuously re-examined and transformed right up to the 
great debates of the 1830s on penitentiary reform. In many respects

Punishment 


the Walnut Street Prison, opened in 1790, under the direct influence 
of the Quakers, was modelled on those of Ghent and Gloucester. 
There was compulsory work in workshops; the prisoners were kept 
constantly occupied; the prison was flnanced by this work, but the 
prisoners were also rewarded individually as a way of reinserting 
them morally and materially into the strict world of the economy; 
by keeping the prisoners ‘constantly employed on productive 
works, they were able to defray the expenses of the prison, they 
were not left idle and they were able to save a little money for the 
time when their captivity would cease’ (La Rochefoucauld-Lian- 
court, 9). Life was partitioned, therefore, according to an absolutely 
strict time-table, under constant supervision; each moment of the 
day was devoted to a particular type of activity, and brought with it 
its own obligations and prohibitions: ‘All prisoners rise at daybreak, 
so that, after making their beds, cleaning and washing themselves 
and attending to other needs, they generally begin their work at 
sunrise. From that moment, no one may go into the rooms or other 
places except to the workshops and places assigned for their work. 
... At nightfall, a bell rings to mark the end of their work... They 
are given half an hour to arrange their beds, after which they are not 
allowed to converse aloud or to make the least noise’ (Turnbull, 15- 
16). As at Gloucester, solitary confinement was not total; it was used 
for certain prisoners who would in former times have incurred the 
death penalty, and for those inside the prison who deserved special 
punishment: ‘There, without occupation, without anything to dis¬ 
tract him, waiting in uncertainty for the moment when he would be 
delivered’, the prisoner spent ‘long anxious hours, with nothing but 
the reflections that are present to the minds of all guilty persons’ 
(Teeters, 1935, 49). Lastly, as at Ghent, the length of the imprison¬ 
ment could vary with the behaviour of the prisoner: after consulting 
the files, the prison inspectors obtained from the authorities - with¬ 
out much difficulty up to the 1820s - pardons for prisoners who had 
shown good behaviour. 

Furthermore, Walnut Street had a number of characteristics that 
were specific to it, or which at least developed what was potentially 
present in the other models. First, the principle of not publicizing
