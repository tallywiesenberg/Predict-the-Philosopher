Punishment 


of the defendant, notes on his behaviour before and after sentence: 
indispensable elements if one wished to ‘decide what steps will have 
to be taken to destroy his old habits*.^* And throughout his deten¬ 
tion he would be observed; his conduct would be noted daily and 
the inspectors - twelve local worthies appointed in 1795 - who, two 
by two, visited the prison each week, would be kept informed of 
events, follow the conduct of each prisoner and decide which of 
them deserved a shortening of his term. This ever-growing know¬ 
ledge of the individuals made it possible to divide them up in the 
prison not so much according to their crimes as according to the 
dispositions that they revealed. The prison became a sort of permanent 
observatory that made it possible to distribute the varieties of vice 
or weakness. From 1797, the prisoners were divided into four classes: 
the first for those who were explicitly condemned to solitary con¬ 
finement or who had committed serious offences in the prison; the 
second for those who were ‘well known as old offenders ... whose 
depraved morality, dangerous character, irregular dispositions, or 
disorderly conduct’ became apparent during the time they were in 
prison; the third for those ‘whose character and circumstances, 
before and after conviction, led one to believe that they were not 
habitual offenders’; the fourth and last was a special section, a 
probationary class for those whose character was still not known, 
or who, if they were better known, did not deserve to be put in the 
preceding category (Teeters, 1935, 59). A whole corpus of indivi¬ 
dualizing knowledge was being organized that took as its field of 
reference not so much the crime committed (at least in isolation), 
but the potentiality of danger that lies hidden in an individual and 
which is manifested in his observed everyday conduct. The prison 
functions in this as an apparatus of knowledge. 

Between this apparatus of punishment proposed by the Flemish, 
English and American models, between these ‘reformatories’ and 
all the punishments imagined by the reformers, one may establish 
the points of convergence and the disparities. 

Points of convergence. In the first instance, there is a difference 
in the temporal direction of punishment. The ‘reformatories’ were 
mechanisms directed towards the future; they too were intended not 
to efface a crime, but to prevent its repetition. ‘As to the end, or
