Punishment 


and for the spectators - an object of representation. By what instru¬ 
ment did one act on the representations.^ Other representations, or 
rather couplings of ideas (crime-punishment, the imagined advan¬ 
tage of crime-disadvantage perceived in the punishments); these 
pairings could function only in the element of publicity: punitive 
scenes that established them or reinforced them in the eyes of all, a 
discourse that circulated, brought back into currency at each 
moment the complex of signs. The role of the criminal in punish¬ 
ment was to reintroduce, in the face of crime and the criminal code, 
the real presence of the signified - that is to say, of the penalty 
which, according to the terms of the code, must be infallibly associ¬ 
ated with the offence. By producing this signified abundantly and 
visibly, and therefore reactivating the signifying system of the code, 
the idea of crime functioning as a sign of punishment, it is with this 
coin that the offender pays his debt to society. Individual correction 
must, therefore, assure the process of redefining the individual as 
subject of law, through the reinforcement of the systems of signs 
and representations that they circulate. 

The apparatus of corrective penality acts in a quite different way. 
The point of application of the penalty is not the representation, but 
the body, time, everyday gestures and activities; the soul, too, but 
in so far as it is the seat of habits. The body and the soul, as prin¬ 
ciples of behaviour, form the element that is now proposed for 
punitive intervention. Rather than on an art of representations, this 
punitive intervention must rest on a studied manipulation of the 
individual: ‘I have no more doubt of every crime having its cure in 
moral and physical influence ...’; so, in order to decide on punish¬ 
ments, one ‘will require some knowledge of the principles of sensa¬ 
tion, and of the sympathies which occur in the nervous system’ 
(Rush, 13). As for the instruments used, these are no longer com¬ 
plexes of representation, reinforced and circulated, but forms of 
coercion, schemata of constraint, applied and repeated. Exercises, 
not signs: time-tables, compulsory movements, regular activities, 
solitary meditation, work in common, silence, application, respect, 
good habits. And, ultimately, what one is trying to restore in this 
technique of correction is not so much the juridical subject, who is 
caught up in the fundamental interests of the social pact, but the 
obedient subject, the individual subjected to habits, rules, orders.
