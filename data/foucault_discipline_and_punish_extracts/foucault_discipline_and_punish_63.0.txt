Punishment 


spectacle, sign, discourse; legible like an open book; operating by a 
permanent recodification of the mind of the citizens; eliminating 
crime by those obstacles placed before the idea of crime; acting 
invisibly and uselessly on the ‘soft fibres of the brain’, as Servan put 
it. A power to punish that ran the whole length of the social network 
would act at each of its points, and in the end would no longer be 
perceived as a power of certain individuals over others, but as an 
immediate reaction of all in relation to the individual. On the other 
hand, a compact functioning of the power to punish: a meticulous 
assumption of responsibility for the body and the time of the con¬ 
vict, a regulation of his movements and behaviour by a system of 
authority and knowledge; a concerted orthopaedy applied to con¬ 
victs in order to reclaim them individually; an autonomous adminis¬ 
tration of this power that is isolated both from the social body and 
from the judicial power in the strict sense. The emergence of the 
prison marks the institutionalization of the power to punish, or, to be 
more precise: will the power to punish (with the strategic aim adop¬ 
ted in the late eighteenth century, the reduction of popular illegality) 
be better served by concealing itself beneath a general social func¬ 
tion, in the ‘punitive city’, or by investing itself in a coercive 
institution, in the enclosed space of the ‘reformatory’.^ 

In any case, it can be said that, in the late eighteenth century, one 
is confronted by three ways of organizing the power to punish. The 
first is the one that was still functioning and which was based on the 
old monarchical law. The other two both refer to a preventive, 
utilitarian, corrective conception of a right to punish that belongs 
to society as a whole; but they are very different from one another 
at the level of the mechanisms they envisage. Broadly speaking, one 
might say that, in monarchical law, punishment is a ceremonial of 
sovereignty; it uses the ritual marks of the vengeance that it applies 
to the body of the condemned man; and it deploys before the eyes 
of the spectators an effect of terror as intense as it is discontinuous, 
irregular and always above its own laws, the physical presence of the 
sovereign and of his power. The reforming jurists, on the other 
hand, saw punishment as a procedure for requalifying individuals 
as subjects, as juridical subjects; it uses not marks, but signs, coded 
sets of representations, which would be given the most rapid 
circulation and the most general acceptance possible by citizens
