The gentle way in punishment 


wimessing the scene of punishment. Lastly, in the project for a 
prison institution that was then developing, punishment was seen 
as a technique for the coercion of individuals; it operated methods 
of training the body - not signs - by the traces it leaves, in the form 
of habits, in behaviour; and it presupposed the setting up of a 
specific power for the administration of the penalty. We have, then, 
the sovereign and his force, the social body and the administrative 
apparatus; mark, sign, trace; ceremony, representation, exercise; 
the vanquished enemy, the juridical subject in the process of re¬ 
qualification, the individual subjected to immediate coercion; the 
tortured body, the soul with its manipulated representations, the 
body subjected to training. We have here the three series of elements 
that characterize the three mechanisms that face one another in the 
second half of the eighteenth century. They cannot be reduced to 
theories of law (though they overlap with such theories), nor can 
they be identified with apparatuses or institutions (though they are 
based on them), nor can they be derived from moral choices (though 
they find their justification in morality). They are modalities accord¬ 
ing to which the power to punish is exercised: three technologies of 
power. 

The problem, then, is the following: how is it that, in the end, 
it was the third that was adoptedi' How did the coercive, corporal, 
solitary, secret model of the power to punish replace the representa¬ 
tive, scenic, signifying, public, collective model.^ Why did the 
physical exercise of punishment (which is not torture) replace, with 
the prison that is its institutional support, the social play of the signs 
of punishment and the prolix festival that circulated them.^
