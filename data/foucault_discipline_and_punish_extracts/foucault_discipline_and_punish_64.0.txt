Let us take the ideal figure of the soldier as it was still seen in the 
early seventeenth century. To begin with, the soldier was someone 
who could be recognized from afar; he bore certain signs: the natural 
signs of his strength and his courage, the marks, too, of his pride; 
his body was the blazon of his strength and valour; and although it 
is true that he had to learn the profession of arms little by little - 
generally in actual fighting - movements like marching and attitudes 
like the bearing of the head belonged for the most part to a bodily 
rhetoric of honour; ‘The signs for recognizing those most suited to 
this profession are a lively, alert manner, an erect head, a taut 
stomach, broad shoulders, long arms, strong fingers, a small belly, 
thick thighs, slender legs and dry feet, because a man of such a 
figure could not fail to be agile and strong’; when he becomes a pike- 
bearer, the soldier ‘will have to march in step in order to have as 
much grace and gravity as possible, for the pike is an honourable 
weapon, worthy to be borne with gravity and boldness’ (Mont- 
gommery, 6 and 7). By the late eighteenth century, the soldier has 
become something that can be made; out of a formless clay, an inapt 
body, the machine required can be constructed; posture is gradually 
corrected; a calculated constraint runs slowly through each part of 
the body, mastering it, making it pliable, ready at all times, turning 
silently into the automatism of habit; in short, one has ‘got rid of 
the peasant’ and given him ‘the air of a soldier’ (ordinance of 20 
March 1764). Recruits become accustomed to ‘holding their heads 
high and erect; to standing upright, without bending the back, to 
sticking out the belly, throwing out the chest and throwing back the 
shoulders; and, to help them acquire the habit, they are given this 
position while standing against a wall in such a way that the heels, 
the thighs, the waist and the shoulders touch it, as also do the backs

of the hands, as one turns the arms outwards, without moving them 
away from the body. . . Likewise, they will be taught never to fix 
their eyes on the ground, but to look straight at those they pass ... 
to remain motionless until the order is given, without moving the 
head, the hands or the feet... lastly to march with a bold step, with 
knee and ham taut, on the points of the feet, which should face 
outwards’ (ordinance of 20 March 1764). 

The classical age discovered the body as object and target of 
power. It is easy enough to find signs of the attention then paid to 
the body - to the body that is manipulated, shaped, trained, which
