punitive system, at the threshold of the contemporary period. De¬ 
scribing them will require great attention to detail: beneath every set 
of figures, we must seek not a meaning, but a precaution; we must 
situate them not only in the inextricability of a functioning, but in 
the coherence of a tactic. They are the acts of cunning, not so much 
of the greater reason that works even in its sleep and gi\^es meaning 
to the insignificant, as of the attentive ‘malevolence’ that turns 
everything to account. Discipline is a political anatomy of detail. 

Before we lose patience we would do well to recall the words of 
Marshal de Saxe: ‘Although those who concern themselves with 
details are regarded as folk of limited intelligence, it seems to me 
that this part is essential, because it is the foundation, and it is 
impossible to erect any building or establish any method without 
understanding its principles. It is not enough to have a liking for 
architecture. One must also know stone-cutting’ (Saxe, 5). There is 
a whole history to be written about such ‘stone-cutting’ - a history 
of the utilitarian rationalization of detail in moral accountability and 
political control. The classical age did not initiate it; rather it 
accelerated it, changed its scale, gave it precise instruments, and 
perhaps found some echoes for it in the calculation of the infinitely 
small or in the description of the most detailed characteristics of 
natural beings. In any case, ‘detail’ had long been a category of

theology and asceticism; every detail is important since, in the sight 
of God, no immensity is greater than a detail, nor is anything so 
small that it was not willed by one of his individual wishes. In this 
great tradition of the eminence of detail, all the minutiae of Chris¬ 
tian education, of scholastic or military pedagogy, all forms of 
‘training’ found their place easily enough. For the disciplined man, 
as for the true believer, no detail is unimportant, but not so much 
for the meaning that it conceals within it as for the hold it provides 
for the power that wishes to seize it. Characteristic is the great hymn 
to the ‘little things’ and to their eternal importance, sung by Jean- 
Baptiste de La Salle, in his Traite sur les obligations des freres des 
Nicoles chretiennes. The mystique of the everyday is joined here with 
the discipline of the minute. ‘How dangerous it is to neglect little 
things. It is a very consoling reflection for a soul like mine, little 
disposed to great actions, to think that fidelity to little things may, 
by an imperceptible progress, raise us to the most eminent sanctity: 
because little things lead to greater... Little things; it will be said,
