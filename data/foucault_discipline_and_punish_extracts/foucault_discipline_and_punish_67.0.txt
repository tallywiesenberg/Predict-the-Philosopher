The art of distributions 

In the first instance, discipline proceeds from the distribution of in¬ 
dividuals in space. To achieve this end, it employs several techniques. 

I. Discipline sometimes requires enclosure, the specification of a 
place heterogeneous to all others and closed in upon itself. It is the 
protected place of disciplinary monotony. There was the great 
‘confinement’ of vagabonds and paupers; there were other more 
discreet, but insidious and effective ones. There were the colleges, 
or secondary schools: the monastic model was gradually imposed; 
boarding appeared as the most perfect, if not the most frequent, 
educational regime; it became obligatory at Louis-le-Grand when, 
after the departure of the Jesuits, it was turned into a model school 
(cf. Ari^s, 308-13 and Snyders, 35-41). There were the military

barracks: the army, that vagabond mass, has to be held in place; 
looting and violence must be prevented; the fears of local inhabi¬ 
tants, who do not care for troops passing through their towns, 
must be calmed; conflicts with the civil authorities must be avoided; 
desertion must be stopped, expenditure controlled. The ordinance 
of 1719 envisaged the construction of several hundred barracks, 
on the model of those already set up in the south of the country; 
there would be strict confinements: ‘The whole will be enclosed by 
an outer wall ten feet high, which will surround the said houses, at 
a distance of thirty feet from ail the sides’; this will have the effect 
of maintaining the troops in ‘order and discipline, so that an officer 
will be in a position to answer for them’ {L’Ordonnance militaire, 
IXL, 25 September 1719). In 1745, there were barracks in about 
320 towns; and it was estimated that the total capacity of the bar¬ 
racks in 1775 was approximately 200,000 men (Daisy, 201-9; ®n 
anonymous memoir of 1775, in Dep6t de la guerre, 3689, f. 156; 
Navereau, 132-5). Side by side with the spread of workshops, there 
also developed great manufacturing spaces, both homogeneous and 
well defined: first, the combined manufactories, then, in the second 
half of the eighteenth century, the works or factories proper (the 
Chaussade ironworks occupied almost the whole of the Medine 
peninsula, between Ni^vre and Loire; in order to set up the Indret 
factory in 1777, Wilkinson, by means of embankments and dikes,
