method: the monastic cell. Even if the compartments it assigns 
become purely ideal, the disciplinary space is always, basically, 
cellular. Solitude was necessary to both body and soul, according to 
a certain asceticism: they must, at certain moments at least, confront 
temptation and perhaps the severity of God alone. ‘Sleep is the 
image of death, the dormitory is the image of the sepulchre — 
although the dormitories are shared, the beds are nevertheless 
arranged in such a way and closed so exactly by means of curtains 
that the girls may rise and retire without being seen’ {Reglementpour 
la communauti des fillet du Bon Pasteur, in Delamare, 507). But this 
is still a very crude form.

institutions, code a space that architecture generally left at the dis¬ 
posal of several different uses. Particular places were defined to 
correspond not only to the need to supervise, to break dangerous

communications, but also to create a useful space. The process 
appeared clearly in the hospitals, especially in the military and naval 
hospitals. In France, it seems that Rochefort served both as experi¬ 
ment and model. A port, and a military port is - with its circulation 
of goods, men signed up willingly or by force, sailors embarking 
and disembarking, diseases and epidemics - a place of desertion, 
smuggling, contagion: it is a crossroads for dangerous mixtures, a 
meeting-place for forbidden circulations. The naval hospital must 
therefore treat, but in order to do this it must be a filter, a mechanism 
that pins down and partitions; it must provide a hold over this whole 
mobile, swarming mass, by dissipating the confusion of illegality 
and evil. The medical supervision of diseases and contagions is 
inseparable from a whole series of other controls: the military control 
over deserters, fiscal control over commodities, administrative con¬ 
trol over remedies, rations, disappearances, cures, deaths, simula¬ 
tions. Hence the need to distribute and partition off space in a 
rigorous manner. The first steps taken at Rochefort concerned 
things rather than men, precious commodities, rather than patients. 
The arrangements of fiscal and economic supervision preceded the 
techniques of medical observation: placing of medicines under lock 
and key, recording their use; a little later, a system was worked out 
to verify the real number of patients, their identity, the units to 
which they belonged; then one began to regulate their comings and 
goings; they were forced to remain in their wards; to each bed was 
attached the name of its occupant; each individual treated was
