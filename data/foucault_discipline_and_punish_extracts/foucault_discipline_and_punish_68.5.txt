entered in a register that the doctor had to consult during the visit; 
later came the isolation of contagious patients and separate beds. 
Gradually, an administrative and political space was articulated upon 
a therapeutic space; it tended to individualize bodies, diseases, 
symptoms, lives and deaths; it constituted a real table of juxtaposed 
and carefully distinct singularities. Out of discipline, a medically 
useful space was bom. 

In the factories that appeared at the end of the eighteenth century, 
the principle of individualizing partitioning became more compli¬ 
cated. It was a question of distributing individuals in a space in 
which one might isolate them and map them; but also of articulating 
this distribution on a production machinery that had its own re¬ 
quirements. The distribution of bodies, the spatial arrangement of

production machinery and the different forms of activity in the 
distribution of ‘posts’ had to be linked together. The Oberkampf 
manufactory at Jouy obeyed this principle. It was made up of a 
series of workshops specified according to each broad type of opera¬ 
tion: for the printers, the handlers, the colourists, the women who 
touched up the design, the engravers, the dyers. The largest of the 
buildings, built in 1791, by Toussaint Barre, was no metres long 
and had three storeys. The ground floor was devoted mainly to 
block printing; it contained 132 tables arranged in two rows, the 
length of the workshop, which had eighty-eight windows; each 
printer worked at a table with his ‘puller’, who prepared and spread 
the colours. There were 264 persons in all. At the end of each table 
was a sort of rack on which the material that had just been printed 
was left to dry (Saint-Maur). By walking up and down the central 
aisle of the workshop, it was possible to carry out a supervision that 
was both general and individual: to observe the worker’s presence 
and application, and the quality of his work; to compare workers 
with one another, to classify them according to skill and speed; 
to follow the successive stages of the production process. All these 
serializations formed a permanent grid: confusion was eliminated*: 
that is to say, production was divided up and the labour process 
was articulated, on the one hand, according to its stages or element¬ 
ary operations, and, on the other hand, according to the individuals, 
the particular bodies, that carried it out: each variable of this force - 
strength, promptness, skill, constancy - would be observed, and 
therefore characterized, assessed, computed and related to the 
individual who was its particular agent. Thus, spread out in a per¬
