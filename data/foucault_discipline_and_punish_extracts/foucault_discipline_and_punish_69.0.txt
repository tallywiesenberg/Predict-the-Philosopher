fectly legible way over the whole series of individual bodies, the 
work force may be analysed in individual units. At the emergence 
of large-scale industry, one finds, beneath the division of the pro¬ 
duction process, the individualizing fragmentation of labour power; 
the distributions of the disciplinary space often assured both. 

4. In discipline, the elements are interchangeable, since each is 
defined by the place it occupies in a series, and by the gap that 
separates it from the others. The unit is, therefore, neither the 
territory (unit of domination), nor the place (unit of residence), but 
the ran^; the place one occupies in a classification, the point at which 
a line and a column intersect, the interval in a series of intervals that

one may traverse one after the other. Discipline is an art of rank, 
a technique for the transformation of arrangements. It individualizes 
bodies by a location that does not give them a fixed position, but 
distributes them and circulates them in a network of relations. 

Take the example of the ‘class’. In the Jesuit colleges, one still 
found an organization that was at once binary and unified; the 
classes, which might comprise up to two or three hundred pupils, 
were subdivided into groups of ten; each of these groups, with its 
‘decurion’, was placed in a camp, Roman or Carthaginian; each 
‘decury’ had its counterpart in the opposing camp. The general 
form was that of war and rivalry; work, apprenticeship and classifi¬ 
cation were carried out in the form of the joust, through the con¬ 
frontation of two armies; the contribution of each pupil was in¬ 
scribed in this general duel; it contributed to the victory or the 
defeat of a whole camp; and the pupils were assigned a place that 
corresponded to the function of each individual and to his value as 
a combatant in the unitary group of his ‘decury’ (Rochemonteix, 
5 iff). It should be observed moreover that this Roman comedy 
made it possible to link, to the binary exercises of rivalry, a spatial 
disposition inspired by the legion, with rank, hierarchy, pyramidal 
supervision. One should not forget that, generally speaking, the 
Roman model, at the Enlightenment, played a dual role: in its 
republican aspect, it was the very embodiment of liberty; in its 
military aspect, it was the ideal schema of discipline. The Rome of 
the eighteenth century and of the Revolution was the Rome of the 
Senate, but it was also that of the legion; it was the Rome of the 
Forum, but it was also that of the camps. Up to the empire, the 
Roman reference transmitted, somewhat ambiguously, the juridical 
ideal of citizenship and the technique of disciplinary methods. In 
any case, the strictly disciplinary element in the ancient fable used by 
the Jesuit colleges came to dominate the element of joust and mock
