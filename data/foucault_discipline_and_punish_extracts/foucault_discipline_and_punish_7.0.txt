The disappearance of public executions marks therefore the decline 
of the spectacle; but it also marks a slackening of the hold on the 
body. In 1787, in an address to the Society for Promoting Political 
Enquiries, Benjamin Rush remarked: ‘I can only hope that the time 
is not far away when gallows, pillory, scaffold, flogging and wheel 
will, in the history of punishment, be regarded as the marks of the 
barbarity of centuries and of countries and as proofs of the feeble 
influence of reason and religion over the human mind’ (Teeters, 
1935, 30). Indeed, sixty years later. Van Meenen, opening the second 
penitentiary congress, in Brussels, recalled the time of his childhood 
as of a past age: ‘I have seen the ground strewn with wheels, 
gibbets, gallows, pillories; I have seen hideously stretched skeletons 
on wheels’ (Annales de la Chariti, 529-30). Branding had been 
abolished in England (1834) and in France (1832); in 1820, England 
no longer dared to apply the full punishment reserved for traitors 
(Thistlewood was not quartered). Only flogging still remained in a 
number of penal systems (Russia, England, Prussia). But, generally

speaking, punitive practices had become more reticent. One no 
longer touched the body, or at least as little as possible, and then 
only to reach something other than the body itself. It might be 
objected that imprisonment, confinement, forced labour, penal 
servitude, prohibition from entering certain areas, deportation - 
which have occupied so important a place in modern penal systems - 
are ‘physical’ penalties: unlike fines, for example, they directly 
aflFect the body. But the punishment-body relation is not the same 
as it was in the torture during public executions. The body now 
serves as an instrument or intermediary: if one intervenes upon it 
to imprison it, or to make it work, it is in order to deprive the 
individual of a liberty that is regarded both as a right and as property. 
The body, according to this penality, is caught up in a system of 
constraints and privations, obligations and prohibitions. Physical 
pain, the pain of the body itself, is no longer the constituent element 
of the penalty. From being an art of unbearable sensations punish¬ 
ment has become an economy of suspended rights. If it is still 
necessary for the law to reach and manipulate the body of the con¬ 
vict, it will be at a distance, in the proper way, according to strict 
rules, and with a much ‘higher’ aim. As a result of this new restraint, 
a whole army of technicians took over from the executioner, the 
immediate anatomist of pain: warders, doctors, chaplains, psychia¬ 
trists, psychologists, educationalists; by their very presence near the 
prisoner, they sing the praises that the law needs: they reassure it
