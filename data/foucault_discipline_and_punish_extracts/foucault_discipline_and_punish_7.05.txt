The short time that usually elapsed between sentence 
and execution (often a few hours) meant that the pardon usually 
arrived at the very last moment.But the ceremony, by the very 
slowness of its progress, was no doubt arranged to leave room for 
this eventuality.(Cf.Hardy, 30 January 1769, 1 ,125 and 14 Decem¬ 
ber 1779, IV, 229; Anchel, 162-3, story of Antoine Boulle- 

teix, who was already at the foot of the scaffold when a horseman 
arrived carrying the celebrated parchment.Shouts of ‘God save the 
King’ arose and Boulleteix was taken to the tavern, while the clerk 
of the court made a collection on his behalf.)
