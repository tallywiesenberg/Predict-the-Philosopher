The condemned 
always hoped for a pardon and, in order to drag things out, they 
would pretend, even at the foot of the scaffold, that they had further 
revelations to make.When the people wanted a pardon they called 
for it aloud and tried to postpone the last moment, looking out for 
the arrival of the messenger bearing the letter with the green wax 
seal and if necessary claiming that he was on his way (this happened 
during the execution of those condemned for the uprising against 
child abduction on 3 August 1750).The sovereign was present at 
the execution not only as the power exacting the vengeance of the 
law, but as the power that could suspend both law and vengeance.He alone must remain master, he alone could wash away the offences 
committed on his person; although it is true that he delegated to the 
courts the task of exercising his power to dispense justice, he had 
not transferred it; he retained it in its entirety and he could suspend 
the sentence or increase it at will.We must regard the public execution, as it was still ritualized in 
the eighteenth century, as a political operation, It was logically 
inscribed in a system of punishment, in which the sovereign, directly 
or indirectly, demanded, decided and carried out punishments, in 
so far as it was he who, through the law, had been injured by the 
crime.
