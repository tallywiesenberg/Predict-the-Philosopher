The next day the 
arm was cut off, and, since it fell at his feet, he was constantly 
kicking it up and down the scaffold; on the third day, red-hot 
pincers were applied to his breasts and the front of his arm; on the 
fourth day, the pincers were applied similarly on the back of his 
arm and on his buttocks; and thus, consecutively, this man was 
tortured for eighteen days.’ On the last day, he was put to the wheel 
and 'mailloti' [beaten with a wooden club].After six hours, he was 
still asking for water, which was not given him.‘Finally the police 
magistrate was begged to put an end to him by strangling, so that 
his soul should not despair and be lost’ (Brantome, II, 191-2).There can be no doubt that the existence of public tortures and 
executions were connected with something quite other than this 
internal organization.Rusche and Kirchheimer are right to see it as 
the effect of a system of production in which labour power, and 
therefore the human body, has neither the utility nor the commercial 
value that are conferred on them in an economy of an industrial 
type.
