Moreover, this ‘contempt’ for the body is certainly related to 
a general attitude to death; and, in such an attitude, one can detect 
not only the values proper to Christianity, but a demographical.54 




The spectacle of the scaffold 


in a sense biological, situation: the ravages of disease and hunger, 
the periodic massacres of the epidemics, the formidable child mor¬ 
tality rate, the precariousness of the bio-economic balances - all this 
made death familiar and gave rise to rituals intended to integrate it, 
to make it acceptable and to give a meaning to its permanent 
aggression.But in analysing why the public executions survived for 
so long, one must also refer to the historical conjuncture; it must 
not be forgotten that the ordinance of 1670 that regulated criminal 
justice almost up to the Revolution had even increased in certain 
respects the rigour of the old edicts; Pussort, who, among the com¬ 
missioners entrusted with the task of drawing up the documents, 
represented the intentions of the king, was responsible for this, 
despite the views of such magistrates as Lamoignon; the number of 
uprisings at the very height of the classical age, the rumbling close 
at hand of civil war, the king’s desire to assert his power at the 
expense of the parlements go a long way to explain the survival of 
so severe a penal system.In accounting for a penal system involving so much torture, these 
are general and in a sense external reasons; they explain not only 
the possibility and the long survival of physical punishments, but 
also the weakness and the rather sporadic nature of the opposition 
to them.Against this general background we must bring out their 
precise function.
