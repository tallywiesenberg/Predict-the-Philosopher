If torture was so strongly embedded in legal 
practice, it was because it revealed truth and showed the operation 
of power.It assured the articulation of the written on the oral, the 
secret on the public, the procedure of investigation on the operation 
of the confession; it made it possible to reproduce the crime on the 
visible body of the criminal; in the same horror, the crime had to 
be manifested and annulled.It also made the body of the condemned 
man the place where the vengeance of the sovereign was applied, 
the anchoring point for a manifestation of power, an opportunity 
of affirming the dissymmetry of forces.We shall see later that the 
truth-power relation remains at the heart of all mechanisms of 
punishment and that it is still to be found in contemporary penal 
practice - but in a quite different form and with very different effects.The Enlightenment was soon to condemn public torture and execu¬ 
tion as an ‘atrocity’ - a term that was often used to describe it, but 
without any critical intention, by jurists themselves.
