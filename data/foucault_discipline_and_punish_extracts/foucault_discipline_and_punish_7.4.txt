Torture 


notion of ‘atrocity’ is one of those that best designates the economy 
of the public execution in the old penal practice.To begin with, 
atrocity is a characteristic of some of the great crimes: it refers to the 
number of natural or positive, divine or human laws that they 
attack, to the scandalous openness or, on the contrary, to the secret 
cunning with which they have been committed, to the rank and 
status of those who are their authors and victims, to the disorder 
that they presuppose or bring with them, to the horror they 
arouse.In so far as it must bring the crime before everyone’s eyes, 
in all its severity, the punishment must take responsibility for this 
atrocity: it must bring it to light by confessions, statements, inscrip¬ 
tions that make it public; it must reproduce it in ceremonies that 
apply it to the body of the guilty person in the form of humiliation 
and pain.Atrocity is that part of the crime that the punishment 
turns back as torture in order to display it in the full light of day: 
it is a figure inherent in the mechanism that produces the visible 
truth of the crime at the very heart of the punishment itself.The 
public execution formed part of the procedure that established the 
reality of what one punished.
