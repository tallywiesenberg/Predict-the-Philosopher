Furthermore, the atrocity of a crime 
was also the violence of the challenge flung at the sovereign; it was 
that which would move him to make a reply whose function was to 
go further than this atrocity, to master it, to overcome it by an 
excess that annulled it.The atrocity that haunted the public execu¬ 
tion played, therefore, a double role: it was the principle of the 
communication between the crime and the punishment, it was also 
the exacerbation of the punishment in relation to the crime.It pro¬ 
vided the spectacle with both truth and power; it was the culmina¬ 
tion of the ritual of the investigation and the ceremony in which the 
sovereign triumphed.And it joined both together in the tortured 
body.The punitive practice of the nineteenth century was to strive 
to put as much distance as possible between the ‘serene’ search for 
truth and the violence that cannot be entirely effaced from punish¬ 
ment.
