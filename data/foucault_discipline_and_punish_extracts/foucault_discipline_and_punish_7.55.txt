They were 
worthy only of the crowned monsters who governed the Romans’ 
(Pastoret, on the subject of the punishment of regicides, II, 6i).But, 
according to the penal practice of the preceding period, the proxim¬ 
ity in the public execution of the sovereign and the crime, the mix¬ 
ture that was produced in it of ‘demonstration’ and punishment, 
were not the result of a barbarous confusion; what joined them 
together was the mechanism of atrocity and its necessary concatena¬ 
tions.The atrocity of the expiation organized the ritual destruction 
of infamy by omnipotence.The fact that the crime and the punishment were related and 
bound up in the form of atrocity was not the result of some ob¬ 
scurely accepted law of retaliation.It was the effect, in the rites of 
punishment, of a certain mechanism of power: of a power that not 
only did not hesitate to exert itself directly on bodies, but was 
exalted and strengthened by its visible manifestations; of a power 
that asserted itself as an armed power whose functions of maintain¬ 
ing order were not entirely unconnected with the functions of war; 
of a power that presented rules and obligations as personal bonds, a 
breach of which constituted an offence and called for vengeance; 
of a power for which disobedience was an act of hostility, the first 
sign of rebellion, which is not in principle different from civil war; 
of a power that had to demonstrate not why it enforced its laws, 
but who were its enemies, and what unleashing of force threatened 
them; of a power which, in the absence of continual supervision, 
sought a renewal of its effect in the spectacle of its individual mani¬ 
festations; of a power that was recharged in the ritual display of its 
reality as ‘super-power’.
