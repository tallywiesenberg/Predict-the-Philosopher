People were summoned as spectators: they were assembled 
to observe public exhibitions and amendes honorables; pillories, 
gallows and scaffolds were erected in public squares or by the roadÂ¬ 
side; sometimes the corpses of the executed persons were displayed 
for several days near the scenes of their crimes.Not only must 
people know, they must see with their own eyes.Because they must 
be made to be afraid; but also because they must be the witnesses, 
the guarantors, of the punishment, and because they must to a 
certain extent take part in it.The right to be witnesses was one that 
they possessed and claimed; a hidden execution was a privileged 
execution, and in such cases it was often suspected that it had not 
taken place with all its customary severity.There were protests 
when at the last moment the victim was taken away out of sight.
