The senior postal official who had been put on public exhibition 
for killing his wife was later taken away from the crowd.‘He was 
put into a hired coach; it was thought that if he had not been well 
escorted, it would have been difficult to protect him from being 
ill-treated by the populace, who yelled and jeered at him’ (Hardy, I, 
328).When the woman Lescombat was hanged, care was taken to 
hide her face; she had ‘a kerchief over her neck and head, which 
made the public murmur and say that it was not Lescombat’ 
(Anchel, 70-71).The people claimed the right to observe the execu¬ 
tion and to see who was being executed.The first time the guillotine 
was used the Chronique de Paris reported that people complained 
that they could not see anything and chanted, ‘Give us back our 
gallows’ (Lawrence, yiff).
