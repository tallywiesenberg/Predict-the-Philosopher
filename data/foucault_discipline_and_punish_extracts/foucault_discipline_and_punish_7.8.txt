This ‘service’ had been specified 
in the old ordinances; the edict of 1347 concerning blasphemers 
stipulated that they would be exhibited at the pillory ‘from the hour 
of prime, to that of their deaths.And mud and other refuse, though 
no stone or anything injurious, could be thrown at their faces...The second time, in case of relapse, it is our will that he be put in the 
pillory on a solemn market day, and that his upper lip be split so 
that the teeth appear.’ No doubt, at the classical period, this form 
of participation in the torture was no more than tolerated and 
attempts were made to limit it: because of the barbarities that it gave 
rise to and the usurpation it involved of the power to punish.
