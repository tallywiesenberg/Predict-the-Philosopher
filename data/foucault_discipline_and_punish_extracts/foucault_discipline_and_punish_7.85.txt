But it 
belonged too closely to the general economy of the public execution 
for it to be eliminated altogether.Even in the eighteenth century, 
there were scenes like the one that accompanied the execution of 
Montigny in 1737; as the executioner was carrying out the execu¬ 
tion, the local fish-wives walked in procession, holding aloft an 
effigy of the condemned man, and then cut off its head (Anchel, 63).And very often, as they moved slowly in procession through it, 
criminals had to be ‘protected’ from the crowd - both as an example 
and as a target, a possible threat and a ‘prey’, promised but also 
forbidden.In calling on the crowd to manifest its power, the 
sovereign tolerated for a moment acts of violence, which he accepted 
as a sign of allegiance, but which were strictly limited by the sover¬ 
eign’s own privileges.Now it was on this point that the people, drawn to the spectacle 
intended to terrorize it, could express its rejection of the punitive 
power and sometimes revolt.
