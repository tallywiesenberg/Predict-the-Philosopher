causing an uproar against the sentence - all this formed part of the 
popular practices that invested, traversed and often overturned the 
ritual of the public execution.TTiis often happened, of course, in the 
case of those condemned for rioting: there were the disturbances 
that followed a famous case of child abduction, when the crowd 
wanted to prevent the execution of three supposed rioters, who were 
to be hanged at the cemetery of Saint-Jean, ‘because there were 
fewer entrances and processions to guard’;* the terrified executioner 
cut down one of the condemned men; the archers let fly their arrows.It occurred again after the corn riots of 1775; and again in 1786, 
when the day-labourers marched on Versailles and set about freeing 
their arrested comrades.But apart from these cases, when the pro¬ 
cess of agitation had been triggered off previously and for reasons 
that did not concern some measure of penal justice, one finds many 
examples when the agitation was provoked directly by a verdict 
and an execution: small, but innumerable ‘disturbances around the 
scaffold’.In their most elementary forms, these disturbances began with the 
shouts of encouragement, sometimes the cheering, that accompanied 
the condemned man to his execution.
