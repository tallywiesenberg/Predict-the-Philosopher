Throughout the long proces¬ 
sion, he was sustained by ‘the compassion of the meek and tender¬ 
hearted, and with the applause, admiration and envy of all the bold 
and hardened’ (Fielding, 449).If the crowd gathered round the 
scaffold, it was not simply to witness the sufferings of the condemned 
man or to excite the anger of the executioner: it was also to hear an 
individual who had nothing more to lose curse the judges, the laws, 
the government and religion.The public execution allowed the 
luxury of these momentary saturnalia, when nothing remained to 
prohibit or to punish.Under the protection of imminent death, the 
criminal could say everything and the crowd cheered.‘If there were 
annals in which the last words of the tortured and executed were 
scrupulously recorded, and if one had the courage to read through 
them, even if one did no more than question the vile populace that 
gathers around the scaffolds out of cruel curiosity, one would be told 
that no one who had died on the wheel did not accuse heaven for the 
misery that brought him to the crime, reproach his judges for their 
barbarity, curse the minister of the altars who accompanies them 
and blaspheme against the God whose organ he is’ (Boucher
