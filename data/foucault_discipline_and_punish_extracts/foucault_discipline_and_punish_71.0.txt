formed into ‘congregations’, in an attempt to inure them to work 
in the workshops; the framework of the ‘factory-monastery’ was

imposed upon the workers. In the Protestant armies of Maurice of 
Orange and Gustavus Adolphus, military discipline was achieved 
through a rhythmics of time punctuated by pious exercises; army 
life, Boussanelle was later to say, should have some of the ‘perfec¬ 
tions of the cloister itself’ (Boussanelle, 2; on the religious character 
of discipline in the Swedish army, cf. The Swedish Discipline, 
London, 1632). For centuries, the religious orders had been masters 
of discipline; they were the specialists of time, the great technicians 
of rhythm and regular activities. But the disciplines altered these 
methods of temporal regulation from which they derived. They 
altered them first by refining them. One began to count in quarter 
hours, in minutes, in seconds. This happened in the army, of course: 
Guibert systematically implemented the chronometric measurement 
of shooting that had been suggested earlier by Vauban. In the ele¬ 
mentary schools, the division of time became increasingly minute; 
activities were governed in detail by orders that had to be obeyed 
immediately: ‘At the last stroke of the hour, a pupil will ring the 
bell, and at the first sound of the bell all the pupils will kneel, with 
their arms crossed and their eyes lowered. When the prayer has been 
said, the teachet will strike the signal once to indicate that the pupils 
should get up, a second time as a sign that they should salute Christ, 
and a third that they should sit down’ (La Salle, Conduite ..., 27-8). 
In the early nineteenth century, the following time-table was sug¬ 
gested for the Ecoles mutuelles, or ‘mutual improvement schools’: 
8.45 entrance of the monitor, 8.52 the monitor’s summons, 8.56 
entrance of the children and prayer, 9.00 the children go to their 
benches, 9.04 first slate, 9.08 end of dictation, 9.12 second slate, etc. 
(Tronchot, 221). The gradual extension of the wage-earning class 
brought with it a more detailed partitioning of time; ‘If workers 
arrive later than a quarter of an hour after the ringing of the bell...’ 
(Amboise, article 2); ‘if any one of the companions is asked for 
during work and loses more than five minutes ...’, ‘anyone who is 

not at his work at the correct time_’ (Oppenheim, article 7-8). 

But an attempt is also made to assure the quality of the time used: 
constant supervision, the pressure of supervisors, the elimination o£ 
anything that might disturb or distract; it is a question of constitut¬ 
ing a totally useful time: ‘It is expressly forbidden during work to
