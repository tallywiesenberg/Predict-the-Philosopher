at any game whatsoever, to eat, to sleep, to tell stories and comedies’ 
(Oppenheim, article i6); and even during the meal-break, ‘there will 
be no telling of stories, adventures or other such talk that distracts 
the workers from their work’; ‘it is expressly forbidden for any 
worker, under any pretext, to bring wine into the manufactory and 
to drink in the workshops’ {Amboise, article 4). Time measured and 
paid must also be a time without impurities or defects; a time of 
good quality, throughout which the body is constantly applied to 
its exercise. Precision and application are, with regularity, the funda¬ 
mental virtues of disciplinary time. But this is not the newest thing 
about it. Other methods are more characteristic of the disciplines. 

2. The temporal elaboration of the act. There are, for example, two 
ways of controlling marching troops. In the early seventeenth 
century, we have: ‘Accustomed soldiers marching in file or in 
battalion to march to the rhythm of the drum. And to do this, one 
must begin with the right foot so that the whole troop raises the 
same foot at the same time’ (Montgommery, 86). In the mid¬ 
eighteenth century, there are four sorts of steps: ‘The length of the 
the short step will be a foot, that of the ordinary step, the double 
step and the marching step will be two feet, the whole measured from 
one heel to the next; as for the duration, that of the small step and 
the ordinary step will last one second, during which two double 
steps would be performed; the duration of the marching step will be 
a little longer than one second. The oblique step will take one 
second; it will be at most eighteen inches from one heel to the next. 
... The ordinary step will be executed forwards, holding the head 
up high and the body erect, holding oneself in balance successively 
on a single leg, and bringing the other forwards, the ham taut, the 
point of the foot a little turned outwards and low, so that one may 
without affectation brush the ground on which one must walk and 
place one’s foot, in such a way that each part may come to rest there 
at the same time without striking the ground’ (‘Ordonnance du i®*’ 
janvier 1766, pour regler I’exercise de I’infanterie’). Between these 
two instructions, a new set of restraints had been brought into play, 
another degree of precision in the breakdown of gestures and move¬ 
ments, another way of adjusting the body to temporal imperatives. 

What the ordinance of 1766 defines is not a time-table - the 
general framework for an activity; it is rather a collective and
