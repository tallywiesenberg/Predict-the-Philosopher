obligatory rhythm, imposed from the outside; it is a ‘programme’; 
it assures the elaboration of the act itself; it controls its development 
and its stages from the inside. We have passed from a form of 
injunction that measured or punctuated gestures to a web that con¬ 
strains them or sustains them throughout their entire succession. A 
sort of anatomo-chronological schema of behaviour is defined. The 
act is broken down into its elements; the position of the body, limbs, 
articulations is defined; to each movement are assigned a direction, 
an aptitude, a duration; their order of succession is prescribed. Time 
penetrates the body and with it all the meticulous controls of power. 

3. Hence the correlation of the body and the gesture. Disciplinary 
control does not consist simply in teaching or imposing a series of 
particular gestures; it imposes the best relation between a gesture 
and the overall position of the body, which is its condition of effi¬ 
ciency and speed. In the correct use of the body, which makes 
possible a correct use of time, nothing must remain idle or useless: 
everything must be called upon to form the support of the act 
required. A well-disciplined body forms the operational context of 
the slightest gesture. Good handwriting, for example, presupposes 
a gymnastics - a whole routine whose rigorous code invests the body 
in its entirety, from the points of the feet to the tip of the index 
finger. The pupils must always ‘hold their bodies erect, somewhat 
turned and free on the left side, slightly inclined, so that, with the 
elbow placed on the table, the chin can be rested upon the hand, 
unless this were to interfere with the view; the left leg must be some¬ 
what more forward under the table than the right. A distance of two 
fingers must be left between the body and the table; for not only 
does one write with more alertness, but nothing is more harmful 
to the health than to acquire the habit of pressing one’s stomach 
against the table; the part of the left arm from the elbow to the hand 
must be placed on the table. The right arm must be at a distance 
from the body of about three fingers and be about five fingers from 
the table, on which it must rest lightly. The teacher will place the 
pupils in the posture that they should maintain when writing, and 
will correct it either by sign or otherwise, when they change this 
position’ (La Salle, Conduite —, 63-4). A disciplined body is the 
prerequisite of an efficient gesture.
