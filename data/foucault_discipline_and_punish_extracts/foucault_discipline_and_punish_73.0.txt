5. Exhaustive use. The principle that underlay the time-table in 
its traditional form was essentially negative; it was the principle of 
non-idleness: it was forbidden to waste time, which was counted by 
God and paid for by men; the time-table was to eliminate the danger 
of wasting it - a moral offence and economic dishonesty. Discipline, 
on the other hand, arranges a positive economy; it poses the prin¬ 
ciple of a theoretically ever-growing use of time: exhaustion rather 
than use; it is a question of extracting, from time, ever more available 
moments and, from each moment, ever more useful forces. This 
means that one must seek to intensify the use of the slightest 
moment, as if time, in its very fragmentation, were inexhaustible or 
as if, at least by an ever more detailed internal arrangement, one 
could tend towards an ideal point at which one maintained maximum 
speed and maximum efficiency. It was precisely this that was imple¬ 
mented in the celebrated regulations of the Prussian infantry that 
the whole of Europe imitated after the victories of Frederick II:* the 
more time is broken down, the more its subdivisions multiply, 
the better one disarticulates it by deploying its internal elements 
under a gaze that supervises them, the more one can accelerate an 
operation, or at least regulate it according to an optimum speed; 
hence this regulation of the time of an action that was so important 
in the army and which was to be so throughout the entire technology 
of human activity: the Prussian regulations of 1743 ^^id down six 
stages to bring the weapon to one’s foot, four to extend it, thirteen 
to raise it to the shoulder, etc. By other means, the ‘mutual improve¬ 
ment school’ was also arranged as a machine to intensify the use of 
time; its organization made it possible to obviate the linear, succes¬ 
sive character of the master’s teaching: it regulated the counterpoint 
of operations performed, at the same moment, by different groups 
of pupils under the direction of monitors and assistants, so that each 
passing moment was filled with many different, but ordered activi¬ 
ties; and, on the other hand, the rhythm imposed by signals, whistles, 
orders imposed on everyone temporal norms that were intended both 
to accelerate the process of learning and to teach speed as a virtue;® 
‘the sole aim of these commands ... is to accustom the children to 
executing well and quickly the same operations, to diminish as far as 
possible by speed the loss of time caused by moving from one opera¬ 
tion to another’ (Bernard).

Docile bodies 


Through this technique of subjection a new object was being 
formed; slowly, it superseded the mechanical body - the body com¬ 
posed of solids and assigned movements, the image of which had 
for so long haunted those who dreamt of disciplinary perfection. 
This new object is the natural body, the bearer of forces and the seat 
of duration; it is the body susceptible to specified operations, which 
have their order, their stages, their internal conditions, their con¬ 
stituent elements. In becoming the target for new mechanisms 
of power, the body is offered up to new forms of knowledge. It is 
the body of exercise, rather than of speculative physics; a body 
manipulated by authority, rather than imbued with animal spirits; 
a body of useful training and not of rational mechanics, but one in 
which, by virtue of that very fact, a number of natural requirements 
and functional constraints are beginning to emerge. This is the body 
that Guibert discovered in his critique of excessively artificial move¬ 
ments. In the exercise that is imposed upon it and which it resists, 
the body brings out its essential correlations and spontaneously 
rejects the incompatible: ‘On entering most of our training schools, 
one sees all those unfortunate soldiers in constricting and forced 
attitudes, one sees all their muscles contracted, the circulation of their 
blood interrupted. . . If we studied the intention of nature and the 
construction of the human body, we would find the position and 
the bearing that nature clearly prescribes for the soldier. The head 
must be erect, standing out from the shoulders, sitting perpendicu¬ 
larly between them. It must be turned neither to left nor to right, 
because, in view of the correspondence between the vertebrae of the 
neck and the shoulder-blade to which they are attached, none of them 
may move in a circular manner without slightly bringing with it 
from the same side that it moves one of the shoulders and because, 
the body no longer being placed squarely, the soldier can no longer 
walk straight in front of him or serve as a point of alignment. . . 
Since the hip-bone, which the ordinance indicates as the point 
against which the butt end should rest, is not situated the same in all 
men, the rifle must be placed more to the right for some, and more 
to the left for others. For the same reason of inequality of structure, 
the trigger-guard is more or less pressed against the body, depending 
on whether the outer parts of a man’s shoulder is more or less 
fleshy’ (Guibert, 21-2).
