Discipline 


5. Exhaustive use. The principle that underlay the time-table in 
its traditional form was essentially negative; it was the principle of 
non-idleness: it was forbidden to waste time, which was counted by 
God and paid for by men; the time-table was to eliminate the danger 
of wasting it - a moral offence and economic dishonesty. Discipline, 
on the other hand, arranges a positive economy; it poses the prin¬ 
ciple of a theoretically ever-growing use of time: exhaustion rather 
than use; it is a question of extracting, from time, ever more available 
moments and, from each moment, ever more useful forces. This 
means that one must seek to intensify the use of the slightest 
moment, as if time, in its very fragmentation, were inexhaustible or 
as if, at least by an ever more detailed internal arrangement, one 
could tend towards an ideal point at which one maintained maximum 
speed and maximum efficiency. It was precisely this that was imple¬ 
mented in the celebrated regulations of the Prussian infantry that 
the whole of Europe imitated after the victories of Frederick II:* the 
more time is broken down, the more its subdivisions multiply, 
the better one disarticulates it by deploying its internal elements 
under a gaze that supervises them, the more one can accelerate an 
operation, or at least regulate it according to an optimum speed; 
hence this regulation of the time of an action that was so important 
in the army and which was to be so throughout the entire technology 
of human activity: the Prussian regulations of 1743 ^^id down six 
stages to bring the weapon to one’s foot, four to extend it, thirteen 
to raise it to the shoulder, etc. By other means, the ‘mutual improve¬ 
ment school’ was also arranged as a machine to intensify the use of 
time; its organization made it possible to obviate the linear, succes¬ 
sive character of the master’s teaching: it regulated the counterpoint 
of operations performed, at the same moment, by different groups 
of pupils under the direction of monitors and assistants, so that each 
passing moment was filled with many different, but ordered activi¬ 
ties; and, on the other hand, the rhythm imposed by signals, whistles, 
orders imposed on everyone temporal norms that were intended both 
to accelerate the process of learning and to teach speed as a virtue;® 
‘the sole aim of these commands ... is to accustom the children to 
executing well and quickly the same operations, to diminish as far as 
possible by speed the loss of time caused by moving from one opera¬ 
tion to another’ (Bernard).
