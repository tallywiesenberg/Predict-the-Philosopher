their place among the contemporary techniques of classification and 
tabulation; but also how they introduced into them the specific 
problem of individuals and multiplicity. Similarly, the disciplinary 
controls of activity belonged to a whole series of researches, theor¬ 
etical or practical, into the natural machinery of bodies; but they 
began to discover in them specific processes; behaviour and its 
organized requirements gradually replaced the simple physics of 
movement. The body, required to be docile in its minutest opera¬ 
tions, opposes and shows the conditions of functioning proper to an 
organism. Disciplinary power has as its correlative an individuality 
that is not only analytical and ‘cellular’, but also natural and 
‘organic’. 


The organiiation of geneses 

In 1667, the edict that set up the manufactory of the Gobelins 
envisaged the organization of a school. Sixty scholarship children 
were to be chosen by the superintendent of royal buildings, entrus¬ 
ted for a time to a master whose task it would be to provide them 
with ‘upbringing and instruction’, then apprenticed to the various 
master tapestry makers of the manufactory (who by virtue of this 
fact received compensation deducted from the pupils’ scholarships); 
after six years’ apprenticeship, four years of service and a qualifying 
examination, they were given the right to ‘set up and run a shop’ 
in any town of the kingdom. We find here the characteristics of 
guild apprenticeship: the relation of dependence on the master that 
is both individual and total; the statutory duration of the training, 
which is concluded by a qualifying examination, but which is not 
broken down according to a precise programme; an overall exchange 
between the master who must give his knowledge and the appren¬ 
tice who must offer his services, his assistance and often some pay¬ 
ment. The form of domestic service is mixed with a transference of 
knowledge.® In 1737, an edict organized a school of drawing for 
the apprentices of the Gobelins; it was not intended to replace the 
training given by the master workers, but to complement it. It 
involved a quite different arrangement of time. Two hours a day, 
except on Sundays and feast days, the pupils met in the school. A

down in a register. The school was divided into three classes. The
