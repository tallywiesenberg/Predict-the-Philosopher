first for those who had no notion of drawing; they were made to 
copy models, which were more or less difficult according to the 
abilities of each pupil. The second ‘for those who already have some 
principles’, or who had passed through the first class; they had to 
reproduce pictures ‘at sight, without tracing’, but considering only 
the drawing. In the third class, they learnt colouring and pastel 
drawing, and were introduced to the theory and practice of dyeing. 
The pupils performed individual tasks at regular intervals; each of 
these exercises, signed with the name of its author and date of 
execution, was handed in to the teacher; the best were rewarded; 
assembled together at the end of the year and compared, they made 
it possible to establish the progress, the present ability and the 
relative place of each pupil; it was then decided which of them could 
pass into the next class. A general book, kept by the teachers and 
their assistants, recorded from day to day the behaviour of the 
pupils and everything that happened in the school; it was periodically 
shown to an inspector (Gerspach, 1892). 

The Gobelins school is only one example of an important pheno¬ 
menon: the development, in the classical period, of a new technique 
for taking charge of the time of individual existences; for regulating 
the relations of time, bodies and forces; for assuring an accumula¬ 
tion of duration; and for turning to ever-increased profit or use the 
movement of passing time. How can one capitalize the time of 
individuals, accumulate it in each of them, in their bodies, in their 
forces or in their abilities, in a way that is susceptible of use and 
control.^ How can one organize profitable durations.^ The disciplines, 
which analyse space, break up and rearrange activities, must also be 
understood as machinery for adding up and capitalizing time. This 
was done in four ways, which emerge most clearly in military 
organization. 

I. Divide duration into successive or parallel segments, each of 
which must end at a specific time. For example, isolate the period 
of training and the period of practice; do not mix the instruction of 
recruits and the exercise of veterans; open separate military schools 
for the armed service (in 1764, the creation of the Fcole Militaire in 
Paris, in 1776 the creation of twelve schools in the provinces);
