the handling of weapons, shooting, and do not pass to another 
activity until the first has been completely mastered: ‘One of the 
principal mistakes is to show a soldier every exercise at once’ 
(‘Reglement de 1743 ...’); in short, break down time into separate 
and adjusted threads. 2. Organize these threads according to an 
analytical plan - successions of elements as simple as possible, 
combining according to increasing complexity. This presupposes 
that instruction should abandon the principle of analogical repeti¬ 
tion. In the sixteenth century, military exercise consisted above all 
in copying all or part of the action, and of generally increasing the 
soldier’s skill or strength;’ in the eighteenth century, the instruction 
of the ‘manual’ followed the principle of the ‘elementary’ and not of 
the ‘exemplary’: simple gestures - the position of the fingers, the 
bend of the leg, the movement of the arms - basic elements for useful 
actions that also provide a general training in strength, skill, 
docility. 3. Finalize these temporal segments, decide on how long 
each will last and conclude it with an examination, which will have 
the triple function of showing whether the subject has reached the 
level required, of guaranteeing that each subject undergoes the same 
apprenticeship and of differentiating the abilities of each individual. 
When the sergeants, corporals, etc. ‘entrusted with the task of 
instructing the others, are of the opinion that a particular soldier is 
ready to pass into the first class, they will present him first to the 
officers of their company, who will carefully examine him; if they 
do not find him sufficiently practised, they will refuse to admit him; 
if, on the other hand, the man presented seems to them to be ready, 
the said officers will themselves propose him to the commanding 
officer of the regiment, who will see him if he thinks it necessary, 
and will have him examined by the senior officers. The slightest 
mistakes will be enough to have him rejected, and no one will be 
able to pass from the second class to the first until he has undergone 
this first examination’ {Instruction par I'exercise de Vinfanterie, 14 
mai 1754). 4. Draw up series of series; lay down for each individual, 
according to his level, his seniority, his rank, the exercises that are 
suited to him; common exercises have a differing role and each

difference involves specific exercises. At the end of each series, 
others begin, branch off and subdivide in turn. Thus each individual 
is caught up in a temporal series which specifically defines his level 
or his rank. It is a disciplinary polyphony of exercises; ‘Soldiers of 
the second class will be exercised every morning by sergeants,
