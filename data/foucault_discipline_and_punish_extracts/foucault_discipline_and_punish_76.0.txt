ements must be inscribed within a great temporal series, which is both 
a natural progress of the mind and a code for educative procedures. 

The ‘seriation’ of successive activities makes possible a whole 
investment of duration by power: the possibility of a detailed con¬ 
trol and a regular intervention (of differentiation, correction, 
punishment, elimination) in each moment of time; the possibility of 
characterizing, and therefore of using individuals according to the 
level in the series that they are moving through; the possibility of 
accumulating time and activity, of rediscovering them, totalized and 
usable in a final result, which is the ultimate capacity of an individual. 
Temporal dispersal is brought together to produce a profit, thus 
mastering a duration that would otherwise elude one’s grasp. Power 
is articulated directly onto time; it assures its control and guarantees 
its use. 

The disciplinary methods reveal a linear time whose moments are 
integrated, one upon another, and which is orientated towards a 
terminal, stable point; in short, an ‘evolutive’ time. But it must be 
recalled that, at the same moment, the administrative and economic 
techniques of control reveal a social time of a serial, orientated, 
cumulative type: the discovery of an evolution in terms of‘progress’, 
The disciplinary techniques reveal individual series: the discovery of 
an evolution in terms of ‘genesis’. These two great ‘discoveries’ 
of the eighteenth century - the progress of societies and the geneses 
of individuals - were perhaps correlative with the new techniques of 
power, and more specifically, with a new way of administering 
time and making it useful, by segmentation, seriation, synthesis and 
totalization. A macro- and a micro-physics of power made possible, 
not the Invention of history (it had long had no need of that), but 
the integration of a temporal, unitary, continuous, cumulative 
dimension in the exercise of controls and the practice of dominations. 
‘Evolutive’ historicity, as it was then constituted - and so profoundly 
that it is still self-evident for many today - is bound up with a mode

of functioning of power. No doubt it is as if the ‘history-remember¬ 
ing’ of the chronicles, genealogies, exploits, reigns and deeds had 
long been linked to a modality of power. With the new techniques 
of subjection, the ‘dynamics’ of continuous evolutions tends to re¬ 
place the ‘dynasties’ of solemn events.
