in the political technology of the body and of duration, does not 
culminate in a beyond, but tends towards a subjection that has never 
reached its limit. 


The composition of forces 

‘Let us begin by destroying the old prejudice, according to which 
one believed one was increasing the strength of a troop by increasing 
its depth. All the physical laws of movement become chimeras when 
one wishes to adapt them to tactics.’® From the end of the seven¬ 
teenth century, the technical problem of infantry had been freed 
from the physical model of mass. In an army of pikes and muskets - 
slow, imprecise, practically incapable of selecting a target and taking 
aim - troops were used as a projectile, a wall or a fortress: ‘the 
formidable infantry of the army of Spain’; the distribution of soldiers 
in this mass was carried out above all according to their seniority 
and their bravery; at the centre, with the task of providing weight 
and volume, of giving density to the body, were the least experi¬ 
enced; in front, at the angles and on the flanks, were the bravest or 
reputedly most skilful soldiers. In the course of the classical period, 
one passed over to a whole set of delicate articulations. The unit - 
regiment, battalion, section and, later, ‘division’- became a sort 
of machine with many parts, moving in relation to one another, in 
order to arrive at a configuration and to obtain a specific result. 
What were the reasons for this mutation? Some were economic: to 
make each individual useful and the training, maintenance, and 
arming of troops profitable; to give to each soldier, a precious unit.

maximum efficiency. But these economic reasons could become 
determinant only with a technical transformation: the invention of 
the rifle:^' more accurate, more rapid than the musket, it gave 
greater value to the soldier’s skill; more capable of reaching a par¬ 
ticular target, it made it possible to exploit fire-power at an indivi¬ 
dual level; and, conversely, it turned every soldier into a possible 
target, requiring by the same token greater mobility; it involved 
therefore the disappearance of a technique of masses in favour of an 
art tLn distributed units and men along extended, relatively flexible, 
mobile lines. Hence the need to find a whole calculated practice of 
individual and collective dispositions, movements of groups or 
isolated elements, changes of position, of movement from one dis¬ 
position to another; in short, the need to invent a machinery whose
