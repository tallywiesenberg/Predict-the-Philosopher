longer the principal variables that define it; but the place it occupies, 
the interval it covers, the regularity, the good order according to 
which it operates its movements. The soldier is above all a fragment 
of mobile space, before he is courage or honour. Guibert describes 
the soldier in the following way: ‘When he is under arms, he occu¬ 
pies two feet along his greatest diameter, that is to say, taking him 
from one end to the other, and about one foot in his greatest thick¬ 
ness taken from the chest to the shoulders, to which one must add an 
interval of a foot between him and the next man; this gives two feet 
in all directions per soldier and indicates that a troop of infantry in 
battle occupies, either in its front or in its depth, as many steps as it 
has ranks’ (Guibert, 27). This is a functional reduction of the body. 
But it is also an insertion of this body-segment in a whole ensemble 
over which it is articulated. The soldier whose body has been trained 
to function part by part for particular operations must in turn form 
an element in a mechanism at another level. The soldiers will be 
instructed first ‘one by one, then two by two, then in greater 
numbers. . . For the handling of weapons, one will ascertain that, 
when the soldiers have been separately instructed, they will carry it 
out two by two, and then change places alternately, so that the one 
on the left may learn to adapt himself to the one on the right’ 
(‘Ordonnance ...’). The body is constituted as a part of a multi¬ 
segmentary machine. 

2. The various chronological series that discipline must combine 
to form a composite time are also pieces of machinery. The time of

each must be adjusted to the time of the others in such a way that the 
maximum quantity of forces may be extracted from each and com¬ 
bined with the optimum result. Thus Servan dreamt of a military 
machine that would cover the whole territory of the nation and in 
which each individual would be occupied without interruption but 
in a different way according to the evolutive segment, the generic 
sequence in which he finds himself. Military life would begin in 
childhood, when young children would be taught the profession of 
arms in ‘military manors’; it would end in these same manors when 
the veterans, right up to their last day, would teach the children, 
exercise the recruits, preside over the soldiers’ exercises, supervise 
them when they were carrying out works in the public interest, and 
finally make order reign in the country, when the troops were fight¬ 
ing at the frontiers. There is not a single moment of life from which 
one cannot extract forces, providing one knows how to differentiate
