obedience is prompt and blind; an appearance of indocility, the least 
delay would be a crime’ (Boussanelle, 2). The training of school- 
children was to be carried out in the same way: few words, no 
explanation, a total silence interrupted only by signals - bells, clap¬ 
ping of hands, gestures, a mere glance from the teacher, or that little 
wooden apparatus used by the Brothers of the Christian Schools; it 
was called par excellence the ‘Signal’ and it contained in its mechanical 
brevity both the technique of command and the morality of obedi¬ 
ence. ‘The first and principal use of the signal is to attract at once 
the attention of all the pupils to the teacher and to make them 
attentive to what he wishes to impart to them. Thus, whenever he 
wishes to attract the attention of the children, and to bring the 
exercise to an end, he will strike the signal once. Whenever a good 
pupil hears the noise of the signal, he will imagine that he is hearing 
the voice of the teacher or rather the voice of God himself calling 
him by his name. He will then partake of the feelings of the young 
Samuel, saying with him in the depths of his soul: “Lord, I am 
here.” ’ The pupil will have to have learnt the code of the signals 
and respond automatically to them. ‘When prayer has been said, 
the teacher will strike the signal at once and, turning to the child 
whom he wishes to read, he will make the sign to begin. To make a 
sign to stop to a pupil who is reading, he will strike the signal

once. . . To make a sign to a pupil to repeat when he has read 
badly or mispronounced a letter, a syllable or a word, he will strike 
the signal twice in rapid succession. If, after the sign had been made 
two or three times, the pupil who is reading does not find and repeat 
the word that he has badly read or mispronounced - because he has 
read several words beyond it before being called to order - the 
teacher will strike three times in rapid succession, as a sign to him to 
begin to read farther back; and he will continue to make the sign 
till the pupil finds the word which he has said incorrectly’ (La Salle, 
Conduite ... 137-8; cf. also Demia, 21). The mutual improvement 
school was to exploit still further this control of behaviour by the 
system of signals to which one had to react immediately. Even 
verbal orders were to function as elements of signalization: ‘Enter 
your benches. At the word enter, the children bring their right 
hands down on the table with a resounding thud and at the same 
time put one leg into the bench; at the words ^our benches they put 
the other leg in and sit down opposite their slates ... Take your 
slates. At the word take, the children, with their right hands, take 
hold of the string by which the slate is suspended from the nail 
before them, and, with their left hands, they grasp the slate in the 
middle; at the word slates, they unhook it and place it on the table’.’®
