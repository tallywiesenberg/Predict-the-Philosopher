1*1 these executions, which ought to show only the 
terrorizing power of the prince, there was a whole aspect of the 
carnival, in which rules were inverted, authority mocked and 
criminals transformed into heroes.The shame was turned round; 
the courage, like the tears and the cries of the condemned, caused 
offence only to the law.Fielding notes with regret: ‘To unite the 
ideas of death and shame is not so easy as may be imagined ...I 
will appeal to any man who hath seen an execution, or a procession 
to an execution; let him tell me.When he hath beheld a poor 
wretch, bound in a cart, just on the verge of eternity, all pale and 
trembling with his approaching fate, whether the idea of shame 
hath ever intruded on his mind.^ much less will the bold daring 
rogue, who glories in his present condition, inspire the beholder 
with any such sensation’ (Fielding, 450).
