slow deaths and the altercations that occurred between victim and 
executioner. It was improved and finally adopted in 1783, the same 
year in which the traditional procession from Newgate to Tyburn 
was abolished, and in which the opportunity offered by the rebuild¬ 
ing of the prison, after the Gordon Riots, was used to set up the 
scaffolds in Newgate itself (see Hibbert, 85-6). The celebrated 
article 3 of the French Code of 1791 - ‘Every man condemned to 
death will have his head cut off’ — bears this triple signification: an 
equal death for all (‘Crimes of the same kind will be punished by the 
same kind of punishment, whatever the rank and state of the guilty 
man may be,’ in the words of the motion proposed by Guillotin and 
passed on i December 1789); one death per condemned man, 
obtained by a single blow, without recourse to those ‘long and 
consequently cruel’ methods of execution, such as the gallows.

The body of the condemned 


denounced by Le Peletier; lastly, punishment for the condemned 
man alone, since decapitation, the capital punishment of the nobility, 
was the least shaming for the criminal’s family (Le Peletier, 720). 
The guillotine, first used in March 1792, was the perfect vehicle for 
these principles. Death was reduced to a visible, but instantaneous 
event. Contact between the law, or those who carry it out, and the 
body of the criminal, is reduced to a split second. There is no 
physical confrontation; the executioner need be no more than a 
meticulous watchmaker. ‘Experience and reason demonstrate that 
the method used in the past to cut off the head of a criminal exposed 
him to a torture more frightful than the loss of life alone, which is 
the express intention of the law; the execution should therefore be 
carried out in a single moment and with a single blow; examples 
show how difficult it is to achieve this. For the method to work 
perfectly, it must necessarily depend on invariable mechanical 
means whose force and effect may also be determined. . . It is an 
easy enough matter to have such an unfailing machine built; decapi¬ 
tation will be performed in a moment according to the intention of 
the new law. If this apparatus seems necessary, it will cause no 
sensation and will be scarcely noticed’ (Saint-Edme, 161). The 
guillotine takes life almost without touching the body, just as prison 
deprives of liberty or a fine reduces wealth. It is intended to apply 
the law not so much to a real body capable of feeling pain as to a 
juridical subject, the possessor, among other rights, of the right to 
exist. It had to have the abstraction of the law itself.
