For the people who are 
there and observe, there is always, even in the most extreme ven¬ 
geance of the sovereign a pretext for revenge.This was especially the case if the conviction was regarded as 
unjust - or if one saw a man of the people put to death, for a crime 
that would have merited, for someone better born or richer, a com¬ 
paratively light penalty.It would seem that certain practices of penal 
justice were no longer supported in the eighteenth century - and 
perhaps .for longer - by the lower strata of the population.This 
would explain why executions could easily lead to the beginnings 
of social disturbances.Since the poorest - it was a magistrate who 
made the observation (Dupaty, 1786, 247) - could not be heard in 
the courts of law, it was where the law was manifested publicly, 
where they were called upon to act as witnesses and almost as co¬ 
adjutors of this law, that they could intervene, physically: enter by 
force into the punitive mechanism and redistribute its effects; take 
up in another sense the violence of the punitive rituals.
