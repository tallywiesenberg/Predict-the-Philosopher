There was 
agitation against the difference in p>enalties according to social class: 
in 1781, the parish priest of Champre had been killed by the lord 
of the manor, and an attempt was made to declare the murderer 
insane; ‘the peasants, who were extremely attached to their pastor, 
were furious and had at first seemed ready to lay violent hands upon 
their lord and to set fire to the castle...Everyone protested, and 
rightly, against the indulgence of the minister who deprived justice 
of the means of punishing so abominable a crime’ (Hardy, IV, 394).61 



Torture 


There was agitation, too, against the excessive sentences passed on 
certain common offences that were not regarded as serious (such as 
house-breaking); or against punishments for certain offences con¬ 
nected with social conditions such as petty larceny; the death penalty 
for this crime aroused a great deal of discontent, because there were 
many domestic servants in a single household and it was difficult 
for them, in such a case, to prove their innocence, and also because 
they could easily be victims of their employers’ spite and because 
the indulgence of certain masters who shut their eyes to such 
behaviour made the fate of servants accused, condemned and hanged 
even more iniquitous.
