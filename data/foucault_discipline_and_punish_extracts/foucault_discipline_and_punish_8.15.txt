The execution of such servants often gave 
rise to protests (cf.Hardy, I, 319, 367; III, 227-8; IV, 180).There 
was a small riot in Paris in 1761 in favour of a servant woman who 
had stolen a piece of cloth from her master.Despite the fact that the 
woman admitted her guilt, handed back the material and begged for 
mercy, the master refused to withdraw his complaint; on the day 
of the execution, the local people prevented the hanging, invaded the 
merchantâ€™s shop and looted it; in the end, the servant was pardoned, 
but a woman, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to stick a needle into 
the wicked master, was banished for three years (Anchel, 226).One remembers the great legal affairs of the eighteenth century, 
when enlightened opinion intervened in the persons of the philoso- 
phes and certain magistrates: Galas, Sirven and the Chevalier de La 
Barre, for instance.
