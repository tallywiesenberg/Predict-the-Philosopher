But less attention is given to the popular agita¬ 
tions caused by punitive practice.Indeed, they seldom spread be¬ 
yond a town, or even a district.Yet they did have a real importance.Sometimes these movements, which originated from below, spread 
and attracted the attention of more highly placed persons who, 
taking them up, gave them a new dimension (in the years preceding 
the Revolution, the affair of Catherine Espinas, falsely convicted of 
parricide in 1785, or the case of the three men of Chaumont, con¬ 
demned to the wheel, for whom Dupaty, in 1786, wrote his cele¬ 
brated memoir, or that of Marie Fran^oise Salmon, whom the 
parlement of Rouen in 1782 had condemned to the stake, for poison¬ 
ing, but who in 1786 had still not been executed).More usually, 
those disturbances had maintained around penal justice and its 
manifestations, which ought to have been exemplary, a state of 
permanent unrest.
