The spectacle of the scaffold 

ensure order around the scaffolds, to take steps that were ‘distressing 
to the people’ and ‘humiliating for the authorities’ (Argenson, 241)?It was evident that the great spectacle of punishment ran the risk 
of being rejected by the very people to whom it was addressed.In 
fact, the terror of the public execution created centres of illegality: 
on execution days, work stopped, the taverns were full, the authori¬ 
ties were abused, insults or stones were thrown at the executioner, 
the guards and the soldiers; attempts were made to seize the con¬ 
demned man, either to save him or to kill him more surely; fights 
broke out, and there was no better prey for thieves than the curious 
throng around the scaffold.(Hardy recounts a number of cases like 
the important theft that was committed in the very house in which 
the police magistrate was lodging - IV, 56.)But above all - and this 
was why these disadvantages became a political danger - the people 
never felt closer to those who paid the penalty than in those rituals 
intended to show the horror of the crime and the invincibility of 
power; never did the people feel more threatened, like them, by a 
legal violence exercised without moderation or restraint.
