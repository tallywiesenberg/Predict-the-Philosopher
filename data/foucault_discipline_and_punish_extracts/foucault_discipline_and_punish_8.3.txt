The solid¬ 
arity of a whole section of the population with those we would call 
petty offenders - vagrants, false beggars, the indigent poor, pick¬ 
pockets, receivers and dealers in stolen goods - was constantly 
expressed: resistance to police searches, the pursuit of informers, 
attacks on the watch or inspectors provide abundant evidence of 
this (cf.Richet, 118-19).^^id it was the breaking up of this solidar¬ 
ity that was becoming the aim of penal and police repression.Yet 
out of the ceremony of the public execution, out of that uncertain 
festival in which violence was instantaneously reversible, it was this 
solidarity much more than the sovereign power that was likely to 
emerge with redoubled strength.The reformers of the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries were not to forget that, in the last resort, 
the executions did not, in fact, frighten the people.
