â€˜Seeing this, the executioner had pulled his jerkin up over his face 
and struck him below the knees, on the stomach and on the belly.When the people saw that the executioner was causing him too 
much pain, and even believing that he was killing him down there 
with a bayonet... moved by compassion for the patient and fury 
at the executioner, they threw stones at the scaffold just as the 
executioner knocked away the two ladders and threw the patient 
down and leaped on to his shoulders and kicked him, while the wife 
of the said executioner pulled at his feet from under the gallows.In doing so, they made blood come from his mouth.But the hail 
of stones came thicker - one stone even struck the hanged man on 
the head - which forced the executioner to dash to the ladder, which 
he descended so rapidly that half-way down he fell from it, and 
struck his head on the ground.Then a crowd of people fell upon 
him.
