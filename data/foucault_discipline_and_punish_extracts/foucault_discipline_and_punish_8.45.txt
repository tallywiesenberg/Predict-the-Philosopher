He got to his feet, bayonet in hand, threatening to kill anyone 
who came near him; after falling several times, he finally got to his 
feet, only to be beaten by the crowd, rolled in the mud and nearly 
drowned in the stream, then dragged by the excited and enraged 
crowd to the University and to the Cordeliers Cemetery.His 
servant was also beaten and, with bruises on his head and body, was 
taken to the hospital where he died some days later.However, some 
strangers and unknown people mounted the ladder and cut the rope 
while others caught the hanged man from below after he had been 
hanging there longer than it took to say a full Miserere.The crowd 
then smashed the gallows and broke the executionerâ€™s ladder into 
pieces..
