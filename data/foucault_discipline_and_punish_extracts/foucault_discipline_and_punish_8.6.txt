Between the scaffold and the public, 
kept at a safe distance, two ranks of soldiers stood on guard, one 
facing the execution that was about to take place, the other facing 
the people in case of riot.Contact was broken: it was a public 
execution, but one in which the element of spectacle was neutralized, 
or rather reduced to abstract intimidation.Protected by force of 
arms, on an empty square, justice quietly did its work.If it showed 
the death that it had dealt, it was from high and far: ‘The two 
gallows, which were eighteen feet high, no doubt by way of an 
example, were not set up until three o’clock in the afternoon.From 
two o’clock, the Place de Gr^ve and all the surrounding streets had 
been filled with detachments of different troops, some on foot, some 
on horse; the Swiss and the French guards continued to patrol the 
adjacent streets.
