No one was allowed on to the Greve during the 
execution, and all around one could see a double row of soldiers, 
bayonets at the ready, standing back to back, so that some looked 
outwards and some into the square; the two wretches ... cried out 
all the way that they were innocent and continued to protest in like 
manner as they mounted the ladder’ (Hardy, III, 67).Whatever the 
part played by feelings of humanity for the condemned in the 
abandonment of the liturgy of the public executions, there was, in 
any case, on the part of the state power, a political fear of the effects 
of these ambiguous rituals.Such an equivocal attitude appeared clearly in what might be 
called the ‘gallows speeches’.The rite of execution was so arranged 
that the condemned man would himself proclaim his guilt by the 
amende honorable that he spoke, by the placard that he displayed 
and also by the statements that he was no doubt forced to make.Furthermore, at the moment of the execution, it seems that he was 
given another opportunity to speak, not to proclaim his innocence, 
but to acknowledge his crime and the justice of his conviction.
