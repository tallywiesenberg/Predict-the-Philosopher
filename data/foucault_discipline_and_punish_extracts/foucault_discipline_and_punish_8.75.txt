scaffold: ‘Fathers and mothers who hear me now, watch over your 
children and teach them well; in my childhood I was a liar and good- 
for-nothing; I began by stealing a small six-liard knife...Then I 
robbed pedlars and cattle dealers; finally, I led a robber band and 
that is why I am here.Tell all this to your children and let it be an 
example to them’ (Corre, 257).
