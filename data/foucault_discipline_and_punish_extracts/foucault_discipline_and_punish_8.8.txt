Such a speech is too close, even in its 
turn of phrase, to the morality traditionally to be found in the 
broadsheets and pamphlets for it not to be apocryphal.But the 
existence of the ‘last words of a condemned man’ genre is in itself 
significant.The law required that its victim should authenticate in 
some sense the tortures that he had undergone.The criminal was 
asked to consecrate his own punishment by proclaiming the black¬ 
ness of his crimes; he was made to say, as was Jean-Dominique 
Langlade, three times a murderen ‘Listen to my horrible, infamous 
and lamentable deed, committed in the city of Avignon, where the 
memory of me is execrable, for having inhumanly violated the 
sacred rites of friendship’ (Duhamel, 32).In one sense, the broad¬ 
sheet and the death song were the sequel to the trial; or rather they 
pursued that mechanism by which the public execution transferred 
the secret, written truth of the procedure to the body, gesture and 
speech of the criminal.
