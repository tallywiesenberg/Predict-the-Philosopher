Justice required these apocrypha in order to 
be grounded in truth.Its decisions were thus surrounded by all 
these posthumous ‘proofs’.Sometimes, too, accounts of crimes and 
infamous lives were published, simply as propaganda, before any 
trial had taken place, in order to force the hand of a court that was 
suspected of being too tolerant.In order to discredit smugglers, the 
Compagnie des Fermes published ‘bulletins’ recounting their 
crimes: in 1768, it distributed broadsheets against a certain Mon- 
tagne, the leader of a gang, of whom the writer himself says: ‘Some 
thefts have been ascribed to him the truth of which is somewhat 
uncertain ...; Montagne has been depicted as a wild beast, a second 
hyena to be hunted down; given the hotheads of the Auvergne, this 
idea has caught on’ (cf.Juillard, 24).
