The spectacle of the scaffold 


But the effect, like the use, of this literature was equivocal.The 
condemned man found himself transformed into a hero by the sheer 
extent of his widely advertised crimes, and sometimes the affirmation 
of his belated repentance.Against the law, against the rich, the 
powerful, the magistrates, the constabulary or the watch, against 
taxes and their collectors, he appeared to have waged a struggle 
with which one all too easily identified.The proclamation of these 
crimes blew up to epic proportions the tiny struggle that passed 
unperceived in everyday life.If the condemned man was shown to 
be repentant, accepting the verdict, asking both God and man for 
forgiveness for his crimes, it was as if he had come through some 
process of purification: he died, in his own way, like a saint.
