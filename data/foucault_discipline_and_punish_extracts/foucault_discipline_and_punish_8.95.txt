But 
indomitability was an alternative claim to greatness: by not giving 
in under torture, he gave proof of a strength that no power had 
succeeded in bending: ‘On the day of the execution - this will seem 
scarcely credible -1 showed no trace of emotion, as I performed my 
amende honorable^ and when I finally lay down on the cross I showed 
no fear’ (the Complainte of J.-D. Langlade, executed at Avignon 
12 April 1768).Black hero or reconciled criminal, defender of the 
true right or an indomitable force, the criminal of the broadsheets, 
pamphlets, almanacs and adventure stories brought with him, be¬ 
neath the apparent morality of the example not to be followed, a 
whole memory of struggles and confrontations.A convicted criminal 
could become after his death a sort of saint, his memory honoured 
and his grave respected.(This was the case of Tanguy, executed in 
Brittany about 1740.Before being convicted, it is true, he had begun 
a long penitence ordered by his confessor.
