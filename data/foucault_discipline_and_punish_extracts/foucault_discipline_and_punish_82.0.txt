The means of correct training 


make it possible to see induce effects of power, and in which, 
conversely, the means of coercion make those on whom they are 
applied clearly visible. Slowly, in the course of the classical age, we 
see the construction of those ‘observatories’ of human multiplicity 
for which the history of the sciences has so little good to say. Side 
by side with the major technology of the telescope, the lens and the 
light beam, which were an integral part of the new physics and cos¬ 
mology, there were the minor techniques of multiple and intersect¬ 
ing observations, of eyes that must see without being seen; using 
techniques of subjection and methods of exploitation, an obscure 
art of light and the visible was secretly preparing a new knowledge 
of man. 

These ‘observatories’ had an almost ideal model: the military 
camp - the short-lived, artificial city, built and reshaped almost at 
will; the seat of a power that must be all the stronger, but also all 
the more discreet, all the more effective and on the alert in that it is 
exercised over armed men. In the perfect camp, all power would be 
exercised solely through exact observation; each gaze would form a 
part of the overall functioning of power. The old, traditional square 
plan was considerably refined in innumerable new projects. The 
geometry of the paths, the number and distribution of the tents, 
the orientation of their entrances, the disposition of files and ranks 
were exactly defined; the network of gazes that supervised one 
another was laid down: ‘In the parade ground, five lines are drawn 
up, the first is sixteen feet from the second; the others are eight feet 
from one another; and the last is eight feet from the arms depots. 
The arms depots are ten feet from the tents of the junior officers, 
immediately opposite the first tentpole. A company street is fifty-one 
feet wide. . . All tents are two feet from one another. The tents of 
the subalterns are opposite the alleys of their companies. The rear 
tentpole is eight feet from the last soldiers’ tent and the gate is 
opposite the captains’ tent. . . The captains’ tents are erected 
opposite the streets of their companies. The entrance is opposite the 
companies themselves.’* The camp is the diagram of a power that 
acts by means of general visibility. For a long time this model of the 
camp or at least its underlying principle was found in urban develop¬ 
ment, in the construction of working-class housing estates, hospitals, 
asylums, prisons, schools: the spatial ‘nesting’ of hierarchized
