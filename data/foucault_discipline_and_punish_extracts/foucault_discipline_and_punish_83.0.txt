distributed along a corridor like a series of small cells; at regular 
intervals, an officer’s quarters were situated, so that ‘every ten pupils 
had an officer on each side’; the pupils were confined to their cells 
throughout the night; and Paris had insisted that ‘a window be 
placed on the corridor wall of each room from chest-level to within 
one or two feet of the ceiling. Not only is it pleasant to have such 
windows, but one would venture to say that it is useful, in several 
respects, not to mention the disciplinary reasons that may deter¬ 
mine this arrangement’ (quoted in Laulan, 117-18). In the dining¬ 
rooms was ‘a slightly raised platform for the tables of the inspectors 
of studies, so that they may see all the tables of the pupils of their 
divisions during meals’; latrines had been installed with half-doors, 
so that the supervisor on duty could see the head and legs of the 
pupils, and also with side walls sufficiently high ‘that those inside 
cannot see one another’.* This infinitely scrupulous concern with 
surveillance is expressed in the architecture by innumerable petty 
mechanisms. These mechanisms can only be seen as unimportant 
if one forgets the role of this instrumentation, minor but flawless, 
in the progressive objectification and the ever more subtle partition¬ 
ing of individual behaviour. The disciplinary institutions secreted 
a machinery of control that functioned like a microscope of conduct; 
the fine, analytical divisions that they created formed around men 
an apparatus of observation, recording and training. How was one 
to subdivide the gaze in these observation machines.^ How was one 
to establish a network of communications between themi* How was 
one so to arrange things that a homogeneous, continuous power 
would result from their calculated multiplicity.^ 

The perfect disciplinary apparatus would make it possible for a 
single gaze to see everything constantly. A central point would be 
both the source of light illuminating everything, and a locus of 
convergence for everything that must be known: a perfect eye that 
nothing would escape and a centre towards which all gazes would be 
turned. This is what Ledoux had imagined when he built Arc-et- 
Senans; all the buildings were to be arranged in a circle, opening on 
the inside, at the centre of which a high construction was to house 
the administrative functions of management, the policing functions 
of surveillance, the economic functions of control and checking, the 
religious functions of encouraging obedience and work; from here
