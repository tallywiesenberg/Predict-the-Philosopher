necessary with the multitude, treat them with severity or contempt; 
hence these workers either cost more or leave the factory soon after 
arrival’ {Encyclopidie, article on ‘Manufacture’). But, although the 
workers preferred a framework of a guild type to this new regime 
of surveillance, the employers saw that it was indissociable from the 
system of industrial production, private property and profit. At the 
scale of a factory, a great iron-works or a mine, ‘the objects of 
expenditure are so multiplied, that the slightest dishonesty on each 
object would add up to an immense fraud, which would not only 
absorb the profits, but would lead to a loss of capital... the slightest 
incompetence, if left unnoticed and therefore repeated each day, may 
prove fatal to the enterprise to the extent of destroying it in a very 
short time’; hence the fact that only agents, directly dependent on 
the owner, and entrusted with this task alone would be able to see 
‘that not a sou is spent uselessly, that not a moment of the day is 
lost’; their role would be ‘to supervise the workers, to inspect all the 
places of work, to inform the directors of everything that takes 
place’ (Cournol). Surveillance thus becomes a decisive economic 
operator both as an internal part of the production machinery and 
as a specific mechanism in the disciplinary power. ‘The work of 
directing, superintending and adjusting becomes one of the functions 
of capital, from the moment that the labour under the control of 
capital, becomes cooperative. Once a function of capital, it requires 
special characteristics’ (Marx, Capital, vol. i, 313). 

The same movement was to be found in the reorganization of 
elementary teaching: the details of surveillance were specified and 
it was integrated into the teaching relationship. The development 
of the parish schools, the increase in the number of their pupils, the 
absence of methods for regulating simultaneously the activity of a 
whole class, and the disorder and confusion that followed from this 
made it necessary to work out a system of supervision. In order to 
help the teacher, Batencour selected from among the best pupils a 
whole series of ‘officers’ - intendants, observers, monitors, tutors, 
reciters of prayers, writing officers, receivers of ink, almoners and 
visitors. The roles thus defined were of two kinds: the first involved 
material tasks (distributing ink and paper, giving alms to the poor.

veillance: the ‘observers must record who left his bench, who was 
talking, who did not have his rosary, or Book of Hours, who did not 
comport himself properly at mass, who committed an impure act,
