tus as a whole that produces ‘power’ and distributes individuals in 
this permanent and continuous field. This enables the disciplinary 
power to be both absolutely indiscreet, since it is everywhere and 
always alert, since by its very principle it leaves no zone of shade and 
constantly supervises the very individuals who are entrusted with 
the task of supervising; and absolutely ‘discreet’, for it functions 
permanently and largely in silence. Discipline makes possible the 
operation of a relational power that sustains itself by its own 
mechanism and which, for the spectacle of public events, substitutes 
the uninterrupted play of calculated gazes. Thanks to the techniques 
of surveillance, the ‘physics’ of power, the hold over the body, 
operate according to the laws of optics and mechanics, according 
to a whole play of spaces, lines, screens, beams, degrees and without 
recourse, in principle at least, to excess, force or violence. It is a 
power that seems all the less ‘corporal’ in that it is more subtly 
‘physical’. 


Normalising judgement 

I. At the orphanage of the Chevalier Paulet, the sessions of the 
tribunal that met each morning gave rise to a whole ceremonial: 
‘We found all the pupils drawn up as if for battle, in perfect align¬ 
ment, immobility and silence. The major, a young gentleman of 
sixteen years, stood outside the ranks, sword in hand; at his com¬ 
mand, the troop broke ranks at the double and formed a circle. The 
council met in the centre; each officer made a report of his troop 
for the preceding twenty-four hours. The accused were allowed to 
defend themselves; witnesses were heard; the council deliberated 
and, when agreement was reached, the major announced the number 
of guilty, the nature of the offences and the punishments ordered. 
The troop then marched off in the greatest order’ (Pictet). At the 
heart of all disciplinary systems functions a small penal mechanism.

Discipline 


It enjoys a kind of judicial privilege with its own laws, its specific 
offences, its particular forms of judgement. The disciplines estab¬ 
lished an ‘infra-penality’; they partitioned an area that the laws had 
left empty; they defined and repressed a mass of behaviour that the 
relative indifference of the great systems of punishment had allowed 
to escape. ‘On entering, the companions will greet one another ... 
on leaving, they must lock up the materials and tools that they have
