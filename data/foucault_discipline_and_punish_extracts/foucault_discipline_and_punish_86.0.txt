day; either he will be forced to hear it standing or kneeling, his 
hands joined, or he will be given some other penance’. 

The order that the disciplinary punishments must enforce is of a 
mixed nature; it is an ‘artificial’ order, explicitly laid down by a law, 
a programme, a set of regulations. But it is also an order defined by 
natural and observable processes: the duration of an apprenticeship, 
the time taken to perform an exercise, the level of aptitude refer to 
a regularity that is also a rule. The children of the Christian Schools 
must never be placed in a ‘lesson’ of which they are not yet capable, 
for this would expose them to the danger of being unable to learn 
anything; yet the duration of each stage is fixed by regulation and a 
pupil who at the end of three examinations has been unable to pass 
into the higher order must be placed, well in evidence, on the bench 
of the ‘ignorant’. In a disciplinary regime punishment involves a 
double juridico-natural reference. 

3. Disciplinary punishment has the function of reducing gaps. 
It must therefore be essentially corrective. In addition to punish¬ 
ments borrowed directly from the judicial model (fines, flogging, 
solitary confinement), the disciplinary systems favour punishments 
that are exercise - intensified, multiplied forms of training, several 
times repeated: the regulations of 1766 for the infantry laid down 
that lance-corporals ‘who show some negligence or lack of willing¬ 
ness will be reduced to the rank of private’, and they will be able 
to rise to their former rank only after new exercises and a new 
examination. As Jean-Baptiste de La Salle put it: ‘Of all penances, 
impositions are the most honest for a teacher, the most advantageous 
for the parents’; they make it possible to ‘derive, from the very 
offences of the children, means of advancing their progress by 
correcting their defects’; to those, for example, ‘who have not written 
all that they were supposed to write or who have not applied

themselves to doing it well, one can give some impositions to write 
out or to learn by heart’ (La Salle, Conduite . .., 205). Disciplinary 
punishment is, in the main, isomorphic with obligation itself; it is 
not so much the vengeance of an outraged law as its repetition, its 
reduplicated insistence. So much so that the corrective effect expec¬ 
ted of it involves only incidentally expiation and repentance; it is 
obtained directly through the mechanics of a training. To punish 
is to exercise.
