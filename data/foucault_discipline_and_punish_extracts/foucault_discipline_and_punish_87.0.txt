operates a differentiation that is not one of acts, but of individuals 
themselves, of their nature, their potentialities, their level or their 
value. By assessing acts with precision, discipline judges individuals 
‘in truth’; the penality that it implements is integrated into the cycle 
of knowledge of individuals. 

5. The distribution according to ranks or grade has a double role: 
it marks the gaps, hierarchizes qualities, skills and aptitudes; but it 
also punishes and rewards. It is the penal functioning of setting in 
order and the ordinal character of judging. Discipline rewards 
simply by the play of awards, thus making it possible to attain 
higher ranks and places; it punishes by reversing this process. Rank 
in itself serves as a reward or punishment. At the ficole Militaire, a 
complex system of ‘honorary’ classification was developed; this 
classification was visible to all in the form of slight variations in 
uniform and more or less noble or ignoble punishments were 
associated, as a mark of privilege or infamy, with the ranks thus 
distributed. This classificatory, penal distribution was carried out 
at short intervals by the reports that the officers, teachers and their 
assistants made, without consideration of age or grade, on ‘the 
moral qualities of the pupils’ and on ‘their universally recognized 
behaviour’. The first class, known as the ‘very good’, were dis¬ 
tinguished by a silver epaulette; they enjoyed the honour of being 
treated as ‘purely military troops’; they therefore had a right to 
military punishment (arrests and, in serious cases, imprisonment). 
The second class, ‘the good’, wore an epaulette of red silk and silver; 
they could be arrested and condemned to prison, but also to the cage 
and to kneeling. The class of'midiocres', had the right to an epaulette 
of red wool; to the preceding penalties was added, if necessary, the 
wearing of sackcloth. The last class, that of the ‘bad’, was marked by

an epaulette of brown wool; ‘the pupils of this class will be subjected 
to all the punishments used in the Hotel or all those that are thought 
necessary, even solitary confinement in a dark dungeon’. To this 
was added, for a time, the ‘shameful’ class, for which special regula¬ 
tions were drawn up ‘so that those who belonged to it would always 
be separated from the others and would be dressed in sackcloth’. 
Since merit and behaviour alone must decide the place of the pupil, 
‘those of the last two classes would be able to flatter themselves that 
they would be able to rise to the first two and bear its marks, when, 
by universal agreement, they will be recognized as having made 
themselves worthy of it by the change in their conduct and by their 
progress; and those of the top classes will similarly descend into the 
others if they become slack and if the various reports taken together
