of the examination, implement, within a single mechanism, power 
relations that make it possible to extract and constitute knowledge.^ 
It is not simply at the level of consciousness, of representations and 
in what one thinks one knows, but at the level of what makes possible 
the knowledge that is transformed into political investment. 

One of the essential conditions for the epistemological ‘thaw’ of 
medicine at the end of the eighteenth century was the organization 
of the hospital as an ‘examining’ apparatus. The ritual of the visit 
was its most obvious form. In the seventeenth century, the physi¬ 
cian, coming from the outside, added his inspection to many other 
controls - religious, administrative, etc.; he hardly participated in 
the everyday administration of the hospital. Gradually, the visit 
became more regular, more rigorous, above all more extended: it 
became an ever more important part of the functioning of the 
hospital. In i66i, the physician of the Hotel-Dieu of Paris was 
called upon to make a daily visit; in 1687, an ‘expectant’ physician 
was to examine, in the afternoon, certain seriously sick patients. 
The eighteenth-century regulations laid down the hours of the visit 
and its duration (at least two hours); they insisted on a rotation of 
physicians, which would guarantee visits every day ‘even on Easter 
Sunday’; at last, in 1771, a resident physician was appointed, charged 
with ‘providing all the services of his state, at night as well as in the

day, in the intervals between visits by an outside physician’ (Registre 
des deliberations du bureau de VHotel-Dieii). The old form of inspec¬ 
tion, irregular and rapid, was transformed into a regular observation 
that placed the patient in a situation of almost perpetual examina¬ 
tion. This had two consequences: in the internal hierarchy, the 
physician, hitherto an external element, begins to gain over the 
religious staff and to relegate them to a clearly specified, but subor¬ 
dinate role in the technique of the examination; the category of the 
‘nurse’ then appears; while the hospital itself, which was once little 
more than a poorhouse, was to become a place of training and of 
the correlation of knowledge; it represented a reversal therefore of 
the power relations and the constitution of a corpus of knowledge. 
The ‘well-disciplined’ hospital became the physical counterpart of 
the medical ‘discipline’; this discipline could now abandon its textual 
character and take its references not so much from the tradition of 
author-authorities as from a domain of objects perpetually offered 
for examination.
