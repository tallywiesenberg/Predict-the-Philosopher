Was this a conflict 
between civil justice and religious penitence.^ Cf.Corre, 21.)The 
criminal has been almost entirely transformed into a positive hero.There were those for whom glory and abomination were not dis¬ 
sociated, but coexisted in a reversible figure.Perhaps we should see 
this literature of crime, which proliferated around a few exemplary 
figures,® neither as a spontaneous form of ‘popular expression’, nor 
as a concerted programme of propaganda and moralization from 
above; it was a locus in which two investments of penal practice 
met - a sort of battleground around the crime, its punishment and 
its memory.
