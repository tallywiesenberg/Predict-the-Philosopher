ideological control - the printing and the distribution of these 
almanacs, broadsheets, etc.was in principle subject to strict control.But if these true stories of everyday history were received so avidly, 
if they formed part of the basic reading of the lower classes, it was 
because people found in them not only memories, but also prece¬ 
dents; the interest of‘curiosity’ is also a political interest.Thus these 
texts may be read as two-sided discourses, in the facts that they 
relate, in the effects they give to these facts and in the glory they 
confer on those ‘illustrious’ criminals, and no doubt in the very 
words they use (one should study the use of such categories as 
‘misfortune’ or ‘abomination’ or such epithets as ‘famous’ or 
‘lamentable’ in accounts such as The History of the Life, Great 
Robberies and Tricks of Guilleri and his Companions and of their 
Lamentable and Unhappy End.^ 

Perhaps we should compare this literature with the ‘disturbances 
around the scaffold’ in which, through the tortured body of the 
criminal, the power that condemned confronted the people that was 
the witness, the participant, the possible and indirect victim of this 
execution.In the wake of a ceremony that inadequately channelled 
the power relations it sought to ritualize, a whole mass of discourses 
appeared pursuing the same confrontation; the posthumous pro¬ 
clamation of the crimes justified justice, but also glorified the cri^ 
minal.
