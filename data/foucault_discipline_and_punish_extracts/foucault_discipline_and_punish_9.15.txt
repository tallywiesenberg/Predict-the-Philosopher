While, from 
Gaboriau onwards, the literature of crime follows this first shift: by 
his cunning, his tricks, his sharp-wittedness, the criminal represented 
in this literature has made himself impervious to suspicion; and the 
struggle between two pure minds - the murderer and the detective - 
will constitute the essential form of the confrontation.We are far 
removed indeed from those accounts of the life and misdeeds of the 
criminal in which he admitted his crimes, and which recounted in 
detail the tortures of his execution: we have moved from the 
exposition of the facts or the confession to the slow process of 
discovery; from the execution to the investigation; from the phyÂ¬ 
sical confrontation to the intellectual struggle between criminal and 
investigator.It was not only the broadsheets that disappeared with 
the birth of a literature of crime; the glory of the rustic malefactor 
and his sombre transformation into a hero by the process of torture 
and execution went with them.The man of the people was now 
too simple to be the protagonist of subtle truths.In this new genre, 
there were no more popular heroes or great executions; the criminal 
was wicked, of course, but he was also intelligent; and although he 
was punished, he did not have to suffer.
