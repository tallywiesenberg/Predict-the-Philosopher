The literature of crime 
transposes to another social class the spectacle that had surrounded 
the criminal.Meanwhile the newspapers took over the task of 
recounting the grey, unheroic details of everyday crime and punish¬ 
ment.The split was complete; the people was robbed of its old 
pride in its crimes; the great murders had become the quiet game of 
the well behaved.69

Punishment 






I. Generalized punishment 


‘Let penalties be regulated and proportioned to the offences, let the 
death sentence be passed only on those convicted of murder, and 
let the tortures that revolt humanity be abolished.’ Thus, in 1789, 
the chancellery summed up the general position of the petitions 
addressed to the authorities concerning tortures and executions (cf.Seligman, and Desjardin, 13-20).
