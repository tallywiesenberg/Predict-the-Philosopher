Protests against the public execu¬ 
tions proliferated in the second half of the eighteenth century: among 
the philosophers and theoreticians of the law; among lawyers and 
parlementaires; in popular petitions and among the legislators of the 
assemblies.Another form of punishment was needed; the physical 
confrontation between the sovereign and the condemned man must 
end; this hand-to-hand fight between the vengeance of the prince and 
the contained anger of the people, through the mediation of the victim 
and the executioner, must be concluded.Very soon the public execu¬ 
tion became intolerable.On the side of power, where it betrayed 
tyranny, excess, the thirst for revenge, and ‘the cruel pleasure taken 
in punishing’ (Petion de Villeneuve, 641), it was revolting.On the 
side of the victim who, though reduced to despair, was still expected 
to bless ‘heaven and its judges who appeared to have abandoned 
him’ (Boucher d’Argis, 1781, 125), it was shameful.
