It was, in any 
case, dangerous, in that it provided a support for a confrontation 
between the violence of the king and the violence of the people.It 
was as if the sovereign power did not see, in this emulation of 
atrocity, a challenge that it itself threw down and which might one 
day be taken up: accustomed as it was to ‘seeing blood flow’, the 
people soon learnt that ‘it could be revenged only with blood’ 
(Lachere).In these ceremonies, which were the object of so much 
adverse investment, one sees the intersection of the excess of armed 
justice and the anger of the threatened people.Joseph de Maistre

Punishment 


was to recognize in this relation one of the fundamental mechanisms 
of absolute power: the executioner acts as a cog between the prince 
and the people; the death he deals is like that of the serfs who built 
St Petersburg over swamp and pestilence: it is a principle of uni¬ 
versality; of the individual will of the despot, it makes a law for all, 
and of each of those destroyed bodies, a stone for the State; it hardly 
matters that innocents, too, are struck down!In this same dangerous 
and ritual violence, the eighteenth-century reformers denounced, on 
the contrary, that which exceeded, on both sides, the legitimate 
exercise of power: in this violence, according to them, tyranny 
confronts rebellion; each calls forth the other.
