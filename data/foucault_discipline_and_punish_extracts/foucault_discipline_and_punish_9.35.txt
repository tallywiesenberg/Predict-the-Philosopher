It is a double danger.Instead of taking revenge, criminal justice should simply punish.This need for punishment without torture was first formulated 
as a cry from the heart or from an outraged nature.In the worst of 
murderers, there is one thing, at least, to be respected when one 
punishes: his ‘humanity’.The day was to come, in the nineteenth 
century, when this ‘man’, discovered in the criminal, would become 
the target of penal intervention, the object that it claimed to correct 
and transform, the domain of a whole series of ‘criminological’ 
sciences and strange ‘penitentiary’ practices.
