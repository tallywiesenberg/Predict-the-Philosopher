There is, therefore, a problem here: how was this man-measure 
opposed to the traditional practice of punishment.^ How did he 
become the great moral justification of the reform movement.^ Why 
this universal horror of torture and such lyrical insistence that 
punishment be ‘humane’’' Or, which amounts to the same thing, 
how are the two elements, which are everywhere present in demands 
for a more lenient penal system, ‘measure’ and ‘humanity’, to be

definitive meaning being given to this principle, which nevertheless 
is regarded as insuperable.We must, therefore, recount the birth 
and early days of this enigmatic ‘leniency’.Homage is paid to the ‘great reformers’ - Beccaria, Servan, 
Dupaty, Lacretelle, Duport, Pastoret, Target, Bergasse, the com¬ 
pilers of the Cahiers, or petitions, and the Constituent Assembly - 
for having imposed this leniency on a legal machinery and on 
‘classical’ theoreticians who, at the end of the eighteenth century, 
were still rejecting it with well-formulated arguments.(Cf., in par¬ 
ticular, Muyart de Vouglans’s polemic against Beccaria - Muyart, 
1766.)
