Yet this reform must be situated in a process that historians have 
recently uncovered through the study of legal archives: the relaxa¬ 
tion of penality in the eighteenth century or, to be more precise, 
the double movement by which, during this period, crimes seemed 
to lose their violence, while punishments, reciprocally, lost some of 
their intensity, but at the cost of greater intervention.From the end 
of the seventeenth century, in fact, one observes a considerable 
diminution in murders and, generally speaking, in physical acts of 
aggression; offences against property seem to take over from crimes 
of violence; theft and swindling, from murder and assault; the 
diffuse, occasional, but frequent delinquency of the poorest classes 
was superseded by a limited, but ‘skilled’ delinquency; the criminals 
of the seventeenth century were ‘harassed men, ill-fed, quick to act, 
quick to anger, seasonal criminals’; those of the eighteenth, ‘crafty, 
cunning, sly, calculating’ criminals on the fringes of society (Chaunu, 
1962, 236 and 1966, 107-8).Lastly, the internal organizations of 
delinquency altered; the great gangs of malefactors (looters working 
in small, armed units, groups of smugglers firing on the agents of the 
tax authorities, disbanded soldiers or deserters who roamed the 
countryside together) tended to break up; tracked down more 
efficiently and forced to work in smaller groups - often no more 
than half-a-dozen men - in order to pass undetected, they contented

themselves with more furtive operations, with a more modest 
deployment of forces and less risk of bloodshed; ‘The physical 
destruction or institutional dislocation of large gangs ... left the 
field free for an anti-property form of delinquency practised by 
individuals or very small groups of robbers and pickpockets, seldom 
more than four in number’ (Le Roy-Ladurie).A general movement 
shifted criminality from the attack of bodies to the more or less 
direct seizure of goods; and from a ‘mass criminality’ to a ‘marginal 
criminality’, partly the preserve of professionals.It was as if there 
had been a gradual lowering of level - ‘a defusion of the tensions 
that dominate human relations, — a better control of violent 
impulses’^ - and as if the illegal practices had themselves slackened 
their hold on the body and turned to other targets.
