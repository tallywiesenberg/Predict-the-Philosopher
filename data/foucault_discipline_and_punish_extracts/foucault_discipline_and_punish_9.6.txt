They are, quite 
literally, enemy troops spreading over the surface of the territory, 
living as they wish, as in a conquered country, exacting levies under 
the name of alms.’ They cost the poorest peasants more than taxes: 
the richer peasants had to pay anything up to a third of their 
incomes (Le Trosne, 1764,4).Most observers maintained that crime 
was increasing - they included, of course, those who advocated 
sterner measures; they also included those who thought that a law 
that was more restrained in its use of violence would be more 
effective, less liable to retreat before its own consequences (cf., for 
example, Dupaty, 247); and they included the magistrates who 
claimed to be swamped by the number of trials: ‘the misery of the 
people and the corruption of morals have increased the number of 
crimes and convicted criminals’ (one of the judges of the Chambre 
de la Toumelle in an address to the king, 2 August 1768, quoted 
in Farge, 66); in any case, that crime was on the increase was shown 
by the real practice of the courts.‘The revolutionary and imperial 
era could already be sensed in the last years of the Ancien Regime.One is struck, in the trials of 1782-9, by the increase in tension.There is a new severity towards the poor, a concerted rejection of 
evidence, a rise in mutual mistrust, hatred and fear’ (Chaunu, 1966, 
108).
