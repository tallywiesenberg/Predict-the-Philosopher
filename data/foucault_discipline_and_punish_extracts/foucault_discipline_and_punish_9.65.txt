In fact, the shift from a criminality of blood to a criminality of 
fraud forms part of a whole complex mechanism, embracing the 
development of production, the increase of wealth, a higher juridical 
and moral value placed on property relations, stricter methods of 
surveillance, a tighter partitioning of the population, more efficient 
techniques of locating and obtaining information: the shift in illegal 
practices is correlative with an extension and a refinement of puni¬ 
tive practices.Was this a general change of attitude, a ‘change that belongs to 
the domain of the spirit and the subconscious’ (the expression is 
Mogensen’s).^ Perhaps, but more certainly and more immediatel} 
it was an effort to adjust the mechanisms of power that frame th< 
everyday lives of individuals; an adaptation and a refinement of thf 
machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under Surveil¬

apparently unimportant gestures; another policy for that multiplicity

ing no doubt was not so much a new respect for the humanity of 
the condemned - torture was still frequent in the execution of even 
minor criminals - as a tendency towards a more finely tuned justice, 
towards a closer penal mapping of the social body.Following a 
circular process, the threshold of the passage to violent crimes rises, 
intolerance to economic offences increases, controls become more 
thorough, penal interventions at once more premature and more 
numerous.If one compares this process with the critical discourse of the 
reformers, a remarkable strategic coincidence emerges.
