What they 
were attacking in traditional justice, before they set out the prin¬ 
ciples of a new penality, was certainly the excessive nature of the 
punishments; but an excess that was bound up with an irregularity 
even more than with an abuse of the power to punish.On 24 March 
1790, Thouret opened the debate in the Constituent Assembly on 
the new organization of the judicial power.In his view, this power 
had become ‘denatured’ in France in three ways.By private appro¬ 
priation: the offices of judge were sold; they were hereditary; they 
had a commercial value and, for that reason, the justice that was 
handed out was onerous.By a confusion between two types of 
power: that which dispenses justice and formulates a sentence by 
applying the law and that which creates the law itself.
