Lastly, by the 
existence of a whole series of privileges that made the implementa¬ 
tion of the law inconsistent: there were courts, procedures, litigants, 
even offences that were ‘privileged’ and fell outside common law 
{Archives parlementaires, XII, 344).This was only one of the many 
criticisms that had been levied at the legal system for the past fifty 
years at least, all of which denounced in this denaturation the 
principle of an irregular justice.Penal justice was irregular first of 
all by virtue of the multiplicity of courts responsible for assuring it, 
without ever forming a single and continuous pyramid (cf.Linguet 
or Boucher d’Argis, 1789).Quite apart from the ecclesiastical juris¬ 
dictions, we must take into account the discontinuities, overlappings 
and conflicts between the different legal systems: those of the 
nobility, which still played an important role in judging petty 
offences; those of the king, which were themselves numerous and 
badly coordinated (the sovereign courts were often in conflict with

the bailiffs’ courts and above all with the presidial courts, which had 
recently been created as intermediary instances); those which, de jure 
or de facto, were administered by governmental authorities (such as 
the intendants, or provincial administrators) or police authorities 
(such as the provosts and police magistrates); to these should also 
be added the right possessed by the king or his representatives to 
take decisions on internment or exile quite outside any regular 
procedure.
