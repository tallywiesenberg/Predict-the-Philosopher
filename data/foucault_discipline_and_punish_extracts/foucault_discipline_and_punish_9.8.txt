By their very plethora these innumerable authorities 
cancelled each other out and were incapable of covering the social 
body in its entirety.Paradoxically, their overlapping left penal 
justice with innumerable loopholes.This incompleteness was a result 
of differences of custom and procedure, despite the Ordonnance 
Generale of 1670; of internal conflicts of responsibility; of private 
interests - political or economic - which each authority found itself 
defending; and, lastly, of the interventions of the royal power, which 
could prevent, by means of pardons, commuted sentences, the evo¬ 
cation of a case before the royal council or direct pressure exerted 
on magistrates, the regular, austere course of justice.The criticism of the reformers was directed not so much at the 
weakness or cruelty of those in authority, as at a bad economy of 
power.There was too much power in the lower jurisdictions, which 
could — aided by the ignorance and poverty of those convicted - 
ignore appeal procedure and carry out arbitrary sentences without 
adequate supervision; there was too much power on the side of the 
prosecution, which possessed almost unlimited means of pursuing 
its investigations, while the accused opposed it virtually unarmed - 
this led judges to be sometimes over-severe and sometimes, by way 
of reaction, too lenient; there was too much power in the hands of 
the judges who were able to content themselves with futile evidence, 
providing it was ‘legal’ evidence, and who were allowed too great 
a freedom in the choice of penalty; there was too much power in 
the hands of the ‘gens du roi\ or royal magistrates, in relation to the 
accused, but also in relation to other magistrates; lastly, there was 
too much power exercised by the king, who could suspend courts 
of justice, alter their decisions, remove magistrates from office, or 
exile them, and replace them by judges acting under royal com¬ 
mission.
