It was because he exercised too 
close a power over his ‘gens' and conferred on them almost dis¬ 
cretionary powers that he intensified the conflicts within the magis- 
trature.It was because he had brought the law into conflict with too 
many summary acts of justice (the jurisdictions of the provosts or 
police magistrates) or with administrative measures, that he para¬ 
lysed normal justice, rendered it sometimes lenient and inconsistent, 
but sometimes over-hasty and severe.® 

It was not so much, or not only, the privileges of justice, its 
arbitrariness, its archaic arrogance, its uncontrolled rights that were 
criticized; but rather the mixture of its weaknesses and excesses, its 
exaggerations and its loopholes, and above all the very principle of 
this mixture, the ‘super-power’ of the monarch.The true objective 
of the reform movement, even in its most general formulations, was 
not so much to establish a new right to punish based on more 
equitable principles, as to set up a new ‘economy’ of the power to 
punish, to assure its better distribution, so that it should be neither 
too concentrated at certain privileged points, nor too divided be¬

homogeneous circuits capable of operating everywhere, in a con¬ 
tinuous way, down to the finest grain of the social body.* The 
reform of criminal law must be read as a strategy for the rearrange¬ 
ment of the power to punish, according to modalities that render 
it more regular, more effective, more constant and more detailed in 
its effects; in short, which increase its effects while diminishing its

property, of buying and selling, of corruption in obtaining not only 
offices, but the decisions themselves) and its political cost (by dis¬ 
sociating it from the arbitrariness of monarchical power).The new 
juridical theory of penality corresponds in fact to a new ‘political 
economy’ of the power to punish.
