This explains why the ‘reform’ 
did not have a single origin.It was not the more enlightened mem¬ 
bers of the public, nor the philosophes, who regarded themselves as 
enemies of despotism and friends of mankind; it was not even the 
social groups opposed to the parlementaires who instigated the 
reform.Or rather it was not they alone; in this same overall project 
of a new distribution of the power to punish, and of a new distribu¬ 
tion of its effects, many different interests came together.The reform 
was not prepared outside the legal machinery and against all its 
representatives; it was prepared, for the most part, from within, by 
a large number of magistrates and on the basis of shared objectives 
and the power conflicts that divided them.Certainly the reformers 
did not form a majority of the magistrates; but it was a body of 
lawyers who outlined its general principles: a power to judge that 
would not be affected by the immediate exercise of the prince’s 
sovereignty; that would be relieved of any claim to legislate; that 
would be detached from property relations; and which, having no 
other functions but to judge, would exercise that power to the full.
