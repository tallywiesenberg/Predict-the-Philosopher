principle of its force in the movement by which it deployed that 
force. Those on whom it was exercised could remain in the shade; 
they received light only from that portion of power that was 
conceded to them, or from the reflection of it that for a moment they 
carried. Disciplinary power, on the other hand, is exercised through 
its invisibility; at the same time it imposes on those whom it subjects 
a principle of compulsory visibility. In discipline, it is the subjects 
who have to be seen. Their visibility assures the hold of the power 
that is exercised over them. It is the fact of being constantly seen, 
of being able always to be seen, that maintains the disciplined 
individual in his subjection. And the examination is the technique 
by which power, instead of emitting the signs of its potency, instead 
of imposing its mark on its subjects, holds them in a mechanism of 
objectification. In this space of domination, disciplinary power 
manifests its potency, essentially, by arranging objects. The 
examination is, as it were, the ceremony of this objectification. 

Hitherto the role of the political ceremony had been to give rise 
to the excessive, yet regulated manifestation of power; it was a 
spectacular expression of potency, an ‘expenditure’, exaggerated and

coded, in which power renewed its vigour. It was always more or 
less related to the triumph. The solemn appearance of the sovereign 
brought with it something of the consecration, the coronation, the 
return from victory; even the funeral ceremony took place with all 
the spectacle of power deployed. Discipline, however, had its own 
type of ceremony. It was not the triumph, but the review, the 
‘parade’, an ostentatious form of the examination. In it the ‘subjects’ 
were presented as ‘objects’ to the observation of a power that was 
manifested only by its gaze. They did not receive directly the image 
of the sovereign power; they only felt its effects - in replica, as it 
were - on their bodies, which had become precisely legible and 
docile. On 15 March 1666, Louis XIV took his first military review: 
18,000 men, ‘one of the most sjjectacular actions of the reign’, which 
was supposed to have ‘kept all Europe in disquiet’. Several years 
later, a medal was struck to commemorate the event (cf. Jucquiot, 
50-54). It bears the exergue, ‘Disciplina militaris restitua and the 
legend ‘Prolusio ad victorias'. On the right, the king, right foot 
forward, commands the exercise itself with a stick. On the left, 
several ranks of soldiers are shown full face and aligned in depth; 
they have raised their right arms to shoulder height and are holding 
their rifles exactly vertical, their right legs are slightly forward and 
their left feet turned outwards. On the ground, lines intersect at 
right angles, to form, beneath the soldiers’ feet, broad rectangles
