the effectiveness of treatments, map similar cases and the beginnings 
of epidemics. It was the problem of the teaching establishments, 
where one had to define the aptitude of each individual, situate his 
level and his abilities, indicate the possible use that might be made 
of them: ‘The register enables one, by being available in time and 
place, to know the habits of the children, their progress in piety, 
in catechism, in the letters, during the time they have been at the 
School’ (M.I.D.B., 64). 

Hence the formation of a whole series of codes of disciplinary 
individuality that made it possible to transcribe, by means of homo¬ 
genization the individual features established by the examination:

Discipline 


the physical code of signalling, the medical code of symptoms, the 
educational or military code of conduct or performance. These 
codes were still very crude, both in quality and quantity, but they 
marked a first stage in the ‘formalization’ of the individual within 
power relations. 

The other innovations of disciplinary writing concerned the 
correlation of these elements, the accumulation of documents, their 
seriation, the organization of comparative fields making it possible 
to classify, to form categories, to determine averages, to fix norms. 
The hospitals of the eighteenth century, in particular, were great 
laboratories for scriptuary and documentary methods. The keeping 
of registers, their specification, the modes of transcription from one 
to the other, their circulation during visits, their comparison during 
regular meetings of doctors and administrators, the transmission of 
their data to centralizing bodies (either at the hospital or at the 
central office of the poorhouses), the accountancy of diseases, cures, 
deaths, at the level of a hospital, a town and even of the nation as a 
whole formed an integral part of the process by which hospitals 
were subjected to the disciplinary regime. Among the fundamental 
conditions of a good medical ‘discipline’, in both senses of the word, 
one must include the procedures of writing that made it possible to 
integrate individual data into cumulative systems in such a way that 
they were not lost; so to arrange things that an individual could be 
located in the general register and that, conversely, each datum of 
the individual examination might affect overall calculations. 

Thanks to the whole apparatus of writing that accompanied it, the
