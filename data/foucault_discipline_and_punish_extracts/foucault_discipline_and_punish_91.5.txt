examination opened up two correlative possibilities; firstly, the 
constitution of the individual as a describable, analysable object, not 
in order to reduce him to ‘specific’ features, as did the naturalists in 
relation to living beings, but in order to maintain him in his indivi¬ 
dual features, in his particular evolution, in his own aptitudes or 
abilities, under the gaze of a permanent corpus of knowledge; and, 
secondly, the constitution of a comparative system that made 
possible the measurement of overall phenomena, the description of 
groups, the characterization of collective facts, the calculation of the 
gaps between individuals, their distribution in a given ‘population’. 

These small techniques of notation, of registration, of constituting 
files, of arranging facts in columns and tables that are so familiar

The means of correct training 


to us now, were of decisive importance in the epistemological ‘thaw’ 
of the sciences of the individual. One is no doubt right to pose the 
Aristotelean problem: is a science of the individual possible and 
legitimate.^ A great problem needs great solutions perhaps. But 
there is the small historical problem of the emergence, towards the 
end of the eighteenth century, of what might generally be termed 
the ‘clinical’ sciences; the problem of the entry of the individual (and > 

no longer the species) into the field of knowledge; the problem of 
the entry of the individual description, of the cross-examination, of 
anamnesis, of the ‘file’ into the general functioning of scientific dis¬ 
course. To this simple question of fact, one must no doubt give an 
answer lacking in ‘nobility’: one should look into these procedures 
of writing and registration, one should look into the mechanisms of 
examination, into the formation of the mechanisms of discipline, and 
of a new type of power over bodies. Is this the birth of the sciences 
of man.^ It is probably to be found in these ‘ignoble’ archives, where 
the modern play of coercion over bodies, gestures and behaviour 
has its beginnings. 

3. The examination, surrounded by all its documentary techniques, 
makes each individual a 'case': a case which at one and the same time 
constitutes an object for a branch of knowledge and a hold for a 
branch of power. The case is no longer, as in casuistry or juris¬ 
prudence, a set of circumstances defining an act and capable of 
modifying the application of a rule; it is the individual as he may be 
described, judged, measured, compared with others, in his very
