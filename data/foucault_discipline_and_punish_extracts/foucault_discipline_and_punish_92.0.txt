individuality; and it is also the individual who has to be trained or 
corrected, classified, normalized, excluded, etc. 

For a long time ordinary individuality - the everyday individual¬ 
ity of everybody - remained below the threshold of description. 

To be looked at, observed, described in detail, followed from day 
to day by an uninterrupted writing was a privilege. The chronicle of 
a man, the account of his life, his historiography, written as he lived 
out his life formed part of the rituals of his power. The disciplinary 
methods reversed this relation, lowered the threshold of describable 
individuality and made of this description a means of control and a 
method of domination. It is no longer a monument for future 
memory, but a document for possible use. And this new describ- 
ability is all the more marked in that the disciplinary framework is

Discipline 


a strict one: the child, the patient, the madman, the prisoner, were 
to become, with increasing ease from the eighteenth century and 
according to a curve which is that of the mechanisms of discipline, 
the object of individual descriptions and biographical accounts. 
This turning of real lives into writing is no longer a procedure of 
heroization; it functions as a procedure of objectification and sub¬ 
jection. The carefully collated life of mental patients or delinquents 
belongs, as did the chronicle of kings or the adventures of the great 
popular bandits, to a certain political function of writing; but in a 
quite different technique of power. 

The examination as the fixing, at once ritual and ‘scientific’, of 
individual differences, as the pinning down of each individual in his 
own particularity (in contrast with the ceremony in which status, 
birth, privilege, function are manifested with all the spectacle of 
their marks) clearly indicates the appearance of a new modality of 
power in which each individual receives as his status his own indivi¬ 
duality, and in which he is linked by his status to the features, the 
measurements, the gaps, the ‘marks’ that characterize him and make 
him a ‘case’. 

Finally, the examination is at the centre of the procedures that 
constitute the individual as effect and object of power, as effect and 
object of knowledge. It is the examination which, by combining 
hierarchical surveillance and normalizing judgement, assures the 
great disciplinary functions of distribution and classification, maxi¬
