when the normal took over from the ancestral, and measurement 
from status, thus substituting for the individuality of the memorable 
man that of the calculable man, that moment when the sciences of 
man became possible is the moment when a new technology of 
power and a new political anatomy of the body were implemented. 
And if from the early Middle Ages to the present day the ‘adventure’ 
is an account of individuality, the passage from the epic to the 
novel, from the noble deed to the secret singularity, from long 
exiles to the internal search for childhood, from combats to phan¬ 
tasies, it is also inscribed in the formation of a disciplinary society. 
The adventure of our childhood no longer finds expression in ‘le

of the Rose is written today by Mary Barnes; in the place of Lancelot, 
we have Judge Schreber. 

It is often said that the model of a society that has individuals 
as its constituent elements is borrowed from the abstract juridical 
forms of contract and exchange. Mercantile society, according to 
this view, is represented as a contractual association of isolated 
juridical subjects. Perhaps. Indeed, the political theory of the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries often seems to follow this 
schema. But it should not be forgotten that there existed at the same 
period a technique for constituting individuals as correlative ele¬ 
ments of power and knowledge. The individual is no doubt the 
fictitious atom of an ‘ideological’ representation of society; but he is 
also a reality fabricated by this specific technology of power that I 
have called ‘discipline’. We must cease once and for all to describe 
the effects of power in negative terms: it ‘excludes’, it ‘represses’, 
it ‘censors’, it ‘abstracts’, it ‘masks’, it ‘conceals’. In fact, power 
produces; it produces reality; it produces domains of objects and 
rituals of truth. The individual and the knowledge that may be 
gained of him belong to this production. 

Is it not somewhat excessive to derive such power from the petty 
machinations of discipline.^ How could they achieve effects of such 
scope.^
