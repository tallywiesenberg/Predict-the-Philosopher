theft and extortion’. At each of the town gates there will be an 
observation postj at the end of each street sentinels. Every day, the 
intendant visits the quarter in his charge, inquires whether the 
syndics have carried out their tasks, whether the inhabitants have 
anything to complain of; they ‘observe their actions’. Every day, 
too, the syndic goes into the street for which he is responsible; 
stops before each house: gets all the inhabitants to appear at the 
windows (those who live overlooking the courtyard will be allo¬ 
cated a window looking onto the street at which no one but they 
may show themselves); he calls each of them by name; informs 
himself as to the state of each and every one of them — ‘in which 
respect the inhabitants will be compelled to speak the truth under 
pain of death’; if someone does not appear at the window, the syndic 
must ask why: ‘In this way he will find out easily enough whether 
dead or sick are being concealed.’ Everyone locked up in his 
cage, everyone at his window, answering to his name and showing 
himself when asked - it is the great review of the living and the 
dead. 

This surveillance is based on a system of permanent registration: 
reports from the syndics to the intendants, from the intendants to 
the magistrates or mayor. At the beginning of the ‘lock up’, the role 
of each of the inhabitants present in the town is laid down, one by 
one; this document bears ‘the name, age, sex of everyone, notwith¬ 
standing his condition’: a copy is sent to the intendant of the quarter, 
another to the office of the town hall, another to enable the syndic 
to make his daily roll call. Everything that may be observed during 
the course of the visits - deaths, illnesses, complaints, irregularities - 
is noted down and transmitted to the intendants and magistrates. 
The magistrates have complete control over medical treatment; they 
have appointed a physician in charge; no other practitioner may 
treat, no apothecary prepare medicine, no confessor visit a sick 
person without having received from him a written note ‘to prevent 
anyone from concealing and dealing with those sick of the contagion, 
unknown to the magistrates’. The registration of the pathological 
must be constantly centralized. The relation of each individual to his

disease and to his death passes through the representatives of power, 
the registration they make of it, the decisions they take on it. 

Five or six days after the beginning of the quarantine, the process
