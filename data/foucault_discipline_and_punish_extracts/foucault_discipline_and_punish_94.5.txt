of purifying the houses one by one is begun. All the inhabitants are 
made to leave; in each room ‘the furniture and goods’ are raised 
from the ground or suspended from the air; perfume is poured 
around the room; after carefully sealing the windows, doors and 
even the keyholes with wax, the perfume is set alight. Finally, the 
entire house is closed while the perfume is consumed; those who 
have carried out the work are searched, as they were on entry, ‘in 
the presence of the residents of the house, to see that they did not 
have something on their persons as they left that they did not have 
on entering’. Four hours later, the residents are allowed to re-enter 
their homes. 

This enclosed, segmented space, observed at every point, in 
which the individuals are inserted in a fixed place, in which the 
slightest movements are supervised, in which all events are recorded, 
in which an uninterrupted work of writing links the centre and 
periphery, in which power is exercised without division, according 
to a continuous hierarchical figure, in which each individual is con¬ 
stantly located, examined and distributed among the living beings, 
the sick and the dead - all this constitutes a compact model of the 
disciplinary mechanism. The plague is met by order; its function is 
to sort out every possible confusion: that of the disease, which is 
transmitted when bodies are mixed together; that of the evil, which 
is increased when fear and death overcome prohibitions. It lays 
down for each individual his place, his body, his disease and his 
death, his well-being, by means of an omnipresent and omniscient 
power that subdivides itself in a regular, uninterrupted way even 
to the ultimate determination of the individual, of what characterizes 
him, of what belongs to him, of what happens to him. Against the 
plague, which is a mixture, discipline brings into play its power, 
which is one of analysis. A whole literary fiction of the festival grew 
up around the plague: suspended laws, lifted prohibitions, the 
frenzy of passing time, bodies mingling together without respect, 
individuals unmasked, abandoning their statutory identity and the 
figure under which they had been recognized, allowing a quite 
different truth to appear. But there was also a political dream of the

plague, which was exactly its reverse: not the collective festival, 
but strict divisions; not laws transgressed, but the penetration of 
regulation into even the smallest details of everyday life through the 
mediation of the complete hierarchy that assured the capillary func¬ 
tioning of power; not masks that were put on and taken off, but the
