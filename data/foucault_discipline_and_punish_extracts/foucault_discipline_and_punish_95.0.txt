assignment to each individual of his ‘true’ name, his ‘true’ place, his 
‘true’ body, his ‘true’ disease. The plague as a form, at once real 
and imaginary, of disorder had as its medical and political correlative 
discipline. Behind the disciplinary mechanisms can be read the 
haunting memory of ‘contagions’, of the plague, of rebellions, 
crimes, vagabondage, desertions, people who appear and disappear, 
live and die in disorder. 

If it is true that the leper gave rise to rituals of exclusion, which to 
a certain extent provided the model for and general form of the 
great Confinement, then the plague gave rise to disciplinary pro¬ 
jects. Rather than the massive, binary division between one set of 
people and another, it called for multiple separations, individualizing 
distributions, an organization in depth of surveillance and control, 
an intensification and a ramification of power. The leper was caught 
up in a practice of rejection, of exile-enclosure; he was left to his 
doom in a mass among which it was useless to differentiate; those 
sick of the plague were caught up in a meticulous tactical partition¬ 
ing in which individual differentiations were the constricting effects 
of a power that multiplied, articulated and subdivided itself; the great 
confinement on the one hand; the correct training on the other. 
The leper and his separation; the plague and its segmentations. The 
first is marked; the second analysed and distributed. The exile of 
the leper and the arrest of the plague do not bring with them the 
same political dream. The first is that of a pure community, the 
second that of a disciplined society. Two ways of exercising power 
over men, of controlling their relations, of separating out their 
dangerous mixtures. The plague-stricken town, traversed through¬ 
out with hierarchy, surveillance, observation, writing; the town 
immobilized by the functioning of an extensive power that bears in 
a distinct way over all individual bodies - this is the utopia of the 
perfectly governed city. The plague (envisaged as a possibility at 
least) is the trial in the course of which one may define ideally the 
exercise of disciplinary power. In order to make rights and laws

function according to pure theory, the jurists place themselves in 
imagination in the state of nature; in order to see perfect disciplines 
functioning, rulers dreamt of the state of plague. Underlying dis¬ 
ciplinary projects the image of the plague stands for all forms of 
confusion and disorder; just as the image of the leper, cut off from 
all human contact, underlies projects of exclusion.
