They are different projects, then, but not incompatible ones. We 
see them coming slowly together, and it is the peculiarity of the 
nineteenth century that it applied to the space of exclusion of which 
the leper was the symbolic inhabitant (beggars, vagabonds, madmen 
and the disorderly formed the real population) the technique of 
power proper to disciplinary partitioning. Treat ‘lepers’ as ‘plague 
victims’, project the subtle segmentations of discipline onto the 
confused space of internment, combine it with the methods of analy¬ 
tical distribution proper to power, individualize the excluded, but 
use procedures of individualization to mark exclusion - this is what 
was operated regularly by disciplinary power from the beginning 
of the nineteenth century in the psychiatric asylum, the penitentiary, 
the reformatory, the approved school and, to some extent, the 
hospital. Generally speaking, all the authorities exercising individual 
control function according to a double mode; that of binary division 
and branding (mad/sane; dangerous/harmless; normal/abnormal); 
and that of coercive assignment, of differential distribution (who he 
is; where he must be; how he is to be characterized; how he is to be 
recognized; how a constant surveillance is to be exercised over him 
in an individual way, etc.). On the one hand, the lepers are treated as 
plague victims; the tactics of individualizing disciplines are imposed 
on the excluded; and, on the other hand, the universality of disci¬ 
plinary controls makes it possible to brand the ‘leper’ and to bring 
into play against him the dualistic mechanisms of exclusion. The 
constant division between the normal and the abnormal, to which 
every individual is subjected, brings us back to our own time, by 
applying the binary branding and exile of the leper to quite different 
objects; the existence of a whole set of techniques and institutions 
for measuring, supervising and correcting the abnormal brings into 
play the disciplinary mechanisms to which the fear of the plague 
gave rise. All the mechanisms of power which, even today, are 
disposed around the abnormal individual, to brand him and to alter

Bentham’s Panopticon is the architectural figure of this composi¬ 
tion. We know the principle on which it was based: at the periphery, 
an annular building; at the centre, a tower; this tower is pierced with 
wide windows that open onto the inner side of the ring; the peri¬ 
pheric building is divided into cells, each of which extends the whole 
width of the building; they have two windows, one on the inside,
