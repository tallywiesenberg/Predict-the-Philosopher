corresponding to the windows of the tower; the other, on the out¬ 
side, allows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other. 
All that is needed, then, is to place a supervisor in a central tower 
and to shut up in each cell a madman, a patient, a condemned man, 
a worker or a schoolboy. By the effect of backlighting, one can 
observe from the tower, standing out precisely against the light, 
the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery. They are 
like so many cages, so many small theatres, in which each actor is 
alone, perfectly individualized and constantly visible. The panoptic 
mechanism arranges spatial unities that make it possible to see con¬ 
stantly and to recognize immediately. In short, it reverses the prin¬ 
ciple of the dungeon; or rather of its three functions - to enclose, to 
deprive of light and to hide - it preserves only the first and elimin¬ 
ates the other two. Full lighting and the eye of a supervisor capture 
better than darkness, which ultimately protected. Visibility is a trap. 

To begin with, this made it possible - as a negative effect - to 
avoid those compact, swarming, howling masses that were to be 
found in places of confinement, those painted by Goya or described 
by Howard. Each individual, in his place, is securely confined to a 
cell from which he is seen from the front by the supervisor; but the 
side walls prevent him from coming into contact with his compan¬ 
ions. He is seen, but he does not see; he is the object of information, 
never a subject in communication. The arrangement of his room, 
opposite the central tower, imposes on him an axial visibility; but 
the divisions of the ring, those separated cells, imply a lateral 
invisibility. And this invisibility is a guarantee of order. If the in¬ 
mates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at 
collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad 
reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of

contagion; if they are madmen theie is no risk of their committing 
violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no 
copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, 
there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those dis¬ 
tractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or 
cause accidents. The crowd, a compact mass, a locus of multiple 
exchanges, individualities merging together, a collective effect, is 
abolished and replaced by a collection of separated individualities. 
From the point of view of the guardian, it is replaced by a multipli¬ 
city that can be numbered and supervised; from the point of view of 
the inmates, by a sequestered and observed solitude (Bentham, 
60-64).
