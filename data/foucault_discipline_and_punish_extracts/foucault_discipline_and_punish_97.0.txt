machine: in the absence of the director, his family, his friends, his 
visitors, even his servants (Bentham, 45). Similarly, it does not 
matter what motive animates him: the curiosity of the indiscreet, the 
malice of a child, the thirst for knowledge of a philosopher who 
wishes to visit this museum of human nature, or the perversity of 
those who take pleasure in spying and punishing. The more 
numerous those anonymous and temporary observers are, the greater 
the risk for the inmate of being surprised and the greater his anxious 
awareness of being observed. The Panopticon is a marvellous 
machine which, whatever use one may wish to put it to, produces 
homogeneous effects of power. 

A real subjection is born mechanically from a fictitious relation. 
So it is not necessary to use force to constrain the convict to good 
behaviour, the madman to calm, the worker to work, the schoolboy 
to application, the patient to the observation of the regulations. 
Bentham was surprised that panoptic institutions could be so light: 
there were no more bars, no more chains, no more heavy locks; all 
that was needed was that the separations should be clear and the 
openings well arranged. The heaviness of the old ‘houses of security’, 
with their fortress-like architecture, could be replaced by the simple, 
economic geometry of a ‘house of certainty’. The efficiency of 
power, its constraining force have, in a sense, passed over to the 
other side - to the side of its surface of application. He who is 
subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsi¬ 
bility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontane¬ 
ously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in

which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle 
of his own subjection. By this very fact, the external power may 
throw off its physical weight; it tends to the non-corporal; and, the 
more it approaches this limit, the more constant, profound and 
permanent are its effects; it is a perpetual victory that avoids any 
physical confrontation and which is always decided in advance. 

Bentham does not say whether he was inspired, in his project, by 
Le Vaux’s menagerie at Versailles: the first menagerie in which the 
different elements are not, as they traditionally were, distributed in 
a park (Loisel, 104-7). At the centre was an octagonal pavilion 
which, on the first floor, consisted of only a single room, the king’s 
salon-, on every side large windows looked out onto seven cages
