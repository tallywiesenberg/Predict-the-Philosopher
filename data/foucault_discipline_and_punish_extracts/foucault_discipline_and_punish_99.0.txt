individuals; it gives ‘power of mind over mind’. The panoptic 
schema makes any apparatus of power more intense: it assures its 
economy (in material, in personnel, in time); it assures its efficacity 
by its preventative character, its continuous functioning and its 
automatic mechanisms. It is a way of obtaining from power ‘in 
hitherto unexampled quantity’, ‘a great and new instrument of 
government ...; its great excellence consists in the great strength 
it is capable of giving to any institution it may be thought proper to 
apply it to’ (Bentham, 66). 

It’s a case of ‘it’s easy once you’ve thought of it’ in the political 
sphere. It can in fact be integrated into any function (education, 
medical treatment, production, punishment); it can increase the 
effect of this function, by being linked closely with it; it can consti¬ 
tute a mixed mechanism in which relations of power (and of know¬ 
ledge) may be precisely adjusted, in the smallest detail, to the pro¬ 
cesses that are to be supervised; it can establish a direct proportion 
between ‘surplus power’ and ‘surplus production’. In short, it 
arranges things in such a way that the exercise of power is not 
added on from the outside, like a rigid, heavy constraint, to the 
functions it invests, but is so subtly present in them as to increase 
their efficiency by itself increasing its own points of contact. The 
panoptic mechanism is not simply a hinge, a point of exchange 
between a mechanism of power and a function; it is a way of making

power relations function in a function, and of making a function 
function through these power relations. Bentham’s Preface to 
Panopticon opens with a list of the benefits to be obtained from his 
‘inspection-house’: 'Morals reformed — health preserved — industry 
invigorated- instruction diffused - public burthens lightened - Economy 
seated, as it were, upon a rock - the gordian knot of the Poor-Laws 
not cut, but untied - all by a simple idea in architecture!’ (Bentham, 
39 )- 

Furthermore, the arrangement of this machine is such that its 
enclosed nature does not preclude a permanent presence from the 
outside: we have seen that anyone may come and exercise in the cen¬ 
tral tower the functions of surveillance, and that, this being the case, 
he can gain a clear idea of the way in which the surveillance is practised. 
In fact, any panoptic institution, even if it is as rigorously closed 
as a penitentiary, may without difficulty be subjected to such irregu¬
