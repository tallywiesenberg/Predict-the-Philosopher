lar and constant inspections: and not only by the appointed inspec¬ 
tors, but also by the public; any member of society will have the 
right to come and see with his own eyes how the schools, hospitals, 
factories, prisons function. There is no risk, therefore, that the 
increase of power created by the.panoptic machine may degenerate 
into tyranny; the disciplinary mechanism will be democratically 
controlled, since it will be constantly accessible ‘to the great tribun^ 
committee of the world’.* This Panopticon, subtly arranged so that 
an observer may observe, at a glance, so many different individuals, 
also enables everyone to come and observe any of the observers. 
The seeing machine was once a sort of dark room into which 
individuals spied; it has become a transparent building in which the 
exercise of power may be supervised by society as a whole. 

The panoptic schema, without disappearing as such or losing any 
of its properties, was destined to spread throughout the social body; 
its vocation was to become a generalized function. The plague- 
stricken town provided an exceptional disciplinary model: perfect, 
but absolutely violent; to the disease that brought death, power 
opposed its perpetual threat of death; life inside it was reduced to 
its simplest expression; it was, against the power of death, the meti¬ 
culous exercise of the right of the sword. The Panopticon, on the 
other hand, has a role of amplification; although it arranges power, 
although it is intended to make it more economic and more effective.

Discipline 


it does so not for power itself, nor for the immediate salvation of a 
threatened society: its aim is to strengthen the social forces - to 
increase production, to develop the economy, spread education, 
raise the level of public morality; to increase and multiply. 

How is power to be strengthened in such a way that, far from 
impeding progress, far from weighing upon it with its rules and 
regulations, it actually facilitates such progress.^ What intensificator 
of power will be able at the same time to be a multiplicator of pro¬ 
duction.^ How will power, by increasing its forces, be able to increase 
those of society instead of confiscating them or impeding them.^ The 
Panopticon’s solution to this problem is that the productive increase 
of power can be assured only if, on the one hand, it can be exercised 
continuously in the very foundations of society, in the subtlest 
possible way, and if, on the other hand, it functions outside these 
sudden, violent, discontinuous forms that are bound up with the 
exercise of sovereignty. The body of the king, with its strange
