PART ON E 

We “Other Victorians” 




For a long time, the story goes, we supported a Victorian 
regime, and we continue to be dominated by it even today. 
Thus the image of the imperial prude is emblazoned on our 
restrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality. 

At the beginning of the seventeenth century a certain 
frankness was still common, it would seem. Sexual practices 
had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue 
reticence, and things were done without too much conceal¬ 
ment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit. Codes 
regulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were 
quite lax compared to those of the nineteenth century. It was 
a time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open 
transgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermin¬ 
gled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the 
laughter of adults: it was a period when bodies “made a 
display of themselves.” 

But twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the 
monotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie. Sexuality 
was carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal 
family took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious 
function of reproduction. On the subject of sex, silence be¬ 
came the rule. The legitimate and procreative couple laid 
down the law. The couple imposed itself as model, enforced 
the norm, safeguarded the truth, and reserved the right to 
speak while retaining the principle of secrecy. A single locus 
of sexuality was acknowledged in social space as well as at 
the heart of every household, but it was a utilitarian and 
fertile one: the parents’ bedroom. The rest had only to re¬ 
main vague; proper demeanor avoided contact with other 
bodies, and verbal decency sanitized one’s speech. And ster-

ile behavior carried the taint of abnormality; if it insisted on 
making itself too visible, it would be designated accordingly 
and would have to pay the penalty. 

Nothing that was not ordered in terms of generation or 
transfigured by it could expect sanction or protection. Nor 
did it merit a hearing. It would be driven out, denied, and 
reduced to silence. Not only did it not exist, it had no right 
to exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani¬ 
festation—whether in acts or in words. Everyone knew, for 
example, that children had no sex, which was why they were 
forbidden to talk about it, why one closed one’s eyes and 
stopped one’s ears whenever they came to show evidence to 
the contrary, and why a general and studied silence was 
imposed. These are the characteristic features attributed to 
repression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi¬ 
tions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen¬ 
tence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an 
affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis¬ 
sion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing 
to-see, and nothing to know. Such was the hypocrisy of our 
bourgeois societies with its halting logic. It was forced to 
make a few concessions, however. If it was truly necessary 
to make room for illegitimate sexualities, it was reasoned, let 
them take their infernal mischief elsewhere: to a place where 
they could be reintegrated, if not in the circuits of produc¬ 
tion, at least in those of profit. The brothel and the mental 
hospital would be those places of tolerance: the prostitute, 
the client, and the pimp, together with the psychiatrist and 
his hysteric—those “other Victorians,” as Steven Marcus 
would say—seem to have surreptitiously transferred the 
pleasures that are unspoken into the order of things that are 
counted. Words and gestures, quietly authorized, could be 
exchanged there at the going rate. Only in those places would 
untrammeled sex have a right to (safely insularized) forms of 
reality, and only to clandestine, circumscribed, and coded 
types of discourse. Everywhere else, modern puritanism im-

posed its triple edict of taboo, nonexistence, and silence. 

But have we not liberated ourselves from those two long 
centuries in which the history of sexuality must be seen first 
of all as the chronicle of an increasing repression? Only to 
a slight extent, we are told. Perhaps some progress was made 
by Freud; but with such circumspection, such medical pru¬ 
dence, a scientific guarantee of innocuousness, and so many 
precautions in order to contain everything, with no fear of 
“overflow,” in that safest and most discrete of spaces, be¬ 
tween the couch and discourse: yet another round of whis¬ 
pering on a bed. And could things have been otherwise? We 
are informed that if repression has indeed been the funda¬ 
mental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since 
the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able 
to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: noth¬ 
ing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, 
an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within real¬ 
ity, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power 
will be required. For the least glimmer of truth is conditioned 
by politics. Hence, one cannot hope to obtain the desired 
results simply from a medical practice, nor from a theoretical 
discourse, however rigorously pursued. Thus, one denounces 
Freud’s conformism, the normalizing functions of psychoa¬ 
nalysis, the obvious timidity underlying Reich’s vehemence, 
and all the effects of integration ensured by the “science” of 
sex and the barely equivocal practices of sexology. 

This discourse on modern sexual repression holds up well, 
owing no doubt to how easy it is to uphold. A solemn histori¬ 
cal and political guarantee protects it. By placing the advent 
of the age of repression in the seventeenth century, after 
hundreds of years of open spaces and free expression, one 
adjusts it to coincide with the development of capitalism: it 
becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order. The minor 
chronicle of sex and its trials is transposed into the ceremoni¬ 
ous history of the modes of production; its trifling aspect 
fades from view. A principle of explanation emerges after the

fact: if sex is so rigorously repressed, this is because it is 
incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative. 
At a time when labor capacity was being systematically ex¬ 
ploited, how could this capacity be allowed to dissipate itself 
in pleasurable pursuits, except in those—reduced to a mini¬ 
mum—that enabled it to reproduce itself? Sex and its effects 
are perhaps not so easily deciphered; on the other hand, their 
repression, thus reconstructed, is easily analyzed. And the 
sexual cause—the demand for sexual freedom, but also for 
the knowledge to be gained from sex and the right to speak 
about it—becomes legitimately associated with the honor of 
a political cause: sex too is placed on the agenda for the 
future. A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many 
precautions in order to give the history of sex such an impres¬ 
sive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness: 
as if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such 
a discourse could be formulated or accepted. 

But there may be another reason that makes it so gratify¬ 
ing for us to define the relationship between sex and power 
in terms of repression: something that one might call the 
speaker’s benefit. If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to 
prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact 
that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliber¬ 
ate transgression. A person who holds forth in such language 
places himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power; 
he upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the com¬ 
ing freedom. This explains the solemnity with which one 
speaks of sex nowadays. When they had to allude to it, the 
first demographers and psychiatrists of the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury thought it advisable to excuse themselves for asking 
their readers to dwell on matters so trivial and base. But for 
decades now, we have found it difficult to speak on the 
subject without striking a different pose: we are conscious of 
defying established power, our tone of voice shows that we 
know we are being subversive, and we ardently conjure away 
the present and appeal to the future, whose day will be

hastened by the contribution we believe we are making. 
Something that smacks of revolt, of promised freedom, of the 
coming age of a different law, slips easily into this discourse 
on sexual oppression. Some of the ancient functions of 
prophecy are reactivated therein. Tomorrow sex will be good 
again. Because this repression is affirmed, one can discreetly 
bring into coexistence concepts which the fear of ridicule or 
the bitterness of history prevents most of us from putting side 
by side: revolution and happiness; or revolution and a differ¬ 
ent body, one that is newer and more beautiful; or indeed, 
revolution and pleasure. What sustains our eagerness to 
speak of sex in terms of repression is doubtless this opportu¬ 
nity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths 
and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation, 
and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that com¬ 
bines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change 
the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights. 
This is perhaps what also explains the market value at¬ 
tributed not only to what is said about sexual repression, but 
also to the mere fact of lending an ear to those who would 
eliminate the effects of repression. Ours is, after all, the only 
civilization in which officials are paid to listen to all and 
sundry impart the secrets of their sex: as if the urge to talk 
about it, and the interest one hopes to arouse by doing so, 
have far surpassed the possibilities of being heard, so that 
some individuals have even offered their ears for hire. 

But it appears to me that the essential thing is not this 
economic factor, but rather the existence in our era of a 
discourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturn¬ 
ing of global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come, 
and the promise of a certain felicity are linked together. 
Today it is sex that serves as a support for the ancient form 
—so familiar and important in the West—of preaching. A 
great sexual sermon—which has had its subtle theologians 
and its popular voices—has swept through our societies over 
the last decades; it has chastised the old order, denounced 



8 


The History of Sexuality 


hypocrisy, and praised the rights of the immediate and the 
real; it has made people dream of a New City. The Francis¬ 
cans are called to mind. And we might wonder how it is 
possible that the lyricism and religiosity that long accom¬ 
panied the revolutionary project have, in Western industrial 
societies, been largely carried over to sex. 

The notion of repressed sex is not, therefore, only a theo¬ 
retical matter. The affirmation of a sexuality that has never 
been more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the 
hypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled 
with the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal 
the truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, sub¬ 
vert the law that governs it, and change its future. The 
statement of oppression and the form of the sermon refer 
back to one another; they are mutually reinforcing. To say 
that sex is not repressed, or rather that the relationship be¬ 
tween sex and power is not characterized by repression, is to 
risk falling into a sterile paradox. It not only runs counter to 
a well-accepted argument, it goes against the whole economy 
and all the discursive “interests” that underlie this argument. 

This is the point at which I would like to situate the series 
of historical analyses that will follow, the present volume 
being at the same time an introduction and a first attempt at 
an overview: it surveys a few historically significant points 
and outlines certain theoretical problems. Briefly, my aim is 
to examine the case of a society which has been loudly casti¬ 
gating itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which 
speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate 
in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it 
exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws 
that have made it function. I would like to explore not only 
these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the 
strategic intention that supports them. The question I would 
like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why 
do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment 
against our most recent past, against our present, and against 



We “Other Victorians ”

ourselves, that we are repressed? By what spiral did we come 
to affirm that sex is negated? What led us to show, ostenta¬ 
tiously, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something 
we silence? And we do all this by formulating the matter in 
the most explicit terms, by trying to reveal it in its most 
naked reality, by affirming it in the positivity of its power and 
its effects. It is certainly legitimate to ask why sex was as¬ 
sociated with sin for such a long time—although it would 
remain to be discovered how this association was formed, 
and one would have to be careful not to state in a summary 
and hasty fashion that sex was “condemned”—but we must 
also ask why we burden ourselves today with so much guilt 
for having once made sex a sin. What paths have brought us 
to the point where we are “at fault” with respect to our own 
sex? And how have we come to be a civilization so peculiar 
as to tell itself that, through an abuse of power which has not 
ended, it has long “sinned” against sex? How does one ac¬ 
count for the displacement which, while claiming to free us 
from the sinful nature of sex, taxes us with a great historical 
wrong which consists precisely in imagining that nature to 
be blameworthy and in drawing disastrous consequences 
from that belief? 

It will be said that if so many people today affirm this 
repression, the reason is that it is historically evident. And 
if they speak of it so abundantly, as they have for such a long 
time now, this is because repression is so firmly anchored, 
having solid roots and reasons, and weighs so heavily on sex 
that more than one denunciation will be required in order to 
free ourselves from it; the job will be a long one. All the 
longer, no doubt, as it is in the nature of power—particularly 
the kind of power that operates in our society—to be repres¬ 
sive, and to be especially careful in repressing useless 
energies, the intensity of pleasures, and irregular modes of 
behavior. We must not be surprised, then, if the effects of 
liberation vis-a-vis this repressive power are so slow to mani¬ 
fest themselves; the effort to speak freely about sex and ac-

cept it in its reality is so alien to a historical sequence that 
has gone unbroken for a thousand years now, and so inimical 
to the intrinsic mechanisms of power, that it is bound to 
make little headway for a long time before succeeding in its 
mission. 

One can raise three serious doubts concerning what I shall 
term the “repressive hypothesis.” First doubt: Is sexual re¬ 
pression truly an established historical fact? Is what first 
comes into view—and consequently permits one to advance 
an initial hypothesis—really the accentuation or even the 
establishment of a regime of sexual repression beginning in 
the seventeenth century? This is a properly historical ques¬ 
tion. Second doubt: Do the workings of power, and in partic¬ 
ular those mechanisms that are brought into play in societies 
such as ours, really belong primarily to the category of re¬ 
pression? Are prohibition, censorship, and denial truly the 
forms through which power is exercised in a general way, if 
not in every society, most certainly in our own? This is a 
historico-theoretical question. A third and final doubt: Did 
the critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come 
to act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had ope¬ 
rated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part 
of the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and 
doubtless misrepresents) by calling it “repression”? Was 
there really a historical rupture between the age of repression 
and the critical analysis of repression? This is a historico- 
political question. My purpose in introducing these three 
doubts is not merely to construct counterarguments that are 
symmetrical and contrary to those outlined above; it is not 
a matter of saying that sexuality, far from being repressed in 
capitalist and bourgeois societies, has on the contrary benefit- 
ted from a regime of unchanging liberty; nor is it a matter 
of saying that power in societies such as ours is more tolerant 
than repressive, and that the critique of repression, while it 
may give itself airs of a rupture with the past, actually forms 
part of a much older process and, depending on how one 



We “Other Victorians'’ 11 

chooses to understand this process, will appear either as a 
new episode in the lessening of prohibitions, or as a more 
devious and discreet form of power. 

The doubts I would like to oppose to the repressive hy¬ 
pothesis are aimed less at showing it to be mistaken than at 
putting it back within a general economy of discourses on sex 
in modern societies since the seventeenth century. Why has 
sexuality been so widely discussed, and what has been said 
about it? What were the effects of power generated by what 
was said? What are the links between these discourses, these 
effects of power, and the pleasures that were invested by 
them? What knowledge (savoir) was formed as a result of this 
linkage? The object, in short, is to define the regime of power- 
knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human 
sexuality in our part of the world. The central issue, then (at 
least in the first instance), is not to determine whether one 
says yes or no to sex, whether one formulates prohibitions or 
permissions, whether one asserts its importance or denies its 
effects, or whether one refines the words one uses to designate 
it; but to account for the fact that it is spoken about, to 
discover who does the speaking, the positions and viewpoints 
from which they speak, the institutions which prompt people 
to speak about it and which store and distribute the things 
that are said. What is at issue, briefly, is the over-all “discur¬ 
sive fact,” the way in which sex is “put into discourse.” 
Hence, too, my main concern will be to locate the forms of 
power, the channels it takes, and the discourses it permeates 
in order to reach the most tenuous and individual modes of 
behavior, the paths that give it access to the rare or scarcely 
perceivable forms of desire, how it penetrates and controls 
everyday pleasure—all this entailing effects that may be 
those of refusal, blockage, and invalidation, but also incite¬ 
ment and intensification: in short, the “polymorphous tech¬ 
niques of power.” And finally, the essential aim will not be 
to determine whether these discursive productions and these 
effects of power lead one to formulate the truth about sex, or 



12 


The History of Sexuality 


on the contrary falsehoods designed to conceal that truth, 
but rather to bring out the “will to knowledge” that serves 
as both their support and their instrument. 

Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not claim that sex 
has not been prohibited or barred or masked or misap¬ 
prehended since the classical age; nor do I even assert that 
it has suffered these things any less from that period on than 
before. I do not maintain that the prohibition of sex is a ruse; 
but it is a ruse to make prohibition into the basic and con¬ 
stitutive element from which one would be able to write the 
history of what has been said concerning sex starting from 
the modern epoch. All these negative elements—defenses, 
censorships, denials—which the repressive hypothesis 
groups together in one great central mechanism destined to 
say no, are doubtless only component parts that have a local 
and tactical role to play in a transformation into discourse, 
a technology of power, and a will to knowledge that are far 
from being reducible to the former. 

In short, I would like to disengage my analysis from the 
privileges generally accorded the economy of scarcity and 
the principles of rarefaction, to search instead for instances 
of discursive production (which also administer silences, to 
be sure), of the production of power (which sometimes have 
the function of prohibiting), of the propagation of knowledge 
(which often cause mistaken beliefs or systematic misconcep¬ 
tions to circulate); I would like to write the history of these 
instances and their transformations. A first survey made 
from this viewpoint seems to indicate that since the end of 
the sixteenth century, the “putting into discourse of sex,” far 
from undergoing a process of restriction, on the contrary has 
been subjected to a mechanism of increasing incitement; that 
the techniques of power exercised over sex have not obeyed 
a principle of rigorous selection, but rather one of dissemina¬ 
tion and implantation of polymorphous sexualities; and that 
the will to knowledge has not come to a halt in the face of 
a taboo that must not be lifted, but has persisted in constitut-

ing—despite many mistakes, of course—a science of sexual¬ 
ity. It is these movements that I will now attempt to bring 
into focus in a schematic way, bypassing as it were the repres¬ 
sive hypothesis and the facts of interdiction or exclusion it 
invokes, and starting from certain historical facts that serve 
as guidelines for research. 




PART TWO 

The Repressive 
Hypothesis 




I 

The Incitement 
to Discourse 


The seventeenth century, then, was the beginning of an age 
of repression emblematic of what we call the bourgeois soci¬ 
eties, an age which perhaps we still have not completely left 
behind. Calling sex by its name thereafter became more diffi¬ 
cult and more costly. As if in order to gain mastery over it 
in reality, it had first been necessary to subjugate it at the 
level of language, control its free circulation in speech, ex¬ 
punge it from the things that were said, and extinguish the 
words that rendered it too visibly present. And even these 
prohibitions, it seems, were afraid to name it. Without even 
having to pronounce the word, modern prudishness was able 
to ensure that one did not speak of sex, merely through the 
interplay of prohibitions that referred back to one another: 
instances of muteness which, by dint of saying nothing, im¬ 
posed silence. Censorship. 

Yet when one looks back over these last three centuries 
with their continual transformations, things appear in a very 
different light: around and apropos of sex, one sees a veritable 
discursive explosion. We must be clear on this point, how¬ 
ever. It is quite possible that there was an expurgation—and 
a very rigorous one—of the authorized vocabulary. It may 
indeed be true that a whole rhetoric of allusion and metaphor 
was codified. Without question, new rules of propriety 

17 



18 


The History of Sexuality 


screened out some words: there was a policing of statements. 
A control over enunciations as well: where and when it was 
not possible to talk about such things became much more 
strictly defined; in which circumstances, among which 
speakers, and within which social relationships. Areas were 
thus established, if not of utter silence, at least of tact and 
discretion: between parents and children, for instance, or 
teachers and pupils, or masters and domestic servants. This 
almost certainly constituted a whole restrictive economy, 
one that was incorporated into that politics of language and 
speech—spontaneous on the one hand, concerted on the 
other—which accompanied the social redistributions of the 
classical period. 

At the level of discourses and their domains, however, 
practically the opposite phenomenon occurred. There was a 
steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex—spe¬ 
cific discourses, different from one another both by their 
form and by their object: a discursive ferment that gathered 
momentum from the eighteenth century onward. Here I am 
thinking not so much of the probable increase in “illicit” 
discourses, that is, discourses of infraction that crudely 
named sex by way of insult or mockery of the new code of 
decency; the tightening up of the rules of decorum likely did 
produce, as a countereffect, a valorization and intensification 
of indecent speech. But more important was the multiplica¬ 
tion of discourses concerning sex in the field of exercise of 
power itself: an institutional incitement to speak about it, and 
to do so more and more; a determination on the part of the 
agencies of power to hear it spoken about, and to cause it to 
speak through explicit articulation and endlessly ac¬ 
cumulated detail. 

Consider the evolution of the Catholic pastoral and the 
sacrament of penance after the Council of Trent. Little by 
little, the nakedness of the questions formulated by the con¬ 
fession manuals of the Middle Ages, and a good number of 
those still in use in the seventeenth century, was veiled. One 



The Repressive Hypothesis 


19 


avoided entering into that degree of detail which some au¬ 
thors, such as Sanchez or Tamburini, had for a long time 
believed indispensable for the confession to be complete: 
description of the respective positions of the partners, the 
postures assumed, gestures, places touched, caresses, the pre¬ 
cise moment of pleasure—an entire painstaking review of the 
sexual act in its very unfolding. Discretion was advised, with 
increasing emphasis. The greatest reserve was counseled 
when dealing with sins against purity: “This matter is similar 
to pitch, for, however one might handle it, even to cast it far 
from oneself, it sticks nonetheless, and always soils.”' And 
later, Alfonso de’ Liguori prescribed starting—and possibly 
going no further, especially when dealing with children— 
with questions that were “roundabout and vague.” 2 

But while the language may have been refined, the scope 
of the confession—the confession of the flesh—continually 
increased. This was partly because the Counter Reformation 
busied itself with stepping up the rhythm of the yearly con¬ 
fession in the Catholic countries, and because it tried to 
impose meticulous rules of self-examination; but above all, 
because it attributed more and more importance in penance 
—and perhaps at the expense of some other sins—to all the 
insinuations of the flesh: thoughts, desires, voluptuous ima¬ 
ginings, delectations, combined movements of the body and 
the soul; henceforth all this had to enter, in detail, into the 
process of confession and guidance. According to the new 
pastoral, sex must not be named imprudently, but its aspects, 
its correlations, and its effects must be pursued down to their 
slenderest ramifications: a shadow in a daydream, an image 
too slowly dispelled, a badly exorcised complicity between 
the body’s mechanics and the mind’s complacency: every¬ 
thing had to be told. A twofold evolution tended to make the 
flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important 
moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings

—so difficult to perceive and formulate—of desire. For this 
was an evil that afflicted the whole man, and in the most 
secret of forms: “Examine diligently, therefore, all the facul¬ 
ties of your soul: memory, understanding, and will. Examine 
with precision all your senses as well. . . . Examine, more¬ 
over, all your thoughts, every word you speak, and all your 
actions. Examine even unto your dreams, to know if, once 
awakened, you did not give them your consent. And finally, 
do not think that in so sensitive and perilous a matter as this, 
there is anything trivial or insignificant.” 3 Discourse, there¬ 
fore, had to trace the meeting line of the body and the soul, 
following all its meanderings: beneath the surface of the sins, 
it would lay bare the unbroken nervure of the flesh. Under 
the authority of a language that had been carefully expur¬ 
gated so that it was no longer directly named, sex was taken 
charge of, tracked down as it were, by a discourse that aimed 
to allow it no obscurity, no respite. 

It was here, perhaps, that the injunction, so peculiar to the 
West, was laid down for the first time, in the form of a 
general constraint. I am not talking about the obligation to 
admit to violations of the laws of sex, as required by tradi¬ 
tional penance; but of the nearly infinite task of telling— 
telling oneself and another, as often as possible, everything 
that might concern the interplay of innumerable pleasures, 
sensations, and thoughts which, through the body and the 
soul, had some affinity with sex. This scheme for transform- 
ing sex into discourse had been devised long before in an 
ascetic and monastic setting. The seventeenth century made 
it into a rule for everyone. It would seem in actual fact that 
it could scarcely have applied to any but a tiny elite; the great 
majority of the faithful who only went to confession on rare 
occasions in the course of the year escaped such complex 
prescriptions. But the important point no doubt is that this 
obligation was decreed, as an ideal at least, for every good

Christian. An imperative was established: Not only will you 
confess to acts contravening the law, but you will seek to 
transform your desire, your every desire, into discourse. In¬ 
sofar as possible, nothing was meant to elude this dictum, 
even if the words it employed had to be carefully neutralized. 
The Christian pastoral prescribed as a fundamental duty the 
task of passing everything having to do with sex through the 
endless mill of speech . 4 The forbidding of certain words, the 
decency of expressions, all the censorings of vocabulary, 
might well have been only secondary devices compared to 
that great subjugation: ways of rendering it morally accept¬ 
able and technically useful. 

One could plot a line going straight from the seventeenth- 
century pastoral to what became its projection in literature, 
“scandalous” literature at that. “Tell everything,” the direc¬ 
tors would say time and again: “not only consummated acts, 
but sensual touchings, all impure gazes, all obscene remarks 
. . . all consenting thoughts .” 5 Sade takes up the injunction 
in words that seem to have been retranscribed from the 
treatises of spirtual direction: “Your narrations must be 
decorated with the most numerous and searching details; the 
precise way and extent to which we may judge how the 
passion you describe relates to human manners and man’s 
character is determined by your willingness to disguise no 
circumstance; and what is more, the least circumstance is apt 
to have an immense influence upon the procuring of that 
kind of sensory irritation we expect from your stories .” 6 And 
again at the end of the nineteenth century, the anonymous 
author of My Secret Life submitted to the same prescription; 
outwardly, at least, this man was doubtless a kind of tradi- 

*The reformed pastoral also laid down rules, albeit in a more discreet way, for 
putting sex into discourse. This notion will be developed in the next volume, The 
Body and the Flesh.

tional libertine; but he conceived the idea of complementing 
his life—which he had almost totally dedicated to sexual 
activity—with a scrupulous account of every one of its epi¬ 
sodes. He sometimes excuses himself by stressing his concern 
to educate young people, this man who had eleven volumes 
published, in a printing of only a few copies, which were 
devoted to the least adventures, pleasures, and sensations of 
his sex. It is best to take him at his word when he lets into 
his text the voice of a pure imperative: “I recount the facts, 
just as they happened, insofar as I am able to recollect them; 
this is all that I can do”; “a secret life must not leave out 
anything; there is nothing to be ashamed of.. . one can never 
know too much concerning human nature.” 7 The solitary 
author of My Secret Life often says, in order to justify his 
describing them, that his strangest practices undoubtedly 
were shared by thousands of men on the surface of the earth. 
But the guiding principle for the strangest of these practices, 
which was the fact of recounting them all, and in detail, from 
day to day, had been lodged in the heart of modern man for 
over two centuries. Rather than seeing in this singular man 
a courageous fugitive from a “Victorianism” that would have 
compelled him to silence, I am inclined to think that, in an 
epoch dominated by (highly prolix) directives enjoining dis¬ 
cretion and modesty, he was the most direct and in a way the 
most naive representative of a plurisecular injunction to talk 
about sex. The historical accident would consist rather of the 
reticences of “Victorian puritanism”; at any rate, they were 
a digression, a refinement, a tactical diversion in the great 
process of transforming sex into discourse. 

This nameless Englishman will serve better than his queen 
as the central figure for a sexuality whose main features were 
already taking shape with the Christian pastoral. Doubtless, 
in contrast to the latter, for him it was a matter of augment¬ 
ing the sensations he experienced with the details of what he

said about them; like Sade, he wrote “for his pleasure alone,” 
in the strongest sense of the expression; he carefully mixed 
the editing and rereading of his text with erotic scenes which 
those writer’s activities repeated, prolonged, and stimulated. 
But after all, the Christian pastoral also sought to produce 
specific effects on desire, by the mere fact of transforming it 
—fully and deliberately—into discourse: effects of mastery 
and detachment, to be sure, but also an effect of spiritual 
reconversion, of turning back to God, a physical effect of 
blissful suffering from feeling in one’s body the pangs of 
temptation and the love that resists it. This is the essential 
thing: that Western man has been drawn for three centuries 
to the task of telling everything concerning his sex; that since 
the classical age there has been a constant optimization and 
an increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that 
this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multi¬ 
ple effects of displacement, intensification, reorientation, and 
modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of 
what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled 
to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected 
to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a 
deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by 
referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex? 
There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an 
ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of func¬ 
tioning and taking effect in its very economy. 

This technique might have remained tied to the destiny of 
Christian spirituality if it had not been supported and relayed 
by other mechanisms. In the first place, by a “public inter¬ 
est.” Not a collective curiosity or sensibility; not a new men¬ 
tality; but power mechanisms that functioned in such a way 
that discourse on sex—for reasons that will have to be exam¬ 
ined—became essential. Toward the beginning of the eigh¬ 
teenth century, there emerged a political, economic, and 
technical incitement to talk about sex. And not so much in 
the form of a general theory of sexuality as in the form of 



24 


The History of Sexuality 


analysis, stocktaking, classification, and specification, of 
quantitative or causal studies. This need to take sex “into 
account,” to pronounce a discourse on sex that would not 
derive from morality alone but from rationality as well, was 
sufficiently new that at first it wondered at itself and sought 
apologies for its own existence. How could a discourse based 
on reason speak of that? “Rarely have philosophers directed 
a steady gaze to these objects situated between disgust and 
ridicule, where one must avoid both hypocrisy and scan¬ 
dal.” 8 And nearly a century later, the medical establishment, 
which one might have expected to be less surprised by what 
it was about to formulate, still stumbled at the moment of 
speaking: “The darkness that envelops these facts, the shame 
and disgust they inspire, have always repelled the observer’s 
gaze. . . . For a long time I hesitated to introduce the loath¬ 
some picture into this study.” 9 What is essential is not in all 
these scruples, in the “moralism” they betray, or in the hy¬ 
pocrisy one can suspect them of, but in the recognized neces¬ 
sity of overcoming this hesitation. One had to speak of sex; 
one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not 
determined by the division between licit and illicit, even if the 
speaker maintained the distinction for himself (which is what 
these solemn and preliminary declarations were intended to 
show): one had to speak of it as of a thing to be not simply 
condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems 
of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to 
function according to an optimum. Sex was not something 
one simply judged; it was a thing one administered. It was 
in the nature of a public potential; it called for management 
procedures; it had to be taken charge of by analytical dis¬ 
courses. In the eighteenth century, sex became a “police” 
matter—in the full and strict sense given the term at the time: 
not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization

of collective and individual forces: “We must consolidate and 
augment, through the wisdom of its regulations, the internal 
power of the state; and since this power consists not only in 
the Republic in general, and in each of the members who 
constitute it, but also in the faculties and talents of those 
belonging to it, it follows that the police must concern them¬ 
selves with these means and make them serve the public 
welfare. And they can only obtain this result through the 
knowledge they have of those different assets.” 10 A policing 
of sex: that is, not the rigor of a taboo, but the necessity of 
regulating sex through useful and public discourses. 

A few examples will suffice. One of the great innovations 
in the techniques of power in the eighteenth century was the 
emergence of “population” as an economic and political 
problem: population as wealth, population as manpower or 
labor capacity, population balanced between its own growth 
and the resources it commanded. Governments perceived 
that they were not dealing simply with subjects, or even with 
a “people,” but with a “population,” with its specific 
phenomena and its peculiar variables: birth and death rates, 
life expectancy, fertility, state of health, frequency of ill¬ 
nesses, patterns of diet and habitation. All these variables 
were situated at the point where the characteristic move¬ 
ments of life and the specific effects of institutions inter¬ 
sected: “States are not populated in accordance with the 
natural progression of propagation, but by virtue of their 
industry, their products, and their different institutions. 

. . . Men multiply like the yields from the ground and in 
proportion to the advantages and resources they find in their 
labors.” 11 At the heart of this economic and political problem 
of population was sex: it was necessary to analyze the birth¬ 
rate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate 
births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the 
ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmar-

ried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive 
practices—of those notorious “deadly secrets” which 
demographers on the eve of the Revolution knew were al¬ 
ready familiar to the inhabitants of the countryside. 

Of course, it had long been asserted that a country had to 
be populated if it hoped to be rich and powerful; but this was 
the first time that a society had affirmed, in a constant way, 
that its future and its fortune were tied not only to the 
number and the uprightness of its citizens, to their marriage 
rules and family organization, but to the manner in which 
each individual made use of his sex. Things went from ritual 
lamenting over the unfruitful debauchery of the rich, bache¬ 
lors, and libertines to a discourse in which the sexual conduct 
of the population was taken both as an object of analysis and 
as a target of intervention; there was a progression from the 
crudely populationist arguments of the mercantilist epoch to 
the much more subtle and calculated attempts at regulation 
that tended to favor or discourage—according to the objec¬ 
tives and exigencies of the moment—an increasing birthrate. 
Through the political economy of population there was 
formed a whole grid of observations regarding sex. There 
emerged the analysis of the modes of sexual conduct, their 
determinations and their effects, at the boundary line of the 
biological and the economic domains. There also appeared 
those systematic campaigns which, going beyond the tradi¬ 
tional means—moral and religious exhortations, fiscal meas¬ 
ures—tried to transform the sexual conduct of couples into 
a concerted economic and political behavior. In time these 
new measures would become anchorage points for the differ¬ 
ent varieties of racism of the nineteenth and twentieth centu¬ 
ries. It was essential that the state know what was happening 
with its citizens’ sex, and the use they made of it, but also 
that each individual be capable of controlling the use he 
made of it. Between the state and the individual, sex became 
an issue, and a public issue no less; a whole web of discourses, 
special knowledges, analyses, and injunctions settled upon it.

The situation was similar in the case of children’s sex. It 
is often said that the classical period consigned it to an 
obscurity from which it scarcely emerged before the Three 
Essays or the beneficent anxieties of Little Hans. It is true 
that a longstanding “freedom” of language between children 
and adults, or pupils and teachers, may have disappeared. 
No seventeenth-century pedagogue would have publicly ad¬ 
vised his disciple, as did Erasmus in his Dialogues, on the 
choice of a good prostitute. And the boisterous laughter that 
had accompanied the precocious sexuality of children for so 
long—and in all social classes, it seems—was gradually 
stifled. But this was not a plain and simple imposition of 
silence. Rather, it was a new regime of discourses. Not any 
less was said about it; on the contrary. But things were said 
in a different way; it was different people who said them, 
from different points of view, and in order to obtain different 
results. Silence itself—the things one declines to say, or is 
forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between 
diff erent speakers—is less the absolute limit of discourse, the 
other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, 
than an element that functions alongside the things said, with 
them and in relation to them within over-all strategies. There 
is no binary division to be made between what one says and 
what one does not say; we must try to determine the different 
ways of not saying such things, how those who can and those 
who cannot speak of them are distributed, which type of 
discourse is authorized, or which form of discretion is re¬ 
quired in either case. There is not one but many silences, and 
they are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and 
permeate discourses. 

Take the secondary schools of the eighteenth century, for 
example. On the whole, one can have the impression that sex 
was hardly spoken of at all in these institutions. But one only 
has to glance over the architectural layout, the rules of disci¬ 
pline, and their whole internal organization: the question of 
sex was a constant preoccupation. The builders considered it 



28

explicitly. The organizers took it permanently into account. 
All who held a measure of authority were placed in a state 
of perpetual alert, which the fixtures, the precautions taken, 
the interplay of punishments and responsibilities, never 
ceased to reiterate. The space for classes, the shape of the 
tables, the planning of the recreation lessons, the distribution 
of the dormitories (with or without partitions, with or with¬ 
out curtains), the rules for monitoring bedtime and sleep 
periods—all this referred, in the most prolix manner, to the 
sexuality of children. 12 What one might call the internal 
discourse of the institution—the one it employed to address 
itself, and which circulated among those who made it func¬ 
tion—was largely based on the assumption that this sexuality 
existed, that it was precocious, active, and ever present. But 
this was not all: the sex of the schoolboy became in the course 
of the eighteenth century—and quite apart from that of 
adolescents in general—a public problem. Doctors counseled 
the directors and professors of educational establishments, 
but they also gave their opinions to families; educators de¬ 
signed projects which they submitted to the authorities; 
schoolmasters turned to students, made recommendations to 
them, and drafted for their benefit books of exhortation, full 
of moral and medical examples. Around the schoolboy and 
his sex there prolif erated a whole literature of precepts, opin¬ 
ions, observations, medical advice, clinical cases, outlines for 
reform, and plans for ideal institutions. With Basedow and 
the German “philanthropic” movement, this transformation 
of adolescent sex into discourse grew to considerable dimen¬ 
sions. Salzmann even organized an experimental school 

,2 Reglement de police pour les lycees (1809), art. 67: “There shall always be, during 
class and study hours, an instructor watching the exterior, so as to prevent students 
who have gone out to relieve themselves from stopping and congregating. 

art. 68: “After the evening prayer, the students will be conducted back to the 
dormitory, where the schoolmasters will put them to bed at once. 

art. 69: “The masters will not retire except after having made certain that every 
student is in bed.

which owed its exceptional character to a supervision and 
education of sex so well thought out that youth’s universal 
sin would never need to be practiced there. And with all 
these measures taken, the child was not to be simply the mute 
and unconscious object of attentions prearranged between 
adults only; a certain reasonable, limited, canonical, and 
truthful discourse on sex was prescribed for him—a kind of 
discursive orthopedics. The great festival organized at the 
Philanthropinum in May of 1776 can serve as a vignette in 
this regard. Taking the form of an examination, mixed with 
floral games, the awarding of prizes, and a board of review, 
this was the first solemn communion of adolescent sex and 
reasonable discourse. In order to show the success of the sex 
education given the students, Basedow had invited all the 
dignitaries that Germany could muster (Goethe was one of 
the few to decline the invitation). Before the assembled pub¬ 
lic, one of the professors, a certain Wolke, asked the students 
selected questions concerning the mysteries of sex, birth, and 
procreation. He had them comment on engravings that de¬ 
picted a pregnant woman, a couple, and a cradle. The replies 
were enlightened, offered without shame or embarrassment. 
No unseemly laughter intervened to disturb them—except 
f rom the very ranks of an adult audience more childish than 
the children themselves, and whom Wolke severely repri¬ 
manded. At the end, they all applauded these cherub-faced 
boys who, in front of adults, had skillfully woven the gar¬ 
lands of discourse and sex. 13 

It would be less than exact to say that the pedagogical 
institution has imposed a ponderous silence on the sex of 
children and adolescents. On the contrary, since the eigh¬ 
teenth century it has multiplied the forms of discourse on the 
subject; it has established various points of implantation for 
sex; it has coded contents and qualified speakers. Speaking

about children’s sex, inducing educators, physicians, ad¬ 
ministrators, and parents to speak of it, or speaking to them 
about it, causing children themselves to talk about it, and 
enclosing them in a web of discourses which sometimes ad¬ 
dress them, sometimes speak about them, or impose canoni¬ 
cal bits of knowledge on them, or use them as a basis for 
constructing a science that is beyond their grasp—all this 
together enables us to link an intensification of the interven¬ 
tions of power to a multiplication of discourse. The sex of 
children and adolescents has become, since the eighteenth 
century, an important area of contention around which innu¬ 
merable institutional devices and discursive strategies have 
been deployed. It may well be true that adults and children 
themselves were deprived of a certain way of speaking about 
sex, a mode that was disallowed as being too direct, crude, 
or coarse. But this was only the counterpart of other dis¬ 
courses, and perhaps the condition necessary in order for 
them to function, discourses that were interlocking, hier¬ 
archized, and all highly articulated around a cluster of power 
relations. 

One could mention many other centers which in the eigh¬ 
teenth or nineteenth century began to produce discourses on 
sex. First there was medicine, via the “nervous disorders”; 
next psychiatry, when it set out to discover the etiology of 
mental illnesses, focusing its gaze first on “excess,” then 
onanism, then frustration, then “frauds against procrea¬ 
tion,” but especially when it annexed the whole of the sexual 
perversions as its own province; criminal justice, too, which 
had long been concerned with sexuality, particularly in the 
form of “heinous” crimes and crimes against nature, but 
which, toward the middle of the nineteenth century, broad¬ 
ened its jurisdiction to include petty offenses, minor indecen¬ 
cies, insignificant perversions; and lastly, all those social 
controls, cropping up at the end of the last century, which 
screened the sexuality of couples, parents and children, dan¬ 
gerous and endangered adolescents—undertaking to protect,

separate, and forewarn, signaling perils everywhere, awaken¬ 
ing people’s attention, calling for diagnoses, piling up re¬ 
ports, organizing therapies. These sites radiated discourses 
aimed at sex, intensif ying people’s awareness of it as a con¬ 
stant danger, and this in turn created a further incentive to 
talk about it. 

One day in 1867, a farm hand from the village of Lapcourt, 
who was somewhat simple-minded, employed here then 
there, depending on the season, living hand-to-mouth from 
a little charity or in exchange for the worst sort of labor, 
sleeping in barns and stables, was turned in to the authorities. 
At the border of a field, he had obtained a few caresses from 
a little girl, just as he had done before and seen done by the 
village urchins round about him; for, at the edge of the wood, 
or in the ditch by the road leading to Saint-Nicolas, they 
would play the familiar game called “curdled milk.” So he 
was pointed out by the girl’s parents to the mayor of the 
village, reported by the mayor to the gendarmes, led by the 
gendarmes to the judge, who indicted him and turned him 
over first to a doctor, then to two other experts who not only 
wrote their report but also had it published. 14 What is the 
significant thing about this story? The pettiness of it all; the 
fact that this everyday occurrence in the life of village sexual¬ 
ity, these inconsequential bucolic pleasures, could become, 
from a certain time, the object not only of a collective intoler¬ 
ance but of a judicial action, a medical intervention, a careful 
clinical examination, and an entire theoretical elaboration. 
The thing to note is that they went so far as to measure the 
brainpan, study the facial bone structure, and inspect for 
possible signs of degenerescence the anatomy of this person¬ 
age who up to that moment had been an integral part of 
village life; that they made him talk; that they questioned 
him concerning his thoughts, inclinations, habits, sensations, 
and opinions. And then, acquitting him of any crime, they

decided finally to make him into a pure object of medicine 
and knowledge—an object to be shut away till the end of his 
life in the hospital at Mareville, but also one to be made 
known to the world of learning through a detailed analysis. 
One can be fairly certain that during this same period the 
Lapcourt schoolmaster was instructing the little villagers to 
mind their language and not talk about all these things aloud. 
But this was undoubtedly one of the conditions enabling the 
institutions of knowledge and power to overlay this everyday 
bit of theater with their solemn discourse. So it was that our 
society—and it was doubtless the first in history to take such 
measures—assembled around these timeless gestures, these 
barely furtive pleasures between simple-minded adults and 
alert children, a whole machinery for speechifying, analyz¬ 
ing, and investigating. 

Between the licentious Englishman, who earnestly re¬ 
corded for his own purposes the singular episodes of his 
secret life, and his contemporary, this village halfwit who 
would give a few pennies to the little girls for favors the older 
ones refused him, there was without doubt a profound con¬ 
nection: in any case, from one extreme to the other, sex 
became something to say, and to say exhaustively in accord¬ 
ance with deployments that were varied, but all, in their own 
way, compelling. Whether in the form of a subtle confession 
in confidence or an authoritarian interrogation, sex—be it 
refined or rustic—had to be put into words. A great polymor¬ 
phous injunction bound the Englishman and the poor Lor- 
rainese peasant alike. As history would have it, the latter was 
named Jouy.* 

Since the eighteenth century, sex has not ceased to pro¬ 
voke a kind of generalized discursive erethism. And these 
discourses on sex did not multiply apart from or against 
power, but in the very space and as the means of its exercise. 
Incitements to speak were orchestrated from all quarters, 

*Jouy sounds like the past participle of jouir, the French verb meaning to enjoy, 
to delight in (something), but also to have an orgasm, to come. (Translator’s note) 



The Repressive Hypothesis

apparatuses everywhere for listening and recording, proce¬ 
dures for observing, questioning, and formulating. Sex was 
driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive 
existence. From the singular imperialism that compels every¬ 
one to transform their sexuality into a perpetual discourse, 
to the manifold mechanisms which, in the areas of economy, 
pedagogy, medicine, and justice, incite, extract, distribute, 
and institutionalize the sexual discourse, an immense verbos¬ 
ity is what our civilization has required and organized. 
Surely no other type of society has ever accumulated—and 
in such a relatively short span of time—a similar quantity of 
discourses concerned with sex. It may well be that we talk 
about sex more than anything else; we set our minds to the 
task; we convince ourselves that we have never said enough 
on the subject, that, through inertia or submissiveness, we 
conceal from ourselves the blinding evidence, and that what 
is essential always eludes us, so that we must always start out 
once again in search of it. It is possible that where sex is 
concerned, the most long-winded, the most impatient of soci¬ 
eties is our own. 

But as this first overview shows, we are dealing less with 
a discourse on sex than with a multiplicity of discourses 
produced by a whole series of mechanisms operating in diff¬ 
erent institutions. The Middle Ages had organized around 
the theme of the flesh and the practice of penance a discourse 
that was markedly unitary. In the course of recent centuries, 
this relative uniformity was broken apart, scattered, and 
multiplied in an explosion of distinct discursivities which 
took form in demography, biology, medicine, psychiatry, 
psychology, ethics, pedagogy, and political criticism. More 
precisely, the secure bond that held together the moral theol¬ 
ogy of concupiscence and the obligation of confession (equiv¬ 
alent to the theoretical discourse on sex and its first-person 
formulation) was, if not broken, at least loosened and diver¬ 
sified: between the objectification of sex in rational dis¬ 
courses, and the movement by which each individual was set 



34 


The History of Sexuality 


to the task of recounting his own sex, there has occurred, 
since the eighteenth century, a whole series of tensions, con¬ 
flicts, efforts at adjustment, and attempts at retranscription. 
So it is not simply in terms of a continual extension that we 
must speak of this discursive growth; it should be seen rather 
as a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated, 
a diversification of their forms, and the complex deployment 
of the network connecting them. Rather than the uniform 
concern to hide sex, rather than a general prudishness of 
language, what distinguishes these last three centuries is the 
variety, the wide dispersion of devices that were invented for 
speaking about it, for having it be spoken about, for inducing 
it to speak of itself, for listening, recording, transcribing, and 
Redistributing what is said about it: around sex, a whole 
network of varying, specific, and coercive transpositions into 
discourse. Rather than a massive censorship, beginning with 
the verbal proprieties imposed by the Age of Reason, what 
was involved was a regulated and polymorphous incitement 
to discourse. 

The objection will doubtless be raised that if so many 
stimulations and constraining mechanisms were necessary in 
order to speak of sex, this was because there reigned over 
everyone a certain fundamental prohibition; only definite 
necessities—economic pressures, political requirements— 
were able to lift this prohibition and open a few approaches 
to the discourse on sex, but these were limited and carefully 
coded; so much talk about sex, so many insistent devices 
contrived for causing it to be talked about—but under strict 
conditions: does this not prove that it was an object of se¬ 
crecy, and more important, that there is still an attempt to 
keep it that way? But this often-stated theme, that sex is 
outside of discourse and that only the removing of an obsta¬ 
cle, the breaking of a secret, can clear the way leading to it, 
is precisely what needs to be examined. Does it not partake 
of the injunction by which discourse is provoked? Is it not 
with the aim of inciting people to speak of sex that it is made 



The Repressive Hypothesis 


35 


to mirror, at the outer limit of every actual discourse, some¬ 
thing akin to a secret whose discovery is imperative, a thing 
abusively reduced to silence, and at the same time difficult 
and necessary, dangerous and precious to divulge? We must 
not forget that by making sex into that which, above all else, 
had to be confessed, the Christian pastoral always presented 
it as the disquieting enigma: not a thing which stubbornly 
shows itself, but one which always hides, the insidious pres¬ 
ence that speaks in a voice so muted and often disguised that 
one risks remaining deaf to it. Doubtless the secret does not 
reside in that basic reality in relation to which all the incite¬ 
ments to speak of sex are situated—whether they try to force 
the secret, or whether in some obscure way they reinforce it 
by the manner in which they speak of it. It is a question 
rather of a theme that forms part of the very mechanics of 
these incitements: a way of giving shape to the requirement 
to speak about the matter, a fable that is indispensable to the 
endlessly proliferating economy of the discourse on sex. 
What is peculiar to modern societies, in fact, is not that they 
consigned sex to a shadow existence, but that they dedicated 
themselves to speaking of it ad infinitum, while exploiting it 
as the secret.

The Perverse 
Implantation 


A possible objection: it would be a mistake to see in this 
proliferation of discourses merely a quantitative phenome¬ 
non, something like a pure increase, as if what was said in 
them were immaterial, as if the fact of speaking about sex 
were of itself more important than the forms of imperatives 
that were imposed on it by speaking about it. For was this 
transformation of sex into discourse not governed by the 
endeavor to expel from reality the forms of sexuality that 
were ntrt amenable to the strict economy of reproduction: to 
say no to unproductive activities, to banish casual pleasures, 
to reduce or exclude practices whose object was not procrea¬ 
tion? Through the various discourses, legal sanctions against 
minor perversions were multiplied; sexual irregularity was 
annexed to mental illness; from childhood to old age, a norm 
of sexual development was defined and all the possible devia¬ 
tions were carefully described; pedagogical controls and 
medical treatments were organized; around the least fanta¬ 
sies, moralists, but especially doctors, brandished the whole 
emphatic vocabulary of abomination. Were these anything 
more than means employed to absorb, for the benefit of a 
genitally centered sexuality, all the fruitless pleasures? All 
this garrulous attention which has us in a stew over sexuality, 
is it not motivated by one basic concern: to ensure popula-

tion, to reproduce labor capacity, to perpetuate the form of 
social relations: in short, to constitute a sexuality that is 
economically useful and politically conservative? 

I still do not know whether this is the ultimate objective. 
But this much is certain: reduction has not been the means 
employed for trying to achieve it. The nineteenth century 
and our own have been rather the age of multiplication: a 
dispersion of sexualities, a strengthening of their disparate 
forms, a multiple implantation of “perversions.” Our epoch 
has initiated sexual heterogeneities. 

Up to the end of the eighteenth century, three major explic¬ 
it codes—apart from the customary regularities and con¬ 
straints of opinion—governed sexual practices: canonical 
law, the Christian pastoral, and civil law. They determined, 
each in its own way, the division between licit and illicit. 
They were all centered on matrimonial relations: the marital 
obligation, the ability to fulfill it, the manner in which one 
complied with it, the requirements and violences that accom¬ 
panied it, the useless or unwarranted caresses for which it 
was a pretext, its fecundity or the way one went about mak¬ 
ing it sterile, the moments when one demanded it (dangerous 
periods of pregnancy or breast-feeding, forbidden times of 
Lent or abstinence), its frequency or infrequency, and so on. 
It was this domain that was especially saturated with pre¬ 
scriptions. The sex of husband and wife was beset by rules 
and recommendations. The marriage relation was the most 
intense focus of constraints; it was spoken of more than 
anything else; more than any other relation, it was required 
to give a detailed accounting of itself. It was under constant 
surveillance: if it was found to be lacking, it had to come 
forward and plead its case before a witness. The “rest” re¬ 
mained a good deal more confused: one only has to think of 
the uncertain status of “sodomy,” or the indifference regard¬ 
ing the sexuality of children. 

Moreover, these different codes did not make a clear dis¬ 
tinction between violations of the rules of marriage and 



38 


The History of Sexuality 


deviations with respect to genitality. Breaking the rules of 
marriage or seeking strange pleasures brought an equal meas¬ 
ure of condemnation. On the list of grave sins, and separated 
only by their relative importance, there appeared debauchery 
(extramarital relations), adultery, rape, spiritual or carnal 
incest, but also sodomy, or the mutual “caress.” As to the 
courts, they could condemn homosexuality as well as infi¬ 
delity, marriage without parental consent, or bestiality. 
What was taken into account in the civil and religious juris¬ 
dictions alike was a general unlawfulness. Doubtless acts 
“contrary to nature” were stamped as especially abominable, 
but they were perceived simply as an extreme form of acts 
“against the law”; they were infringements of decrees which 
were just as sacred as those of marriage, and which had been 
established for governing the order of things and the plan of 
beings. Prohibitions bearing on sex were essentially of a 
juridical nature. The “nature” on which they were based was 
still a kind of law. For a long time hermaphrodites were 
criminals, or crime’s offspring, since their anatomical dispo¬ 
sition, their very being, confounded the law that distin¬ 
guished the sexes and prescribed their union. 

The discursive explosion of the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries caused this system centered on legitimate alliance 
to undergo two modifications. First, a centrifugal movement 
with respect to heterosexual monogamy. Of course, the array 
of practices and pleasures continued to be referred to it as 
their internal standard; but it was spoken of less and less, or 
in any case with a growing moderation. Efforts to find out 
its secrets were abandoned; nothing further was demanded 
of it than to define itself from day to day. The legitimate 
couple, with its regular sexuality, had a right to more discre¬ 
tion. It tended to function as a norm, one that was stricter, 
perhaps, but quieter. On the other hand, what came under 
scrutiny was the sexuality of children, mad men and women, 
and criminals; the sensuality of those who did not like the 
opposite sex; reveries, obsessions, petty manias, or great tran- 



The Repressive Hypothesis

sports of rage. It was time for all these figures, scarcely 
noticed in the past, to step forward and speak, to make the 
difficult confession of what they were. No doubt they were 
condemned all the same; but they were listened to; and if 
regular sexuality happened to be questioned once again, it 
was through a reflux movement, originating in these periph¬ 
eral sexualities. 

Whence the setting apart of the “unnatural” as a specific 
dimension in the field of sexuality. This kind of activity 
assumed an autonomy with regard to the other condemned 
forms such as adultery or rape (and the latter were con¬ 
demned less and less): to marry a close relative or practice 
sodomy, to seduce a nun or engage in sadism, to deceive 
one’s wife or violate cadavers, became things that were essen¬ 
tially different. The area covered by the Sixth Command¬ 
ment began to fragment. Similarly, in the civil order, the 
confused category of “debauchery,” which for more than a 
century had been one of the most frequent reasons for ad¬ 
ministrative confinement, came apart. From the debris, there 
appeared on the one hand infractions against the legislation 
(or morality) pertaining to marriage and the family, and on 
the other, offenses against the regularity of a natural function 
(offenses which, it must be added, the law was apt to punish). 
Here we have a likely reason, among others, for the prestige 
of Don Juan, which three centuries have not erased. Under¬ 
neath the great violator of the rules of marriage—stealer of 
wives, seducer of virgins, the shame of families, and an insult 
to husbands and fathers—another personage can be 
glimpsed: the individual driven, in spite of himself, by the 
somber madness of sex. Underneath the libertine, the per¬ 
vert. He deliberately breaks the law, but at the same time, 
something like a nature gone awry transports him far from 
all nature; his death is the moment when the supernatural 
return of the crime and its retribution thwarts the flight into 
counternature. There were two great systems conceived by 
the West for governing sex: the law of marriage and the order 



40

of desires—and the life of Don Juan overturned them both. 
We shall leave it to psychoanalysts to speculate whether he 
was homosexual, narcissistic, or impotent. 

Although not without delay and equivocation, the natural 
laws of matrimony and the immanent rules of sexuality 
began to be recorded on two separate registers. There 
emerged a world of perversion which partook of that of legal 
or moral infraction, yet was not simply a variety of the latter. 
An entire sub-race race was bom, different—despite certain 
kinship ties—from the libertines of the past. From the end 
of the eighteenth century to our own, they circulated through 
the pores of society; they were always hounded, but not 
always by laws; were often locked up, but not always in 
prisons; were sick perhaps, but scandalous, dangerous vic¬ 
tims, prey to a strange evil that also bore the name of vice 
and sometimes crime. They were children wise beyond their 
years, precocious little girls, ambiguous schoolboys, dubious 
servants and educators, cruel or maniacal husbands, solitary 
collectors, ramblers with bizarre impulses; they haunted the 
houses of correction, the penal colonies, the tribunals, and 
the asylums; they carried their infamy to the doctors and 
their sickness to the judges. This was the numberless family 
of perverts who were on friendly terms with delinquents and 
akin to madmen. In the course of the century they succes¬ 
sively bore the stamp of “moral folly,” “genital neurosis,” 
“aberration of the genetic instinct,” “degenerescence,” or 
“physical imbalance.” 

What does the appearance of all these peripheral sexuali¬ 
ties signify? Is the fact that they could appear in broad day¬ 
light a sign that the code had become more lax? Or does the 
fact that they were given so much attention testify to a 
stricter regime and to its concern to bring them under close 
supervision? In terms of repression, things are unclear. There 
was permissiveness, if one bears in mind that the severity of 
the codes relating to sexual offenses diminished considerably 
in the nineteenth century and that law itself often deferred 



The Repressive Hypothesis

to medicine. But an additional ruse of severity, if one thinks 
of all the agencies of control and all the mechanisms of 
surveillance that were put into operation by pedagogy or 
therapeutics. It may be the case that the intervention of the 
Church in conjugal sexuality and its rejection of “frauds” 
against procreation had lost much of their insistence over the 
previous two hundred years. But medicine made a forceful 
entry into the pleasures of the couple: it created an entire 
organic, functional, or mental pathology arising out of “in¬ 
complete” sexual practices; it carefully classified all forms of 
related pleasures; it incorporated them into the notions of 
“development” and instinctual “disturbances”; and it under¬ 
took to manage them. 

Perhaps the point to consider is not the level of indulgence 
or the quantity of repression but the form of power that was 
exercised. When this whole thicket of disparate sexualities 
was labeled, as if to disentangle them from one another, was 
the object to exclude them from reality? It appears, in fact, 
that the function of the power exerted in this instance was 
not that of interdiction, and that it involved four operations 
quite different from simple prohibition. 

1. Take the ancient prohibitions of consanguine marriages 
(as numerous and complex as they were) or the condemna¬ 
tion of adultery, with its inevitable frequency of occurrence; 
or on the other hand, the recent controls through which, 
since the nineteenth century, the sexuality of children has 
been subordinated and their “solitary habits” interfered 
with. It is clear that we are not dealing with one and the same 
power mechanism. Not only because in the one case it is a 
question of law and penality, and in the other, medicine and 
regimentation; but also because the tactics employed is not 
the same. On the surface, what appears in both cases is an 
effort at elimination that was always destined to fail and 
always constrained to begin again. But the prohibition of 
“incests” attempted to reach its objective through an asymp¬ 
totic decrease in the thing it condemned, whereas the control 



42 


The History of Sexuality 


of infantile sexuality hoped to reach it through a simulta¬ 
neous propagation of its own power and of the object on 
which it was brought to bear. It proceeded in accordance 
with a twofold increase extended indefinitely. Educators and 
doctors combatted children’s onanism like an epidemic that 
needed to be eradicated. What this actually entailed, 
throughout this whole secular campaign that mobilized the 
adult world around the sex of children, was using these 
tenuous pleasures as a prop, constituting them as secrets 
(that is, forcing them into hiding so as to make possible their 
discovery), tracing them back to their source, tracking them 
from their origins to their effects, searching out everything 
that might cause them or simply enable them to exist. Wher¬ 
ever there was the chance they might appear, devices of 
surveillance were installed; traps were laid for compelling 
admissions; inexhaustible and corrective discourses were im¬ 
posed; parents and teachers were alerted, and left with the 
suspicion that all children were guilty, and with the fear of 
being themselves at fault if their suspicions were not suffi¬ 
ciently strong; they were kept in readiness in the face of this 
recurrent danger; their conduct was prescribed and their 
pedagogy recodified; an entire medico-sexual regime took 
hold of the family milieu. The child’s “vice” was not so much 
an enemy as a support; it may have been designated as the 
evil to be eliminated, but the extraordinary effort that went 
into the task that was bound to fail leads one to suspect that 
what was demanded of it was to persevere, to proliferate to 
the limits of the visible and the invisible, rather than to 
disappear for good. Always relying on this support, power 
advanced, multiplied its relays and its effects, while its target 
expanded, subdivided, and branched out, penetrating further 
into reality at the same pace. In appearance, we are dealing 
with a barrier system; but in fact, all around the child, indefi¬ 
nite lines of penetration were disposed.

tailed an incorporation of perversions and a new specification

of individuals. As defined by the ancient civil or canonical 
codes, sodomy was a category of forbidden acts; their perpe¬ 
trator was nothing more than the juridical subject of them. 
The nineteenth-century homosexual became a personage, a 
past, a case history, and a childhood, in addition to being a 
type of life, a life form, and a morphology, with an indiscreet 
anatomy and possibly a mysterious physiology. Nothing that 
went into his total composition was unaff ected by his sexual¬ 
ity. It was everywhere present in him: at the root of all his 
actions because it was their insidious and indefinitely active 
principle; written immodestly on his face and body because 
it was a secret that always gave itself away. It was consub- 
stantial with him, less as a habitual sin than as a singular 
nature. We must not forget that the psychological, psychiat¬ 
ric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from 
the moment it was characterized—Westphal’s famous article 
of 1870 on “contrary sexual sensations” can stand as its date 
of birth 1 —less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain 
quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the 
masculine and the feminine in oneself. Homosexuality ap¬ 
peared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was tran¬ 
sposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior 
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had 
been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a 
species. 

So too were all those minor perverts whom nineteenth- 
century psychiatrists entomologized by giving them strange 
baptismal names: there were KrafFt-Ebing’s zoophiles and 
zooerasts, Rohleder’s auto-monosexualists; and later, mixo- 
scopophiles, gynecomasts, presbyophiles, sexoesthetic in¬ 
verts, and dyspareunist women. These fine names for heresies 
referred to a nature that was overlooked by the law, but not 
so neglectful of itself that it did not go on producing more 
species, even where there was no order to fit them into. The

machinery of power that focused on this whole alien strain 
did not aim to suppress it, but rather to give it an analytical, 
visible, and permanent reality: it was implanted in bodies, 
slipped in beneath modes of conduct, made into a principle 
of classification and intelligibility, established as a raison 
d'etre and a natural order of disorder. Not the exclusion of 
these thousand aberrant sexualities, but the specification, the 
regional solidification of each one of them. The strategy 
behind this dissemination was to strew reality with them and 
incorporate them into the individual. 

3. More than the old taboos, this form of power demanded 
constant, attentive, and curious presences for its exercise; it 
presupposed proximities; it proceeded through examination 
and insistent observation; it required an exchange of dis¬ 
courses, through questions that extorted admissions, and 
confidences that went beyond the questions that were asked. 
It implied a physical proximity and an interplay of intense 
sensations. The medicalization of the sexually peculiar was 
both the effect and the instrument of this. Imbedded in bod¬ 
ies, becoming deeply characteristic of individuals, the oddi¬ 
ties of sex relied on a technology of health and pathology. 
And conversely, since sexuality was a medical and medicaliz- 
able object, one had to try and detect it—as a lesion, a 
dysfunction, or a symptom—in the depths of the organism, 
or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of 
behavior. The power which thus took charge of sexuality set 
about contacting bodies, caressing them with its eyes, inten¬ 
sifying areas, electrifying surfaces, dramatizing troubled mo¬ 
ments. It wrapped the sexual body in its embrace. There was 
undoubtedly an increase in effectiveness and an extension of 
the domain controlled; but also a sensualization of power and 
a gain of pleasure. This produced a twofold effect: an impetus 
was given to power through its very exercise; an emotion 
rewarded the overseeing control and carried it further; the 
intensity of the confession renewed the questioner’s curios¬ 
ity; the pleasure discovered fed back to the power that encir-

cled it. But so many pressing questions singularized the 
pleasures felt by the one who had to reply. They were fixed 
by a gaze, isolated and animated by the attention they re¬ 
ceived. Power operated as a mechanism of attraction; it drew 
out those peculiarities over which it kept watch. Pleasure 
spread to the power that harried it; power anchored the 
pleasure it uncovered. 

The medical examination, the psychiatric investigation, 
the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the 
over-all and apparent objective of saying no to all wayward 
or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function 
as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power. 
The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions, 
monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to 
light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at 
having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty 
it. The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is 
pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleas¬ 
ure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting. Capture and 
seduction, confrontation and mutual reinforcement: parents 
and children, adults and adolescents, educator and students, 
doctors and patients, the psychiatrist with his hysteric and 
his perverts, all have played this game continually since the 
nineteenth century. These attractions, these evasions, these 
circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes, 
not boundaries not to be crossed, but perpetual spirals of 
power and pleasure. 

4. Whence those devices of sexual saturation so character¬ 
istic of the space and the social rituals of the nineteenth 
century. People often say that modern society has attempted 
to reduce sexuality to the couple—the heterosexual and, in¬ 
sofar as possible, legitimate couple. There are equal grounds 
for saying that it has, if not created, at least outfitted and 
made to proliferate, groups with multiple elements and a 
circulating sexuality: a distribution of points of power, hier¬ 
archized and placed opposite to one another; “pursued” 



46 


The History of Sexuality 


pleasures, that is, both sought after and searched out; com- 
partmental sexualities that are tolerated or encouraged; 
proximities that serve as surveillance procedures, and func¬ 
tion as mechanisms of intensification; contacts that operate 
as inductors. This is the way things worked in the case of the 
family, or rather the household, with parents, children, and 
in some instances, servants. Was the nineteenth-century fam¬ 
ily really a monogamic and conjugal cell? Perhaps to a cer¬ 
tain extent. But it was also a network of pleasures and powers 
linked together at multiple points and according to trans¬ 
formable relationships. The separation of grown-ups and 
children, the polarity established between the parents’ bed¬ 
room and that of the children (it became routine in the 
course of the century when working-class housing construc¬ 
tion was undertaken), the relative segregation of boys and 
girls, the strict instructions as to the care of nursing infants 
(maternal breast-feeding, hygiene), the attention focused on 
infantile sexuality, the supposed dangers of masturbation, 
the importance attached to puberty, the methods of surveil¬ 
lance suggested to parents, the exhortations, secrets, and 
fears, the presence—both valued and feared—of servants: all 
this made the family, even when brought down to its smallest 
dimensions, a complicated network, saturated with multiple, 
fragmentary, and mobile sexualities. To reduce them to the 
conjugal relationship, and then to project the latter, in the 
form of a forbidden desire, onto the children, cannot account 
for this apparatus which, in relation to these sexualities, was 
less a principle of inhibition than an inciting and multiplying 
mechanism. Educational or psychiatric institutions, with 
their large populations, their hierarchies, their spatial ar¬ 
rangements, their surveillance systems, constituted, along¬ 
side the family, another way of distributing the interplay of 
powers and pleasures; but they too delineated areas of ex¬ 
treme sexual saturation, with privileged spaces or rituals 
such as the classroom, the dormitory, the visit, and the con¬ 
sultation. The forms of a nonconjugal, nonmonogamous sex¬ 
uality were drawn there and established. 



The Repressive Hypothesis 


47 


Nineteenth-century “bourgeois” society—and it is doubt¬ 
less still with us—was a society of blatant and fragmented 
perversion. And this was not by way of hypocrisy, for noth¬ 
ing was more manifest and more prolix, or more manifestly 
taken over by discourses and institutions. Not because, hav¬ 
ing tried to erect too rigid or too general a barrier against 
sexuality, society succeeded only in giving rise to a whole 
perverse outbreak and a long pathology of the sexual instinct. 
At issue, rather, is the type of power it brought to bear on 
the body and on sex. In point of fact, this power had neither 
the form of the law, nor the effects of the taboo. On the 
contrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities. It 
did not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various 
forms of sexuality, pursuing them according to lines of indefi¬ 
nite penetration. It did not exclude sexuality, but included it 
in the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It did 
not seek to avoid it; it attracted its varieties by means of 
spirals in which pleasure and power reinforced one another. 
It did not set up a barrier; it provided places of maximum 
saturation. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic. 
Modern society is perverse, not in spite of its puritanism or 
as if from a backlash provoked by its hypocrisy; it is in actual 
fact, and directly, perverse. 

In actual fact. The manifold sexualities—those which ap¬ 
pear with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the 
child), those which become fixated on particular tastes or 
practices (the sexuality of the invert, the gerontophile, the 
fetishist), those which, in a diffuse manner, invest relation¬ 
ships (the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher and stu¬ 
dent, psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt 
spaces (the sexuality of the home, the school, the prison)— 
all form the correlate of exact procedures of power. We must 
not imagine that all these things that were formerly tolerated 
attracted notice and received a pejorative designation when 
the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of 
sexuality that was capable of reproducing labor power and 
the form of the family. These polymorphous conducts were 



48 


The History of Sexuality 


actually extracted from people’s bodies and from their pleas¬ 
ures; or rather, they were solidified in them; they were drawn 
out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by mul¬ 
tifarious power devices. The growth of perversions is not a 
moralizing theme that obssessed the scrupulous minds of the 
Victorians. It is the real product of the encroachment of a 
type of power on bodies and their pleasures. It is possible that 
the West has not been capable of inventing any new pleas¬ 
ures, and it has doubtless not discovered any original vices. 
But it has defined new rules for the game of powers and 
pleasures. The frozen countenance of the perversions is a 
fixture of this game. 

Directly. This implantation of multiple perversions is not 
a mockery of sexuality taking revenge on a power that has 
thrust on it an excessively repressive law. Neither are we 
dealing with paradoxical forms of pleasure that turn back on 
power and invest it in the form of a “pleasure to be endured.” 
The implantation of perversions is an instrument-effect: it is 
through the isolation, intensification, and consolidation of 
peripheral sexualities that the relations of power to sex and 
pleasure branched out and multiplied, measured the body, 
and penetrated modes of conduct. And accompanying this 
encroachment of powers, scattered sexualities rigidified, be¬ 
came stuck to an age, a place, a type of practice. A prolifera¬ 
tion of sexualities through the extension of power; an optimi¬ 
zation of the power to which each of these local sexualities 
gave a surface of intervention: this concatenation, particu¬ 
larly since the nineteenth century, has been ensured and 
relayed by the countless economic interests which, with the 
help of medicine, psychiatry, prostitution, and pornography, 
have tapped into both this analytical multiplication of pleas¬ 
ure and this optimization of the power that controls it. Pleas¬ 
ure and power do not cancel or turn back against 
one another; they seek out, overlap, and reinforce one an¬ 
other. They are linked together by complex mechanisms and 
devices of excitation and incitement. 



The Repressive Hypothesis 


49 


We must therefore abandon the hypothesis that modern 
industrial societies ushered in an age of increased sexual 
repression. We have not only witnessed a visible explosion of 
unorthodox sexualities; but—and this is the important point 
—a deployment quite different from the law, even if it is 
locally dependent on procedures of prohibition, has ensured, 
through a network of interconnecting mechanisms, the pro¬ 
liferation of specific pleasures and the multiplication of dis¬ 
parate sexualities. It is said that no society has been more 
prudish; never have the agencies of power taken such care to 
feign ignorance of the thing they prohibited, as if they were 
determined to have nothing to do with it. But it is the oppo¬ 
site that has become apparent, at least after a general review 
of the facts: never have there existed more centers of power; 
never more attention manifested and verbalized; never more 
circular contacts and linkages; never more sites where the 
intensity of pleasures and the persistency of power catch 
hold, only to spread elsewhere. 




PART THREE 

Scientia Sexualis 




I suppose that the first two points will be granted me; I 
imagine that people will accept my saying that, for two cen¬ 
turies now, the discourse on sex has been multiplied rather 
than rarefied; and that if it has carried with it taboos and 
prohibitions, it has also, in a more fundamental way, ensured 
the solidification and implantation of an entire sexual mo¬ 
saic. Yet the impression remains that all this has by and large 
played only a defensive role. By speaking about it so much, 
by discovering it multiplied, partitioned off, and specified 
precisely where one had placed it, what one was seeking 
essentially was simply to conceal sex: a screen-discourse, a 
dispersion-avoidance. Until Freud at least, the discourse on 
sex—the discourse of scholars and theoreticians—never 
ceased to hide the thing it was speaking about. We could take 
all these things that were said, the painstaking precautions 
and detailed analyses, as so many procedures meant to evade 
the unbearable, too hazardous truth of sex. And the mere 
fact that one claimed to be speaking about it from the rarefied 
and neutral viewpoint of a science is in itself significant. This 
was in fact a science made up of evasions since, given its 
inability or refusal to speak of sex itself, it concerned itself 
primarily with aberrations, perversions, exceptional oddities, 
pathological abatements, and morbid aggravations. It was by 
the same token a science subordinated in the main to the 
imperatives of a morality whose divisions it reiterated under 
the guise of the medical norm. Claiming to speak the truth, 
it stirred up people’s fears; to the least oscillations of sexual¬ 
ity, it ascribed an imaginary dynasty of evils destined to be 
passed on for generations; it declared the furtive customs of 
the timid, and the most solitary of petty manias, dangerous

for the whole society; strange pleasures, it warned, would 
eventually result in nothing short of death: that of individu¬ 
als, generations, the species itself. 

It thus became associated with an insistent and indiscreet 
medical practice, glibly proclaiming its aversions, quick to 
run to the rescue of law and public opinion, more servile with 
respect to the powers of order than amenable to the require¬ 
ments of truth. Involuntarily naive in the best of cases, more 
often intentionally mendacious, in complicity with what it 
denounced, haughty and coquettish, it established an entire 
pornography of the morbid, which was characteristic of the 
fin desiecle society. In France, doctors like Gamier, Pouillet, 
and Ladoucette were its unglorified scribes and Rollinat its 
poet. But beyond these troubled pleasures, it assumed other 
powers; it set itself up as the supreme authority in matters 
of hygienic necessity, taking up the old fears of venereal 
affliction and combining them with the new themes of asep¬ 
sis, and the great evolutionist myths with the recent institu¬ 
tions of public health; it claimed to ensure the physical vigor 
and the moral cleanliness of the social body; it promised to 
eliminate defective individuals, degenerate and bastardized 
populations. In the name of a biological and historical ur¬ 
gency, it justified the racisms of the state, which at the time 
were on the horizon. It grounded them in “truth.” 

When we compare these discourses on human sexuality 
with what was known at the time about the physiology of 
animal and plant reproduction, we are struck by the incon¬ 
gruity. Their feeble content from the standpoint of elemen¬ 
tary rationality, not to mention scientificity, earns them a 
place apart in the history of knowledge. They form a 
strangely muddled zone. Throughout the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very 
distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction, 
which developed continuously according to a general scien¬ 
tific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite 
different rules of formation. From one to the other, there was 



Scientia Sexualis 


55 


no real exchange, no reciprocal structuration; the role of the 
first with respect to the second was scarcely more than as a 
distant and quite fictitious guarantee: a blanket guarantee 
under cover of which moral obstacles, economic or political 
options, and traditional fears could be recast in a scientific- 
sounding vocabulary. It is as if a fundamental resistance 
blocked the development of a rationally formed discourse 
concerning human sex, its correlations, and its effects. A 
disparity of this sort would indicate that the aim of such a 
discourse was not to state the truth but to prevent its very 
emergence. Underlying the difference between the physiol¬ 
ogy of reproduction and the medical theories of sexuality, we 
would have to see something other and something more than 
an uneven scientific development or a disparity in the forms 
of rationality; the one would partake of that immense will to 
knowledge which has sustained the establishment of scien¬ 
tific discourse in the West, whereas the other would derive 
from a stubborn will to nonknowledge. 

This much is undeniable: the learned discourse on sex that 
was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with 
age-old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a 
refusal to see and to understand; but further—and this is the 
crucial point—a refusal concerning the very thing that was 
brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solic¬ 
ited. For there can be no misunderstanding that is not based 
on a fundamental relation to truth. Evading this truth, bar¬ 
ring access to it, masking it: these were so many local tactics 
which, as if by superimposition and through a last-minute 
detour, gave a paradoxical form to a fundamental petition to 
know. Choosing not to recognize was yet another vagary of 
the will to truth. Let Charcot’s Salpetriere serve as an exam¬ 
ple in this regard: it was an enormous apparatus for observa¬ 
tion, with its examinations, interrogations, and experiments, 
but it was also a machinery for incitement, with its public 
presentations, its theater of ritual crises, carefully staged 
with the help of ether or amyl nitrate, its interplay of dia- 



56

logues, palpations, laying on of hands, postures which the 
doctors elicited or obliterated with a gesture or a word, its 
hierarchy of personnel who kept watch, organized, pro¬ 
voked, monitored, and reported, and who accumulated an 
immense pyramid of observations and dossiers. It is in the 
context of this continuous incitement to discourse and to 
truth that the real mechanisms of misunderstanding (mecon- 
naissance) operated: thus Charcot’s gesture interrupting a 
public consultation where it began to be too manifestly a 
question of “that”; and the more frequent practice of delet¬ 
ing from the succession of dossiers what had been said and 
demonstrated by the patients regarding sex, but also what 
had been seen, provoked, solicited by the doctors themselves, 
things that were almost entirely omitted from the published 
observations. 1 The important thing, in this affair, is not that 
these men shut their eyes or stopped their ears, or that they 
were mistaken; it is rather that they constructed around and 
apropos of sex an immense apparatus for producing truth, 
even if this truth was to be masked at the last moment. The 
essential point is that sex was not only a matter of sensation 
and pleasure, of law and taboo, but also of truth and false¬ 
hood, that the truth of sex became something fundamental, 
useful, or dangerous, precious or formidable: in short, that 
sex was constituted as a problem of truth. What needs to be 
situated, therefore, is not the threshold of a new rationality 
whose discovery was marked by Freud—or someone else— 
but the progressive formation (and also the transformations) 

'Cf., for example, Desire Bourneville, Iconographiephotographique de la Salpetriere 
(1878-1881), pp. 110 ff. The unpublished documents dealing with the lessons of 
Charcot, which can still be found at the Salpetriere, are again more explicit on this 
point than the published texts. The interplay of incitement and elision is clearly 
evident in them. A handwritten note gives an account of the session of November 
25, 1877. The subject exhibits hysterical spasms; Charcot suspends an attack by 
placing first his hand, then the end of a baton, on the woman’s ovaries. He with¬ 
draws the baton, and there is a fresh attack, which he accelerates by administering 
inhalations of amyl nitrate. The afflicted woman then cries out for the sex-baton in 
words that are devoid of any metaphor; “G. is taken away and her delirium 
continues.”

of that “interplay of truth and sex” which was bequeathed 
to us by the nineteenth century, and which we may have 
modified, but, lacking evidence to the contrary, have not rid 
ourselves of. Misunderstandings, avoidances, and evasions 
were only possible, and only had their effects, against the 
background of this strange endeavor: to tell the truth of sex. 
An endeavor that does not date from the nineteenth century, 
even if it was then that a nascent science lent it a singular 
form. It was the basis of all the aberrant, naive, and cunning 
discourses where knowledge of sex seems to have strayed for 
such a long time. 

Historically, there have been two great procedures for 
producing the truth of sex. 

On the one hand, the societies—and they are numerous: 
China, Japan, India, Rome, the Arabo-Moslem societies— 
which endowed themselves with an ars erotica. In the erotic 
art, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a 
practice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not con¬ 
sidered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and 
the forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but 
first and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as 
pleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific qual¬ 
ity, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul. 
Moreover, this knowledge must be deflected back into the 
sexual practice itself, in order to shape it as though from 
within and amplify its effects. In this way, there is formed a 
knowledge that must remain secret, not because of an ele¬ 
ment of infamy that might attach to its object, but because 
of the need to hold it in the greatest reserve, since, according 
to tradition, it would lose its effectiveness and its virtue by 
being divulged. Consequently, the relationship to the master 
who holds the secrets is of paramount importance; only he, 
working alone, can transmit this art in an esoteric manner 
and as the culmination of an initiation in which hejguides the 
disciple’s progress with unfailing skill and severity. The 



58 


The History of Sexuality 


effects of this masterful art, which are considerably more 
generous than the spareness of its prescriptions would lead 
one to imagine, are said to transfigure the one fortunate 
enough to receive its privileges: an absolute mastery of the 
body, a singular bliss, obliviousness to time and limits, the 
elixir of life, the exile of death and its threats. 

On the face of it at least, our civilization possesses no ars 
erotica. In return, it is undoubtedly the only civilization to 
practice a scientia sexualis; or rather, the only civilization to 
have developed over the centuries procedures for telling the 
truth of sex which are geared to a form of knowledge-power 
strictly opposed to the art of initiations and the masterful 
secret: I have in mind the confession. 

Since the Middle Ages at least, Western societies have 
established the confession as one of the main rituals we rely 
on for the production of truth: the codification of the sacra¬ 
ment of penance by the Lateran Council in 1215, with the 
resulting development of confessional techniques, the declin¬ 
ing importance of accusatory procedures in criminal justice, 
the abandonment of tests of guilt (sworn statements, duels, 
judgments of God) and the development of methods of inter¬ 
rogation and inquest, the increased participation of the royal 
administration in the prosecution of infractions, at the ex¬ 
pense of proceedings leading to private settlements, the set¬ 
ting up of tribunals of Inquisition: all this helped to give the 
confession a central role in the order of civil and religious 
powers. The evolution of the word avowal and of the legal 
function it designated is itself emblematic of this develop¬ 
ment: from being a guarantee of the status, identity, and 
value granted to one person by another, it came to signify 
someone’s acknowledgment of his own actions and thoughts. 
For a long time, the individual was vouched for by the refer¬ 
ence of others and the demonstration of his ties to the com¬ 
monweal (family, allegiance, protection); then he was 
authenticated by the discourse of truth he was able or obliged 
to pronounce concerning himself. The truthful confession 



Scientia Sexualis 


59 


was inscribed at the heart of the procedures of individualiza¬ 
tion by power. 

In any case, next to the testing rituals, next to the testi¬ 
mony of witnesses, and the learned methods of observation 
and demonstration, the confession became one of the West’s 
most highly valued techniques for producing truth. We have 
since become a singularly confessing society. The confession 
has spread its effects far and wide. It plays a part in justice, 
medicine, education, family relationships, and love relations, 
in the most ordinary affairs of everyday life, and in the most 
solemn rites; one confesses one’s crimes, one’s sins, one’s 
thoughts and desires, one’s illnesses and troubles; one goes 
about telling, with the greatest precision, whatever is most 
difficult to tell. One confesses in public and in private, to 
one’s parents, one’s educators, one’s doctor, to those one 
loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things 
it would be impossible to tell to anyone else, the things people 
write books about. One confesses—or is forced to confess. 
When it is not spontaneous or dictated by some internal 
imperative, the confession is wrung from a person by vio¬ 
lence or threat; it is driven from its hiding place in the soul, 
or extracted from the body. Since the Middle Ages, torture 
has accompanied it like a shadow, and supported it when it 
could go no further: the dark twins. 2 The most defenseless 
tenderness and the bloodiest of powers have a similar need 
of confession. Western man has become a confessing animal. 

Whence a metamorphosis in literature: we have passed 
from a pleasure to be recounted and heard, centering on the 
heroic or marvelous narration of “trials” of bravery or saint¬ 
hood, to a literature ordered according to the infinite task of 
extracting from the depths of oneself, in between the words, 
a truth which the very form of the confession holds out like 
a shimmering mirage. Whence too this new way of philo¬ 
sophizing: seeking the fundamental relation to the true, not 

’Greek law had already coupled torture and confession, at least where slaves were 
concerned, and Imperial Roman law had widened the practice. 



60 


The History of Sexuality 


simply in oneself—in some forgotten knowledge, or in a 
certain primal trace—but in the self-examination that yields, 
through a multitude of fleeting impressions, the basic cer¬ 
tainties of consciousness. The obligation to confess is now 
relayed through so many different points, is so deeply in¬ 
grained in us, that we no longer perceive it as the effect of 
a power that constrains us; on the contrary, it seems to us 
that truth, lodged in our most secret nature, “demands” only 
to surface; that if it fails to do so, this is because a constraint 
holds it in place, the violence of a power weighs it down, and 
it can finally be articulated only at the price of a kind of 
liberation. Confession frees, but power reduces one to si¬ 
lence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares 
an original affinity with freedom: traditional themes in phi¬ 
losophy, which a “political history of truth” would have to 
overturn by showing that truth is not by nature free—nor 
error servile—but that its production is thoroughly imbued 
with relations of power. The confession is an example of this. 

One has to be completely taken in by this internal ruse of 
confession in order to attribute a fundamental role to censor¬ 
ship, to taboos regarding speaking and thinking; one has to 
have an inverted image of power in order to believe that all 
these voices which have spoken so long in our civilization— 
repeating the formidable injunction to tell what one is and 
what one does, what one recollects and what one has forgot¬ 
ten, what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not 
thinking—are speaking to us of freedom. An immense labor 
to which the West has submitted generations in order to 
produce—while other forms of work ensured the accumula¬ 
tion of capital—men’s subjection: their constitution as sub¬ 
jects in both senses of the word. Imagine how exorbitant 
must have seemed the order given to all Christians at the 
beginning of the thirteenth century, to kneel at least once a 
year and confess to all their transgressions, without omitting 
a single one. And think of that obscure partisan, seven centu¬ 
ries later, who had come to rejoin the Serbian resistance deep

in the mountains; his superiors asked him to write his life 
story; and when he brought them a few miserable pages, 
scribbled in the night, they did not look at them but only said 
to him, “Start over, and tell the truth.” Should those much- 
discussed language taboos make us forget this millennial 
yoke of confession? 

From the Christian penance to the present day, sex was a 
privileged theme of confession. A thing that was hidden, we 
are told. But what if, on the contrary, it was what, in a quite 
particular way, one confessed? Suppose the obligation to 
conceal it was but another aspect of the duty to admit to it 
(concealing it all the more and with greater care as the 
confession of it was more important, requiring a stricter 
ritual and promising more decisive effects)? What if sex in 
our society, on a scale of several centuries, was something 
that was placed within an unrelenting system of confession? 
The transformation of sex into discourse, which I spoke of 
earlier, the dissemination and reinforcement of heterogene¬ 
ous sexualities, are perhaps two elements of the same deploy¬ 
ment: they are linked together with the help of the central 
element of a confession that compels individuals to articulate 
their sexual peculiarity—no matter how extreme. In Greece, 
truth and sex were linked, in the form of pedagogy, by the 
transmission of a precious knowledge from one body to an¬ 
other; sex served as a medium for initiations into learning. 
For us, it is in the confession that truth and sex are joined, 
through the obligatory and exhaustive expression of an indi¬ 
vidual secret. But this time it is truth that serves as a medium 
for sex and its manifestations. 

The confession is a ritual of discourse in which the speak¬ 
ing subject is also the subject of the statement; it is also a 
ritual that unfolds within a power relationship, for one does 
not confess without the presence (or virtual presence) of a 
partner who is not simply the interlocutor but the authority 
who requires the confession, prescribes and appreciates it, 
and intervenes in order to judge, punish, forgive, console, 



62 


The History of Sexuality 


and reconcile; a ritual in which the truth is corroborated by 
the obstacles and resistances it has had to surmount in order 
to be formulated; and finally, a ritual in which the expression 
alone, independently of its external consequences, produces 
intrinsic modifications in the person who articulates it: it 
exonerates, redeems, and purifies him; it unburdens him of 
his wrongs, liberates him, and promises him salvation. For 
centuries, the truth of sex was, at least for the most part, 
caught up in this discursive form. Moreover, this form was 
not the same as that of education (sexual education confined 
itself to general principles and rules of prudence); nor was it 
that of initiation (which remained essentially a silent prac¬ 
tice, which the act of sexual enlightenment or deflowering 
merely rendered laughable or violent). As we have seen, it is 
a form that is far removed from the one governing the “erotic 
art.” By virtue of the power structure immanent in it, the 
confessional discourse cannot come from above, as in the ars 
erotica, through the sovereign will of a master, but rather 
from below, as an obligatory act of speech which, under some 
imperious compulsion, breaks the bonds of discretion or for¬ 
getfulness. What secrecy it presupposes is not owing to the 
high price of what it has to say and the small number of those 
who are worthy of its benefits, but to its obscure familiarity 
and its general baseness. Its veracity is not guaranteed by the 
lofty authority of the magistery, nor by the tradition it trans¬ 
mits, but by the bond, the basic intimacy in discourse, be¬ 
tween the dne who speaks and what he is speaking about. On 
the other hand, the agency of domination does not reside in 
the one who speaks (for it is he who is constrained), but in 
the one who listens and says nothing; not in the one who 
knows and answers, but in the one who questions and is not 
supposed to know. And this discourse of truth finally takes 
effect, not in the one who receives it, but in the one from 
whom it is wrested. With these confessed truths, we are a 
long way from the learned initiations into pleasure, with 
their technique and their mystery. On the other hand, we 



Scientia Sexualis 


63 


belong to a society which has ordered sex’s difficult knowl¬ 
edge, not according to the transmission of secrets, but 
around the slow surfacing of confidential statements. 

The confession was, and still remains, the general standard 
governing the production of the true discourse on sex. It has 
undergone a considerable transformation, however. For a 
long time, it remained firmly entrenched in the practice of 
penance. But with the rise of Protestantism, the Counter 
Reformation, eighteenth-century pedagogy, and nineteenth- 
century medicine, it gradually lost its ritualistic and exclu¬ 
sive localization; it spread; it has been employed in a whole 
series of relationships: children and parents, students and 
educators, patients and psychiatrists, delinquents and ex¬ 
perts. The motivations and effects it is expected to produce 
have varied, as have the forms it has taken: interrogations, 
consultations, autobiographical narratives, letters; they have 
been recorded, transcribed, assembled into dossiers, pub¬ 
lished, and commented on. But more important, the confes¬ 
sion lends itself, if not to other domains, at least to new ways 
of exploring the existing ones. It is no longer a question 
simply of saying what was done—the sexual act—and how 
it was done; but of reconstructing, in and around the act, the 
thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accom¬ 
panied it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the 
pleasure that animated it. For the first time no doubt, a 
society has taken upon itself to solicit and hear the imparting 
of individual pleasures. 

A dissemination, then, of procedures of confession, a mul¬ 
tiple localization of their constraint, a widening of their do¬ 
main: a great archive of the pleasures of sex was gradually 
constituted. For a long time this archive dematerialized as it 
was formed. It regularly disappeared without a trace (thus 
suiting the purposes of the Christian pastoral) until medi¬ 
cine, psychiatry, and pedagogy began to solidify it: Campe, 
Salzmann, and especially Kaan, KrafFt-Ebing, Tardieu, 
Molle, and Havelock Ellis carefully assembled this whole

The History of Sexuality 


pitiful, lyrical outpouring from the sexual mosaic. Western 
societies thus began to keep an indefinite record of these 
people’s pleasures. They made up a herbal of them and estab¬ 
lished a system of classification. They described their every¬ 
day deficiencies as well as their oddities or exasperations. 
This was an important time. It is easy to make light of these 
nineteenth-century psychiatrists, who made a point of apolo¬ 
gizing for the horrors they were about to let speak, evoking 
“immoral behavior” or “aberrations of the genetic senses,” 
but lam more inclined to applaud their seriousness: they had 
a feeling for momentous events. It was a time when the most 
singular pleasures were called upon to pronounce a discourse 
of truth concerning themselves, a discourse which had to 
model itself after that which spoke, not of sin and salvation, 
but of bodies and life processes—the discourse of science. It 
was enough to make one’s voice tremble, for an improbable 
thing was then taking shape: a confessional science, a science 
which relied on a many-sided extortion, and took for its 
object what was unmentionable but admitted to nonetheless. 
The scientific discourse was scandalized, or in any case re¬ 
pelled, when it had to take charge of this whole discourse 
from below. It was also faced with a theoretical and method¬ 
ological paradox: the long discussions concerning the possi¬ 
bility of constituting a science of the subject, the validity of 
introspection, lived experience as evidence, or the presence 
of consciousness to itself were responses to this problem that 
is inherent in the functioning of truth in our society: can one 
articulate the production of truth according to the old juridi- 
co-religious model of confession, and the extortion of confi¬ 
dential evidence according to the rules of scientific discourse? 
Those who believe that sex was more rigorously elided in the 
nineteenth century than ever before, through a formidable 
mechanism of blockage and a deficiency of discourse, can say 
what they please. There was no deficiency, but rather an 
excess, a redoubling, too much rather than not enough dis¬ 
course, in any case an interference between two modes of 



Scientia Sexualis 


65 


production of truth: procedures of confession, and scientific 
discursivity. 

And instead of adding up the errors, naivetes, and moral- 
isms that plagued the nineteenth-century discourse of truth 
concerning sex, we would do better to locate the procedures 
by which that will to knowledge regarding sex, which cha¬ 
racterizes the modern Occident, caused the rituals of confes¬ 
sion to function within the norms of scientific regularity: how 
did this immense and traditional extortion of the sexual con¬ 
fession come to be constituted in scientific terms? 

1. Through a clinical codification of the inducement to 
speak. Combining confession with examination, the personal 
history with the deployment of a set of decipherable signs 
and symptoms; the interrogation, the exacting questionnaire, 
and hypnosis, with the recollection of memories and free 
association: all were ways of reinscribing the procedure of 
confession in a field of scientifically acceptable observations. 

2. Through the postulate of a general and diffuse causality. 
Having to tell everything, being able to pose questions about 
everything, found their justification in the principle that en¬ 
dowed sex with an inexhaustible and polymorphous causal 
power. The most discrete event in one’s sexual behavior— 
whether an accident or a deviation, a deficit or an excess— 
was deemed capable of entailing the most varied conse¬ 
quences throughout one’s existence; there was scarcely a 
malady or physical disturbance to which the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury did not impute at least some degree of sexual etiology. 
From the bad habits of children to the phthises of adults, the 
apoplexies of old people, nervous maladies, and the degener¬ 
ations of the race, the medicine of that era wove an entire 
network of sexual causality to explain them. This may well 
appear fantastic to us, but the principle of sex as a “cause of 
any and everything” was the theoretical underside of a con¬ 
fession that had to be thorough, meticulous, and constant, 



66 


The History of Sexuality 


and at the same time operate within a scientific type of 
practice. The limitless dangers that sex carried with it jus¬ 
tified the exhaustive character of the inquisition to which it 
was subjected. 

3. Through the principle of a latency intrinsic to sexuality. 
If it was necessary to extract the truth of sex through the 
technique of confession, this was not simply because it was 
difficult to tell, or stricken by the taboos of decency, but 
because the ways of sex were obscure; it was elusive by 
nature; its energy and its mechanisms escaped observation, 
and its causal power was partly clandestine. By integrating 
it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth 
century altered the scope of the confession; it tended no 
longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished 
to hide, but with what was hidden from himself, being inca¬ 
pable of coming to light except gradually and through the 
labor of a confession in which the questioner and the ques¬ 
tioned each had a part to play. The principle of a latency 
essential to sexuality made it possible to link the forcing of 
a difficult confession to a scientific practice. It had to be 
exacted, by force, since it involved something that tried to 
stay hidden. 

4. Through the method of interpretation. If one had to 
confess, this was not merely because the person to whom one 
confessed had the power to forgive, console, and direct, but 
because the work of producing the truth was obliged to pass 
through this relationship if it was to be scientifically vali¬ 
dated. The truth did not reside solely in the subject who, by 
confessing, would reveal it wholly formed. It was constituted 
in two stages: present but incomplete, blind to itself, in the 
one who spoke, it could only reach completion in the one 
who assimilated and recorded it. It was the latter’s function 
to verify this obscure truth: the revelation of confession had 
to be coupled with the decipherment of what it said. The one 



Scientia Sexualis 


67 


who listened was not simply the forgiving master, the judge 
who condemned or acquitted; he was the master of truth. His 
was a hermaneutic function. With regard to the confession, 
his power was not only to demand it before it was made, or 
decide what was to follow after it, but also to constitute a 
discourse of truth on the basis of its decipherment. By no 
longer making the confession a test, but rather a sign, and by 
making sexuality something to be interpreted, the nineteenth 
century gave itself the possibility of causing the procedures 
of confession to operate within the regular formation of a 
scientific discourse. 

5. Through the medicalization of the effects of confession. 
The obtaining of the confession and its effects were recodified 
as therapeutic operations. Which meant first of all that the 
sexual domain was no longer accounted for simply by the 
notions of error or sin, excess or transgression, but was 
placed under the rule of the normal and the pathological 
(which, for that matter, were the transposition of the former 
categories); a characteristic sexual morbidity was defined for 
the first time; sex appeared as an extremely unstable patho¬ 
logical field: a surface of repercussion for other ailments, but 
also the focus of a specific nosography, that of instincts, 
tendencies, images, pleasure, and conduct. This implied fur¬ 
thermore that sex would derive its meaning and its necessity 
from medical interventions: it would be required by the doc¬ 
tor, necessary for diagnosis, and effective by nature in the 
cure. Spoken in time, to the proper party, and by the person 
who was both the bearer of it and the one responsible for it, 
the truth healed. 

Let us consider things in broad historical perspective: 
breaking with the traditions of the ars erotica, our society has 
equipped itself with a scientia sexualis. To be more precise, 
it has pursued the task of producing true discourses concern¬ 
ing sex, and this by adapting—not without difficulty—the 



68 


The History of Sexuality 


ancient procedure of confession to the rules of scientific dis¬ 
course. Paradoxically, the scientia sexualis that emerged in 
the nineteenth century kept as its nucleus the singular ritual 
of obligatory and exhaustive confession, which in the Chris¬ 
tian West was the first technique for producing the truth of 
sex. Beginning in the sixteenth century, this rite gradually 
detached itself from the sacrament of penance, and via the 
guidance of souls and the direction of conscience—the ars 
artium —emigrated toward pedagogy, relationships between 
adults and children, family relations, medicine, and psychia¬ 
try. In any case, nearly one hundred and fifty years have gone 
into the making of a complex machinery for producing true 
discourses on sex: a deployment that spans a wide segment 
of history in that it connects the ancient injunction of confes¬ 
sion to clinical listening methods. It is this deployment that 
enables something called “sexuality” to embody the truth of 
sex and its pleasures. 

“Sexuality”: the correlative of that slowly developed dis¬ 
cursive practice which constitutes the scientia sexualis. The 
essential features of this sexuality are not the expression of 
a representation that is more or less distorted by ideology, or 
of a misunderstanding caused by taboos; they correspond to 
the functional requirements of a discourse that must produce 
its truth. Situated at the point of intersection of a technique 
of confession and a scientific discursivity, where certain 
major mechanisms had to be found for adapting them to one 
another (the listening technique, the postulate of causality, 
the principle of latency, the rule of interpretation, the imper¬ 
ative of medicalization), sexuality was defined as being “by 
nature”: a domain susceptible to pathological processes, and 
hence one calling for therapeutic or normalizing interven¬ 
tions; a field of meanings to decipher; the site of processes 
concealed by specific mechanisms; a focus of indefinite causal 
relations; and an obscure speech (parole) that had to be 
ferreted out and listened to. The “economy” of discourses— 
their intrinsic technology, the necessities of their operation, 



Scientia Sexualis 


69 


the tactics they employ, the effects of power which underlie 
them and which they transmit—this, and not a system of 
representations, is what determines the essential features of 
what they have to say. The history of sexuality—that is, the 
history of what functioned in the nineteenth century as a 
specific field of truth—must first be written from the view¬ 
point of a history of discourses. 

Let us put forward a general working hypothesis. The 
society that emerged in the nineteenth century—bourgeois, 
capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will—did not 
confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition. On 
the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for 
producing true discourses concerning it. Not only did it 
speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to 
formulate the uniform truth of sex. As if it suspected sex of 
harboring a fundamental secret. As if it needed this produc¬ 
tion of truth. As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not 
only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of 
knowledge. Thus sex gradually became an object of great 
suspicion; the general and disquieting meaning that pervades 
our conduct and our existence, in spite of ourselves; the point 
of weakness where evil portents reach through to us; the 
fragment of darkness that we each carry within us: a general 
signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause, a fear 
that never ends. And so, in this “question” of sex (in both 
senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the 
need for confession and integration into a field of rationality), 
two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other: 
we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret 
and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves 
the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and 
deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth, 
or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about our¬ 
selves which we think we possess in our immediate con¬ 
sciousness. We tell it its truth by deciphering what it tells us 
about that truth; it tells us our own by delivering up that part

of it that escaped us. From this interplay there has evolved, 
over several centuries, a knowledge of the subject; a knowl¬ 
edge not so much of his form, but of that which divides him, 
determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be 
ignorant of himself. As unlikely as this may seem, it should 
not surprise us when we think of the long history of the 
Christian and juridical confession, of the shifts and transfor¬ 
mations this form of knowledge-power, so important in the 
West, has undergone: the project of a science of the subject 
has gravitated, in ever narrowing circles, around the question 
of sex. Causality in the subject, the unconscious of the sub¬ 
ject, the truth of the subject in the other who knows, the 
knowledge he holds unbeknown to him, all this found an 
opportunity to deploy itself in the discourse of sex. Not, 
however, by reason of some natural property inherent in sex 
itself, but by virtue of the tactics of power immanent in this 
discourse. 

Scientia sexualis versus ars erotica, no doubt. But it should 
be noted that the ars erotica did not disappear altogether 
from Western civilization; nor has it always been absent from 
the movement by which one sought to produce a science of 
sexuality. In the Christian confession, but especially in the 
direction and examination of conscience, in the search for 
spiritual union and the love of God, there was a whole series 
of methods that had much in common with an erotic art: 
guidance by the master along a path of initiation, the inten¬ 
sification of experiences extending down to their physical 
components, the optimization of effects by the discourse that 
accompanied them. The phenomena of possession and ec¬ 
stasy, which were quite frequent in the Catholicism of the 
Counter Reformation, were undoubtedly effects that had got 
outside the control of the erotic technique immanent in this 
subtle science of the flesh. And we must ask whether, since 
the nineteenth century, the scientia sexualis —under the 
guise of its decent positivism—has not functioned, at least to 



Scientia Sexualis 


71 


a certain extent, as an ars erotica. Perhaps this production 
of truth, intimidated though it was by the scientific model, 
multiplied, intensified, and even created its own intrinsic 
pleasures. It is often said that we have been incapable of 
imagining any new pleasures. We have at least invented a 
different kind of pleasure: pleasure in the truth of pleasure, 
the pleasure of knowing that truth, of discovering and expos¬ 
ing it, the fascination of seeing it and telling it, of captivating 
and capturing others by it, of confiding it in secret, of luring 
it out in the open—the specific pleasure of the true discourse 
on pleasure. 

The most important elements of an erotic art linked to our 
knowledge about sexuality are not to be sought in the ideal, 
promised to us by medicine, of a healthy sexuality, nor in the 
humanist dream of a complete and flourishing sexuality, and 
certainly not in the lyricism of orgasm and the good feelings 
of bio-energy (these are but aspects of its normalizing utiliza¬ 
tion), but in this multiplication and intensification of pleas¬ 
ures connected to the production of the truth about sex. The 
learned volumes, written and read; the consultations and 
examinations; the anguish of answering questions and the 
delights of having one’s words interpreted; all the stories told 
to oneself and to others, so much curiosity, so many confi¬ 
dences offered in the face of scandal, sustained—but not 
without trembling a little—by the obligation of truth; the 
profusion of secret fantasies and the dearly paid right to 
whisper them to whoever is able to hear them; in short, the 
formidable “pleasure of analysis” (in the widest sense of the 
latter term) which the West has cleverly been fostering for 
several centuries: all this constitutes something like the er¬ 
rant fragments of an erotic art that is secretly transmitted by 
confession and the science of sex. Must we conclude that our 
scientia sexualis is but an extraordinarily subtle form of ars 
erotica, and that it is the Western, sublimated version of that 
seemingly lost tradition? Or must we suppose that all these 
pleasures are only the by-products of a sexual science, a 



72 


The History of Sexuality 


bonus that compensates for its many stresses and strains? 

In any case, the hypothesis of a power of repression ex¬ 
erted by our society on sex for economic reasons appears to 
me quite inadequate if we are to explain this whole series of 
reinforcements and intensifications that our preliminary in¬ 
quiry has discovered: a proliferation of discourses, carefully 
tailored to the requirements of power; the solidification of the 
sexual mosaic and the construction of devices capable not 
only of isolating it but of stimulating and provoking it, of 
forming it into focuses of attention, discourse, and pleasure; 
the mandatory production of confessions and the subsequent 
establishment of a system of legitimate knowledge and of an 
economy of manifold pleasures. We are dealing not nearly so 
much with a negative mechanism of exclusion as with the 
operation of a subtle network of discourses, special knowl¬ 
edges, pleasures, and powers. At issue is not a movement 
bent on pushing rude sex back into some obscure and inac¬ 
cessible region,'but on the contrary, a process that spreads 
it over the surface of things and bodies, arouses it, draws it 
out and bids it speak, implants it in reality and enjoins it to 
tell the truth: an entire glittering sexual array, reflected in a 
myriad of discourses, the obstination of powers, and the 
interplay of knowledge and pleasure. 

All this is an illusion, it will be said, a hasty impression 
behind which a more discerning gaze will surely discover the 
same great machinery of repression. Beyond these few phos¬ 
phorescences, are we not sure to find once more the somber 
law that always says no? The answer will have to come out 
of a historical inquiry. An inquiry concerning the manner in 
which a knowledge of sex has been forming over the last 
three centuries; the manner in which the discourses that take 
it as their object have multiplied, and the reasons for which 
we have come to attach a nearly fabulous price to the truth 
they claimed to produce. Perhaps these historical analyses 
will end by dissipating what this cursory survey seems to 
suggest. But the postulate I started out with, and would like 



Scientia Sexualis 


73 


to hold to as long as possible, is that these deployments of 
power and knowledge, of truth and pleasures, so unlike those 
of repression, are not necessarily secondary and derivative; 
and further, that repression is not in any case fundamental 
and overriding. We need to take these mechanisms seriously, 
therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather 
than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an 
ignorance measured against what we are supposed to know, 
we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as 
they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleas¬ 
ure, and generate power; we must investigate the conditions 
of their emergence and operation, and try to discover how 
the related facts of interdiction or concealment are dis¬ 
tributed with respect to them. In short, we must define the 
strategies of power that are immanent in this will to knowl¬ 
edge. As far as sexuality is concerned, we shall attempt to 
constitute the “political economy” of a will to knowledge. 




PART FOUR 

The Deployment 
of Sexuality 




The aim of this series of studies? To transcribe into history 
the fable of Les Bijoux indiscrets. 

Among its many emblems, our society wears that of the 
talking sex. The sex which one catches unawares and ques¬ 
tions, and which, restrained and loquacious at the same time, 
endlessly replies. One day a certain mechanism, which was 
so elfin-like that it could make itself invisible, captured this 
sex and, in a game that combined pleasure with compulsion, 
and consent with inquisition, made it tell the truth about 
itself and others as well. For many years, we have all been 
living in the realm of Prince Mangogul: under the spell of an 
immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it, with an 
insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about, quick 
to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to 
abandon its discretion. As if it were essential for us to be able 
to draw from that little piece of ourselves not only pleasure 
but knowledge, and a whole subtle interchange f rom one to 
the other: a knowledge of pleasure, a pleasure that comes of 
knowing pleasure, a knowledge-pleasure; and as if that fan¬ 
tastic animal we accommodate had itself such finely tuned 
ears, such searching eyes, so gifted a tongue and mind, as to 
know much and be quite willing to tell it, provided we em¬ 
ployed a little skill in urging it to speak. Between each of us 
and our sex, the West has placed a never-ending demand for 
truth: it is up to us to extract the truth of sex, since this truth 
is beyond its grasp; it is up to sex to tell us our truth, since 
sex is what holds it in darkness. But is sex hidden from us, 
concealed by a new sense of decency, kept under a bushel by 
the grim necessities of bourgeois society? On the contrary, it 
shines forth; it is incandescent. Several centuries ago, it was 

77 



78 


The History of Sexuality 


placed at the center of a formidable petition to know. A 
double petition, in that we are compelled to know how things 
are with it, while it is suspected of knowing how things are 
with us. 

In the space of a few centuries, a certain inclination has 
led us to direct the question of what we are, to sex. Not so 
much to sex as representing nature, but to sex as history, as 
signification and discourse. We have placed ourselves under 
the sign of sex, but in the form of a Logic of Sex, rather than 
a Physics.. We must make no mistake here: with the great 
series of binary oppositions (body/soul, flesh/spirit, instinct/ 
reason, drives/consciousness) that seemed to refer sex to a 
pure mechanics devoid of reason, the West has managed not 
only, or not so much, to annex sex to a field of rationality, 
which would not be. all that remarkable an achievement, 
seeing how accustomed we are to such “conquests” since the 
“Greeks, but to bring us almost entirely—our bodies, our 
vminds, our individuality, our history—under the sway of a 
“logic of concupiscence and desire. Whenever it is a question 
of knowing who we are, it is this logic that henceforth serves 
as our master key. It has been several decades since geneti¬ 
cists ceased to conceive of life as an organization strangely 
equipped with an additional capacity to reproduce itself; they 
see in the reproductive mechanism that very element which 
introduces the biological dimension: the matrix not only of 
the living, but of life itself. But it was centuries ago that 
countless theoreticians and practitioners of the flesh—whose 
approach was hardly “scientific,” it is true—made man the 
offspring of an imperious and intelligible sex. Sex, the expla¬ 
nation for everything. 

It is pointless to ask: Why then is sex so secret? What is 
this force that so long reduced it to silence and has only 
recently relaxed its hold somewhat, allowing us to question 
it perhaps, but always in the context of and through its 
repression? In reality, this question, so often repeated nowa¬ 
days, is but the recent form of a considerable affirmation and

a secular prescription: there is where the truth is; go see if 
you can uncover it. Acheronto movebo: an age-old decision. 

Ye wise men, highly, deeply learned, 

Who think it out and know. 

How, when, and where do all things pair? 

Why do they kiss and love? 

Ye men of lofty wisdom, say 
What happened to me then; 

Search out and tell me where, how, when 
And why it happened thus . 1 

It is reasonable therefore to ask first of all: What is this 
injunction? Why this great chase after the truth of sex, the 
truth in sex? 

In Diderot’s tale, the good genie Cucufa discovers at the 
bottom of his pocket, in the midst of worthless things— 
consecrated seeds, little pagodas made of lead, and moldy 
sugar-coated pills—the tiny silver ring whose stone, when 
turned, makes the sexes one encounters speak. He gives it to 
the curious sultan. Our problem is to know what marvelous 
ring confers a similar power on us, and on which master’s 
finger it has been placed; what game of power it makes 
possible or presupposes, and how it is that each one of us has 
become a sort of attentive and imprudent sultan with respect 
to his own sex and that of others. It is this magical ring, this 
jewel which is so indiscreet when it comes to making others 
speak, but so ineloquent concerning one’s own mechanism, 
that we need to render loquacious in its turn; it is what we 
have to talk about. We must write the history of this will to 
truth, this petition to know that for so many centuries has 
kept us enthralled by sex: the history of a stubborn and 
relentless effort. What is it that we demand of sex, beyond 
its possible pleasures, that makes us so persistent? What is 
this patience or eagerness to constitute it as the secret, the

omnipotent cause, the hidden meaning, the unremitting fear? 
And why was the task of discovering this difficult truth 
finally turned into an invitation to eliminate taboos and 
break free of what binds us? Was the labor then so arduous 
that it had to be enchanted by this promise? Or had this 
knowledge become so costly—in political, economic, and 
ethical terms—that in order to subject everyone to its rule, 
it was necessary to assure them, paradoxically, that their 
liberation was at stake? 

In order to situate the investigations that will follow, let 
me put forward some general propositions concerning the 
objective, the method, the domain to be covered, and the 
periodizations that one can accept in a provisory way. 



I 


Objective 


Why these investigations? I am well aware that an uncer¬ 
tainty runs through the sketches I have drawn thus far, one 
that threatens to invalidate the more detailed inquiries that 
I have projected. I have repeatedly stressed that the history 
of the last centuries in Western societies did not manifest the 
movement of a power that was essentially repressive. I based 
my argument on the disqualification of that notion while 
feigning ignorance of the fact that a critique has been 
mounted from another quarter and doubtless in a more radi¬ 
cal fashion: a critique conducted at the level of the theory of 
desire. In point of fact, the assertion that sex is not “re¬ 
pressed” is not altogether new. Psychoanalysts have been 
saying the same thing for some time. They have challenged 
the simple little machinery that comes to mind when one 
speaks of repression; the idea of a rebellious energy that must 
be throttled has appeared to them inadequate for deciphering 
the manner in which power and desire are joined to one 
another; they consider them to be linked in a more complex 
and primary way than through the interplay of a primitive, 
natural, and living energy welling up from below, and a 
higher order seeking to stand in its way; thus one should not 
think that desire is repressed, for the simple reason that the 
law is what constitutes both desire and the lack on which it 
is predicated. Where there is desire, the power relation is 
already present: an illusion, then, to denounce this relation 

81 



82 


The History of Sexuality 


for a repression exerted after the event; but vanity as well, 
to go questing after a desire that is beyond the reach of 
power. 

But, in an obstinately confused way, I sometimes spoke, 
as though I were dealing with equivalent notions, of repres¬ 
sion, and sometimes of law, of prohibition or censorship. 
Through stubbornness or neglect, I failed to consider every¬ 
thing that can distinguish their theoretical implications. And 
I grant that one might justifiably say to me: By constantly 
referring to positive technologies of power, you are playing 
a double game where you hope to win on all counts; you 
confuse your adversaries by appearing to take the weaker 
position, and, discussing repression alone, you would have us 
believe, wrongly, that you have rid yourself of the problem 
of law; and yet you keep the essential practical consequence 
of the principle of power-as-law, namely the fact that there 
is no escaping from power, that it is always-already present, 
constituting that very thing which one attempts to counter 
it with. As to the idea of a power-repression, you have re¬ 
tained its most fragile theoretical element, and this in order 
to criticize it; you have retained the most sterilizing political 
consequence of the idea of power-law, but only in order to 
preserve it for your own use. 

The aim of the inquiries that will follow is to move less 
toward a “theory” of power than toward an “analytics” of 
power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain 
formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of 
the instruments that will make possible its analysis. How¬ 
ever, it seems to me that this analytics can be constituted 
only if it frees itself completely from a certain representation 
of power that I would term—it will be seen later why— 
“juridico-discursive.” It is this conception that governs both 
the thematics of repression and the theory of the law as 
constitutive of desire. In other words, what distinguishes the 
analysis made in terms of the repression of instincts from 
that made in terms of the law of desire is clearly the way in 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


83 


which they each conceive of the nature and dynamics of the 
drives, not the way in which they conceive of power. They 
both rely on a common representation of power which, de¬ 
pending on the use made of it and the position it is accorded 
with respect to desire, leads to two contrary results: either to 
the promise of a “liberation,” if power is seen as having only 
an external hold on desire, or, if it is constitutive of desire 
itself, to the affirmation: you are always-already trapped. 
Moreover, one must not imagine that this representation is 
peculiar to those who are concerned with the problem of the 
relations of power with sex. In fact it is much more general; 
one frequently encounters it in political analyses of power, 
and it is deeply rooted in the history of the West. 

These are some of its principal features: 

— The negative relation. It never establishes any connec¬ 
tion between power and sex that is not negative: rejection, 
exclusion, refusal, blockage, concealment, or mask. Where 
sex and pleasure are concerned, power can “do” nothing but 
say no to them; what it produces, if anything, is absences and 
gaps; it overlooks elements, introduces discontinuities, sepa¬ 
rates what is joined, and marks off boundaries. Its effects take 
the general form of limit and lack. 

— The insistence of the rule. Power is essentially what 
dictates its law to sex. Which means first of all that sex is 
placed by power in a binary system: licit and illicit, permitted 
and forbidden. Secondly, power prescribes an “order” for sex 
that operates at the same time as a form of intelligibility: sex 
is to be deciphered on the basis of its relation to the law. And 
finally, power acts by laying down the rule: power’s hold on 
sex is maintained through language, or rather through the 
act of discourse that creates, from the very fact that it is 
articulated, a rule of law. It speaks, and that is the rule. The 
pure form of power resides in the function of the legislator; 
and its mode of action with regard to sex is of a juridico- 
discursive character. 



84 


The History of Sexuality 


—The cycle of prohibition: thou shalt not go near, thou 
shalt not touch, thou shalt not consume, thou shalt not 
experience pleasure, thou shalt not speak, thou shalt not 
show thyself; ultimately thou shalt not exist, except in dark¬ 
ness and secrecy. To deal with sex, power employs nothing 
more than a law of prohibition. Its objective: that sex re¬ 
nounce itself. Its instrument: the threat of a punishment that 
is nothing other than the suppression of sex. Renounce your¬ 
self or suffer the penalty of being suppressed; do not appear 
if you do not want to disappear. Your existence will be 
maintained only at the cost of your nullification. Power con¬ 
strains sex only through a taboo that plays on the alternative 
between two nonexistences. 

— The logic of censorship. This interdiction is thought to 
take three forms: affirming that such a thing is not permitted, 
preventing it from being said, denying that it exists. Forms 
that are difficult to reconcile. But it is here that one imagines 
a sort of logical sequence that characterizes censorship 
mechanisms: it links the inexistent, the illicit, and the inex¬ 
pressible in such a way that each is at the same time the 
principle and the effect of the others: one must not talk about 
what is forbidden until it is annulled in reality; what is inex¬ 
istent has no right to show itself, even in the order of speech 
where its inexistence is declared; and that which one must 
keep silent about is banished from reality as the thing that 
is tabooed above all else. The logic of power exerted on sex 
is the paradoxical logic of a law that might be expressed as 
an injunction of nonexistence, nonmanifestation, and silence. 

—The uniformity of the apparatus. Power over sex is exer¬ 
cised in the same way at all levels. From top to bottom, in 
its over-all decisions and its capillary interventions alike, 
whatever the devices or institutions on which it relies, it acts 
in a uniform and comprehensive manner; it operates accord¬ 
ing to the simple and endlessly reproduced mechanisms of 
law, taboo, and censorship: from state to family, from prince 
to father, from the tribunal to the small change of everyday 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


85 


punishments, from the agencies of social domination to the 
structures that constitute the subject himself, one finds a 
general form of power, varying in scale alone. This form is 
the law of transgression and punishment, with its interplay 
of licit and illicit. Whether one attributes to it the form of the 
prince who formulates rights, of the father who forbids, of 
the censor who enforces silence, or of the master who states 
the law, in any case one schematizes power in a juridical 
form, and one defines its effects as obedience. Confronted by 
a power that is law, the subject who is constituted as subject 
—who is “subjected”—is he who obeys. To the formal 
homogeneity of power in these various instances corresponds 
the general form of submission in the one who is constrained 
by it—whether the individual in question is the subject oppo¬ 
site the monarch, the citizen opposite the state, the child 
opposite the parent, or the disciple opposite the master. A 
legislative power on one side, and an obedient subject on the 
other. 

Underlying both the general theme that power represses 
sex and the idea that the law constitutes desire, one encoun¬ 
ters the same putative mechanics of power. It is defined in 
a strangely restrictive way, in that, to begin with, this power 
is poor in resources, sparing of its methods, monotonous in 
the tactics it utilizes, incapable of invention, and seemingly 
doomed always to repeat itself. Further, it is a power that 
only has the force of the negative on its side, a power to say 
no; in no condition to produce, capable only of posting limits, 
it is basically anti-energy. This is the paradox of its effective¬ 
ness: it is incapable of doing anything, except to render what 
it dominates incapable of doing anything either, except for 
what this power allows it to do. And finally, it is a power 
whose model is essentially juridical, centered on nothing 
more than the statement of the law and the operation of 
taboos. All the modes of domination, submission, and subju¬ 
gation are ultimately reduced to an effect of obedience. 



86 


The History of Sexuality 


Why is this juridical notion of power, involving as it does 
the neglect of everything that makes for its productive effec¬ 
tiveness, its strategic resourcefulness, its positivity, so readily 
accepted? In a society such as ours, where the devices of 
power are so numerous, its rituals so visible, and its instru¬ 
ments ultimately so reliable, in this society that has been 
more imaginative, probably, than any other in creating devi¬ 
ous and supple mechanisms of power, what explains this 
tendency not to recognize the latter except in the negative 
and emaciated form of prohibition? Why are the deploy¬ 
ments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law 
of interdiction? 

Let me offer a general and tactical reason that seems self- 
evident: power is tolerable only on condition that it mask a 
substantial part of itself. Its success is proportional to its 
ability to hide its own mechanisms. Would power be ac¬ 
cepted if it were entirely cynical? For it, secrecy is not in the 
nature of an abuse; it is indispensable to its operation. Not 
only because power imposes secrecy on those whom it domi¬ 
nates, but because it is perhaps just as indispensable to the 
latter: would they accept it if they did not see it as a mere 
limit placed on their desire, leaving a measure of freedom— 
however slight—intact? Power as a pure limit set on freedom 
is, at least in our society, the general form of its acceptability. 

There is, perhaps, a historical reason for this. The great 
institutions of power that developed in the Middle Ages— 
monarchy, the state with its apparatus—rose up on the basis 
of a multiplicity of prior powers, and to a certain extent in 
opposition to them: dense, entangled, conflicting powers, 
powers tied to the direct or indirect dominion over the land, 
to the possession of arms, to serfdom, to bonds of suzerainty 
and vassalage. If these institutions were able to implant 
themselves, if, by profiting from a whole series of tactical 
alliances, they were able to gain acceptance, this was because 
they presented themselves as agencies of regulation, arbitra¬ 
tion, and demarcation, as a way of introducing order in the

midst of these powers, of establishing a principle that would 
temper them and distribute them according to boundaries 
and a fixed hierarchy. Faced with a myriad of clashing 
forces, these great forms of power functioned as a principle 
of right that transcended all the heterogeneous claims, mani¬ 
festing the triple distinction of forming a unitary regime, of 
identifying its will with the law, and of acting through mech¬ 
anisms of interdiction and sanction. The slogan of this re¬ 
gime, pax et justitia, in keeping with the function it laid claim 
to, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private 
wars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling 
of lawsuits. Doubtless there was more to this development of 
great monarchic institutions than a pure and simple juridical 
edifice. But such was the language of power, the representa¬ 
tion it gave of itself, and the entire theory of public law that 
was constructed in the Middle Ages, or reconstructed from 
Roman law, bears witness to the fact. Law was not simply 
a weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the mo¬ 
narchic system’s mode of manifestation and the form of its 
acceptability. In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the 
exercise of power has always been formulated in terms of 
law. 

A tradition dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth 
century has accustomed us to place absolute monarchic 
power on the side of the unlawful: arbitrariness, abuse, ca¬ 
price, willfulness, privileges and exceptions, the traditional 
continuance of accomplished facts. But this is to overlook a 
fundamental historical trait of Western monarchies: they 
were constructed as systems of law, they expressed them¬ 
selves through theories of law, and they made their mech¬ 
anisms of power work in the form of law. The old reproach 
that Boulainvilliers directed at the French monarchy—that 
it used the law and jurists to do away with rights and to bring 
down the aristocracy—was basically warranted by the facts. 
Through the development of the monarchy and its institu¬ 
tions this juridico-political dimension was established. It is 



88 


The History of Sexuality 


by no means adequate to describe the manner in which 
power was and is exercised, but it is the code according to 
which power presents itself and prescribes that we conceive 
of it. The history of the monarchy went hand in hand with 
the covering up of the facts and procedures of power by 
juridico-political discourse. 

Yet, despite the efforts that were made to disengage the 
juridical sphere from the monarchic institution and to free 
the political from the juridical, the representation of power 
remained caught within this system. Consider the two fol¬ 
lowing examples. Criticism of the eighteenth-century mo¬ 
narchic institution in France was not directed against the 
juridico-monarchic sphere as such, but was made on behalf 
of a pure and rigorous juridical system to which all the 
mechanisms of power could conform, with no excesses or 
irregularities, as opposed to a monarchy which, notwith¬ 
standing its own assertions, continuously overstepped the 
legal framework and set itself above the laws. Political criti¬ 
cism availed itself, therefore, of all the juridical thinking that 
had accompanied the development of the monarchy, in order 
to condemn the latter; but it did not challenge the principle 
which held that law had to be the very form of power, and 
that power always had to be exercised in the form of law. 
Another type of criticism of political institutions appeared in 
the nineteenth century, a much more radical criticism in that 
it was concerned to show not only that real power escaped 
the rules of jurisprudence, but that the legal system itself was 
merely a way of exerting violence, of appropriating that 
violence for the benefit of the few, and of exploiting the 
dissymmetries and injustices of domination under cover of 
general law. But this critique of law is still carried out on the 
assumption that, ideally and by nature, power must be exer¬ 
cised in accordance with a fundamental lawfulness. 

At bottom, despite the differences in epochs and objec¬ 
tives, the representation of power has remained under the 
spell of monarchy. In political thought and analysis, we still

89 


have not cut off the head of the king. Hence the importance 
that the theory of power gives to the problem of right and 
violence, law and illegality, freedom and will, and especially 
the state and sovereignty (even if the latter is questioned 
insofar as it is personified in a collective being and no longer 
a sovereign individual). To conceive of power on the basis of 
these problems is to conceive of it in terms of a historical 
form that is characteristic of our societies: the juridical mon¬ 
archy. Characteristic yet transitory. For while many of its 
forms have persisted to the present, it has gradually been 
penetrated by quite new mechanisms of power that are prob¬ 
ably irreducible to the representation of law. As we shall see, 
these power mechanisms are, at least in part, those that, 
beginning in the eighteenth century, took charge of men’s 
existence, men as living bodies. And if it is true that the 
juridical system was useful for representing, albeit in a 
nonexhaustive way, a power that was centered primarily 
around deduction (prelevement) and death, it is utterly in¬ 
congruous with the new methods of power whose operation 
is not ensured by right but by technique, not by law but by 
normalization, not by punishment but by control, methods 
that are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond 
the state and its apparatus. We have been engaged for centu¬ 
ries in a type of society in which the juridical is increasingly 
incapable of coding power, of serving as its system of repre¬ 
sentation. Our historical gradient carries us further and fur¬ 
ther away from a reign of law that had already begun to 
recede into the past at a time when the French Revolution 
and the accompanying age of constitutions and codes seemed 
to destine it for a future that was at hand. 

It is this juridical representation that is still at work in 
recent analyses concerning the relationships of power to sex. 
But the problem is not to know whether desire is alien to 
power, whether it is prior to the law as is often thought to 
be the case, when it is not rather the law that is perceived as 
constituting it. This question is beside the point. Whether 



90 


The History of Sexuality 


desire is this or that, in any case one continues to conceive 
of it in relation to a power that is always juridical and discur¬ 
sive, a power that has its central point in the enunciation of 
the law. One remains attached to a certain image of power- 
law, of power-sovereignty, which was traced out by the 
theoreticians of right and the monarchic institution. It is this 
image that we must break free of, that is, of the theoretical 
privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power 
within the concrete and historical framework of its opera¬ 
tion. We must construct an analytics of power that no longer 
takes law as a model and a code. 

This history of sexuality, or rather this series of studies 
concerning the historical relationships of power and the dis¬ 
course on sex, is, I realize, a circular project in the sense that 
it involves two endeavors that refer back to one another. We 
shall try to rid ourselves of a juridical and negative represen¬ 
tation of power, and cease to conceive of it in terms of law, 
prohibition, liberty, and sovereignty. But how then do we 
analyze what has occurred in recent history with regard to 
this thing—seemingly one of the most forbidden areas of our 
lives and bodies—that is sex? How, if not by way of prohibi¬ 
tion and blockage, does power gain access to it? Through 
which mechanisms, or tactics, or devices? But let us assume 
in turn that a somewhat careful scrutiny will show that 
power in modern societies has not in fact governed sexuality 
through law and sovereignty; let us suppose that historical 
analysis has revealed the presence of a veritable “technol¬ 
ogy” of sex, one that is much more complex and above all 
much more positive than the mere effect of a “defense” could 
be; this being the case, does this example—which can only 
be considered a privileged one, since power seemed in this 
instance, more than anywhere else, to function as prohibition 
—not compel one to discover principles for analyzing power 
which do not derive from the system of right and the form 
of law? Hence it is a question of forming a different grid of 
historical decipherment by starting from a different theory of 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


91 


power; and, at the same time, of advancing little by little 
toward a different conception of power through a closer 
examination of an entire historical material. We must at the 
same time conceive of sex without the law, and power with¬ 
out the king. 



2 

Method 


Hence the objective is to analyze a certain form of knowl¬ 
edge regarding sex, not in terms of repression or law, but in 
terms of power. But the word power is apt to lead to a 
number of misunderstandings—misunderstandings with re¬ 
spect to its nature, its form, and its unity. By power, I do not 
mean “Power” as a group of institutions and mechanisms 
that ensure the subservience of the citizens of a given state. 
By power, I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation 
which, in contrast to violence, has the form of the rule. 
Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of domi¬ 
nation exerted by one group over another, a system whose 
effects, through successive derivations, pervade the entire 
social body. The analysis, made in terms of power, must not 
assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law, 
or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset; 
rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes. It 
seems to me that power must be understood in the first 
instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the 
sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own 
organization; as the process which, through ceaseless strug¬ 
gles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses 
them; as the support which these force relations find in one 
another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the con¬ 
trary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them 
from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they 
92 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


93 


take effect, whose general design or institutional crystalliza¬ 
tion is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation 
of the law, in the various social hegemonies. Power’s condi¬ 
tion of possibility, or in any case the viewpoint which permits 
one to understand its exercise, even in its more “peripheral” 
effects, and which also makes it possible to use its mech¬ 
anisms as a grid of intelligibility of the social order, must not 
be sought in the primary existence of a central point, in a 
unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and de¬ 
scended forms would emanate; it is the moving substrate of 
force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly 
engender states of power, but the latter are always local and 
unstable. The omnipresence of power: not because it has the 
privilege of consolidating everything under its invincible 
unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the 
next, at every point, or rather in every relation from one 
point to another. Power is everywhere; not because it em¬ 
braces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. 
And “Power,” insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert, 
and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that 
emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that 
rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their move¬ 
ment. One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not 
an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain 
strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attrib¬ 
utes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society. 

Should we turn the expression around, then, and say that 
politics is war pursued by other means? If we still wish to 
maintain a separation between war and politics, perhaps we 
should postulate rather that this multiplicity of force rela¬ 
tions can be coded—in part but never totally—either in the 
form of “war,” or in the form of “politics”; this would imply 
two different strategies (but the one always liable to switch 
into the other) for integrating these unbalanced, heterogene¬ 
ous, unstable, and tense force relations. 



94 


The History of Sexuality 


Continuing this line of discussion, we can advance a cer¬ 
tain number of propositions: 

—Power is not something that is acquired, seized, or shared, 
something that one holds on to or allows to slip away; 
power is exercised from innumerable points, in the inter¬ 
play of nonegalitarian and mobile relations. 

—Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority with 
respect to other types of relationships (economic proc¬ 
esses, knowledge relationships, sexual relations), but are 
immanent in the latter; they are the immediate effects of 
the divisions, inequalities, and disequilibriums which 
occur in the latter, and conversely they are the internal 
conditions of these differentiations; relations of power are 
not in superstructural positions, with merely a role of 
prohibition or accompaniment; they have a directly pro¬ 
ductive role, wherever they come into play. 

—Power comes from below; that is, there is no binary and 
all-encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at 
the root of power relations, and serving as a general matrix 
—no such duality extending from the top down and react¬ 
ing on more and more limited groups to the very depths 
of the social body. One must suppose rather that the mani¬ 
fold relationships of force that take shape and come into 
play in the machinery of production, in families, limited 
groups, and institutions, are the basis for wide-ranging 
effects of cleavage that run through the social body as a 
whole. These then form a general line of force that trav¬ 
erses the local oppositions and links them together; to be 
sure, they also bring about redistributions, realignments, 
homogenizations, serial arrangements, and convergences 
of the force relations. Major dominations are the hege¬ 
monic effects that are sustained by all these confronta¬ 
tions. 

—Power relations are both intentional and nonsubjective. If 
in fact they are intelligible, this is not because they are the 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


95 


effect of another instance that “explains” them, but rather 
because they are imbued, through and through, with cal¬ 
culation: there is no power that is exercised without a 
series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that 
it results from the choice or decision of an individual 
subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides 
over its rationality; neither the caste which governs, nor 
the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those 
who make the most important economic decisions direct 
the entire network of power that functions in a society 
(and makes it function); the rationality of power is charac¬ 
terized by tactics that are often quite explicit at the re¬ 
stricted level where they are inscribed (the local cynicism 
of power), tactics which, becoming connected to one an¬ 
other, attracting and propagating one another, but finding 
their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by 
forming comprehensive systems: the logic is perfectly 
clear, the aims decipherable, and yet it is often the case 
that no one is there to have invented them, and few who 
can be said to have formulated them: an implicit charac¬ 
teristic of the great anonymous, almost unspoken strate¬ 
gies which coordinate the loquacious tactics whose “in¬ 
ventors” or decisionmakers are often without hypocrisy. 

—Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or 
rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position 
of exteriority in relation to power. Should it be said that 
one is always “inside” power, there is no “escaping” it, 
there is no absolute outside where it is concerned, because 
one is subject to the law in any case? Or that, history being 
the ruse of reason, power is the ruse of history, always 
emerging the winner? This would be to misunderstand the 
strictly relational character of power relationships. Their 
existence depends on a multiplicity of points of resistance: 
these play the role of adversary, target, support, or handle 
in power relations. These points of resistance are present 
everywhere in the power network. Hence there is no single 



96 


The History of Sexuality 


locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all 
rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary. Instead there 
is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case: 
resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others 
that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted, ram¬ 
pant, or violent; still others that are quick to compromise, 
interested, or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist 
in the strategic field of power relations. But this does not 
mean that they are only a reaction or rebound, forming 
with respect to the basic domination an underside that is 
in the end always passive, doomed to perpetual defeat. 
Resistances do not derive from a few heterogeneous prin¬ 
ciples; but neither are they a lure or a promise that is of 
necessity betrayed. They are the odd term in relations of 
power; they are inscribed in the latter as an irreducible 
opposite. Hence they too are distributed in irregular fash¬ 
ion: the points, knots, or focuses of resistance are spread 
over time and space at varying densities, at times mobiliz¬ 
ing groups or individuals in a definitive way, inflaming 
certain points of the body, certain moments in life, certain 
types of behavior. Are there no great radical ruptures, 
massive binary divisions, then? Occasionally, yes. But 
more often one is dealing with mobile and transitory 
points of resistance, producing cleavages in a society that 
shift about, fracturing unities and effecting regroupings, 
furrowing across individuals themselves, cutting them up 
and remolding them, marking off irreducible regions in 
them, in their bodies and minds. Just as the network of 
power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes 
through apparatuses and institutions, without being ex¬ 
actly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of 
resistance traverses social stratifications and individual 
unities. And it is doubtless the strategic codification of 
these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible, 
somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on 
the institutional integration of power relationships.

It is in this sphere of force relations that we must try to 
analyze the mechanisms of power. In this way we will escape 
from the system of Law-and-Sovereign which has captivated 
political thought for such a long time. And if it is true that 
Machiavelli was among the few—and this no doubt was the 
scandal of his “cynicism”—who conceived the power of the 
Prince in terms of force relationships, perhaps we need to go 
one step further, do without the persona of the Prince, and 
decipher power mechanisms on the basis of a strategy that 
is immanent in force relationships. 

To return to sex and the discourses of truth that have 
taken charge of it, the question that we must address, then, 
is not: Given a specific state structure, how and why is it that 
power needs to establish a knowledge of sex? Neither is the 
question: What over-all domination was served by the con¬ 
cern, evidenced since the eighteenth century, to produce true 
discourses on sex? Nor is it: What law presided over both the 
regularity of sexual behavior and the conformity of what was 
said about it? It is rather: In a specific type'of discourse on 
sex, in a specific form of extortion of truth, appearing histori¬ 
cally and in specific places (around the child’s body, apropos 
of women’s sex, in connection with practices restricting 
births, and so on), what were the most immediate, the most 
local power relations at work? How did they make possible 
these kinds of discourses, and conversely, how were these 
discourses used to support power relations? How was the 
action of these power relations modified by their very exer¬ 
cise, entailing a strengthening of some terms and a weaken¬ 
ing of others, with effects of resistance and counterinvest¬ 
ments, so that there has never existed one type of stable 
subjugation, given once and for all? How were these power 
relations linked to one another according to the logic of a 
great strategy, which in retrospect takes on the aspect of a 
unitary and voluntarist politics of sex? In general terms: 
rather than referring all the infinitesimal violences that are 
exerted on sex, all the anxious gazes that are directed at it, 



98 


The History of Sexuality 


and all the hiding places whose discovery is made into an 
impossible task, to the unique form of a great Power, we 
must immerse the expanding production of discourses on sex 
in the field of multiple and mobile power relations. 

Which leads us to advance, in a preliminary way, four 
rules to follow. But these are not intended as methodological 
imperatives; at most they are cautionary prescriptions. 

1. Rule of immanence 

One must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of 
sexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and 
disinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mech¬ 
anisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or 
ideological requirements of power. If sexuality was con¬ 
stituted as an area of investigation, this was only because 
relations of power had established it as a possible object; and 
conversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was 
because techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis¬ 
course were capable of investing it. Between techniques of 
knowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, 
even if they have specific roles and are linked together on the 
basis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what 
might be called “local centers” of power-knowledge: for ex¬ 
ample, the relations that obtain between penitents and 
confessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience. 
Here, guided by the theme of the “flesh” that must be mas¬ 
tered, different forms of discourse—self-examination, ques¬ 
tionings, admissions, interpretations, interviews—were the 
vehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of 
forms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge. Similarly, 
the body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his 
cradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of 
parents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten¬ 
tive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted, 
particularly since the eighteenth century, another “local cen¬ 
ter” of power-knowledge. 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


99 


2. Rules of continual variations 

We must not look for who has the power in the order of 
sexuality (men, adults, parents, doctors) and who is deprived 
of it (women, adolescents, children, patients); nor for who 
has the right to know and who is forced to remain ignorant. 
We must seek rather the pattern of the modifications which 
the relationships of force imply by the very nature of their 
process. The “distributions of power” and the “appropria¬ 
tions of knowledge” never represent only instantaneous 
slices taken from processes involving, for example, a cumula¬ 
tive reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal of 
relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase of two terms. 
Relations of power-knowledge are not static forms of distri¬ 
bution, they are “matrices of transformations.” The nine¬ 
teenth-century grouping made up of the father, the mother, 
the educator, and the doctor, around the child and his sex, 
was subjected to constant modifications, continual shifts. 
One of the more spectacular results of the latter was a strange 
reversal: whereas to begin with the child’s sexuality had been 
problematized within the relationship established between 
doctor and parents (in the form of advice, or recommenda¬ 
tions to keep the child under observation, or warnings of 
future dangers), ultimately it was in the relationship of the 
psychiatrist to the child that the sexuality of adults them¬ 
selves was called into question. 

3. Rule of double conditioning 

No “local center,” no “pattern of transformation” could 
function if, through a series of sequences, it did not eventu¬ 
ally enter into an over-all strategy. And inversely, no strategy 
could achieve comprehensive effects if did not gain support 
from precise and tenuous relations serving, not as its point 
of application or final outcome, but as its prop and anchor 
point. There is no discontinuity between them, as if one were 
dealing with two different levels (one microscopic and the 



100 


The History of Sexuality 


other macroscopic); but neither is there homogeneity (as if 
the one were only the enlarged projection or the miniaturiza¬ 
tion of the other); rather, one must conceive of the double 
conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tac¬ 
tics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them 
work. Thus the father in the family is not the “representa¬ 
tive” of the sovereign or the state; and the latter are not 
projections of the father on a different scale. The family does 
not duplicate society, just as society does not imitate the 
family. But the family organization, precisely to the extent 
that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the 
other power mechanisms, was used to support the great 
“maneuvers” employed for the Malthusian control of the 
birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicali- 
zation of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms. 

4. Rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses 

What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the 
surface of projection of these power mechanisms. Indeed, it 
is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together. 
And for this very reason, we must conceive discourse as a 
series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is 
neither uniform nor stable. To be more precise, we must not 
imagine a world of discourse divided between accepted dis¬ 
course and excluded discourse, or between the dominant 
discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of 
discursive elements that can come into play in various strate¬ 
gies. It is this distribution that we must reconstruct, with the 
things said and those concealed, the enunciations required 
and those forbidden, that it comprises; with the variants and 
different effects—according to who is speaking, his position 
of power, the institutional context in which he happens to be 
situated—that it implies; and with the shifts and reutiliza¬ 
tions of identical formulas for contrary objectives that it also 
includes. Discourses are not once and for all subservient to 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


101 


power or raised up against it, any more than silences are. We 
must make allowance for the complex and unstable process 
whereby discourse can be both an instrument and an effect 
of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of 
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Dis¬ 
course transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but 
also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes 
it possible to thwart it. In like manner, silence and secrecy 
are a shelter for power, anchoring its prohibitions; but they 
also loosen its holds and provide for relatively obscure areas 
of tolerance. Consider for example the history of what was 
once “the” great sin against nature. The extreme discretion 
of the texts dealing with sodomy—that utterly confused cate¬ 
gory—and the nearly universal reticence in talking about it 
made possible a twofold operation: on the one hand, there 
was an extreme severity (punishment by fire was meted out 
well into the eighteenth century, without there being any 
substantial protest expressed before the middle of the cen¬ 
tury), and on the other hand, a tolerance that must have been 
widespread (which one can deduce indirectly from the infre¬ 
quency of judicial sentences, and which one glimpses more 
directly through certain statements concerning societies of 
men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts). 
There is no question that the appearance in nineteenth-cen¬ 
tury psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole se¬ 
ries of discourses on the species and subspecies of homosexu¬ 
ality, inversion, pederasty, and “psychic hermaphrodism” 
made possible a strong advance of social controls into this 
area of “perversity”; but it also made possible the formation 
of a “reverse” discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its 
own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or “naturality” be 
acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same 
categories by which it was medically disqualified. There is 
not, on the one side, a discourse of power, and opposite it, 
another discourse that runs counter to it. Discourses are 
tactical elements or blocks operating in the field of force 



102 


The History of Sexuality 


relations; there can exist different and even contradictory 
discourses within the same strategy; they can, on the con¬ 
trary, circulate without changing their form from one strat¬ 
egy to another, opposing strategy. We must not expect the 
discourses on sex to tell us, above all, what strategy they 
derive from, or what moral divisions they accompany, or 
what ideology—dominant or dominated—they represent; 
rather we must question them on the two levels of their 
tactical productivity (what reciprocal effects of power and 
knowledge they ensure) and their strategical integration 
(what conjunction and what force relationship make their 
utilization necessary in a given episode of the various con¬ 
frontations that occur). 

In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a concep¬ 
tion of power which replaces the privilege of the law with the 
viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with 
the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty 
with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force 
relations, wherein far-reaching, but never completely stable, 
effects of domination are produced. The strategical model, 
rather than the model based on law. And this, not out of a 
speculative choice or theoretical preference, but because in 
fact it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that 
the force relationships which for a long time had found 
expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually be¬ 
came invested in the order of political power.

Domain 


Sexuality must not be described as a stubborn drive, by 
nature alien and of necessity disobedient to a power which 
exhausts itself trying to subdue it and often fails to control 
it entirely. It appears rather as an especially dense transfer 
point for relations of power: between men and women, young 
people and old people, parents and offspring, teachers and 
students, priests and laity, an administration and a popula¬ 
tion. Sexuality is not the most intractable element in power 
relations, but rather one of those endowed with the greatest 
instrumentality: useful for the greatest number of maneuvers 
and capable of serving as a point of support, as a linchpin, 
for the most varied strategies. 

There is no single, all-encompassing strategy, valid for all 
of society and uniformly bearing on all the manifestations of 
sex. For example, the idea that there have been repeated 
attempts, by various means, to reduce all of sex to its repro¬ 
ductive function, its heterosexual and adult form, and its 
matrimonial legitimacy fails to take into account the mani¬ 
fold objectives aimed for, the manifold means employed in 
the different sexual politics concerned with the two sexes, the 
different age groups and social classes. 

In a first approach to the problem, it seems that we can 
distinguish four great strategic unities which, beginning in 
the eighteenth century, formed specific mechanisms of 
knowledge and power centering on sex. These did not come 

103 



104 


The History of Sexuality 


into being fully developed at that time; but it was then that 
they took on a consistency and gained an effectiveness in the 
order of power, as well as a productivity in the order of 
knowledge, so that it is possible to describe them in their 
relative autonomy. 

1. A hysterization of women’s bodies: a threefold process 
whereby the feminine body was analyzed—qualified and dis¬ 
qualified—as being thoroughly saturated with sexuality; 
whereby it was integrated into the sphere of medical prac¬ 
tices, by reason of a pathology intrinsic to it; whereby, finally, 
it was placed in organic communication with the social body 
(whose regulated fecundity it was supposed to ensure), the 
family space (of which it had to be a substantial and func¬ 
tional element), and the life of children (which it produced 
and had to guarantee, by virtue of a biologico-moral respon¬ 
sibility lasting through the entire period of the children’s 
education): the Mother, with her negative image of “nervous 
woman,” constituted the most visible form of this hysteriza¬ 
tion. 

2. A pedagogization of children's sex: a double assertion 
that practically all children indulge or are prone to indulge 
in sexual activity; and that, being unwarranted, at the same 
time “natural” and “contrary to nature,” this sexual activity 
posed physical and moral, individual and collective dangers; 
children were defined as “preliminary” sexual beings, on this 
side of sex, yet within it, astride a dangerous dividing line. 
Parents, families, educators, doctors, and eventually psy¬ 
chologists would have to take charge, in a continuous way, 
of this precious and perilous, dangerous and endangered 
sexual potential: this pedagogization was especially evident 
in the war against onanism, which in the West lasted nearly 
two centuries. 

3. A socialization of procreative behavior: an economic so¬ 
cialization via all the incitements and restrictions, the “so¬ 
cial” and fiscal measures brought to bear on the fertility of 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


105 


couples; a political socialization achieved through the “re- 
sponsibilization” of couples with regard to the social body as 
a whole (which had to be limited or on the contrary rein¬ 
vigorated), and a medical socialization carried out by at¬ 
tributing a pathogenic value—for the individual and the spe¬ 
cies—to birth-control practices. 

4. A psychiatrization of perverse pleasure: the sexual in¬ 
stinct was isolated as a separate biological and psychical 
instinct; a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of 
anomalies by which it could be afflicted; it was assigned a role 
of normalization or pathologization with respect to all be¬ 
havior; and finally, a corrective technology was sought for 
these anomalies. 

Four figures emerged from this preoccupation with sex, 
which mounted throughout the nineteenth century—four 
privileged objects of knowledge, which were also targets and 
anchorage points for the ventures of knowledge: the hysteri¬ 
cal woman, the masturbating child, the Malthusian couple, 
and the perverse adult. Each of them corresponded to one of 
these strategies which, each in its own way, invested and 
made use of the sex of women, children, and men. 

What was at issue in these strategies? A struggle against 
sexuality? Or were they part of an effort to gain control of 
it? An attempt to regulate it more effectively and mask its 
more indiscreet, conspicuous, and intractable aspects? A way 
of formulating only that measure of knowledge about it that 
was acceptable or useful? In actual fact, what was involved, 
rather, was the very production of sexuality. Sexuality must 
not be thought of as a kind of natural given which power tries 
to hold in check, or as an obscure domain which knowledge 
tries gradually to uncover. It is the name that can be given 
to a historical construct: not a furtive reality that is difficult 
to grasp, but a great surface network in which the stimula¬ 
tion of bodies, the intensification of pleasures, the incitement

to discourse, the formation of special knowledges, the 
strengthening of controls and resistances, are linked to one 
another, in accordance with a few major strategies of knowl¬ 
edge and power. 

It will be granted no doubt that relations of sex gave rise, 
in every society, to a deployment of alliance: a system of 
marriage, of fixation and development of kinship ties, of 
transmission of names and possessions. This deployment of 
alliance, with the mechanisms of constraint that ensured its 
existence and the complex knowledge it often required, lost 
some of its importance as economic processes and political 
structures could no longer rely on it as an adequate instru¬ 
ment or sufficient support. Particularly from the eighteenth 
century onward, Western societies created and deployed a 
new apparatus which was superimposed on the previous one, 
and which, without completely supplanting the latter, helped 
to reduce its importance. I am speaking of the deployment of 
sexuality: like the deployment of alliance, it connects up with 
the circuit of sexual partners, but in a completely different 
way. The two systems can be contrasted term by term. The 
deployment of alliance is built around a system of rules 
defining the permitted and the forbidden, the licit and the 
illicit, whereas the deployment of sexuality operates accord¬ 
ing to mobile, polymorphous, and contingent techniques of 
power. The deployment of alliance has as one of its chief 
objectives to reproduce the interplay of relations and main¬ 
tain the law that governs them; the deployment of sexuality, 
on the other hand, engenders a continual extension of areas 
and forms of control. For the first, what is pertinent is the 
link between partners and definite statutes; the second is 
concerned with the sensations of the body, the quality of 
pleasures, and the nature of impressions, however tenuous or 
imperceptible these may be. Lastly, if the deployment of 
alliance is firmly tied to the economy due to the role it can 
play in the transmission or circulation of wealth, the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality is linked to the economy through numer-

ous and subtle relays, the main one of which, however, is the 
body—the body that produces and consumes. In a word, the 
deployment of alliance is attuned to a homeostasis of the 
social body, which it has the function of maintaining; whence 
its privileged link with the law; whence too the fact that the 
important phase for it is “reproduction.” The deployment of 
sexuality has its reason for being, not in reproducing itself, 
but in proliferating, innovating, annexing, creating, and 
penetrating bodies in an increasingly detailed way, and in 
controlling populations in an increasingly comprehensive 
way. We are compelled, then, to accept three or four hypoth¬ 
eses which run counter to the one on which the theme of a 
sexuality repressed by the modern forms of society is based: 
sexuality is tied to recent devices of power; it has been ex¬ 
panding at an increasing rate since the seventeenth century; 
the arrangement that has sustained it is not governed by 
reproduction; it has been linked from the outset with an 
intensification of the body—with its exploitation as an object 
of knowledge and an element in relations of power. 

It is not exact to say that the deployment of sexuality 
supplanted the deployment of alliance. One can imagine that 
one day it will have replaced it. But as things stand at pre¬ 
sent, while it does tend to cover up the deployment of alli¬ 
ance, it has neither obliterated the latter nor rendered it 
useless. Moreover, historically it was around and on the basis 
of the deployment of alliance that the deployment of sexual¬ 
ity was constructed. First the practice of penance, then that 
of the examination of conscience and spiritual direction, was 
the formative nucleus: as we have seen, 1 what was at issue to 
begin with at the tribunal of penance was sex insofar as it was 
the basis of relations; the questions posed had to do with the 
commerce allowed or forbidden (adultery, extramarital rela¬ 
tions, relations with a person prohibited by blood or statute, 
the legitimate or illegitimate character of the act of sexual

congress); then, coinciding with the new pastoral and its 
application in seminaries, secondary schools, and convents, 
there was a gradual progression away from the problematic 
of relations toward a problematic of the “flesh,” that is, of 
the body, sensation, the nature of pleasure, the more secret 
forms of enjoyment or acquiescence. “Sexuality” was taking 
shape, born of a technology of power that was originally 
focused on alliance. Since then, it has not ceased to operate 
in conjunction with a system of alliance on which it has 
depended for support. The family cell, in the form in which 
it came to be valued in the course of the eighteenth century, 
made it possible for the main elements of the deployment of 
sexuality (the feminine body, infantile precocity, the regula¬ 
tion of births, and to a lesser extent no doubt, the specifica¬ 
tion of the perverted) to develop along its two primary 
dimensions: the husband-wife axis and the parents-children 
axis. The family, in its contemporary form, must not be 
understood as a social, economic, and political structure of 
alliance that excludes or at least restrains sexuality, that 
diminishes it as much as possible, preserving only its useful 
functions. On the contrary, its role is to anchor sexuality and 
provide it with a permanent support. It ensures the produc¬ 
tion of a sexuality that is not homogeneous with the privi¬ 
leges of alliance, while making it possible for the systems of 
alliance to be imbued with a new tactic of power which they 
would otherwise be impervious to. The family is the inter¬ 
change of sexuality and alliance: it conveys the law and the 
juridical dimension in the deployment of sexuality; and it 
conveys the economy of pleasure and the intensity of sensa¬ 
tions in the regime of alliance. 

This interpenetration of the deployment of alliance and 
that of sexuality in the form of the family allows us to under¬ 
stand a number of facts: that since the eighteenth century the 
family has become an obligatory locus of affects, feelings, 
love; that sexuality has its privileged point of development in 
the family; that for this reason sexuality is “incestuous” from

the start. It may be that in societies where the mechanisms 
of alliance predominate, prohibition of incest is a function¬ 
ally indispensable rule. But in a society such as ours, where 
the family is the most active site of sexuality, and where it 
is doubtless the exigencies of the latter which maintain and 
prolong its existence, incest—for different reasons altogether 
and in a completely different way—occupies a central place; 
it is constantly being solicited and refused; it is an object of 
obsession and attraction, a dreadful secret and an indispens¬ 
able pivot. It is manifested as a thing that is strictly forbidden 
in the family insofar as the latter functions as a deployment 
of alliance; but it is also a thing that is continuously de¬ 
manded in order for the family to be a hotbed of constant 
sexual incitement. If for more than a century the West has 
displayed such a strong interest in the prohibition of incest, 
if more or less by common accord it has been seen as a social 
universal and one of the points through which every society 
is obliged to pass on the way to becoming a culture, perhaps 
this is because it was found to be a means of self-defense, not 
against an incestuous desire, but against the expansion and 
the implications of this deployment of sexuality which had 
been set up, but which, among its its many benefits, had the 
disadvantage of ignoring the laws and juridical forms of 
alliance. By asserting that all societies without exception, 
and consequently our own, were subject to this rule of rules, 
one guaranteed that this deployment of sexuality, whose 
strange effects were beginning to be felt—among them, the 
affective intensification of the family space—would not be 
able to escape from the grand and ancient system of alliance. 
Thus the law would be secure, even in the new mechanics of 
power. For this is the paradox of a society which, from the 
eighteenth century to the present, has created so many tech¬ 
nologies of power that are foreign to the concept of law: it 
fears the effects and proliferations of those technologies and 
attempts to recode them in forms of law. If one considers the 
threshold of all culture to be prohibited incest, then sexuality 



110 


The History of Sexuality 


has been, from the dawn of time, under the sway of law and 
right. By devoting so much effort to an endless reworking of 
the transcultural theory of the incest taboo, anthropology 
has proved worthy of the whole modern deployment of sexu¬ 
ality and the theoretical discourses it generates. 

What has taken place since the seventeenth century can be 
interpreted in the following manner: the deployment of 
sexuality which first developed on the fringes of familial 
institutions (in the direction of conscience and pedagogy, for 
example) gradually became focused on the family: the alien, 
irreducible, and even perilous effects it held in store for the 
deployment of alliance (an awareness of this danger was 
evidenced in the criticism often directed at the indiscretion 
of the directors, and in the entire controversy, which oc¬ 
curred somewhat later, over the private or public, institu¬ 
tional or familial education of children 2 ) were absorbed by 
the family, a family that was reorganized, restricted no 
doubt, and in any case intensified in comparison with the 
functions it formerly exercised in the deployment of alliance. 
In the family, parents and relatives became the chief agents 
of a deployment of sexuality which drew its outside support 
from doctors, educators, and later psychiatrists, and which 
began by competing with the relations of alliance but soon 
“psychologized” or “psychiatrized” the latter. Then these 
new personages made their appearance: the nervous woman, 
the frigid wife, the indifferent mother—or worse, the mother 
beset by murderous obsessions—the impotent, sadistic, 
perverse husband, the hysterical or neurasthenic girl, the 
precocious and already exhausted child, and the young 
homosexual who rejects marriage or neglects his wife. These 
were the combined figures of an alliance gone bad and an 
abnormal sexuality; they were the means by which the dis¬ 
turbing factors of the latter were brought into the former; 

2 Moliere’s Tartuffe and Jakob Michael Lenz’s Tutor, separated by more than a 
century, both depict the interference of the deployment of sexuality in the family 
organization, apropos of spiritual direction in Tartuffe and education in The Tutor.

111 


and yet they also provided an opportunity for the alliance 
system to assert its prerogatives in the order of sexuality. 
Then a pressing demand emanated from the family: a 
plea for help in reconciling these unfortunate conflicts be¬ 
tween sexuality and alliance; and, caught in the grip of 
this deployment of sexuality which had invested it from 
without, contributing to its solidification into its modern 
form, the family broadcast the long complaint of its sex¬ 
ual suffering to doctors, educators, psychiatrists, priests, 
and pastors, to all the “experts” who would listen. It was 
as if it had suddenly discovered the dreadful secret of 
what had always been hinted at and inculcated in it: the 
family, the keystone of alliance, was the germ of all the 
misfortunes of sex. And lo and behold, from the mid¬ 
nineteenth century onward, the family engaged in search¬ 
ing out the slightest traces of sexuality in its midst, 
wrenching from itself the most difficult confessions, solic¬ 
iting an audience with everyone who might know some¬ 
thing about the matter, and opening itself unreservedly to 
endless examination. The family was the crystal in the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality: it seemed to be the source of a sex¬ 
uality which it actually only reflected and diffracted. By 
virtue of its permeability, and through that process of re¬ 
flections to the outside, it became one of the most valu¬ 
able tactical components of the deployment. 

But this development was not without its tensions and 
problems. Charcot doubtless constituted a central figure in 
this as well. For many years he was the most noteworthy of 
all those to whom families, burdened down as they were with 
this sexuality that saturated them, appealed for mediation 
and treatment. On receiving parents who brought him their 
children, husbands their wives, and wives their husbands, 
from the world over, his first concern was to separate the 
“patient” from his family, and the better to observe him, he 
would pay as little attention as possible to what the family 



112 


The History of Sexuality 


had to say. 3 He sought to detach the sphere of sexuality from 
the system of alliance, in order to deal with it directly 
through a medical practice whose technicity and autonomy 
were guaranteed by the neurological model. Medicine thus 
assumed final responsibility, according to the rules of a spe¬ 
cific knowledge, for a sexuality which it had in fact urged 
families to concern themselves with as an essential task and 
a major danger. Moreover, Charcot noted on several occa¬ 
sions how difficult it was for families to “yield” the patient 
whom they nonetheless had brought to the doctor, how they 
laid siege to the mental hospitals where the subject was being 
kept out of view, and the ways in which they were constantly 
interfering with the doctor’s work. Their worry was unwar¬ 
ranted, however: the therapist only intervened in order to 
return to them individuals who were sexually compatible 
with the family system; and while this intervention manipu¬ 
lated the sexual body, it did not authorize the latter to define 
itself in explicit discourse. One must not speak of these “geni¬ 
tal causes”: so went the phrase—muttered in a muted voice 
—which the most famous ears of our time overheard one day 
in 1886, from the mouth of Charcot. 

This was the context in which psychoanalysis set to work; 
but not without substantially modifying the pattern of anxie¬ 
ties and reassurances. In the beginning it must have given 
rise to distrust and hostility, for, pushing Charcot’s lesson to 
the extreme, it undertook to examine the sexuality of in¬ 
dividuals outside family control; it brought this sexuality to 
light without covering it over again with the neurological 
model; more serious still, it called family relations into ques¬ 
tion in the analysis it made of them. But despite everything, 

1 Jean-Martin Charcot, Lemons de Mardi, January 7, 1888: “In order to properly 
treat a hysterical girl, one must not leave her with her father and mother; she needs 
to be placed in a mental hospital. . . . Do you know how long well-behaved little 
girls cry for their mothers after they part company? . . . Let us take the average, 
if you will; it's not very long, a half-hour or thereabouts.” 

February 21, 1888: “In the case of hysteria of young boys, what one must do is 
to separate them from their mothers. So long as they are with their mothers, nothing 
is of any use. . . . The father is sometimes just as unbearable as the mother; it is 
best, then, to get rid of them both.”

psychoanalysis, whose technical procedure seemed to place 
the confession of sexuality outside family jurisdiction, redis¬ 
covered the law of alliance, the involved workings of mar¬ 
riage and kinship, and incest at the heart of this sexuality, as 
the principle of its formation and the key to its intelligibility. 
The guarantee that one would find the parents-children rela¬ 
tionship at the root of everyone’s sexuality made it possible 
—even when everything seemed to point to the reverse proc¬ 
ess—to keep the deployment of sexuality coupled to the 
system of alliance. There was no risk that sexuality would 
appear to be, by nature, alien to the law: it was constituted 
only through the law. Parents, do not be afraid to bring your 
children to analysis: it will teach them that in any case it is 
you whom they love. Children, you really shouldn’t com¬ 
plain that you are not orphans, that you always rediscover 
in your innermost selves your Object-Mother or the sover¬ 
eign sign of your Father: it is through them that you gain 
access to desire. Whence, after so many reticences, the enor¬ 
mous consumption of analysis in societies where the deploy¬ 
ment of alliance and the family system needed strengthening. 
For this is one of the most significant aspects of this entire 
history of the deployment of sexuality: it had its beginnings 
in the technology of the “flesh” in classical Christianity, 
basing itself on the alliance system and the rules that gov¬ 
erned the latter; but today it fills a reverse function in that 
it tends to prop up the old deployment of alliance. From the 
direction of conscience to psychoanalysis, the deployments 
of alliance and sexuality were involved in a slow process that 
had them turning about one another until, more than three 
centuries later, their positions were reversed; in the Christian 
pastoral, the law of alliance codified the flesh which was just 
being discovered and fitted it into a framework that was still 
juridical in character; with psychoanalysis, sexuality gave 
body and life to the rules of alliance by saturating them with 
desire. 

Hence the domain we must analyze in the different studies 
that will follow the present volume is that deployment of 



114

sexuality: its formation on the basis of the Christian notion 
of the flesh, and its development through the four great 
strategies that were deployed in the nineteenth century: the 
sexualization of children, the hysterization of women, the 
specification of the perverted, and the regulation of popula¬ 
tions—all strategies that went by way of a family which must 
be viewed, not as a powerful agency of prohibition, but as a 
major factor of sexualization. 

The first phase corresponded to the need to form a “labor 
force” (hence to avoid any useless “expenditure,” any wasted 
energy, so that all forces were reduced to labor capacity 
alone) and to ensure its reproduction (conjugality, the regu¬ 
lated fabrication of children). The second phase corre¬ 
sponded to that epoch of Spatkapitalismus in which the 
exploitation of wage labor does not demand the same violent 
and physical constraints as in the nineteenth century, and 
where the politics of the body does not require the elision of 
sex or its restriction solely to the reproductive function; it 
relies instead on a multiple channeling into the controlled 
circuits of the economy—on what has been called a hyper- 
repressive desublimation. 

If the politics of sex makes little use of the law of the taboo 
but brings into play an entire technical machinery, if what 
is involved is the production of sexuality rather than the 
repression of sex, then our emphasis has to be placed else¬ 
where; we must shift our analysis away from the problem of 
“labor capacity” and doubtless abandon the diffuse energet¬ 
ics that underlies the theme of a sexuality repressed for eco¬ 
nomic reasons.

Periodization 


The history of sexuality supposes two ruptures if one tries 
to center it on mechanisms of repression. The first, occurring 
in the course of the seventeenth century, was characterized 
by the advent of the great prohibitions, the exclusive promo¬ 
tion of adult marital sexuality, the imperatives of decency, 
the obligatory concealment of the body, the reduction to 
silence and mandatory reticences of language. The second, a 
twentieth-century phenomenon, was really less a rupture 
than an inflexion of the curve: this was the moment when the 
mechanisms of repression were seen as beginning to loosen 
their grip; one passed from insistent sexual taboos to a rela¬ 
tive tolerance with regard to prenuptial or extramarital rela¬ 
tions; the disqualification of “perverts” diminished, their 
condemnation by the law was in part eliminated; a good 
many of the taboos that weighed on the sexuality of children 
were lifted. 

We must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices: 
the inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renova¬ 
tions of previous techniques. But there is also the calendar 
of their utilization to consider, the chronology of their diffu¬ 
sion and of the effects (of subjugation and resistance) they 
produced. These multiple datings doubtless will not coincide 
with the great repressive cycle that is ordinarily situated 
between the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries. 

1. The chronology of the techniques themselves goes back 

115

a long way. Their point of formation must be sought in the 
penitential practices of medieval Christianity, or rather in 
the dual series constituted by the obligatory, exhaustive, and 
periodic confession imposed on all the faithful by the Lateran 
Council and by the methods of asceticism, spiritual exercise, 
and mysticism that evolved with special intensity from the 
sixteenth century on. First the Reformation, then Tridentine 
Catholicism, mark an important mutation and a schism in 
what might be called the “traditional technology of the 
flesh.” A division whose depth should not be under¬ 
estimated; but this did not rule out a certain parallelism in 
the Catholic and Protestant methods of examination of con¬ 
science and pastoral direction: procedures for analyzing 
“concupiscence” and transforming it into discourse were 
established in both instances. This was a rich, refined tech¬ 
nique which began to take shape in the sixteenth century and 
went through a long series of theoretical elaborations until, 
at the end of the eighteenth century, it became fixed in ex¬ 
pressions capable of symbolizing the mitigated strictness of 
Alfonso de’ Liguori in the one case and Wesleyan pedagogy 
in the other. 

It was during the same period—the end of the eighteenth 
century—and for reasons that will have to be determined, 
that there emerged a completely new technology of sex; new 
in that for the most part it escaped the ecclesiastical institu¬ 
tion without being truly independent of the thematics of sin. 
Through pedagogy, medicine, and economics, it made sex 
not only a secular concern but a concern of the state as well; 
to be more exact, sex became a matter that required the social 
body as a whole, and virtually all of its individuals, to place 
themselves under surveillance. New too for the fact that it 
expanded along three axes: that of pedagogy, having as its 
objective the specific sexuality of children; that of medicine, 
whose objective was the sexual physiology peculiar to 
women; and last, that of demography, whose objective was 
the spontaneous or concerted regulation of births. Thus the 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


117 


“sin of youth,” “nervous disorders,” and “frauds against 
procreation” (as those “deadly secrets” were later to be 
called) designate three privileged areas of this new technol¬ 
ogy. There is no question that in each of these areas, it went 
back to methods that had already been formed by Christian¬ 
ity, but of course not without modifying them: the sexuality 
of children was already problematized in the spiritual 
pedagogy of Christianity (it is interesting to note that Molli- 
ties, the first treatise on sin, was written in the fifteenth 
century by an educator and mystic named Gerson, and that 
the Onania collection compiled by Dekker in the eighteenth 
century repeats word for word examples set forth by the 
Anglican pastoral); the eighteenth-century medicine of 
nerves and vapors took up in turn a field of analysis that had 
already been delimited when the phenomena of possession 
fomented a grave crisis in the all too indiscreet practices of 
conscience direction and spiritual examination (nervous ill¬ 
ness is certainly not the truth of possession, but the medicine 
of hysteria is not unrelated to the earlier direction of “ob¬ 
sessed” women); and the campaigns apropos of the birthrate 
took the place of the control of conjugal relations—in a 
different form and at another level—which the Christian 
penance had so persistently sought to establish through its 
examinations. A visible continuity, therefore, but one that 
did not prevent a major transformation: from that time on, 
the technology of sex was ordered in relation to the medical 
institution, the exigency of normality, and—instead of the 
question of death and everlasting punishment—the problem 
of life and illness. The flesh was brought down to the level 
of the organism. 

This mutation took place at the turn of the nineteenth 
century; it opened the way for many other transformations 
that derived from it. The first of these set apart the medicine 
of sex from the medicine of the body; it isolated a sexual 
“instinct” capable of presenting constitutive anomalies, ac¬ 
quired derivations, infirmities, or pathological processes. 



118 


The History of Sexuality 


Heinrich Kaan’s Psychopathia Sexualis, published in 1846, 
can be used as an indicator: these were the years that saw the 
correlative appearance of a medicine, an “orthopedics,” 
specific to sex: in a word, the opening up of the great medico- 
psychological domain of the “perversions,” which was 
destined to take over from the old moral categories of de¬ 
bauchery and excess. In the same period, the analysis of 
heredity was placing sex (sexual relations, venereal diseases, 
matrimonial alliances, perversions) in a position of “biologi¬ 
cal responsibility” with regard to the species: not only could 
sex be affected by its own diseases, it could also, if it was not 
controlled, transmit diseases or create others that would 
afflict future generations. Thus it appeared to be the source 
of an entire capital for the species to draw from. Whence the 
medical—but also political—project for organizing a state 
management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex 
and its fertility had to be administered. The medicine of 
perversions and the programs of eugenics were the two great 
innovations in the technology of sex of the second half of the 
nineteenth century. 

Innovations that merged together quite well, for the 
theory of “degenerescence” made it possible for them to 
perpetually refer back to one another; it explained how a 
heredity that was burdened with various maladies (it made 
little difference whether these were organic, functional, or 
psychical) ended by producing a sexual pervert (look into the 
genealogy of an exhibitionist or a homosexual: you will find 
a hemiplegic ancestor, a phthisic parent, or an uncle afflicted 
with senile dementia); but it went on to explain how a sexual 
perversion resulted in the depletion of one’s line of descent 
—rickets in the children, the sterility of future generations. 
The series composed of perversion-heredity-degenerescence 
formed the solid nucleus of the new technologies of sex. And 
let it not be imagined that this was nothing more than a 
medical theory which was scientifically lacking and improp¬ 
erly moralistic. Its application was widespread and its im-

plantation went deep. Psychiatry, to be sure, but also juris¬ 
prudence, legal medicine, agencies of social control, the sur¬ 
veillance of dangerous or endangered children, all func¬ 
tioned for a long time on the basis of “degen - 
erescence” and the heredity-perversion system. An entire 
social practice, which took the exasperated but coherent 
form of a state-directed racism, furnished this technology of 
sex with a formidable power and far-reaching consequences. 

And the strange position of psychiatry at the end of the 
nineteenth century would be hard to comprehend if one did 
not see the rupture it brought about in the great system of 
degenerescence: it resumed the project of a medical technol¬ 
ogy appropriate for dealing with the sexual instinct; but it 
sought to free it from its ties with heredity, and hence from 
eugenics and the various racisms. It is very well to look back 
from our vantage point and remark upon the normalizing 
impulse in Freud; one can go on to denounce the role played 
for many years by the psychoanalytic institution; but the fact 
remains that in the great family of technologies of sex, which 
goes so far back into the history of the Christian West, of all 
those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to 
medicalize sex, it was the one that, up to the decade of the 
forties, rigorously opposed the political and institutional 
effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system. 

It is clear that the genealogy of all these techniques, with 
their mutations, their shifts, their continuities and ruptures, 
does not coincide with the hypothesis of a great repressive 
phase that was inaugurated in the course of the classical age 
and began to slowly decline in the twentieth. There was 
rather a perpetual inventiveness, a steady growth of methods 
and procedures, with two especially productive moments in 
this proliferating history: around the middle of the sixteenth 
century, the development of procedures of direction and 
examination of conscience; and at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century, the advent of medical technologies of sex. 

2. But the foregoing is still only a dating of the techniques 



120 


The History of Sexuality 


themselves. The history of their spread and their point of 
application is something else again. If one writes the history 
of sexuality in terms of repression, relating this repression to 
the utilization of labor capacity, one must suppose that sex¬ 
ual controls were the more intense and meticulous as they 
were directed at the poorer classes; one has to assume that 
they followed the path of greatest domination and the most 
systematic exploitation: the young adult man, possessing 
nothing more than his life force, had to be the primary target 
of a subjugation destined to shift the energy available for 
useless pleasure toward compulsory labor. But this does not 
appear to be the way things actually happened. On the con¬ 
trary, the most rigorous techniques were formed and, more 
particularly, applied first, with the greatest intensity, in the 
economically privileged and politically dominant classes. 
The direction of consciences, self-examination, the entire 
long elaboration of the transgressions of the flesh, and the 
scrupulous detection of concupiscence were all subtle proce¬ 
dures that could only have been accessible to small groups 
of people. It is true that the penitential method of Alfonso 
de’ Liguori and the rules recommended to the Methodists by 
Wesley ensured that these procedures would be more widely 
disseminated, after a fashion; but this was at the cost of a 
considerable simplification. 

The same can be said of the family as an agency of control 
and a point of sexual saturation; it was in the “bourgeois” or 
“aristocratic” family that the sexuality of children and 
adolescents was first problematized, and feminine sexuality 
medicalized; it was the first to be alerted to the potential 
pathology of sex, the urgent need to keep it under close 
watch and to devise a rational technology of correction. It 
was this family that first became a locus for the psychiatriza- 
tion of sex. Surrendering to fears, creating remedies, appeal¬ 
ing for rescue by learned techniques, generating countless 
discourses, it was the first to commit itself to sexual erethism. 
The bourgeoisie began by considering that its own sex was

something important, a fragile treasure, a secret that had to 
be discovered at all costs. It is worth remembering that the 
first figure to be invested by the deployment of sexuality, one 
of the first to be “sexualized,” was the “idle” woman. She 
inhabited the outer edge of the “world,” in which she always 
had to appear as a value, and of the family, where she was 
assigned a new destiny charged with conjugal and parental 
obligations. Thus there emerged the “nervous” woman, the 
woman afflicted with “vapors”; in this figure, the hysteriza- 
tion of woman found its anchorage point. As for the adoles¬ 
cent wasting his future substance in secret pleasures, the 
onanistic child who was of such concern to doctors and 
educators from the end of the eighteenth century to the end 
of the nineteenth, this was not the child of the people, the 
future worker who had to be taught the disciplines of the 
body, but rather the schoolboy, the child surrounded by 
domestic servants, tutors, and governesses, who was in dan¬ 
ger of compromising not so much his physical strength as his 
intellectual capacity, his moral fiber, and the obligation to 
preserve a healthy line of descent for his family and his social 
class. 

For their part, the working classes managed for a long 
time to escape the deployment of “sexuality. ” Of course, 
they were subjected in specific ways to the deployment of 
“alliances”: the exploitation of legitimate marriage and fertil¬ 
ity, the exclusion of consanguine sexual union, prescriptions 
of social and local endogamy. On the other hand, it is un¬ 
likely that the Christian technology of the flesh ever had any 
importance for them. As for the mechanisms of sexualiza- 
tion, these penetrated them slowly and apparently in three 
successive stages. The first involved the problems of birth 
control, when it was discovered, at the end of the eighteenth 
century, that the art of fooling nature was not the exclusive 
privilege of city dwellers and libertines, but was known and 
practiced by those who, being close to nature itself, should 
have held it to be more repugnant than anyone else did. Next

the organization of the “conventional” family came to be 
regarded, sometime around the eighteen-thirties, as an indis¬ 
pensable instrument of political control and economic regu¬ 
lation for the subjugation of the urban proletariat: there was 
a great campaign for the “moralization of the poorer 
classes.” The last stage came at the end of the nineteenth 
century with the development of the juridical and medical 
control of perversions, for the sake of a general protection of 
society and the race. It can be said that this was the moment 
when the deployment of “sexuality,” elaborated in its more 
complex and intense forms, by and for the privileged classes, 
spread through the entire social body. But the forms it took 
were not everywhere the same, and neither were the instru¬ 
ments it employed (the respective roles of medical and judi¬ 
cial authority were not the same in both instances; nor was 
even the way in which medicine and sexuality functioned). 

These chronological reminders—whether we are con¬ 
cerned with the invention of techniques or the calendar of 
their diffusion—are of some importance. They cast much 
doubt on the idea of a repressive cycle, with a beginning and 
an end and forming a curve with its point of inflexion: it 
appears unlikely that there was an age of sexual restriction. 
They also make it doubtful that the process was homoge¬ 
neous at all levels of society and in all social classes: there was 
no unitary sexual politics. But above all, they make the 
meaning of the process, and its reasons for being, problemati¬ 
cal: it seems that the deployment of sexuality was not estab¬ 
lished as a principle of limitation of the pleasures of others 
by what have traditionally been called the “ruling classes.” 
Rather it appears to me that they first tried it on themselves. 
Was this a new avatar of that bourgeois asceticism described 
so many times in connection with the Reformation, the new 
work ethic, and the rise of capitalism? It seems in fact that 
what was involved was not an asceticism, in any case not a 
renunciation of pleasure or a disqualification of the flesh, but 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


123 


on the contrary an intensification of the body, a problemati- 
zation of health and its operational terms: it was a question 
of techniques for maximizing life. The primary concern was 
not repression of the sex of the classes to be exploited, but 
rather the body, vigor, longevity, progeniture, and descent of 
the classes that “ruled.” This was the purpose for which the 
deployment of sexuality was first established, as a new distri¬ 
bution of pleasures, discourses, truths, and powers; it has to 
be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the 
enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthen¬ 
ing, and an exaltation that were eventually extended to oth¬ 
ers—at the cost of different transformations—as a means of 
social control and political subjugation. With this investment 
of its own sex by a technology of power and knowledge 
which it had itself invented, the bourgeoisie underscored the 
high political price of its body, sensations, and pleasures, its 
well-being and survival. Let us not isolate the restrictions, 
reticences, evasions, or silences which all these procedures 
may have manifested, in order to refer them to some con¬ 
stitutive taboo, psychical repression, or death instinct. What 
was formed was a political ordering of life, not through an 
enslavement of others, but through an affirmation of self. 
And this was far from being a matter of the class which in 
the eighteenth century became hegemonic believing itself 
obliged to amputate from its body a sex that was useless, 
expensive, and dangerous as soon as it was no longer given 
over exclusively to reproduction; we can assert on the con¬ 
trary that it provided itself with a body to be cared for, 
protected, cultivated, and preserved from the many dangers 
and contacts, to be isolated from others so that it would 
retain its differential value; and this, by equipping itself with 
—among other resources—a technology of sex. 

Sex is not that part of the body which the bourgeoisie was 
forced to disqualify or nullify in order to put those whom it 
dominated to work. It is that aspect of itself which troubled 
and preoccupied it more than any other, begged and obtained 



124 


The History of Sexuality 


its attention, and which it cultivated with a mixture of fear, 
curiosity, delight, and excitement. The bourgeoisie made this 
element identical with its body, or at least subordinated the 
latter to the former by attributing to it a mysterious and 
undefined power; it staked its life and its death on sex by 
making it responsible for its future welfare; it placed its hopes 
for the future in sex by imagining it to have ineluctable effects 
on generations to come; it subordinated its soul to sex by 
conceiving of it as what constituted the soul’s most secret and 
determinant part. Let us not picture the bourgeoisie symboli¬ 
cally castrating itself the better to refuse others the right to 
have a sex and make use of it as they please. This class must 
be seen rather as being occupied, from the mid-eighteenth 
century on, with creating its own sexuality and forming a 
specific body based on it, a “class” body with its health, 
hygiene, descent, and race: the autosexualization of its body, 
the incarnation of sex in its body, the endogamy of sex and 
the body. 

There were doubtless many reasons for this. First of all, 
there was a transposition into different forms of the methods 
employed by the nobility for marking and maintaining its 
caste distinction; for the aristocracy had also asserted the 
special character of its body, but this was in the form of 
blood, that is, in the form of the antiquity of its ancestry and 
of the value of its alliances; the bourgeoisie on the contrary 
looked to its progeny and the health of its organism when it 
laid claim to a specific body. The bourgeoisie’s “blood” was 
its sex. And this is more than a play on words; many of the 
themes characteristic of the caste manners of the nobility 
reappeared in the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie, but in the 
guise of biological, medical, or eugenic precepts. The concern 
with genealogy became a preoccupation with heredity; but 
included in bourgeois marriages were not only economic 
imperatives and rules of social homogeneity, not only the 
promises of inheritance, but the menaces of heredity; families 
wore and concealed a sort of reversed and somber escutcheon

whose defamatory quarters were the diseases or defects of the 
group of relatives—the grandfather’s general paralysis, the 
mother’s neurasthenia, the youngest child’s phthisis, the hys¬ 
terical or erotomanic aunts, the cousins with bad morals. But 
there was more to this concern with the sexual body than the 
bourgeois transposition of themes of the nobility for the 
purpose of self-affirmation. A different project was also in¬ 
volved: that of the indefinite extension of strength, vigor, 
health, and life. The emphasis on the body should undoubt¬ 
edly be linked to the process of growth and establishment of 
bourgeois hegemony: not, however, because of the market 
value assumed by labor capacity, but because of what the 
“cultivation” of its own body could represent politically, 
economically, and historically for the present and the future 
of the bourgeoisie. Its dominance was in part dependent on 
that cultivation; but it was not simply a matter of economy 
or ideology, it was a “physical” matter as well. The works, 
published in great numbers at the end of the eighteenth 
century, on body hygiene, the art of longevity, ways of hav¬ 
ing healthy children and of keeping them alive as long as 
possible, and methods for improving the human lineage, bear 
witness to the fact: they thus attest to the correlation of this 
concern with the body and sex to a type of “racism.” But the 
latter was very different from that manifested by the nobility 
and organized for basically conservative ends. It was a dy¬ 
namic racism, a racism of expansion, even if it was still in a 
budding state, awaiting the second half of the nineteenth 
century to bear the fruits that we have tasted. 

May I be forgiven by those for whom the bourgeoisie 
signifies the elision of the body and the repression of sexual¬ 
ity, for whom class struggle implies the fight to eliminate that 
repression; the “spontaneous philosophy” of the bourgeoisie 
is perhaps not as idealistic or castrating as is commonly 
thought. In any event, one of its primary concerns was to 
provide itself with a body and a sexuality—to ensure the 
strength, endurance, and secular proliferation of that body 



126 


The History of Sexuality 


through the organization of a deployment of sexuality. This 
process, moreover, was linked to the movement by which it 
asserted its distinctiveness and its hegemony. There is little 
question that one of the primordial forms of class conscious¬ 
ness is the affirmation of the body; at least, this was the case 
for the bourgeoisie during the eighteenth century. It con¬ 
verted the blue blood of the nobles into a sound organism and 
a healthy sexuality. One understands why it took such a long 
time and was so unwilling to acknowledge that other classes 
had a body and a sex—precisely those classes it was exploit¬ 
ing. The living conditions that were dealt to the proletariat, 
particularly in the first half of the nineteenth century, show 
there was anything but concern for its body and sex: 1 it was 
of little importance whether those people lived or died, since 
their reproduction was something that took care of itself in 
any case. Conflicts were necessary (in particular, conflicts 
over urban space: cohabitation, proximity, contamination, 
epidemics, such as the cholera outbreak of 1832, or again, 
prostitution and venereal diseases) in order for the proletar¬ 
iat to be granted a body and a sexuality; economic emergen¬ 
cies had to arise (the development of heavy industry with the 
need for a stable and competent labor force, the obligation 
to regulate the population flow and apply demographic con¬ 
trols); lastly, there had to be established a whole technology 
of control which made it possible to keep that body and 
sexuality, finally conceded to them, under surveillance 
(schooling, the politics of housing, public hygiene, institu¬ 
tions of relief and insurance, the general medicalization of 
the population, in short, an entire administrative and techni¬ 
cal machinery made it possible to safely import the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality into the exploited class; the latter no longer 
risked playing an assertive class role opposite the bourgeoi¬ 
sie; it would remain the instrument of the bourgeoisie’s

The Deployment of Sexuality

hegemony). Whence no doubt the proletariat’s hesitancy to 
accept this deployment and its tendency to say that this 
sexuality was the business of the the bourgeoisie and did not 
concern it. 

Some think they can denounce two symmetrical hypocri¬ 
sies at the same time: the primary hypocrisy of the bourgeoi¬ 
sie which denies its own sexuality, and the secondary hypoc¬ 
risy of the proletariat which in turn rejects its sexuality by 
accepting the dominant ideology. This is to misunderstand 
the process whereby on the contrary the bourgeoisie en¬ 
dowed itself, in an arrogant political affirmation, with a gar¬ 
rulous sexuality which the proletariat long refused to accept, 
since it was foisted on them for the purpose of subjugation. 
If it is true that sexuality is the set of effects produced in 
bodies, behaviors, and social relations by a certain deploy¬ 
ment deriving from a complex political technology, one has 
to admit that this deployment does not operate in symmetri¬ 
cal fashion with respect to the social classes, and conse¬ 
quently, that it does not produce the same effects in them. 
We must return, therefore, to formulations that have long 
been disparaged; we must say that there is a bourgeois sexu¬ 
ality, and that there are class sexualities. Or rather, that 
sexuality is originally, historically bourgeois, and that, in its 
successive shifts and transpositions, it induces specific class 
effects. 

A few more words are in order. As we have noted, the 
nineteenth century witnessed a generalization of the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality, starting from a hegemonic center. Eventu¬ 
ally the entire social body was provided with a “sexual 
body,” although this was accomplished in different ways and 
using different tools. Must we speak of the universality of 
sexuality, then? It is at this point that one notes the introduc¬ 
tion of a new differentiating element. Somewhat similar to 
the way in which, at the end of the eighteenth century, the 
bourgeoisie set its own body and its precious sexuality 



128 


The History of Sexuality 


against the valorous blood of the nobles, at the end of the 
nineteenth century it sought to redefine the specific character 
of its sexuality relative to that of others, subjecting it to a 
thorough differential review, and tracing a dividing line that 
would set apart and protect its body. This line was not the 
same as the one which founded sexuality, but rather a bar 
running through that sexuality; this was the taboo that con¬ 
stituted the difference, or at least the manner in which the 
taboo was applied and the rigor with which it was imposed. 
It was here that the theory of repression—which was gradu¬ 
ally expanded to cover the entire deployment of sexuality, so 
that the latter came to be explained in terms of a generalized 
taboo—had its point of origin. This theory is bound up his¬ 
torically with the spread of the deployment of sexuality. On 
the one hand, the theory would justify its authoritarian and 
constraining influence by postulating that all sexuality must 
be subject to the law; more precisely, that sexuality owes its 
very definition to the action of the law: not only will you 
submit your sexuality to the law, but you will have no sexual¬ 
ity except by subjecting yourself to the law. But on the other 
hand, the theory of repression would compensate for this 
general spread of the deployment of sexuality by its analysis 
of the differential interplay of taboos according to the social 
classes. The discourse which at the end of the eighteenth 
century said: “There is a valuable element within us that 
must be feared and treated with respect; we must exercise 
extreme care in dealing with it, lest it be the cause of count¬ 
less evils,” was replaced by a discourse which said: “Our 
sexuality, unlike that of others, is subjected to a regime of 
repression so intense as to present a constant danger; not 
only is sex a formidable secret, as the directors of conscience, 
moralists, pedagogues, and doctors always said to former 
generations, not only must we search it out for the truth it 
conceals, but if it carries with it so many dangers, this is 
because—whether out of scrupulousness, an overly acute 
sense of sin, or hypocrisy, no matter—we have too long 



The Deployment of Sexuality

reduced it to silence.” Henceforth social differentiation 
would be affirmed, not by the “sexual” quality of the body, 
but by the intensity of its repression. 

Psychoanalysis comes in at this juncture: both a theory of 
the essential interrelatedness of the law and desire, and a 
technique for relieving the effects of the taboo where its rigor 
makes it pathogenic. In its historical emergence, psychoanal¬ 
ysis cannot be dissociated from the generalization of the 
deployment of sexuality and the secondary mechanisms of 
differentiation that resulted from it. The problem of incest is 
still significant in this regard. On one hand, as we have seen, 
its prohibition was posited as an absolutely universal princi¬ 
ple which made it possible to explain both the system of 
alliance and the regime of sexuality; this taboo, in one form 
or another, was valid therefore for every society and every 
individual. But in practice psychoanalysis gave itself the task 
of alleviating the effects of repression (for those who were in 
a position to resort to psychoanalysis) that this prohibition 
was capable of causing; it allowed individuals to express their 
incestuous desire in discourse. But during the same period, 
there was a systematic campaign being organized against the 
kinds of incestuous practices that existed in rural areas or in 
certain urban quarters inaccessible to psychiatry: an inten¬ 
sive administrative and judicial grid was laid out then to put 
an end to these practices. An entire politics f or the protection 
of children or the placing of “endangered” minors under 
guardianship had as its partial objective their withdrawal 
from families that were suspected—through lack of space, 
dubious proximity, a history of debauchery, antisocial 
“primitiveness,” or degenerescence—of practicing incest. 
Whereas the deployment of sexuality had been intensifying 
affective relations and physical proximity since the eigh¬ 
teenth century, and although there had occurred a perpetual 
incitement to incest in the bourgeois family, the regime of 
sexuality applied to the lower classes on the contrary in¬ 
volved the exclusion of incestuous practices or at least their 



130 


The History of Sexuality 


displacement into another form. At a time when incest was 
being hunted out as a conduct, psychoanalysis was busy 
revealing it as a desire and alleviating—for those who suff¬ 
ered from the desire—the severity which repressed it. We 
must not forget that the discovery of the Oedipus complex 
was contemporaneous with the juridical organization of loss 
of parental authority (in France, this was formulated in the 
laws of 1889 and 1898). At the moment when Freud was 
uncovering the nature of Dora’s desire and allowing it to be 
put into words, preparations were being made to undo those 
reprehensible proximities in other social sectors; on the one 
hand, the father was elevated into an object of compulsory 
love, but on the other hand, if he was a loved one, he was 
at the same time a fallen one in the eyes of the law. Psychoa¬ 
nalysis, as a limited therapeutic practice, thus played a differ¬ 
entiating role with respect to other procedures, within a 
deployment of sexuality that had come into general use. 
Those who had lost the exclusive privilege of worrying over 
their sexuality henceforth had the privilege of experiencing 
more than others the thing that prohibited it and of possess¬ 
ing the method which made it possible to remove the repres¬ 
sion. 

The history of the deployment of sexuality, as it has 
evolved since the classical age, can serve as an archaeology 
of psychoanalysis. We have seen in fact that psychoanalysis 
plays several roles at once in this deployment: it is a mecha¬ 
nism for attaching sexuality to the system of alliance; it 
assumes an adversary position with respect to the theory of 
degenerescence; it functions as a differentiating factor in the 
general technology of sex. Around it the great requirement 
of confession that had taken form so long ago assumed the 
new meaning of an injunction to lift psychical repression. 
The task of truth was now linked to the challenging of 
taboos. 

This same development, moreover, opened up the possibil¬ 
ity of a substantial shift in tactics, consisting in: reinterpret- 



The Deployment of Sexuality 


131 


ing the deployment of sexuality in terms of a generalized 
repression; tying this repression to general mechanisms of 
domination and exploitation; and linking together the proc¬ 
esses that make it possible to free oneself both of repression 
and of domination and exploitation. Thus between the two 
world wars there was formed, around Reich, the historico- 
political critique of sexual repression. The importance of this 
critique and its impact on reality were substantial. But the 
very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it 
always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not 
outside or against it. The fact that so many things were able 
to change in the sexual behavior of Western societies without 
any of the promises or political conditions predicted by 
Reich being realized is sufficient proof that this whole sexual 
“revolution,” this whole “antirepressive” struggle, repre¬ 
sented nothing more, but nothing less—and its importance 
is undeniable—than a tactical shift and reversal in the great 
deployment of sexuality. But it is also apparent why one 
could not expect this critique to be the grid for a history of 
that very deployment. Nor the basis for a movement to dis¬ 
mantle it. 




PART FIVE 

Right of Death 
and Power over Life 




For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of 
sovereign power was the right to decide life and death. In a 
formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria 
potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the 
right to “dispose” of the life of his children and his slaves; 
just as he had given them life, so he could take it away. By 
the time the right of life and death was framed by the classi¬ 
cal theoreticians, it was in a considerably diminished form. 
It was no longer considered that this power of the sovereign 
over his subjects could be exercised in an absolute and un¬ 
conditional way, but only in cases where the sovereign’s very 
existence was in jeopardy: a sort of right of rejoinder. If he 
were threatened by external enemies who sought to over¬ 
throw him or contest his rights, he could then legitimately 
wage war, and require his subjects to take part in the defense 
of the state; without “directly proposing their death,” he was 
empowered to “expose their life”: in this sense, he wielded 
an “indirect” power over them of life and death. 1 But if 
someone dared to rise up against him and transgress his laws, 
then he could exercise a direct power over the offender’s life: 
as punishment, the latter would be put to death. Viewed in 
this way, the power of life and death was not an absolute 
privilege: it was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, 
and his own survival. Must we follow Hobbes in seeing it as 
the transfer to the prince of the natural right possessed by 
every individual to defend his life even if this meant the death 
of others? Or should it be regarded as a specific right that was 
manifested with the formation of that new juridical being, 

1 Samuel von Pufendorf, Le Droit de la nature (French trans., 1734), p. 445. 


135 



136

the sovereign? 2 In any case, in its modern form—relative and 
limited-as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life 
and death is a dissymmetrical one. The sovereign exercised 
his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by 
refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only 
through the death he was capable of requiring. The right 
which was formulated as the “power of life and death” was 
in reality the right to take life or let live. Its symbol, after 
all, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re¬ 
ferred to a historical type of society in which power was 
exercised mainly as a means of deduction (prelevement), a 
subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of 
the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and 
blood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was 
essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and 
ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize 
hold of life in order to suppress it. 

Since the classical age the West has undergone a very 
profound transformation of these mechanisms of power. 
“Deduction” has tended to be no longer the major form of 
power but merely one element among others, working to 
incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize 
the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak¬ 
ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated 
to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. 
There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least 
a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis¬ 
tering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that 
was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as 
simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, 
maintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody 
as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things 

2 “Just as a composite body can have properties not found in any of the simple bodies 
of which the mixture consists, so a moral body, by virtue of the very union of 
persons of which it is composed, can have certain rights which none of the individu¬ 
als could expressly claim and whose exercise is the proper function of leaders 
alone.” Pufendorf, Le Droit de la nature, p. 452. 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


137 


being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts 
on their own populations. But this formidable power of death 
—and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and 
the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits 
—now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that 
exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to adminis¬ 
ter, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls 
and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in 
the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are 
waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire popula¬ 
tions are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in 
the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is 
as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that 
so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, 
causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that 
closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them 
to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision 
that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in 
fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. 
The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: 
the power to expose a whole population to death is the 
underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s con¬ 
tinued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of bat¬ 
tle—that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on 
living—has become the principle that defines the strategy of 
states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical 
existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence 
of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern 
powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient 
right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at 
the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale 
phenomena of population. 

On another level, I might have taken up the example of the 
death penalty. Together with war, it was for a long time the 
other form of the right of the sword; it constituted the reply 
of the sovereign to those who attacked his will, his law, or 



138 


The History of Sexuality 


his person. Those who died on the scaffold became fewer and 
fewer, in contrast to those who died in wars. But it was for 
the same reasons that the latter became more numerous and 
the former more and more rare. As soon as power gave itself 
the function of administering life, its reason for being and the 
logic of its exercise—and not the awakening of humanitarian 
feelings—made it more and more difficult to apply the death 
penalty. How could power exercise its highest prerogatives 
by putting people to death, when its main role was to ensure, 
sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order? For such 
a power, execution was at the same time a limit, a scandal, 
and a contradiction. Hence capital punishment could not be 
maintained except by invoking less the enormity of the crime 
itself than the monstrosity of the criminal, his incorrigibility, 
and the safeguard of society. One had the right to kill those 
who represented a kind of biological danger to others. 

One might say that the ancient right to take life or let live 
was replaced by a power to foster life or disallow it to the 
point of death. This is perhaps what explains that disqualifi¬ 
cation of death which marks the recent wane of the rituals 
that accompanied it. That death is so carefully evaded is 
linked less to a new anxiety which makes death unbearable 
for our societies than to the fact that the procedures of power 
have not ceased to turn away from death. In the passage from 
this world to the other, death was the manner in which a 
terrestrial sovereignty was relieved by another, singularly 
more powerful sovereignty; the pageantry that surrounded it 
was in the category of political ceremony. Now it is over life, 
throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its domin¬ 
ion; death is power’s limit, the moment that escapes it; death 
becomes the most secret aspect of existence, the most “pri¬ 
vate.” It is not surprising that suicide—once a crime, since 
it was a way to usurp the power of death which the sovereign 
alone, whether the one here below or the Lord above, had the 
right to exercise—became, in the course of the nineteenth 
century, one of the first conducts to enter into the sphere of

sociological analysis; it testified to the individual and private 
right to die, at the borders and in the interstices of power that 
was exercised over life. This determination to die, strange 
and yet so persistent and constant in its manifestations, and 
consequently so difficult to explain as being due to particular 
circumstances or individual accidents, was one of the first 
astonishments of a society in which political power had as¬ 
signed itself the task of administering life. 

In concrete terms, starting in the seventeenth century, this 
power over life evolved in two basic forms; these forms were 
not antithetical, however; they constituted rather two poles 
of development linked together by a whole intermediary 
cluster of relations. One of these poles—the first to be 
formed, it seems—centered on the body as a machine: its 
disciplining, the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion 
of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its 
docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic 
controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power that 
characterized the disciplines: an anatomo-politics of the 
human body. The second, formed somewhat later, focused 
on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of 
life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propa¬ 
gation, births and mortality, the level of health, life expect¬ 
ancy and longevity, with all the conditions that can cause 
these to vary. Their supervision was effected through an 
entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a bio¬ 
politics of the population. The disciplines of the body and the 
regulations of the population constituted the two poles 
around which the organization of power over life was de¬ 
ployed. The setting up, in the course of the classical age, of 
this great bipolar technology—anatomic and biological, in¬ 
dividualizing and specifying, directed toward the perfor¬ 
mances of the body, with attention to the processes of life— 
characterized a power whose highest function was perhaps 
no longer to kill, but to invest life through and through. 

The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power

was now carefully supplanted by the administration of bodies 
and the calculated management of life. During the classical 
period, there was a rapid development of various disciplines 
—universities, secondary schools, barracks, workshops; 
there was also the emergence, in the field of political prac¬ 
tices and economic observation, of the problems of birthrate, 
longevity, public health, housing, and migration. Hence 
there was an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques 
for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of 
populations, marking the beginning of an era of “bio¬ 
power.” The two directions taken by its development still 
appeared to be clearly separate in the eighteenth century. 
With regard to discipline, this development was embodied in 
institutions such as the army and the schools, and in reflec¬ 
tions on tactics, apprenticeship, education, and the nature of 
societies, ranging from the strictly military analyses of Mar¬ 
shal de Saxe to the political reveries of Guibert or Servan. As 
for population controls, one notes the emergence of demog¬ 
raphy, the evaluation of the relationship between resources 
and inhabitants, the constructing of tables analyzing wealth 
and its circulation: the work of Quesnay, Moheau, and Siiss- 
milch. The philosophy of the “Ideologists,” as a theory of 
ideas, signs, and the individual genesis of sensations, but also 
a theory of the social composition of interests—Ideology 
being a doctrine of apprenticeship, but also a doctrine of 
contracts and the regulated formation of the social body— 
no doubt constituted the abstract discourse in which one 
sought to coordinate these two techniques of power in order 
to construct a general theory of it. In point of fact, however, 
they were not to be joined at the level of a speculative 
discourse, but in the form of concrete arrangements (agence- 
ments concrets) that would go to make up the great technol¬ 
ogy of power in the nineteenth century: the deployment of 
sexuality would be one of them, and one of the most impor¬ 
tant. 

This bio-power was without question an indispensable ele-

ment in the development of capitalism; the latter would not 
have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies 
into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the 
phenomena of population to economic processes. But this 
was not all it required; it also needed the growth of both these 
factors, their reinforcement as well as their availability and 
docility; it had to have methods of power capable of optimiz¬ 
ing forces, aptitudes, and life in general without at the same 
time making them more difficult to govern. If the develop¬ 
ment of the great instruments of the state, as institutions of 
power, ensured the maintenance of production relations, the 
rudiments of anatomo- and bio-politics, created in the eigh¬ 
teenth century as techniques of power present at every level 
of the social body and utilized by very diverse institutions 
(the family and the army, schools and the police, individual 
medicine and the administration of collective bodies), ope¬ 
rated in the sphere of economic processes, their development, 
and the forces working to sustain them. They also acted as 
factors of segregation and social hierarchization, exerting 
their influence on the respective forces of both these move¬ 
ments, guaranteeing relations of domination and effects of 
hegemony. The adjustment of the accumulation of men to 
that of capital, the joining of the growth of human groups to 
the expansion of productive forces and the differential alloca¬ 
tion of profit, were made possible in part by the exercise of 
bio-power in its many forms and modes of application. The 
investment of the body, its valorization, and the distributive 
management of its forces were at the time indispensable. 

One knows how many times the question has been raised 
concerning the role of an ascetic morality in the first forma¬ 
tion of capitalism; but what occurred in the eighteenth cen¬ 
tury in some Western countries, an event bound up with the 
development of capitalism, was a different phenomenon hav¬ 
ing perhaps a wider impact than the new morality; this was 
nothing less than the entry of life into history, that is, the 
entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species 



142 


The History of Sexuality 


into the order of knowledge and power, into the sphere of 
political techniques. It is not a question of claiming that this 
was the moment when the first contact between life and 
history was brought about. On the contrary, the pressure 
exerted by the biological on the historical had remained very 
strong for thousands of years; epidemics and famine were the 
two great dramatic forms of this relationship that was always 
dominated by the menace of death. But through a circular 
process, the economic—and primarily agricultural—devel¬ 
opment of the eighteenth century, and an increase in produc¬ 
tivity and resources even more rapid than the demographic 
growth it encouraged, allowed a measure of relief from these 
profound threats: despite some renewed outbreaks, the pe¬ 
riod of great ravages from starvation and plague had come 
to a close before the French Revolution; death was ceasing 
to torment life so directly. But at the same time, the develop¬ 
ment of the different fields of knowledge concerned with life 
in general, the improvement of agricultural techniques, and 
the observations and measures relative to man’s life and 
survival contributed to this relaxation: a relative control over 
life averted some of the imminent risks of death. In the space 
for movement thus conquered, and broadening and organiz¬ 
ing that space, methods of power and knowledge assumed 
responsibility for the life processes and undertook to control 
and modify them. Western man was gradually learning what 
it meant to be a living species in a living world, to have a 
body, conditions of existence, probabilities of life, an individ¬ 
ual and collective welfare, forces that could be modified, and 
a space in which they could be distributed in an optimal 
manner. For the first time in history, no doubt, biological 
existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living 
was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged 
from time to time, amid the randomness of death and its 
fatality; part of it passed into knowledge’s field of control and 
power’s sphere of intervention. Power would no longer be 
dealing simply with legal subjects over whom the ultimate 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


143 


dominion was death, but with living beings, and the mastery 
it would be able to exercise over them would have to be 
applied at the level of life itself; it was the taking charge of 
life, more than the threat of death, that gave power its access 
even to the body. If one can apply the term bio-history to the 
pressures through which the movements of life and the proc¬ 
esses of history interfere with one another, one would have 
to speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its 
mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made 
knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life. 
It is not that life has been totally integrated into techniques 
that govern and administer it; it constantly escapes them. 
Outside the Western world, famine exists, on a greater scale 
than ever; and the biological risks confronting the species are 
perhaps greater, and certainly more serious, than before the 
birth of microbiology. But what might be called a society’s 
“threshold of modernity” has been reached when the life of 
the species is wagered on its own political strategies. For 
millennia, man remained what he was for Aristotle: a living 
animal with the additional capacity for a political existence; 
modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence 
as a living being in question. 

This transformation had considerable consequences. It 
would serve no purpose here to dwell on the rupture that 
occurred then in the pattern of scientific discourse and on the 
manner in which the twofold problematic of life and man 
disrupted and redistributed the order of the classical epis- 
teme. If the question of man was raised—insofar as he was 
a specific living being, and specifically related to other living 
beings—the reason for this is to be sought in the new mode 
of relation between history and life: in this dual position of 
life that placed it at the same time outside history, in its 
biological environment, and inside human historicity, pene¬ 
trated by the latter’s techniques of knowledge and power. 
There is no need either to lay further stress on the prolifera¬ 
tion of political technologies that ensued, investing the body, 



144 


The History of Sexuality 


health, modes of subsistence and habitation, living condi¬ 
tions, the whole space of existence. 

Another consequence of this development of bio-power 
was the growing importance assumed by the action of the 
norm, at the expense of the juridical system of the law. Law 
cannot help but but be armed, and its arm, par excellence, 
is death; to those who transgress it, it replies, at least as a last 
resort, with that absolute menace. The law always refers to 
the sword. But a power whose task is to take charge of life 
needs continuous regulatory and corrective mechanisms. It 
is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field 
of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of 
value and utility. Such a power has to qualify, measure, 
appraise, and hierarchize, rather than display itself in its 
murderous splendor; it does not have to draw the line that 
separates the enemies of the sovereign from his obedient 
subjects; it effects distributions around the norm. I do not 
mean to say that the law fades into the background or that 
the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather that 
the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the 
judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a con¬ 
tinuum of apparatuses (medical, administrative, and so on) 
whose functions are for the most part regulatory. A normal¬ 
izing society is the historical outcome of a technology of 
power centered on life. We have entered a phase of juridical 
regression in comparison with the pre-seventeenth-century 
societies we are acquainted with; we should not be deceived 
by all the Constitutions framed throughout the world since 
the French Revolution, the Codes written and revised, a 
whole continual and clamorous legislative activity: these 
were the forms that made an essentially normalizing power 
acceptable. 

Moreover, against this power that was still new in the 
nineteenth century, the forces that resisted relied for support 
on the very thing it invested, that is, on life and man as a 
living being. Since the last century, the great struggles that 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


145 


have challenged the general system of power were not guided 
hy the belief in a return to former rights, or by the age-old 
dream of a cycle of time or a Golden Age. One no longer 
aspired toward the coming of the emperor of the poor, or the 
kingdom of the latter days, or even the restoration of our 
imagined ancestral rights; what was demanded and what 
served as an objective was life, understood as the basic needs, 
man’s concrete essence, the realization of his potential, a 
plenitude of the possible. Whether or not it was Utopia that 
was wanted is of little importance; what we have seen has 
been a very real process of struggle; life as a political object 
was in a sense taken at face value and turned back against 
the system that was bent on controlling it. It was life more 
than the law that became the issue of political struggles, even 
if the latter were formulated through affirmations concerning 
rights. The “right” to life, to one’s body, to health, to happi¬ 
ness, to the satisfaction of needs, and beyond all the oppres¬ 
sions or “alienations,” the “right” to rediscover what one is 
and all that one can be, this “right”—which the classical 
juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending— 
was the political response to all these new procedures of 
power which did not derive, either, from the traditional right 
of sovereignty. 

This is the background that enables us to understand the 
importance assumed by sex as a political issue. It was at the 
pivot of the two axes along which developed the entire politi¬ 
cal technology of life. On the one hand it was tied to the 
disciplines of the body: the harnessing, intensification, and 
distribution of forces, the adjustment and economy of ener¬ 
gies. On the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of 
populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activ¬ 
ity. It fitted in both categories at once, giving rise to infinitesi¬ 
mal surveillances, permanent controls, extremely meticulous 
orderings of space, indeterminate medical or psychological 
examinations, to an entire micro-power concerned with the 



146 


The History of Sexuality 


body. But it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, 
statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire 
social body or at groups taken as a whole. Sex was a means 
of access both to the life of the body and the life of the 
species. It was employed as a standard for the disciplines and 
as a basis for regulations. This is why in the nineteenth 
century sexuality was sought out in the smallest details of 
individual existences; it was tracked down in behavior, pur¬ 
sued in dreams; it was suspected of underlying the least 
follies, it was traced back into the earliest years of childhood; 
it became the stamp of individuality—at the same time what 
enabled one to analyze the latter and what made it possible 
to master it. But one also sees it becoming the theme of 
political operations, economic interventions (through incite¬ 
ments to or curbs on procreation), and ideological campaigns 
for raising standards of morality and responsibility: it was 
put forward as the index of a society’s strength, revealing of 
both its political energy and its biological vigor. Spread out 
from one pole to the other of this technology of sex was a 
whole series of different tactics that combined in varying 
proportions the objective of disciplining the body and that of 
regulating populations. 

Whence the importance of the four great lines of attack 
along which the politics of sex advanced for two centuries. 
Each one was a way of combining disciplinary techniques 
with regulative methods. The first two rested on the require¬ 
ments of regulation, on a whole thematic of the species, 
descent, and collective welfare, in order to obtain results at 
the level of discipline; the sexualization of children was ac¬ 
complished in the form of a campaign for the health of the 
race (precocious sexuality was presented from the eighteenth 
century to the end of the nineteenth as an epidemic menace 
that risked compromising not only the future health of adults 
but the future of the entire society and species); the hysteriza- 
tion of women, which involved a thorough medicalization of 
their bodies and their sex, was carried out in the name of the 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


147 


responsibility they owed to the health of their children, the 
solidity of the family institution, and the safeguarding of 
society. It was the reverse relationship that applied in the 
case of birth controls and the psychiatrization of perversions: 
here the intervention was regulatory in nature, but it had to 
rely on the demand for individual disciplines and constraints 
(dressages). Broadly speaking, at the juncture of the “body” 
and the “population,” sex became a crucial target of a power 
organized around the management of life rather than the 
menace of death. 

The blood relation long remained an important element in 
the mechanisms of power, its manifestations, and its rituals. 
For a society in which the systems of alliance, the political 
form of the sovereign, the differentiation into orders and 
castes, and the value of descent lines were predominant; for 
a society in which famine, epidemics, and violence made 
death imminent, blood constituted one of the fundamental 
values. It owed its high value at the same time to its instru¬ 
mental role (the ability to shed blood), to the way it func¬ 
tioned in the order of signs (to have a certain blood, to be of 
the same blood, to be prepared to risk one’s blood), and also 
to its precariousness (easily spilled, subject to drying up, too 
readily mixed, capable of being quickly corrupted). A society 
of blood—I was tempted to say, of “sanguinity”—where 
power spoke through blood: the honor of war, the fear of 
famine, the triumph of death, the sovereign with his sword, 
executioners, and tortures; blood was a reality with a sym¬ 
bolic function. We, on the other hand, are in a society of 
“sex,” or rather a society “with a sexuality”: the mechanisms 
of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes 
it to proliferate, to what reinforces the species, its stamina, 
its ability to dominate, or its capacity for being used. 
Through the themes of health, progeny, race, the future of 
the species, the vitality of the social body, power spoke of 
sexuality and to sexuality, the latter was not a mark or a 
symbol, it was an object and a target. Moreover, its impor- 



148 


The History of Sexuality 


tance was due less to its rarity or its precariousness than to 
its insistence, its insidious presence, the fact that it was every¬ 
where an object of excitement and fear at the same time. 
Power delineated it, aroused it, and employed it as the prolif¬ 
erating meaning that had always to be taken control of again 
lest it escape; it was an effect with a meaning-value. I do not 
mean to say that a substitution of sex for blood was by itself 
responsible for all the transformations that marked the 
threshold of our modernity. It is not the soul of two civiliza¬ 
tions or the organizing principle of two cultural forms that 
I am attempting to express; I am looking for the reasons for 
which sexuality, far from being repressed in the society of 
that period, on the contrary was constantly aroused. The 
new procedures of power that were devised during the classi¬ 
cal age and employed in the nineteenth century were what 
caused our societies to go from a symbolics of blood to an 
analytics of sexuality. Clearly, nothing was more on the side 
of the law, death, transgression, the symbolic, and sove¬ 
reignty than blood; just as sexuality was on the side of the 
norm, knowledge, life, meaning, the disciplines, and regula¬ 
tions. 

Sade and the first eugenists were contemporary with this 
transition from “sanguinity” to “sexuality.” But whereas the 
first dreams of the perfecting of the species inclined the whole 
problem toward an extremely exacting administration of sex 
(the art of determining good marriages, of inducing the 
desired fertilities, of ensuring the health and longevity of 
children), and while the new concept of race tended to oblit¬ 
erate the aristocratic particularities of blood, retaining only 
the controllable effects of sex, Sade carried the exhaustive 
analysis of sex over into the mechanisms of the old power of 
sovereignty and endowed it with the ancient but fully main¬ 
tained prestige of blood; the latter flowed through the whole 
dimension of pleasure—the blood of torture and absolute 
power, the blood of the caste which was respected in itself 
and which nonetheless was made to flow in the major rituals 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


149 


of parricide and incest, the blood of the people, which was 
shed unreservedly since the sort that flowed in its veins was 
not even deserving of a name. In Sade, sex is without any 
norm or intrinsic rule that might be formulated from its own 
nature; but it is subject to the unrestricted law of a power 
which itself knows no other law but its own; if by chance it 
is at times forced to accept the order of progressions carefully 
disciplined into successive days, this exercise carries it to a 
point where it is no longer anything but a unique and naked 
sovereignty: an unlimited right of all-powerful monstrosity. 

While it is true that the analytics of sexuality and the 
symbolics of blood were grounded at first in two very distinct 
regimes of power, in actual fact the passage from one to the 
other did not come about (any more than did these powers 
themselves) without overlappings, interactions, and echoes. 
In different ways, the preoccupation with blood and the law 
has for nearly two centuries haunted the administration of 
sexuality. Two of these interferences are noteworthy, the one 
for its historical importance, the other for the problems it 
poses. Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, 
the thematics of blood was sometimes called on to lend its 
entire historical weight toward revitalizing the type of politi¬ 
cal power that was exercised through the devices of sexuality. 
Racism took shape at this point (racism in its modern, “bi¬ 
ologizing,” statist form): it was then that a whole politics of 
settlement (peuplement), family, marriage, education, social 
hierarchization, and property, accompanied by a long series 
of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct, 
health, and everyday life, received their color and their jus¬ 
tification from the mythical concern with protecting the 
purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race. 
Nazism was doubtless the most cunning and the most naive 
(and the former because of the latter) combination of the 
fantasies of blood and the paroxysms of a disciplinary power. 
A eugenic ordering of society, with all that implied in the 
way of extension and intensification of micro-powers, in the 



150 


The History of Sexuality 


guise of an unrestricted state control (etatisation), was ac¬ 
companied by the oneiric exaltation of a superior blood; the 
latter implied both the systematic genocide of others and the 
risk of exposing oneself to a total sacrifice. It is an irony of 
history that the Hitlerite politics of sex remained an insignifi¬ 
cant practice while the blood myth was transformed into the 
greatest blood bath in recent memory. 

At the opposite extreme, starting from this same end of the 
nineteenth century, we can trace the theoretical effort to 
reinscribe the thematic of sexuality in the system of law, the 
symbolic order, and sovereignty. It is to the political credit 
of psychoanalysis—or at least, of what was most coherent in 
it—that it regarded with suspicion (and this from its incep¬ 
tion, that is, from the moment it broke away from the neu¬ 
ropsychiatry of degenerescence) the irrevocably proliferating 
aspects which might be contained in these power mech¬ 
anisms aimed at controlling and administering the everyday 
life of sexuality: whence the Freudian endeavor (out of reac¬ 
tion no doubt to the great surge of racism that was contem¬ 
porary with it) to ground sexuality in the law—the law of 
alliance, tabooed consanguinity, and the Sovereign-Father, 
in short, to surround desire with all the trappings of the old 
order of power. It was owing to this that psychoanalysis was 
—in the main, with a few exceptions—in theoretical and 
practical opposition to fascism. But this position of psychoa¬ 
nalysis was tied to a specific historical conjuncture. And yet, 
to conceive the category of the sexual in terms of the law, 
death, blood, and sovereignty—whatever the references 
to Sade and Bataille, and however one might gauge their 
“subversive” influence—is in the last analysis a historical 
“retro-version.” We must conceptualize the deployment of 
sexuality on the basis of the techniques of power that are 
contemporary with it. 

People are going to say that I am dealing in a historicism 
which is more careless than radical; that I am evading the

biologically established existence of sexual functions for the 
benefit of phenomena that are variable, perhaps, but fragile, 
secondary, and ultimately superficial; and that I speak of 
sexuality as if sex did not exist. And one would be entitled 
to object as follows: “You claim to analyze in detail the 
processes by which women’s bodies, the lives of children, 
family relationships, and an entire network of social relations 
were sexualized. You wish to describe that great awakening 
of sexual concern since the eighteenth century and our grow¬ 
ing eagerness to suspect the presence of sex in everything. Let 
us admit as much and suppose that the mechanisms of power 
were in fact used more to arouse and ‘excite’ sexuality than 
to repress it. But here you remain quite near to the thing you 
no doubt believe you have gotten away from; at bottom, 
when you point out phenomena of diffusion, anchorage, and 
fixation of sexuality, you are trying to reveal what might be 
called the organization of ‘erotic zones’ in the social body; it 
may well be the case that you have done nothing more than 
transpose to the level of diffuse processes mechanisms which 
psychoanalysis has identified with precision at the level of the 
individual. But you pass over the thing on the basis of which 
this sexualization was able to develop and which psychoanal¬ 
ysis does not fail to recognize—namely, sex. Before Freud, 
one sought to localize sexuality as closely as possible: in sex, 
in its reproductive functions, in its immediate anatomical 
localizations; one fell back upon a biological minimum: 
organ, instinct, and finality. You, on the other hand, are in 
a symmetrical and inverse position: for you, there remain 
only groundless effects, ramifications without roots, a sexual¬ 
ity without a sex. What is this if not castration once again?” 

Here we need to distinguish between two questions. First, 
does the analysis of sexuality necessarily imply the elision of 
the body, anatomy, the biological, the functional? To this 
question, I think we can reply in the negative. In any case, 
the purpose of the present study is in fact to show how 
deployments of power are directly connected to the body— 



152 


The History of Sexuality 


to bodies, functions, physiological processes, sensations, and 
pleasures; far from the body having to be effaced, what is 
needed is to make it visible through an analysis in which the 
biological and the historical are not consecutive to one an¬ 
other, as in the evolutionism of the first sociologists, but are 
bound together in an increasingly complex fashion in accord¬ 
ance with the development of the modern technologies of 
power that take life as their objective. Hence I do not envis¬ 
age a “history of mentalities” that would take account of 
bodies only through the manner in which they have been 
perceived and given meaning and value; but a “history of 
bodies” and the manner in which what is most material and 
most vital in them has been invested. 

Another question, distinct from the first one: this material¬ 
ity that is referred to, is it not, then, that of sex, and is it not 
paradoxical to venture a history of sexuality at the level of 
bodies, without there being the least question of sex? After 
all, is the power that is exercised through sexuality not di¬ 
rected specifically at that element of reality which is “sex,” 
sex in general? That sexuality is not, in relation to power, an 
exterior domain to which power is applied, that on the con¬ 
trary it is a result and an instrument of power’s designs, is 
all very well. But as for sex, is it not the “other” with respect 
to power, while being the center around which sexuality 
distributes its effects? Now, it is precisely this idea of sex in 
itself that we cannot accept without examination. Is “sex” 
really the anchorage point that supports the manifestations 
of sexuality, or is it not rather a complex idea that was 
formed inside the deployment of sexuality? In any case, one 
could show how this idea of sex took form in the different 
strategies of power and the definite role it played therein. 

All along the great lines which the development of the 
deployment of sexuality has followed since the nineteenth 
century, one sees the elaboration of this idea that there exists 
something other than bodies, organs, somatic localizations, 
functions, anatomo-physiological systems, sensations, and 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


153 


pleasures; something else and something more, with intrinsic 
properties and laws of its own: “sex.” Thus, in the process 
of hysterization of women, “sex” was defined in three ways: 
as that which belongs in common to men and women; as that 
which belongs, par excellence, to men, and hence is lacking 
in women; but at the same time, as that which by itself 
constitutes woman’s body, ordering it wholly in terms of the 
functions of reproduction and keeping it in constant agita¬ 
tion through the effects of that very function. Hysteria was 
interpreted in this strategy as the movement of sex insofar as 
it was the “one” and the “other,” whole and part, principle 
and lack. In the sexualization of childhood, there was formed 
the idea of a sex that was both present (from the evidence of 
anatomy) and absent (from the standpoint of physiology), 
present too if one considered its activity, and deficient if one 
referred to its reproductive finality; or again, actual in its 
manifestations, but hidden in its eventual effects, whose path¬ 
ological seriousness would only become apparent later. If the 
sex of the child was still present in the adult, it was in the 
form of a secret causality that tended to nullify the sex of the 
latter (it was one of the tenets of eighteenth- and nineteenth- 
century medicine that precocious sex would eventually result 
in sterility, impotence, frigidity, the inability to experience 
pleasure, or the deadening of the senses); by sexualizing 
childhood, the idea was established of a sex characterized 
essentially by the interplay of presence and absence, the visi¬ 
ble and the hidden; masturbation and the effects imputed to 
it were thought to reveal in a privileged way this interplay 
of presence and absence, of the visible and the hidden. 

In the psychiatrization of perversions, sex was related to 
biological functions and to an anatomo-physiological ma¬ 
chinery that gave it its “meaning,” that is, its finality; but it 
was also referred to an instinct which, through its peculiar 
development and according to the objects to which it could 
become attached, made it possible for perverse behavior pat¬ 
terns to arise and made their genesis intelligible. Thus “sex” 



154 


The History of Sexuality 


was defined by the interlacing of function and instinct, final¬ 
ity and signification; moreover, this was the form in which 
it was manifested, more clearly than anywhere else, in the 
model perversion, in that “fetishism” which, from at least as 
early as 1877, served as the guiding thread for analyzing all 
the other deviations. In it one could clearly perceive the way 
in which the instinct became fastened to an object in accord¬ 
ance with an individual’s historical adherence and biological 
inadequacy. Lastly, in the socialization of procreative behav¬ 
ior, “sex” was described as being caught between a law of 
reality (economic necessity being its most abrupt and imme¬ 
diate form) and an economy of pleasure which was always 
attempting to circumvent that law—when, that is, it did not 
ignore it altogether. The most notorious of “frauds,” coitus 
interruptus, represented the point where the insistence of the 
real forced an end to pleasure and where the pleasure found 
a way to surface despite the economy dictated by the real. It 
is apparent that the deployment of sexuality, with its differ¬ 
ent strategies, was what established this notion of “sex”; and 
in the four major forms of hysteria, onanism, fetishism, and 
interrupted coition, it showed this sex to be governed by the 
interplay of whole and part, principle and lack, absence and 
presence, excess and deficiency, by the function of instinct, 
finality, and meaning, of reality and pleasure. 

The theory thus generated performed a certain number of 
functions that made it indispensable. First, the notion of 
“sex” made it possible to group together, in an artificial 
unity, anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts, 
sensations, and pleasures, and it enabled one to make use of 
this fictitious unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent 
meaning, a secret to be discovered everywhere: sex was thus 
able to function as a unique signifier and as a universal 
signified. Further, by presenting itself in a unitary fashion, as 
anatomy and lack, as function and latency, as instinct and 
meaning, it was able to mark the line of contact between a 
knowledge of human sexuality and the biological sciences of 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


155 


reproduction; thus, without really borrowing anything from 
the these sciences, excepting a few doubtful analogies, the 
knowledge of sexuality gained through proximity a guaran¬ 
tee of quasi-scientificity; but by virtue of this same proximity, 
some of the contents of biology and physiology were able to 
serve as a principle of normality for human sexuality. Fi¬ 
nally, the notion of sex brought about a fundamental rever¬ 
sal; it made it possible to invert the representation of the 
relationships of power to sexuality, causing the latter to ap¬ 
pear, not in its essential and positive relation to power, but 
as being rooted in a specific and irreducible urgency which 
power tries as best it can to dominate; thus the idea of “sex” 
makes it possible to evade what gives “power” its power; it 
enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo. Sex 
—that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret 
which seems to underlie all that we are, that point which 
enthralls us through the the power it manifests and the 
meaning it conceals, and which we ask to reveal what we are 
and to free us from what defines us—is doubtless but an ideal 
point made necessary by the deployment of sexuality and its 
operation. We must not make the mistake of thinking that 
sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces 
manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its 
surface of contact with power. On the contrary, sex is the 
most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a 
deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on 
bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensa¬ 
tions, and pleasures. 

It might be added that “sex” performs yet another func¬ 
tion that runs through and sustains the ones we have just 
examined. Its role in this instance is more practical than 
theoretical. It is through sex—in fact, an imaginary point 
determined by the deployment of sexuality—that each 
individual has to pass in order to have access to his own 
intelligibility (seeing that it is both the hidden aspect and the 
generative principle of meaning), to the whole of his body 



156 


The History of Sexuality 


(since it is a real and threatened part of it, while symbolically 
constituting the whole), to his identity (since it joins the force 
of a drive to the singularity of a history). Through a reversal 
that doubtless had its surreptitious beginnings long ago—it 
was already making itself felt at the time of the Christian 
pastoral of the flesh—we have arrived at the point where we 
expect our intelligibility to come from what was for many 
centuries thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body 
from what was long considered its stigma and likened to a 
wound; our identity from what was perceived as an obscure 
and nameless urge. Hence the importance we ascribe to it, 
the reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we 
take to know it. Hence the fact that over the centuries it has 
become more important than our soul, more important al¬ 
most than our life; and so it is that all the world’s enigmas 
appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in 
each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than 
any other. The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been 
instilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as 
follows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the 
truth and the sovereignty of sex. Sex is worth dying for. It 
is in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued 
with the death instinct. When a long while ago the West 
discovered love, it bestowed on it a value high enough to 
make death acceptable; nowadays it is sex that claims this 
equivalence, the highest of all. And while the deployment of 
sexuality permits the techniques of power to invest life, the 
fictitious point of sex, itself marked by that deployment, 
exerts enough charm on everyone for them to accept hearing 
the grumble of death within it. 

By creating the imaginary element that is “sex,” the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality established one of its most essential 
internal operating principles: the desire for sex—the desire to 
have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to 
articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth. It con¬ 
stituted “sex” itself as something desirable. And it is this 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


157 


desirability of sex that attaches each one of us to the injunc¬ 
tion to know it, to reveal its law and its power; it is this 
desirability that makes us think we are affirming the rights 
of our sex against all power, when in fact we are fastened to 
the deployment of sexuality that has lifted up from deep 
within us a sort of mirage in which we think we see ourselves 
reflected—the dark shimmer of sex. 

“It is sex,” said Kate in The Plumed Serpent. “How won¬ 
derful sex can be, when men keep it powerful and sacred, and 
it fills the world! like sunshine through and through one!” 

So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency 
of sex; but rather show how “sex” is historically subordinate 
to sexuality. We must not place sex on the side of reality, and 
sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is 
a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the 
notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its opera¬ 
tion. We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says 
no to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid 
out by the general deployment of sexuality. It is the agency 
of sex that we must break away from, if we aim—through a 
tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality—to 
counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleas¬ 
ures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibil¬ 
ity of resistance. The rallying point for the counterattack 
against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex- 
desire, but bodies and pleasures. 

“There has been so much action in the past,” said D. H. 
Lawrence, “especially sexual action, a wearying repetition 
over and over, without a corresponding thought, a corre¬ 
sponding realization. Now our business is to realize sex. 
Today the full conscious realization of sex is even more 
important than the act itself.” 

Perhaps one day people will wonder at this. They will not 
be able to understand how a civilization so intent on develop¬ 
ing enormous instruments of production and destruction 



158 


The History of Sexuality 


found the time and the infinite patience to inquire so anxi¬ 
ously concerning the actual state of sex; people will smile 
perhaps when they recall that here were men—meaning our¬ 
selves—who believed that therein resided a truth every bit as 
precious as the one they had already demanded from the 
earth, the stars, and the pure forms of their thought; people 
will be surprised at the eagerness with which we went about 
pretending to rouse from its slumber a sexuality which every¬ 
thing—our discourses, our customs, our institutions, our 
regulations, our knowledges—was busy producing in the 
light of day and broadcasting to noisy accompaniment. And 
people will ask themselves why we were so bent on ending 
the rule of silence regarding what was the noisiest of our 
preoccupations. In retrospect, this noise may appear to have 
been out of place, but how much stranger will seem our 
persistence in interpreting it as but the refusal to speak and 
the order to remain silent. People will wonder what could 
have made us so presumptuous; they will look for the reasons 
that might explain why we prided ourselves on being the first 
to grant sex the importance we say is its due and how we 
came to congratulate ourselves for finally—in the twentieth 
century—having broken free of a long period of harsh repres¬ 
sion, a protracted Christian asceticism, greedily and fastidi¬ 
ously adapted to the imperatives of bourgeois economy. And 
what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and 
the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the 
centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling 
sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon 
sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when 
in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality. 

People will be amused at the reproach of pansexualism 
that was once aimed at Freud and psychoanalysis. But the 
ones who will appear to have been blind will perhaps be not 
so much those who formulated the objection as those who 
discounted it out of hand, as if it merely expressed the fears 
of an outmoded prudishness. For the first, after all, were only 



Right of Death and Power over Life 


159 


taken unawares by a process which had begun long before 
and by which, unbeknown to them, they were already sur¬ 
rounded on all sides; what they had attributed solely to the 
genius of Freud had already gone through a long stage of 
preparation; they had gotten their dates wrong as to the 
establishment, in our society, of a general deployment of 
sexuality. But the others were mistaken concerning the na¬ 
ture of the process; they believed that Freud had at last, 
through a sudden reversal, restored to sex the rightful share 
which it had been denied for so long; they had not seen how 
the good genius of Freud had placed it at one of the critical 
points marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the 
strategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effec¬ 
tive he was—worthy of the greatest spiritual fathers and 
directors of the classical period—in giving a new impetus to 
the secular injunction to study sex and transform it into 
discourse. We are often reminded of the countless procedures 
which Christianity once employed to make us detest the 
body; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for 
centuries to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it 
desirable and everything said about it precious. Let us con¬ 
sider the stratagems by which we were induced to apply all 
our skills to discovering its secrets, by which we were at¬ 
tached to the obligation to draw out its truth, and made 
guilty for having failed to recognize it for so long. These 
devices are what ought to make us wonder today. Moreover, 
we need to consider the possibility that one day, perhaps, in 
a different economy of bodies and pleasures, people will no 
longer quite understand how the ruses of sexuality, and the 
power that sustains its organization, were able to subject us 
to that austere monarchy of sex, so that we became dedicated 
to the endless task of forcing its secret, of exacting the truest 
of confessions from a shadow. 

The irony of this deployment is in having us believe that 
our “liberation” is in the balance.

A number of people contributed to this translation, at 
Berkeley and elsewhere. Out of respect for the author’s work, 
they made an occasion of community for which I am grateful. 

Peter Brown generously shared his knowledge of classical 
matters and his familiarity with the author’s project. His criti¬ 
cal comments were an invaluable service. 

Stephen W. Foster reviewed the translation with a practiced 
eye and suggested many changes of phraseology, virtually all 
of which I incorporated into the text. 

Denis Hollier answered several questions that cropped up 
when my reading did not quite match the sophistication of the 
author’s prose. 

James Faubion drew up a list of reliable English versions of 
the major Greek texts. Without his recommendations, I would 
have risked many inaccuracies. 

Marie-Claude Perigon, my wife, helped me with various 
problems of micro-interpretation, that is, with the kind of 
difficulties every reader encounters but only translators have 
to resolve. 

I am indebted most to Paul Rabinow. He offered advice and 
encouragement—moral support—at every stage. 

I wish to dedicate this English version to the memory of 
Michel Foucault.

This series of studies is being published later than I had 
anticipated, and in a form that is altogether different. I will 
explain why. 

It was intended to be neither a history of sexual behaviors 
nor a history of representations, but a history of “sexuality” 
—the quotation marks have a certain importance. My aim was 
not to write a history of sexual behaviors and practices, tracing 
their successive forms, their evolution, and their dissemina¬ 
tion; nor was it to analyze the scientific, religious, or philo¬ 
sophical ideas through which these behaviors have been 
represented. I wanted first to dwell on that quite recent and 
banal notion of “sexuality”: to stand detached from it, brack¬ 
eting its familiarity, in order to analyze the theoretical and 
practical context with which it has been associated. The term 
itself did not appear until the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, a fact that should be neither underestimated nor 
overinterpreted. It does point to something other than a sim¬ 
ple recasting of vocabulary, but obviously it does not mark the 
sudden emergence of that to which “sexuality” refers. The use 
of the word was established in connection with other 
phenomena: the development of diverse fields of knowledge 
(embracing the biological mechanisms of reproduction as well 
as the individual or social variants of behavior); the establish¬ 
ment of a set of rules and norms—in part traditional, in part 
new—which found support in religious, judicial, pedagogical,

and medical institutions; and changes in the way individuals 
were led to assign meaning and value to their conduct, their 
duties, their pleasures, their feelings and sensations, their 
dreams. In short, it was a matter of seeing how an “experi¬ 
ence” came to be constituted in modern Western societies, an 
experience that caused individuals to recognize themselves as 
subjects of a “sexuality,” which was accessible to very diverse 
fields of knowledge and linked to a system of rules and con¬ 
straints. What I planned, therefore, was a history of the expe¬ 
rience of sexuality, where experience is understood as the 
correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normativity, 
and forms of subjectivity in a particular culture. 

To speak of sexuality in this way, I had to break with a 
conception that was rather common. Sexuality was conceived 
of as a constant. The hypothesis was that where it was mani¬ 
fested in historically singular forms, this was through various 
mechanisms of repression to which it was bound to be sub¬ 
jected in every society. What this amounted to, in effect, was 
that desire and the subject of desire were withdrawn from the 
historical field, and interdiction as a general form was made 
to account for anything historical in sexuality. But rejection 
of this hypothesis was not sufficient by itself. To speak of 
“sexuality” as a historically singular experience also presup¬ 
posed the availability of tools capable of analyzing the peculiar 
characteristics and interrelations of the three axes that consti¬ 
tute it: (1) the formation of sciences (savoirs) that refer to it, 
(2) the systems of power that regulate its practice, (3) the 
forms within which individuals are able, are obliged, to recog¬ 
nize themselves as subjects of this sexuality. Now, as to the 
first two points, the work I had undertaken previously—hav¬ 
ing to do first with medicine and psychiatry, and then with 
punitive power and disciplinary practices—provided me with 
the tools I needed. The analysis of discursive practices made 
it possible to trace the formation of disciplines (savoirs) while 
escaping the dilemma of science versus ideology. And the 
analysis of power relations and their technologies made it

possible to view them as open strategies, while escaping the 
alternative of a power conceived of as domination or exposed 
as a simulacrum. 

But when I came to study the modes according to which 
individuals are given to recognize themselves as sexual sub¬ 
jects, the problems were much greater. At the time the notion 
of desire, or of the desiring subject, constituted if not a theory, 
then at least a generally accepted theoretical theme. This very 
acceptance was odd: it was this same theme, in fact, or varia¬ 
tions thereof, that was found not only at the very center of the 
traditional theory, but also in the conceptions that sought to 
detach themselves from it. It was this theme, too, that ap¬ 
peared to have been inherited, in the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries, from a long Christian tradition. While the experi¬ 
ence of sexuality, as a singular historical figure, is perhaps 
quite distinct from the Christian experience of the “flesh,” 
both appear nonetheless to be dominated by the principle of 
“desiring man.” In any case, it seemed to me that one could 
not very well analyze the formation and development of the 
experience of sexuality from the eighteenth century onward, 
without doing a historical and critical study dealing with de¬ 
sire and the desiring subject. In other words, without under¬ 
taking a “genealogy.” This does not mean that I proposed to 
write a history of the successive conceptions of desire, of 
concupiscence, or of libido, but rather to analyze the practices 
by which individuals were led to focus their attention on 
themselves, to decipher, recognize, and acknowledge them¬ 
selves as subjects of desire, bringing into play between them¬ 
selves and themselves a certain relationship that allows them 
to discover, in desire, the truth of their being, be it natural or 
fallen. In short, with this genealogy the idea was to investigate 
how individuals were led to practice, on themselves and on 
others, a hermeneutics of desire, a hermeneutics of which their 
sexual behavior was doubtless the occasion, but certainly not 
the exclusive domain. Thus, in order to understand how the 
modern individual could experience himself as a subject of a 



6 


The Use of Pleasure 


“sexuality,” it was essential first to determine how, for centu¬ 
ries, Western man had been brought to recognize himself as 
a subject of desire. 

A theoretical shift had seemed necessary in order to analyze 
what was often designated as the advancement of learning; it 
led me to examine the forms of discursive practices that ar¬ 
ticulated the human sciences. A theoretical shift had also been 
required in order to analyze what is often described as the 
manifestations of “power”; it led me to examine, rather, the 
manifold relations, the open strategies, and the rational tech¬ 
niques that articulate the exercise of powers. It appeared that 
I now had to undertake a third shift, in order to analyze what 
is termed “the subject.” It seemed appropriate to look for the 
forms and modalities of the relation to self by which the 
individual constitutes and recognizes himself qua subject. 
After first studying the games of truth (jeuxde verite) in their 
interplay with one another, as exemplified by certain empirical 
sciences in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and then 
studying their interaction with power relations, as exemplified 
by punitive practices—I felt obliged to study the games of 
truth in the relationship of self with self and the forming of 
oneself as a subject, taking as my domain of reference and field 
of investigation what might be called “the history of desiring 
man.” 

But it was clear that to undertake this genealogy would 
carry me far from my original project. I had to choose: either 
stick to the plan I had set, supplementing it with a brief 
historical survey of the theme of desire, or reorganize the 
whole study around the slow formation, in antiquity, of a 
hermeneutics of the self. I opted for the latter, reasoning that, 
after all, what I have held to, what I have tried to maintain 
for many years, is the effort to isolate some of the elements 
that might be useful for a history of truth. Not a history that 
would be concerned with what might be true in the fields of 
learning, but an analysis of the “games of truth,” the games 
of truth and error through which being is historically con-

stituted as experience; that is, as something that can and must 
be thought. What are the games of truth by which man pro¬ 
poses to think his own nature when he perceives himself to be 
mad; when he considers himself to be ill; when he conceives 
of himself as a living, speaking, laboring being; when he judges 
and punishes himself as a criminal? What were the games of 
truth by which human beings came to see themselves as desir¬ 
ing individuals? It seemed to me that by framing the question 
in this way, and by attempting to develop it for a period that 
was rather far from the horizons with which I was familiar, 
I would be going more closely into the inquiry that I have long 
been committed to—even if this approach were to demand a 
few years of additional work. This long detour carried risks, 
to be sure; but I was motivated, and I seemed to have discov¬ 
ered a certain theoretical advantage in the research that I 
envisaged. 

The risks? First, there was the likelihood of delaying and 
upsetting the publication schedule that I had projected. I am 
gratef ul to those who followed the advances and detours of my 
work—I am thinking of my auditors at the College de France 
—and to those who had the patience to wait for its outcome 
—Pierre Nora in particular. As to those for whom to work 
hard, to begin and begin again, to attempt and be mistaken, 
to go back and rework everything from top to bottom, and still 
find reason to hesitate from one step to the next—as to those, 
in short, for whom to work in the midst of uncertainty and 
apprehension is tantamount to failure, all I can say is that 
clearly we are not from the same planet. 

There was also the danger that I would be dealing with 
documents with which I was insufficiently acquainted.* I 

*1 am neither a Hellenist nor a Latinist. But it seemed to me that if I gave enough 
care, patience, modesty, and attention to the task, it would be possible to gain 
sufficient familiarity with the ancient Greek and Roman texts; that is, a familiarity 
that would allow me—in keeping with a practice that is doubtless fundamental to 
Western philosophy—to examine both the difference that keeps us at a remove from 
a way of thinking in which we recognize the origin of our own, and the proximity 
that remains in spite of that distance which we never cease to explore.

The Use of Pleasure 


would run the risk of adapting them, without fully realizing 
it, to alien forms of analysis or to modes of inquiry that would 
scarcely suit them. In dealing with this risk, I have benefited 
greatly from the works of Peter Brown and those of Pierre 
Hadot, and I have been helped more than once by the conver¬ 
sations we have had and the views they have expressed. In the 
effort to familiarize myself with the ancient texts, I also ran 
the contrary risk of losing the thread of the questions I wanted 
to raise; Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow at Berkeley 
enabled me, through their comments and their rigorous ques¬ 
tioning, to undertake a theoretical and methodological reformu¬ 
lation. Francois Wahl offered me invaluable advice. 

Paul Veyne has given me constant assistance throughout 
these years. He knows, what the true historian’s search for 
truth is about, but he also knows the labyrinth one enters 
when one sets out to trace the history of the games of truth 
and error. He is one of those individuals (rare nowadays) who 
are willing to face the hazard that the history of truth poses 
for all thought. His influence on what I have written here is 
pervasive. As for what motivated me, it is quite simple; I 
would hope that in the eyes of some people it might be suffi¬ 
cient in itself. It was curiosity—the only kind of curiosity, in 
any case, that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy: 
not the curiosity that seeks to assimilate what it is proper for 
one to know, but that which enables one to get free of oneself. 
After all, what would be the value of the passion for knowl¬ 
edge if it resulted only in a certain amount of knowledgeable¬ 
ness and not, in one way or another and to the extent possible, 
in the knower’s straying afield of himself? There are times in 
life when the question of knowing if one can think differently 
than one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is 
absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting 
at all. People will say, perhaps, that these games with oneself 
would better be left backstage; or, at best, that they might 
properly form part of those preliminary exercises that are 
forgotten once they have served their purpose. But, then, what 



Introduction

is philosophy today—philosophical activity, I mean—if it is 
not the critical work that thought brings to bear on itself? In 
what does it consist, if not in the endeavor to know how and 
to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead 
of legitimating what is already known? There is always some¬ 
thing ludicrous in philosophical discourse when it tries, from 
the outside, to dictate to others, to tell them where their truth 
is and how to find it, or when it works up a case against them 
in the language of naive positivity. But it is entitled to explore 
what might be changed, in its own thought, through the prac¬ 
tice of a knowledge that is foreign to it. The “essay”—which 
should be understood as the assay or test by which, in the 
game of truth, one undergoes changes, and not as the simplis¬ 
tic appropriation of others for the purpose of communication 
—is the living substance of philosophy, at least if we assume 
that philosophy is still what it was in times past, i.e., an 
“ascesis,” askesis, an exercise of oneself in the activity of 
thought. 

The studies that follow, like the others I have done previ¬ 
ously, are studies of “history” by reason of the domain they 
deal with and the references they appeal to; but they are not 
the work of a “historian.” Which does not mean that they 
summarize or synthesize work done by others. Considered 
from the standpoint of their “pragmatics,” they are the record 
of a long and tentative exercise that needed to be revised and 
corrected again and again. It was a philosophical exercise. The 
object was to learn to what extent the effort to think one’s own 
history can free thought from what it silently thinks, and so 
enable it to think differently. 

Was I right to take these risks? That is for others to say. I 
only know that by shifting, as I did, the theme and chronologi¬ 
cal frame of reference of my study, I obtained a certain theo¬ 
retical benefit; I could go on to make two generalizations that 
enabled me both to widen its scope and to specify its method 
and its goal more precisely. 

It seemed that by starting from the modern era, and pro- 



10 


The Use of Pleasure 


ceeding back through Christianity to antiquity, one would not 
be able to avoid raising a question that was at the same time 
very simple and very general: why is sexual conduct, why are 
the activities and pleasures that attach to it, an object of moral 
solicitude? Why this ethical concern—which, at certain times, 
in certain societies and groups, appears more important than 
the moral attention that is focused on other, likewise essential, 
areas of individual or collective life, such as alimentary behav¬ 
iors or the fulfillment of civic duties? A reply comes to mind 
immediately, I know: they have been the object of fundamen¬ 
tal interdictions, and transgressing the latter is considered a 
serious offense. But this is to make an answer of the question 
itself; and further, it shows a failure to recognize that the 
ethical concern over sexual conduct is not, in its intensity or 
its forms, always directly tied to the system of interdictions. 
It is often the case that the moral solicitude is strong precisely 
where there is neither obligation nor prohibition. In other 
words, the interdiction is one thing, the moral problematiza- 
tion is another. It seemed to me, therefore, that the question 
that ought to guide my inquiry was the following: how, why, 
and in what forms was sexuality constituted as a moral do¬ 
main? Why this ethical concern that was so persistent despite 
its varying forms and intensity? Why this “problematization”? 
But, after all, this was the proper task of a history of thought, 
as against a history of behaviors or representations: to define 
the conditions in which human beings “problematize” what 
they are, what they do, and the world in which they live. 

But in raising this very general question, and in directing it 
to Greek and Greco-Roman culture, it occurred to me that 
this problematization was linked to a group of practices that 
have been of unquestionable importance in our societies: I am 
referring to what might be called the “arts of existence.” What 
I mean by the phrase are those intentional and voluntary 
actions by which men not only set themselves rules of conduct, 
but also seek to transform themselves, to change themselves 
in their singular being, and to make their life into an oeuvre

that carries certain aesthetic values and meets certain stylistic 
criteria. These “arts of existence,” these “techniques of the 
self,” no doubt lost some of their importance and autonomy 
when they were assimilated into the exercise of priestly power 
in early Christianity, and later, into educative, medical, and 
psychological types of practices. Still, I thought that the long 
history of these aesthetics of existence and these technologies 
of the self remained to be done, or resumed. It has been a long 
time now since Burckhardt pointed out their significance for 
the epoch of the Renaissance, but their perpetuation, their 
history, and their development do not end there.* In any case, 
it seemed to me that the study of the problematization of 
sexual behavior in antiquity could be regarded as a chapter— 
one of the first chapters—of that general history of the “tech¬ 
niques of the self.” 

There is irony in those efforts one makes to alter one’s way 
of looking at things, to change the boundaries of what one 
knows and to venture out a ways from there. Did mine actu¬ 
ally result in a different way of thinking? Perhaps at most they 
made it possible to go back through what I was already think¬ 
ing, to think it differently, and to see what I had done from 
a new vantage point and in a clearer light. Sure of having 
traveled far, one finds that one is looking down on oneself 
from above. The journey rejuvenates things, and ages the 
relationship with oneself. I seem to have gained a better per¬ 
spective on the way I worked—gropingly, and by means of 
different or successive fragments—on this project, whose goal 
is a history of truth. It was a matter of analyzing, not behav¬ 
iors or ideas, nor societies and their “ideologies,” but the 
problematizations through which being offers itself to be, nec¬ 
essarily, thought—and the practices on the basis of which 
these problematizations are formed. The archaeological di- 

*It is not quite correct to imply that since Burckhardt the study of these arts and this 
aesthetics of existence has been completely neglected. One thinks of Benjamin’s study 
on Baudelaire. There is also an interesting analysis in Stephen Greenblatt’s recent 
book, Renaissance Self-Fashioning (1980).

mension of the analysis made it possible to examine the forms 
themselves; its genealogical dimension enabled me to analyze 
their formation out of the practices and the modifications 
undergone by the latter. There was the problematization of 
madness and illness arising out of social and medical practices, 
and defining a certain pattern of “normalization”; a prob¬ 
lematization of life, language, and labor in discursive practices 
that conformed to certain “epistemic” rules; and a problemati¬ 
zation of crime and criminal behavior emerging from certain 
punitive practices conforming to a “disciplinary” model. And 
now I would like to show how, in classical antiquity, sexual 
activity and sexual pleasures were problematized through 
practices of the self, bringing into play the criteria of an “aes¬ 
thetics of existence.” 

These, then, are the reasons that led me to recenter my 
entire study on the genealogy of desiring man, from classical 
antiquity through the first centuries of Christianity. I have 
followed a simple chronological arrangement: this volume, 
The Use of Pleasure, is devoted to the manner in which sexual 
activity was problematized by philosophers and doctors in 
classical Greek culture of the fourth century B.C.; Care of the 
Self deals with the same problematization in the Greek and 
Latin texts of the first two centuries of our era; lastly, The 
Confessions of the Flesh deals with the formation of the doc¬ 
trine and ministry concerning the flesh. The documents I will 
refer to are for the most part “prescriptive” texts—that is, 
texts whose main object, whatever their form (speech, dia¬ 
logue, treatise, collection of precepts, etc.) is to suggest rules 
of conduct. I will appeal to the theoretical texts on the doc¬ 
trine of pleasures and passions only to look for clarifications. 
The domain I will be analyzing is made up of texts written for 
the purpose of offering rules, opinions, and advice on how to 
behave as one should: “practical” texts, which are themselves 
objects of a “practice” in that they were designed to be read, 
learned, reflected upon, and tested out, and they were in¬ 
tended to constitute the eventual framework of everyday con-

duct. These texts thus served as functional devices that would 
enable individuals to question their own conduct, to watch 
over and give shape to it, and to shape themselves as ethical 
subjects; in short, their function was “etho-poetic,” to trans¬ 
pose a word found in Plutarch. 

But since this analysis of desiring man is situated at the 
point where an archaelogy of problematizations and a 
genealogy of practices of the self intersect, I would like to 
dwell briefly, before getting started, on those two notions— 
that is, to account for the forms of “problematization” that I 
chose to examine, to indicate what is to be understood by 
“practices of the self,” and to explain how I was led, through 
certain paradoxes and difficulties, to substitute a history of 
ethical problematizations based on practices of the self, for a 
history of systems of morality based, hypothetically, on inter¬ 
dictions.

Forms of 
Problematization 


Suppose for a moment that we accept categories as general 
as those of “paganism,” “Christianity,” “morality,” and “sex¬ 
ual morality.” Suppose that we ask on which points the “sex¬ 
ual morality of Christianity” contrasted most sharply with the 
“sexual morality of ancient paganism.” Prohibition of incest, 
male domination, subjugation of women? These are not the 
replies that will be given, no doubt; the extent and constancy 
of those phenomena in their various forms are well known. 
Other points of differentiation will more likely be submitted. 
For example, the meaning of the sexual act itself: it will be said 
that Christianity associated it with evil, sin, the Fall, and 
death, whereas antiquity invested it with positive symbolic 
values. Or the definition of the legitimate partner: it would 
appear that, in contrast to what occurred in the Greek and 
Roman societies, Christianity drew the line at monogamous 
marriage and laid down the principle of exclusively procrea¬ 
tive ends within that conjugal relationship. Or the disallow¬ 
ance of relations between individuals of the same sex: it would 
seem that Christianity strictly excluded such relationships, 
while Greece exalted them and Rome accepted them, at least 
between men. To these three points of major opposition might 
be added the high moral and spiritual value that Christianity, 
unlike pagan morality, accorded to strict abstinence, lifelong 
chastity, and virginity. In short, regarding all these points that 
have been considered for such a long time to be so important

—the nature of the sexual act, monogamous fidelity, homosex¬ 
ual relations, chastity—it would seem that men of ancient 
times were rather indifferent, and that none of this claimed 
much of their attention or constituted very serious problems 
as far as they were concerned. 

But this picture is not accurate; moreover, it would be easy 
to show that it is not. One would only have to point out the 
direct borrowing and strict continuities between the first 
Christian doctrines and the moral philosophy of antiquity. 
The first great Christian text devoted to sexual practice in 
married life—Chapter X of Book II of The Pedagogue by 
Clement of Alexandria—is supported by a number of scrip¬ 
tural references, but it also draws on a set of principles and 
precepts borrowed directly from pagan philosophy. One al¬ 
ready notes a certain association of sexual activity with evil, 
along with the rule of procreative monogamy, a condemnation 
of relations between individuals of the same sex, and a glorifi¬ 
cation of self-restraint. Furthermore, given a longer historical 
frame to consider, one could trace the persistence of themes, 
anxieties, and exigencies that no doubt marked the Christian 
ethic and the morality of modern European societies; but not 
only, since they were already present at the core of Greek and 
Greco-Roman thought. Below is some evidence to consider, 
comprising: (1) the expression of a fear, (2) a model of con¬ 
duct, (3) the image of a stigmatized attitude, and (4) an exam¬ 
ple of abstinence. 

1. A fear. Young people afflicted with seminal weakness 
“of necessity become old in the habit of their body, dull, 
languid, dispirited, sluggish, stupidly silent, weak, wrinkled, 
incapable of any exertion, sallow, wan, effeminate; they lose 
their appetite, feel cold, a sense of weight in their limbs, and 
torpor in their legs, their strength fails, and they become 
paralyzed in every effort, and with many the disease goes on 
to palsy. For how could it be otherwise, that the power of the 
nerves should suffer when the generative principle is chilled?” 



16 


The Use of Pleasure 


This disease, which is “shameful in itself,” is “dangerous in 
that it leads to stagnation; harmful to society in that it goes 
against the propagation of the species; and because it is in all 
respects the source of countless ills, it requires prompt treat¬ 
ment.” 1 * One has no trouble recognizing in this text the obses¬ 
sive worries that medicine and pedagogy nurtured on the 
subject of pure sexual expenditure—that unproductive and 
partnerless activity—from the eighteenth century onward. 
The gradual exhaustion of the organism, the death of the 
individual, the destruction of his offspring, and finally, harm 
to the entire human race, were regularly promised, through an 
endlessly garrulous literature, to those who would make illicit 
use of their sex. These solicited fears seem to have been the 
“naturalistic” and scientific legacy, in medical thought of the 
nineteenth century, of a Christian tradition that consigned 
pleasure to the realm of death and evil. 

Now, this description is actually a translation—a free trans¬ 
lation, in the style of the period—of a text written by a Greek 
physician, Aretaeus, in the first century of our era. And one 
could find many other statements from the same epoch, testi¬ 
fying to this fear of the sexual act, which was liable, if it got 
out of control, to produce the most deleterious effects on the 
life of the individual. Soranus, for example, thought that sex¬ 
ual activity was in any case less favorable to health than 
virginity and plain abstinence. Even prior to that, medicine 
had earnestly recommended prudence and economy in the use 
of sexual pleasures: avoid their untimely enjoyment, take into 
account the conditions in which they are to be experienced, 
fear their peculiar violence and the effects of errors of regimen. 

*In his French translation, L. Renaud offers this comment on the passage from 
Aretaeus: “The gonorrhea in question differs essentially from the disease that goes 
by that name today, which is more correctly called blennorrhea. . . . Simple or true 
gonorrhea, of which Aretaeus is speaking here, is characterized by an involuntary 
discharge, outside coition, of the spermatic humor mixed with the prostatic humor. 
This shameful disease is often provoked by, and the result of, masturbation." 2 The 
French translation slightly alters the meaning of the Greek text, which can be found 
in the Corpus Medicorum Graecorum.

Some even advised to indulge only “if one wants to do harm 
to oneself.” A very ancient fear, therefore. 

2. An ideal of conduct. We know how Saint Francis of 
Sales exhorted people to conjugal virtue. He held out a mirror 
to married couples, recommending the example of the ele¬ 
phant and the good morals it manifested with its mate. It was 
“only a large beast, but the most worthy of all the animals on 
earth, and the one with the most intelligence. ... It never 
changes females and it is tenderly loving with the one it has 
chosen, mating only every three years, and then only for five 
days, and so secretly that it is never seen in the act; but it can 
be seen again on the sixth day, when the first thing it does is 
go straight to the river and bathe its whole body, being unwill¬ 
ing to return to the herd before it is purified. Tell me if these 
are not good and honorable habits.” 3 Now this text is itself a 
variation on a theme that had been handed down by a long 
tradition (via Aldrovandi, Gesner, Vincent of Beauvais, and 
the famous Physiologus)\ one finds it already formulated in 
Pliny, whom Saint Francis of Sales follows rather closely in 
the Introduction to the Devout Life: “Owing to their modesty, 
elephants never mate except in secret... the female at the age 
of ten; and mating takes place for two years, on five days, so 
it is said, of each year and not more; and on the sixth day they 
give themselves a shower-bath in the river, not returning to the 
herd before. Adultery is unknown among them.” 4 Of course, 
Pliny was not proposing a schema as explicitly didactic as that 
of Saint Francis of Sales; he was, however, referring to a 
clearly recommended model of conduct. It is not the case that 
mutual faithfulness among marriage partners was a generally 
acknowledged and accepted imperative among the Greeks and 
Romans. But it was a lesson given emphasis in some philo¬ 
sophical currents such as late Stoicism; it was also a conduct 
that was valued as a manifestation of virtue, inner strength, 
and self-mastery. Thus, the younger Cato was praised because, 



18 


The Use of Pleasure 


up to the age at which he decided to marry, he still had not 
had relations with any woman; or better yet, there was 
Laelius: “in the course of his long life, he knew but one 
woman, the wife of his youth.” 5 One can go back even further 
in the definition of this model of mutual conjugal fidelity. 
Nicocles, in the speech attributed to him by Isocrates, shows 
the moral and political importance he accorded to the achieve¬ 
ment of not “having approached any woman but my own 
wife” from the time of his marriage. 6 And in his ideal city, 
Aristotle would have sexual relations of a husband with an¬ 
other woman, or the wife with another man, considered “dis¬ 
honorable ... in any circumstances whatsoever.” 7 The sexual 
“fidelity” of a husband with respect to his legitimate wife was 
not required either by law or by custom; it was nevertheless 
a question that people raised and a form of austerity on which 
some moralists set a high value. 

3. An image. In nineteenth-century texts there is a 
stereotypical portrait of the homosexual or invert: not only his 
mannerisms, his bearing, the way he gets dolled up, his co¬ 
quetry, but also his facial expressions, his anatomy, the femi¬ 
nine morphology of his whole body, are regularly included in 
this disparaging description. The image alludes both to the 
theme of role reversal and to the principle of a natural stigma 
attached to this offense against nature. It was as if “nature 
herself had become an accessory to sexual mendacity.” 8 One 
could doubtless trace the long history of this image (to which 
actual behaviors may have corresponded, through a complex 
play of inductions and attitudes of defiance). In the deeply 
negative intensity of this stereotype, one might read the age- 
old difficulty, for our societies, of integrating these two 
phenomena—different phenomena at that—of the inversion of 
sexual roles and intercourse between individuals of the same 
sex. Now this image, with the repulsive aura that surrounds 
it, has come down through the centuries. It was already 
clearly delineated in the Greco-Roman literature of the impe-

rial age. One encounters it in the portrait of the Effeminatus 
drawn by the author of an anonymous treatise on physiog¬ 
nomy of the fourth century; in the description of the priests 
of Atargatis, whom Apuleius makes fun of in The Golden /Ixs; 
in the symbolization that Dio Chrysostom offers for the 
daimon of immoderation in one of his lectures on monarchy; 
in the fleeting evocation of the petty orators, with their per¬ 
fume and their curls, whom Epictetus calls on at the back of 
his class, asking them if they are men or women. 9 One could 
see it again in the portrait of decadent youth, such as Seneca 
the Elder notices around him, with great repugnance: “Libidi¬ 
nous delight in song and dance transfixes these effeminates. 
Braiding the hair, refining the voice till it is as caressing as a 
woman’s, competing in bodily softness with women, beautify¬ 
ing themselves with filthy fineries—this is the pattern our 
youths set themselves.... Born feeble and spineless, they stay 
like that throughout their lives; taking others’ chastity by 
storm, careless of their own.” 10 But in its essential traits, the 
portrait is more ancient still. Socrates’ first speech in the Phae- 
drus alludes to it, when he voices disapproval of the love that 
is given to soft boys, too delicate to be exposed to the sun as 
they are growing up, and all made up with rouge and decked 
out in ornaments." And it is with these same traits that Aga- 
thon appears in The Thesmophoriazusae: pale complexion, 
smooth-shaven cheeks, woman’s voice, so much so that his 
interlocutor wonders if he is in the presence of a man or a 
woman. 12 It would be completely incorrect to interpret this as 
a condemnation of love of boys, or of what we generally refer 
to as homosexual relations; but at the same time, one cannot 
fail to see in it the effect of strongly negative judgments con¬ 
cerning some possible aspects of relations between men, as 
well as a definite aversion to anything that might denote a 
deliberate renunciation of the signs and privileges of the mas¬ 
culine role. The domain of male loves may have been “free” 
in Greek antiquity, much more so at any rate than it has been 
in modem European societies; the fact remains that one sees 



20 


The Use of Pleasure 


the very early expression of intense negative reactions and of 
forms of stigmatization that will extend well into the future. 

4. A model of abstention. The virtuous hero who is able to 
turn aside from pleasure, as if from a temptation into which 
he knows not to fall, is a familiar figure in Christianity—as 
common as the idea that this renunciation can give access to 
a spiritual experience of truth and love that sexual activity 
excludes. But equally well known in pagan antiquity was the 
figure of those athletes of self-restraint who were sufficiently 
masters of themselves and their cravings to be able to re¬ 
nounce sexual pleasure. Long before a thaumaturge like Apol¬ 
lonius of Tyana, who vowed chastity once and for all, and then 
had no more sexual relations for the rest of his life, 13 Greece 
had known and honored similar models. In some people, such 
extreme virtue was the visible mark of the mastery they 
brought to bear on themselves and hence of the power they 
were worthy of exercising over others. Thus Xenophon’s 
Agesilaus not only “kept at arm’s length those whose intimacy 
he did not desire,” but kept from embracing even the boy he 
did love; and he was careful to lodge only in temples or in a 
place where “all men’s eyes became witnesses to his recti¬ 
tude.” 14 But, for others, this abstention was linked directly to 
a form of wisdom that brought them into direct contact with 
some superior element in human nature and gave them access 
to the very essence of truth. The Socrates of the Symposium 
was like this, the one everybody wanted to be near, everybody 
was enamored of; the one whose wisdom everybody sought to 
appropriate—a wisdom that manifested and proved itself pre¬ 
cisely in the fact that he was himself able to keep from laying 
hands on the provocative beauty of Alcibiades. 15 The themat- 
ics of a relationship between sexual abstinence and access to 
truth was already quite prominent. 

We must not ask too much of these few references, however. 
It would be a mistake to infer that the sexual morality of 



Introduction 


21 


Christianity and that of paganism form a continuity. Several 
themes, principles, or notions may be found in the one and the 
other alike, true; but for all that, they do not have the same 
place or the same value within them. Socrates is not a desert 
Father struggling against temptation, and Nicocles is not a 
Christian husband; Aristophanes’ laughter at the expense of 
Agathon in drag has few traits in common with the disparage¬ 
ment of the invert that will be found much later in medical 
discourse. Moreover, one must also not lose sight of the fact 
that the Church and the pastoral ministry stressed the princi¬ 
ple of a morality whose precepts were compulsory and whose 
scope was universal (which did not rule out differences of 
prescription relating to the status of individuals, or the exis¬ 
tence of ascetic movements having their own aspirations). In 
classical thought, on the other hand, the demands of austerity 
were not organized into a unified, coherent, authoritarian 
moral system that was imposed on everyone in the same man¬ 
ner; they were more in the nature of a supplement, a “luxury” 
in relation to the commonly accepted morality. Further, they 
appeared in “scattered centers” whose origins were in differ¬ 
ent philosophical or religious movements. They developed in 
the midst of many separate groups. They proposed—more 
than they imposed—different styles of moderation or strict¬ 
ness, each having its specific character or “shape.” Py¬ 
thagorean austerity was not the same as that of the Stoics, 
which was very different in turn from that recommended by 
Epicurus. From the few similarities I have managed to point 
out, it should not be concluded that the Christian morality of 
sex was somehow “pre-formed” in ancient thought; one ought 
to imagine instead that very early in the moral thought of 
antiquity, a thematic complex—a “quadri-thematics” of sex¬ 
ual austerity—formed around and apropos of the life of the 
body, the institution of marriage, relations between men, and 
the existence of wisdom. And, crossing through institutions, 
sets of precepts, extremely diverse theoretical references, and 
in spite of many alterations, this thematics maintained a cer- 



22 


The Use of Pleasure 


tain constancy as time went by: as if, starting in antiquity, 
there were four points of problematization on the basis of 
which—and according to schemas that were often very differ¬ 
ent—the concern with sexual austerity was endlessly refor¬ 
mulated. 

Now, it should be noted that these themes of austerity did 
not coincide with the lines of demarcation that may have been 
traced by the great social, civil, and religious interdictions. 
One might think that, generally speaking, where prohibitions 
are most fundamental, and where obligations are most coer¬ 
cive, moral systems develop the most insistent demands for 
austerity. Such a situation may arise, and the history of Chris¬ 
tianity or of modern Europe would doubtless afford examples 
of this.* But it seems in fact that this was not the case in 
antiquity. This appears very clearly in the dissymmetry that 
was a peculiar feature of all the moral reflection on sexual 
behavior of that age: women were generally subjected (except¬ 
ing the liberty they could be granted by a status like that of 
courtesan) to extremely strict constraints, and yet this ethics 
was not addressed to women; it was not their duties, or obliga¬ 
tions, that were recalled, justified, or spelled out. It was an 
ethics for men: an ethics thought, written, and taught by men, 
and addressed to men—to free men, obviously. A male ethics, 
consequently, in which women figured only as objects or, at 
most, as partners that one had best train, educate, and watch 
over when one had them under one’s power, but stay away 
from when they were under the power of someone else (father, 
husband, tutor). This is doubtless one of the most remarkable 
aspects of that moral reflection: it did not try to define a 
field of conduct and a domain of valid rules—subject to the 
necessary modulations—for the two sexes in common; it was 
an elaboration of masculine conduct carried out from the 

•The development of an ethics of marital relations, or more specifically, of reflections 
on the sexual behavior of husband and wife in the conjugal relationship (ideas that 
assumed such importance in the Christian pastoral ministry), can be seen as a conse¬ 
quence of the setting up of the Christian model of marriage—a slow, belated, and 
difficult occurrence, at that—in the course of the Middle Ages. 16

viewpoint of men in order to give form to their behavior. 

Better still: it did not speak to men concerning behaviors 
presumably owing to a few interdictions that were universally 
recognized and solemnly recalled in codes, customs, and reli¬ 
gious prescriptions. It spoke to them concerning precisely 
those conducts in which they were called upon to exercise 
their rights, their power, their authority, and their liberty: in 
the practice of pleasures that were not frowned upon, in a 
marital life where no rule or custom prevented the husband 
from having extramarital sexual relations, in relationships 
with boys, which—at least within certain limits—were ac¬ 
cepted, commonly maintained, and even prized. These themes 
of sexual austerity should be understood, not as an expression 
of, or commentary on, deep and essential prohibitions, but as 
the elaboration and stylization of an activity in the exercise of 
its power and the practice of its liberty. 

Which does not mean that this thematics of sexual austerity 
represents nothing more than an inconsequential refinement 
and a speculation unconnected with any specific concern. On 
the contrary, it is easy to see that each of these great figures 
of sexual austerity is tied to an axis of experience and to a 
cluster of concrete relationships: relations to the body, with 
the question of health, and behind it the whole game of life and 
death; the relation to the other sex, with the question of the 
spouse as privileged partner, in the game of the family institu¬ 
tion and the ties it creates; the relation to one’s own sex, with 
the question of partners that one can choose within it, and the 
problem of the adjustment between social roles and sexual 
roles; and finally, the relation to truth, where the question is 
raised of the spiritual conditions that enable one to gain access 
to wisdom. 

It thus seemed to me that a whole recentering was called 
for. Instead of looking for basic interdictions that were hidden 
or manifested in the demands of sexual austerity, it was neces¬ 
sary to locate the areas of experience and the forms in which 
sexual behavior was problematized, becoming an object of 



24 


The Use of Pleasure 


concern, an element for reflection, and a material for styliza¬ 
tion. More specifically, it was logical to ask why the four great 
domains of relations in which it seemed that a free man in 
classical societies was able to develop and display his activity 
without encountering any major prohibition, were precisely 
the locuses of an intense problematization of sexual practice. 
Why was it in those areas—apropos of the body, of the wife, 
of boys, and of truth—that the practice of pleasures became 
a matter for debate? Why did the bringing of sexual activity 
into these relations occasion anxiety, discussion, and reflec¬ 
tion? Why did these axes of everyday experience give rise to 
a way of thinking that sought to rarefy sexual behavior, to 
moderate and condition it, and to define an austere style in the 
practice of pleasures? How did sexual behavior, insofar as it 
implied these different types of relations, come to be conceived 
as a domain of moral experience?

Morality and Practice 
of the Self 


In order to answer this question, some methodological con¬ 
siderations need to be brought in; more specifically, it is best 
to reflect on the object one has in view when one undertakes 
to study the forms and transformations of a “morality.” 

Everyone is aware of the word’s ambiguity. By “morality,” 
one means a set of values and rules of action that are recom¬ 
mended to individuals through the intermediary of various 
prescriptive agencies such as the family (in one of its roles), 
educational institutions, churches, and so forth. It is some¬ 
times the case that these rules and values are plainly set forth 
in a coherent doctrine and an explicit teaching. But it also 
happens that they are transmitted in a diffuse manner, so that, 
far from constituting a systematic ensemble, they form a com¬ 
plex interplay of elements that counterbalance and correct one 
another, and cancel each other out on certain points, thus 
providing for compromises or loopholes. With these qualifica¬ 
tions taken into account, we can call this prescriptive ensem¬ 
ble a “moral code.” But “morality” also refers to the real 
behavior of individuals in relation to the rules and values that 
are recommended to them: the word thus designates the man¬ 
ner in which they comply more or less fully with a standard 
of conduct, the manner in which they obey or resist an inter¬ 
diction or a prescription; the manner in which they respect or 
disregard a set of values. In studying this aspect of morality, 
one must determine how and with what margins of variation 

25 



26 


The Use of Pleasure 


or transgression individuals or groups conduct themselves in 
reference to a prescriptive system that is explicitly or implic¬ 
itly operative in their culture, and of which they are more or 
less aware. We can call this level of phenomena “the morality 
of behaviors.” 

There is more. For a rule of conduct is one thing; the 
conduct that may be measured by this rule is another. But 
another thing still is the manner in which one ought to “con¬ 
duct oneself’—that is, the manner in which one ought to form 
oneself as an ethical subject acting in reference to the prescrip¬ 
tive elements that make up the code. Given a code of actions, 
and with regard to a specific type of actions (which can be 
defined by their degree of conformity with or divergence from 
the code), there are different ways to “conduct oneself’ mor¬ 
ally, different ways for the acting individual to operate, not 
just as an agent, but as an ethical subject of this action. Take, 
for example, a code of sexual prescriptions enjoining the two 
marital partners to practice a strict and symmetrical conjugal 
fidelity, always with a view to procreation; there will be many 
ways, even within such a rigid frame, to practice that auster¬ 
ity, many ways to “be faithful.” These differences can bear on 
several points worth considering. 

They concern what might be called the determination of the 
ethical substance; that is, the way in which the individual has 
to constitute this or that part of himself as the prime material 
of his moral conduct. Thus, one can relate the crucial aspects 
of the practice of fidelity to the strict observance of interdic¬ 
tions and obligations in the very acts one accomplishes. But 
one can also make the essence of fidelity consist in the mastery 
of desires, in the fervent combat one directs against them, in 
the strength with which one is able to resist temptations: what 
makes up the content of fidelity in this case is that vigilance 
and that struggle. In these conditions, the contradictory 
movements of the soul—much more than the carrying out of 
the acts themselves—will be the prime material of moral prac¬ 
tice. Alternatively, one can have it consist in the intensity, 



Introduction 


27 


continuity, and reciprocity of feelings that are experienced 
vis-a-vis the partner, and in the quality of the relationship that 
permanently binds the two spouses. 

The differences can also have to do with the mode of subjec¬ 
tion (mode d'assujettissement); that is, with the way in which 
the individual establishes his relation to the rule and recog¬ 
nizes himself as obliged to put it into practice. One can, for 
example, practice conjugal fidelity and comply with the pre¬ 
cept that imposes it, because one acknowledges oneself to be 
a member of the group that accepts it, declares adherence to 
it out loud, and silently preserves it as a custom. But one can 
practice it, too, because one regards oneself as an heir to a 
spiritual tradition that one has the responsibility of maintain¬ 
ing or reviving; one can also practice fidelity in response to an 
appeal, by offering oneself as an example, or by seeking to give 
one’s personal life a form that answers to criteria of brilliance, 
beauty, nobility, or perfection. 

There are also possible differences in the forms of elabora¬ 
tion, of ethical work (travail ethique) that one performs on 
oneself, not only in order to bring one’s conduct into compli¬ 
ance with a given rule, but to attempt to transform oneself into 
the ethical subject of one’s behavior. Thus, sexual austerity 
can be practiced through a long effort of learning, memoriza¬ 
tion, and assimilation of a systematic ensemble of precepts, 
and through a regular checking of conduct aimed at measur¬ 
ing the exactness with which one is applying these rules. It can 
be practiced in the form of a sudden, all-embracing, and defini¬ 
tive renunciation of pleasures; it can also be practiced in the 
form of a relentless combat whose vicissitudes—including mo¬ 
mentary setbacks—can have meaning and value in them¬ 
selves; and it can be practiced through a decipherment as 
painstaking, continuous, and detailed as possible, of the move¬ 
ments of desire in all its hidden forms, including the most 
obscure. 

Other differences, finally, concern what might be called the 
telos of the ethical subject: an action is not only moral in itself, 



28

in its singularity; it is also moral in its circumstantial integra¬ 
tion and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of 
conduct. It is an element and an aspect of this conduct, and 
it marks a stage in its life, a possible advance in its continuity. 
A moral action tends toward its own accomplishment; but it 
also aims beyond the latter, to the establishing of a moral 
conduct that commits an individual, not only to other actions 
always in conformity with values and rules, but to a certain 
mode of being, a mode of being characteristic of the ethical 
subject. Many differences are possible here as well: conjugal 
fidelity can be associated with a moral conduct that aspires to 
an ever more complete mastery of the self; it can be a moral 
conduct that manifests a sudden and radical detachment vis-a- 
vis the world; it may strain toward a perfect tranquillity of 
soul, a total insensitivity to the agitations of the passions, or 
toward a purification that will ensure salvation after death and 
blissful immortality. 

In short, for an action to be “moral,” it must not be reduci¬ 
ble to an act or a series of acts conforming to a rule, a law, 
or a value. Of course all moral action involves a relationship 
with the reality in which it is carried out, and a relationship 
with the self. The latter is not simply “self-awareness” but 
self-formation as an “ethical subject,” a process in which the 
individual delimits that part of himself that will form the 
object of his moral practice, defines his position relative to the 
precept he will follow, and decides on a certain mode of being 
that will serve as his moral goal. And this requires him to act 
upon himself, to monitor, test, improve, and transform him¬ 
self. There is no specific moral action that does not refer to a 
unified moral conduct; no moral conduct that does not call for 
the forming of oneself as an ethical subject; and no forming 
of the ethical subject without “modes of subjectivation” and 
an “ascetics” or “practices of the self’ that support them. 
Moral action is indissociable from these forms of self-activity, 
and they do not differ any less from one morality to another 
than do the systems of values, rules, and interdictions.

These distinctions are bound to have effects that are not 
confined to theory. They also have consequences for historical 
analysis. Anyone who wishes to study the history of a “moral¬ 
ity” has to take into account the different realities that are 
covered by the term. A history of “moral behaviors” would 
study the extent to which actions of certain individuals or 
groups are consistent with the rules and values that are pre¬ 
scribed for them by various agencies. A history of “codes” 
would analyze the different systems of rules and values that 
are operative in a given society or group, the agencies or 
mechanisms of constraint that enforce them, the forms they 
take in their multifariousness, their divergences and their con¬ 
tradictions. And finally, a history of the way in which in¬ 
dividuals are urged to constitute themselves as subjects of 
moral conduct would be concerned with the models proposed 
for setting up and developing relationships with the self, for 
self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-examination, for the deci¬ 
pherment of the self by oneself, for the transformations that 
one seeks to accomplish with oneself as object. This last is 
what might be called a history of “ethics” and “ascetics,” 
understood as a history of the forms of moral subjectivation 
and of the practices of self that are meant to ensure it. 

If it is true, in fact, that every morality, in the broad sense, 
comprises the two elements I have just mentioned: codes of 
behavior and forms of subjectivation; if it is true that they can 
never be entirely dissociated, though they may develop in 
relative independence from one another—then we should not 
be surprised to find that in certain moralities the main empha¬ 
sis is placed on the code, on its systematicity, its richness, its 
capacity to adjust to every possible case and to embrace every 
area of behavior. With moralities of this type, the important 
thing is to focus on the instances of authority that enforce the 
code, that require it to be learned and observed, that penalize 
infractions; in these conditions, the subjectivation occurs basi¬ 
cally in a quasi-juridical form, where the ethical subject refers 
his conduct to a law, or set of laws, to which he must submit 



30 


The Use of Pleasure 


at the risk of committing offenses that may make him liable 
to punishment. It would be quite incorrect to reduce Christian 
morality—one probably should say “Christian moralities”— 
to such a model; and yet it may not be wrong to think that 
the organization of the penitential system at the beginning of 
the thirteenth century, and its development up to the eve of 
the Reformation, brought about a very strong “juridification” 
—more precisely, a very strong “codification”—of the moral 
experience. It was against this codification that many spiritual 
movements reacted before the Reformation. 

On the other hand, it is easy to conceive of moralities in 
which the strong and dynamic element is to be sought in the 
forms of subjectivation and the practices of the self. In this 
case, the system of codes and rules of behavior may be rather 
rudimentary. Their exact observance may be relatively unim¬ 
portant, at least compared with what is required of the indi¬ 
vidual in the relationship he has with himself, in his different 
actions, thoughts, and feelings as he endeavors to form himself 
as an ethical subject. Here the emphasis is on the forms of 
^relations with the self, on the methods and techniques by 
which he works them out, on the exercises by which he makes 
of himself an object to be known, and on the practices that 
enable him to transform his own mode of being. These “ethics- 
oriented” moralities (which do not necessarily correspond to 
those involving “ascetic denial”) have been very important in 
Christianity, functioning alongside the “code-oriented” 
moralities. Between the two types there have been, at differ¬ 
ent times, juxtapositions, rivalries and conflicts, and com¬ 
promises. 

Now, it seems clear, from a first approach at least, that 
moral conceptions in Greek and Greco-Roman antiquity were 
much more oriented toward practices of the self and the ques¬ 
tion of askesis than toward codifications of conducts and the 
strict definition of what is permitted and what is forbidden. If 
exception is made of the Republic and the Laws, one finds very 
few references to the principle of a code that would define in

detail the right conduct t o maintain, few references to the need 
for an authority charged with seeing to its application, few 
references to the possibility of punishments that would sanc¬ 
tion infractions. Although the necessity of respecting the law 
and the customs—the nomoi —was very often underscored, 
more important than the content of the law and its conditions 
of application was the attitude that caused one to respect 
them. The accent was placed on the relationship with the self 
that enabled a person to keep from being carried away by the 
appetites and pleasures, to maintain a mastery and superiority 
over them, to keep his senses in a state of tranquillity, to 
remain free from interior bondage to the passions, and to 
achieve a mode of being that could be defined by the full 
enjoyment of oneself, or the perfect supremacy of oneself over 
oneself. 

This explains the choice of method I have kept to through¬ 
out this study on the sexual morality of pagan and Christian 
antiquity; that is, I had to keep in mind the distinction be¬ 
tween the code elements of a morality and the elements of 
ascesis, neglecting neither their coexistence, their interrela¬ 
tions, their relative autonomy, nor their possible differences of 
emphasis. I had to take into account everything, in these 
moralities, that seemed to have to do with the privileged status 
of the practices of the self and the interest that may have been 
accorded them; with the effort that was made to develop them, 
perfect them, and teach them; and with the debate that went 
on concerning them. Consequently, the question that is so 
often raised regarding the continuity (or break) between the 
philosophical moralities of antiquity and Christian morality 
had to be reformulated; instead of asking what were the code 
elements that Christianity may have borrowed from ancient 
thought, and what were those that it added in its own right, 
in order to define what was permitted and what forbidden 
within a sexuality assumed to be constant, it seemed more 
pertinent to ask how, given the continuity, transfer, or modifi¬ 
cation of codes, the forms of self-relationship (and the prac- 



32 


The Use of Pleasure 


tices of the self that were associated with them) were defined, 
modified, recast, and diversified. 

I am not supposing that the codes are unimportant. But one 
notices that they ultimately revolve around a rather small 
number of rather simple principles: perhaps men are not much 
more inventive when it comes to interdictions than they are 
when it comes to pleasures. Their stability is also rather re¬ 
markable; the notable proliferation of codifications (concern¬ 
ing permitted or forbidden places, partners, and acts) 
occurred rather late in Christianity. On the other hand, it 
appears—at any rate this is the hypothesis I would like to 
explore here—that there is a whole rich and complex field of 
historicity in the way the individual is summoned to recognize 
himself as an ethical subject of sexual conduct. This will be a 
matter of seeing how that subjectivation was defined and 
transformed, from classical Greek thought up to the formula¬ 
tion of the Christian doctrine and pastoral ministry regarding 
the flesh. 

In this volume, I would like to take note of some general 
traits that characterized the way in which sexual behavior was 
considered by classical Greek thought as a domain of moral 
valuation and choice. I will start from the then common no¬ 
tion of “use of the pleasures ”—chresis aphrodision —and at¬ 
tempt to determine the modes of subjectivation to which it 
referred: the ethical substance, the types of subjection, the 
forms of elaboration of the self, and the moral teleology. Then, 
starting each time from a practice whose existence, status, and 
rules were native to Greek culture (the practice of the health 
regimen, that of household management, that of courtship), I 
will study the way in which medical and philosophical 
thought worked out this “use of the pleasures,” formulating 
several recurrent themes of austerity that would center on 
four great axes of experience: the relation to one’s body, the 
relation to one’s wife, the relation to boys, and the rela¬ 
tion to truth. 



PART ONE 


The Moral 
Pro b lema tization 
of Pleasures 





One would have a difficult time finding among the Greeks 
(or the Romans either, for that matter) anything resembling 
the notion of “sexuality” or “flesh.” I mean a notion that 
refers to a single entity and allows diverse phenomena to be 
grouped together, despite the apparently loose connections 
between them, as if they were of the same nature, derived from 
the same origin, or brought the same type of causal mech¬ 
anisms into play: behaviors, but also sensations, images, 
desires, instincts, passions. 1 

Of course the Greeks had a whole stock of words available 
for designating different actions or acts that we call “sexual.” 
They had a vocabulary for referring to specific practices; they 
had vaguer terms that referred in a general way to what we 
call sexual “intercourse,” “union,” or “relations”: for exam¬ 
ple, synousia, homilia, plesiasmos, mixis, ocheia. But the blan¬ 
ket category that covered all these actions, acts, and practices 
is much more difficult to grasp. The Greeks were fond of using 
a nominalized adjective: ta aphrodisia, 2 which the Romans 
translated roughly as venerea. “Things” or “pleasures of 
love,” “sexual relations,” “carnal acts,” “sensual pleasures”— 
one renders the term as best one can, but the difference be¬ 
tween the notional sets, theirs and ours, makes it hard to 
translate precisely. Our idea of “sexuality” does not just cover 
a wider area; it applies to a reality of another type, and it 
functions quite differently in our morals and knowledge. 
Moreover, we do not have a concept that specifies and sub¬ 
sumes a set analogous to that of aphrodisia. Perhaps I will be 
excused if occasionally I leave the Greek term in its original 
form. 

I do not aim in this section to give an exhaustive account, 

35

The Use of Pleasure 


or even a systematic summary, of the different philosophical 
or medical doctrines that dealt in one way or another, from 
the fifth century to the beginning of the third, with pleasure 
in general and with sexual pleasures in particular. Preliminary 
to studying the four types of stylization of sexual conduct that 
were developed in a dietetics concerned with the body, an 
economics concerned with marriage, an erotics concerned 
with the subject of boys, and a philosophy concerned with 
truth, I intend simply to bring out a few general traits that 
served as a framework for them, seeing that these traits were 
common to the different reflections on the aphrodisia. One can 
grant the familiar proposition that the Greeks of that epoch 
accepted certain sexual behaviors much more readily than the 
Christians of the Middle Ages or the Europeans of the modern 
period; one can also grant that laxity and misconduct in this 
regard provoked less scandal back then and made one liable 
to less recrimination, especially as there was no institution— 
whether pastoral or medical—that claimed the right to deter¬ 
mine what was permitted or forbidden, normal or abnormal, 
in this area; one can also grant that the Greeks attributed 
much less importance to all these questions than we do. But 
once all that is granted or assumed, one point still remains 
irreducible: they nonetheless concerned themselves with such 
matters, and there were Greek thinkers, moralists, philoso¬ 
phers, and doctors who believed that what the laws of the city 
prescribed or prohibited, what the general customs tolerated 
or rejected, could not suffice to regulate properly the sexual 
conduct of a man who cared about himself. The manner in 
which this kind of pleasure was enjoyed was considered by 
them to be an ethical problem. 

What I would like to define in the next few pages are just 
those general aspects which their preoccupation with these 
questions shared; that is, the general form of the moral inquiry 
that they pursued concerning the aphrodisia. And for this we 
will need to consult texts that are radically different from one 
another—essentially those of Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle. 



The Moral Problematizalion of Pleasures 


37 


I will attempt to restore, not the “doctrinal context” that 
might give each one its peculiar meaning and its differential 
value, but rather the “field of problematization” that they had 
in common and that made each of them possible. The object, 
therefore, will be to elicit, in its general features, the constitu¬ 
tion of the aphrodisia as a domain of moral concern. I will 
consider four notions that are often encountered in the reflec¬ 
tion on sexual ethics: the notion of aphrodisia, through which 
one can grasp what was recognized as the “ethical substance” 
in sexual behavior; the notion of “use,” of chresis, which 
allows one to perceive the type of subjection that the practice 
of pleasures had to undergo in order to be morally valorized; 
the notion of enkrateia, of mastery, that defines the attitude 
that was required with respect to oneself in order to make 
oneself into an ethical subject; and lastly, the notion of “mod¬ 
eration,” of sophrosyne, that characterized the ethical subject 
in his fulfillment. It should thus be possible to determine what 
structured the moral experience of sexual pleasures—its on¬ 
tology, its deontology, its ascetics, its teleology. 



1 


Aphrodisia 


The Suda gives a definition of aphrodisia that will be re¬ 
peated by Hesychius: aphrodisia are “the works, the acts of 
Aphrodite” (erga Aphrodites). Doubtless one should not ex¬ 
pect to see a very rigorous attempt at conceptualization in 
such a work as the one mentioned, but it is a fact that the 
Greeks had not evinced, either in their theoretical reflection 
or in their practical thinking, a very insistent concern for 
defining precisely what they meant by aphrodisia —whether it 
was a question of determining the nature of the thing desig¬ 
nated, of delimiting its scope, or of drawing up an inventory 
of its elements. In any case, they had nothing resembling those 
long lists of possible acts, such as one finds later in the peniten¬ 
tial books, the manuals of confession, or in works on psy¬ 
chopathology; no table that served to define what was licit, 
permitted, or normal, and to describe the vast family of pro¬ 
hibited gestures. Nor was there anything resembling the con¬ 
cern—which was so characteristic of the question of the flesh 
or of sexuality—for discovering the insidious presence of a 
power of undetermined limits and multiple masks beneath 
what appeared inoffensive or innocent. Neither classification 
nor decipherment. They might take great pains to fix the 
optimal age to marry and have children, and the best season 
for having sexual relations, but they would never say, like a 
Christian spiritual director, which gestures to make or avoid 
making, which preliminary caresses were allowed, which posi-

tion to take, or in which conditions one could interrupt the 
act. To the insufficiently prepared, Socrates recommended to 
flee from the sight of a handsome boy, even if it meant a year’s 
exile,' and the Phaedrus evokes the lover’s long struggle 
against his own desire; but nowhere is there a statement, as 
there will be in Christian spirituality, of the precautions that 
have to be taken in order to prevent desire from entering the 
soul surreptitiously, or to detect its secret traces. Even stran¬ 
ger perhaps: the doctors who set forth, in some detail, the 
elements of the aphrodisia regimen are practically silent con¬ 
cerning the forms that the acts themselves may take; they say 
very little—aside from a few references to the “natural posi¬ 
tion”—regarding what is in accord with or contrary to the will 
of nature. 

Was this due to modesty? Possibly. For, as much as we like 
to credit the Greeks with a great liberty of morals, the repre¬ 
sentation of sexual acts that they suggest in their written 
works—and even in their erotic literature—seems to have 
been characterized by a good deal of reserve,* despite the 
impression one gets from the entertainments they staged or 
from certain iconographic representations that have been 
rediscovered. 3 In any case, one does sense that Xenophon, 
Aristotle, and later Plutarch would not have thought it decent 
to dispense the sort of presumptive and pragmatic advice on 
sexual relations with one’s lawful wife that the Christian au¬ 
thors lavishly distributed on the subject of conjugal pleasures. 
They were not prepared, as the directors of conscience would 
be, to regulate the process of demands and refusals, of first 
caresses, of the modalities of union, of the pleasures one ex¬ 
perienced and the conclusion they should properly be given. 
But there was a positive reason for this attitude that we may 
perceive retrospectively as “reticence” or “reserve.” It was 
due to their conception of the aphrodisia, to the kind of ques¬ 
tioning they directed to them, which was not oriented in the 

*K. J. Dover notes an accentuation of this reserve in the course of the classical age . 2 



40 


The Use of Pleasure 


least toward the search for their profound nature, their 
canonical forms, or their secret potential. 

1. The aphrodisia are the acts, gestures, and contacts that 
produce a certain form of pleasure. When Saint Augustine in 
his Confessions recalls the friendships of his youth, the inten¬ 
sity of his affections, the pleasures of the days spent together, 
the conversations, the enthusiasms and good times, he won¬ 
ders if, underneath its seeming innocence, all that did not 
pertain to the flesh, to that “glue” which attaches us to the 
flesh. 4 But when Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics wants to 
determine exactly which people deserve to be called “self- 
indulgent,” his definition is cautiously restrictive: self-indul¬ 
gence— akolasia —relates only to the pleasures of the body; 
and among these, the pleasures of sight, hearing, and smell 
must be excluded. 5 It is not self-indulgent to “delight in” 
(charein) colors, shapes, or paintings, nor in theater or music; 
one can, without self-indulgence, delight in the scent of fruit, 
roses, or incense; and, he says in the Eudemian Ethics, 6 any¬ 
one who would become so intensely absorbed in looking at a 
statue or in listening to a song as to lose his appetite or taste 
for lovemaking could not be reproached for self-indulgence, 
any more than could someone who let himself be seduced by 
the Sirens. For there is pleasure that is liable to akolasia only 
where there is touch and contact: contact with the mouth, the 
tongue, and the throat (for the pleasures of food and drink), 
or contact with other parts of the body (for the pleasure of 
sex). Moreover, Aristotle remarks that it would be unjust to 
suspect self-indulgence in the case of certain pleasures ex¬ 
perienced on the surface of the body, such as the noble pleas¬ 
ures that are produced by massages and heat in the 
gymnasium: “for the contact characteristic of the self-indul¬ 
gent man does not affect the whole body but only certain 
parts.” 7 * 

*One should, however, note the importance attributed by many Greek texts to the 
gaze and to the eyes in the genesis of desire or love; but it is not that the pleasure

It will be one of the characteristic traits of the Christian 
experience of the “flesh,” and later of “sexuality,” that the 
subject is expected to exercise suspicion often, to be able to 
recognize from afar the manifestations of a stealthy, resource¬ 
ful, and dreadful power. Reading these signs will be all the 
more important as this power has the ability to cloak itself in 
many forms other than sexual acts. There is no similar suspi¬ 
cion inhabiting the experience of the aphrodisia. To be sure, 
in the teaching and the exercise of moderation, it is recom¬ 
mended to be wary of sounds, images, and scents; but this is 
not because attachment to them would be only the masked 
form of a desire whose essence is sexual: it is because there are 
musical forms capable of weakening the soul with their 
rhythms, and because there are sights capable of affecting the 
soul like a venom, and because a particular scent, a particular 
image, is apt to call up the “memory of the thing desired.” 9 
And when philosophers are laughed at for claiming to love 
only the beautiful souls of boys, they are not suspected of 
harboring murky feelings of which they may not be conscious, 
but simply of waiting for the tete-a-tete in order to slip their 
hand under the tunic of their heart’s desire. 10 

What of the form and variety of these acts? Greek natural 
history gives some descriptions, at least as concerns animals: 
Aristotle remarks that mating is not the same among all ani¬ 
mals and does not take place in the same manner." And in the 
part of Book VI of the History of Animals that deals more 
specifically with viviparous animals, he describes the different 
forms of copulation that can be observed: they vary according 
to the form and location of the organs, the position taken by 
the partners, and the duration of the act. But he also evokes 
the types of behavior that characterize the mating season: wild 

of the gaze is self-indulgent; rather, it is thought to make an opening through which 
the soul is reached. In this connection, see Xenophon’s Memorabilia. * As for the kiss, 
it was very highly valued as a physical pleasure and a communication of souls despite 
the danger it carried. As a matter of fact, an entire historical study could be under¬ 
taken on the “pleasure body” and its transformations. 



42 


The Use of Pleasure 


boars preparing for battle, elephants whose frenzy extends to 
the destruction of their keeper’s house, or stallions that group 
their females together by tracing a big circle around them 
before throwing themselves against their rivals. 12 With regard 
to the human animal, while the description of organs and their 
functioning may be detailed, the subject of sexual behavior, 
with its possible variants, is barely touched upon. Which does 
not mean, however, that there was, in Greek medicine, philos¬ 
ophy, or ethics, a zone of strict silence around the sexual 
activity of humans. It is not that people were careful to avoid 
talking about these pleasurable acts; but when they were the 
subject of questioning, what was at issue was not the form they 
assumed, it was the activity they manifested. Their dynamics 
was much more important than their morphology. 

This dynamics was defined by the movement that linked the 
aphrodisia to the pleasure that was associated with them and 
to the desire to which they gave rise. The attraction exerted 
by pleasure and the force of the desire that was directed to¬ 
ward it constituted, together with the action of the aphrodisia 
itself, a solid unity. The dissociation—or partial dissociation 
at least—of this ensemble would later become one of the basic 
features of the ethics of the flesh and the notion of sexuality. 
This dissociation was to be marked, on the one hand, by a 
certain “elision” of pleasure (a moral devaluation through the 
injunction given in the preaching by the Christian clergy 
against the pursuit of sensual pleasure as a goal of sexual 
practice; a theoretical devaluation shown by the extreme diffi¬ 
culty of finding a place for pleasure in the conception of sexu¬ 
ality); it would also be marked by an increasingly intense 
problematization of desire (in which the primordial sign of a 
fallen nature or the structure characteristic of the human 
condition would be visible). In the experience of the aphrodisia 
on the other hand, act, desire, and pleasure formed an ensem¬ 
ble whose elements were distinguishable certainly, but closely 
bound to one another. It was precisely their close linkage that 
constituted one of the essential characteristics of that form of 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


43 


activity. Nature intended (for reasons we shall consider) that 
the performance of the act be associated with a pleasure, and 
it was this pleasure that gave rise to epithumia, to desire, in 
a movement that was naturally directed toward what “gives 
pleasure,” according to a principle that Aristotle cites: desire 
is always “desire for the agreeable thing” (he gar epithumia 
tou hedeos estin). 13 It is true—Plato always comes back to the 
idea—that for the Greeks there could not be desire without 
privation, without the want of the thing desired and without 
a certain amount of suffering mixed in; but the appetite, Plato 
explains in the Philebus, can be aroused only by the represen¬ 
tation, the image or the memory of the thing that gives pleas¬ 
ure; he concludes that there can be no desire except in the soul, 
for while the body is affected by privation, it is the soul and 
only the soul that can, through memory, make present the 
thing that is to be desired and thereby arouse the epithumia . 14 
Thus, what seems in fact to have formed the object of moral 
reflection for the Greeks in matters of sexual conduct was not 
exactly the act itself (considered in its different modalities), or 
desire (viewed from the standpoint of its origin or its aim), or 
even pleasure (evaluated according to the different objects or 
practices that can cause it); it was more the dynamics that 
joined all three in a circular fashion (the desire that leads to 
the act, the act that is linked to pleasure, and the pleasure that 
occasions desire). The ethical question that was raised was 
not: which desires? which acts? which pleasures? but rather: 
with what force is one transported “by the pleasures and 
desires”? The ontology to which this ethics of sexual behavior 
referred was not, at least not in its general form, an ontology 
of deficiency and desire; it was not that of a nature setting the 
standard for acts; it was an ontology of a force that linked 
together acts, pleasures, and desires. It was this dynamic rela¬ 
tionship that constituted what might be called the texture of 
the ethical experience of the aphrodisia. * 

*The frequency of expressions that link pleasures and desires very closely together 
should be noted. These expressions show that what is at stake in the ethical system 



44 


The Use of Pleasure 


This dynamics is analyzed in terips of two major variables. 
The first is quantitative; it has to do with the degree of activity 
that is shown by the number and frequency of acts. What 
differentiates men from one another, for medicine and moral 
philosophy alike, is not so much the type of objects toward 
which they are oriented, nor the mode of sexual practice they 
prefer; above all, it is the intensity of that practice. The divi¬ 
sion is between lesser and greater: moderation or excess. It is 
rather rare, when a notable personage is depicted, for his 
preference for one form of sexual practice or another to be 
pointed up.* On the other hand, it is always important for his 
moral characterization to note whether he has been able to 
show moderation in his involvement with women or boys, like 
Agesilaus, who carried moderation to the point that he refused 
to kiss the young man that he loved; or whether he surrend¬ 
ered, like Alcibiades or Arcesilaus, to the appetite for the 
pleasures that one can enjoy with both sexes. 18 This point is 
supported by the famous passage of the first book of the Laws: 
it is true that Plato draws a sharp opposition in this passage 
between the relationship “according to nature” that joins man 
and woman for procreative ends, and relations “against na¬ 
ture” of male with male and female with female. 19 But this 
opposition, as marked as it is from the standpoint of natural¬ 
ness, is referred by Plato to the more basic distinction between 
self-restraint and self-indulgence. The practices that contra¬ 
vene nature and the principle of procreation are not explained 
as the effect of an abnormal nature or of a peculiar form of 
desire; they are merely the result of immoderation: “a lack of 

of the aphrodisia is the dynamic ensemble consisting of desire and pleasure associated 
with the act. The epithumiai-hedonai pair occurs quite commonly in Plato . 15 Fre¬ 
quent, too, are expressions that speak of pleasure as a force that persuades, transports, 
triumphs, as in Xenophon’s Memorabilia . 16 

*lt sometimes happens that a man’s particular fondness for boys will be mentioned 
for narrative purposes. Xenophon does this in the Anabasis, in regard to a certain 
Episthenes. But when he draws a negative portrait of Menon, he does not reproach 
him for this kind of taste, but for misusing such pleasures: obtaining a command too 
young, or loving an overage boy while still being beardless himself . 17

self-restraint with regard to pleasure” (akrateia hedones) is 
their source . 20 And when, in the Timaeus, Plato declares that 
lust should be considered as the effect, not of a bad volition 
of the soul, but of a sickness of the body, this disorder is 
described in terms of a grand pathology of excess: the sperm, 
instead of remaining enclosed in the marrow and its bony 
casing, overflows and starts to stream through the whole body, 
so that the latter becomes like a tree whose vegetative power 
exceeds all limits; the individual is thus driven to distraction 
for a large part of his existence by “pleasures and pains in 
excess .” 21 This idea that immorality in the pleasures of sex is 
always connected with exaggeration, surplus, and excess is 
found again in the third book of the Nicomachean Ethics: 
Aristotle explains that for the natural desires that are common 
to everyone, the only offenses that one can commit are quan¬ 
titative in nature: they pertain to “the more” (to pleion); so 
that natural desire only consists in satisfying needs, “to eat or 
drink whatever offers itself till one is surfeited is to exceed the 
natural amount [ toi plethei ].” It is true that Aristotle also 
makes allowance for the particular pleasures of individuals. It 
happens that people commit different types of offenses, either 
by not taking their pleasure “where they should,” or by behav¬ 
ing “like the crowd,” or again, by not taking their pleasure “as 
they ought.” But, Aristotle adds, “self-indulgent individuals 
exceed [ hyperballousi ] in all these ways; they both delight in 
some things that they ought not to delight in, and if one ought 
to delight in some of the things they delight in, they do so 
more than one ought and than most men do.” What consti¬ 
tutes self-indulgence in this sphere is excess, “and that is 
culpable.” 22 * It appears, then, that the primary dividing 
line laid down by moral judgment in the area of sexual behav¬ 
ior was not prescribed by the nature of the act, with its possi¬ 
ble variations, but by the activity and its quantitative 
gradations. 

*It should be noted, however, that Aristotle gives his attention on several occasions 
to the question of the “disgraceful pleasures" that some individuals tend to seek.*’ 



46 


The Use of Pleasure 


The practice of the pleasures was also related to another 
variable that might be labeled “role or polarity specific.” Cor¬ 
responding to the term aphrodisia was the verb aphrodisiazein. 
It refers to sexual activity in general: people thus spoke of the 
moment when animals reached an age at which they were 
capable of aphrodisiazein. 24 It also denotes the accomplish¬ 
ment of a sexual act of any kind: thus, in Xenophon, Antis- 
thenes mentions the desire to aphrodisiazein, which he 
sometimes has. 25 But the verb can also be employed in its 
active sense, in which case it relates specifically to the so-called 
“masculine” role in intercourse, and to the active function 
defined by penetration. And inversely, one can use it in its 
passive form— aphrodisiasthenai —designating in this case the 
other role in sexual union: the “passive” role of the object 
partner. This role is the one that nature had set aside for 
women—Aristotle speaks of the age at which girls become 
capable of aphrodisiasthenai ; 26 it is the role that could be 
imposed by force on someone who was thus reduced to being 
the object of the other’s pleasure; 27 it is also the role accepted 
by the boy or man who let himself be penetrated by his partner 
—the author of the Problems thus speculates about what 
causes some men to take pleasure in aphrodisiazeisthai . 28 

It is doubtless correct to say that there is no noun in the 
Greek vocabulary that would consolidate, into a common 
notion, whatever might be specific to male sexuality and fe¬ 
male sexuality. 29 But it should be remarked that in the practice 
of sexual pleasures two roles and two poles can be clearly 
distinguished, just as they can be distinguished in the repro¬ 
ductive function; these consisted of two positional values: that 
of the subject and that of the object, that of the agent and that 
of the “patient”—as Aristotle says, “the female, as female, is 
passive, and the male, as male, is active.” 30 Whereas the expe¬ 
rience of the “flesh” would be considered as an experience 
common to men and women, even if it did not take the same 
form in both, and whjle “sexuality” would be marked by the 
great caesura between male and female sexuality, the aphrodi-

si a were thought of as an activity involving two actors, each 
having its role and function—the one who performs the activ¬ 
ity and the one on whom it is performed. 

From this viewpoint, and in this ethics (always bearing in 
mind that it was a male ethics, made by and for men), it can 
be said that the dividing line fell mainly between men and 
women, for the simple reason that there was a strong differen¬ 
tiation between the world of men and that of women in many 
ancient societies. But more generally, it fell between what 
might be called the “active actors” in the drama of pleasures, 
and the “passive actors”: on one side, those who were the 
subjects of sexual activity (and who were expected to carry it 
out in a measured and opportune manner); and on the other, 
those who were the object-partners, the supporting players 
with whom it was carried out. The first were men, naturally, 
but more specifically they were adult free men; the second 
included women of course, but women made up only one 
element of a much larger group that was sometimes referred 
to as a way of designating the objects of possible pleasure: 
“women, boys, slaves.” In the text known as the Hippocratic 
Oath, the doctor pledges to refrain from erga aphrodisia in 
every house he enters, with any person whatsoever, whether 
a woman, a free man, or a slave. 31 

Hence the second major variable that engaged moral valua¬ 
tion, in addition to the “quantity of activity” criterion, was the 
question of remaining in one’s role or abandoning it, being the 
subject of the activity or its object, joining those who under¬ 
went it—even if one was a man—or remaining with those 
who actively performed it. For a man, excess and passivity 
were the two main forms of immorality in the practice of the 
aphrodisia. 

2. While sexual activity had thus to become an object of 
moral differentiation and valuation, the reason for this was not 
that the sexual act was bad in itself, nor that it bore the mark 
of a primordial fall from grace. Even when the current form 



48 


The Use of Pleasure 


of sexual relations and love was referred back, as it was by 
Aristophanes in the Symposium, to an original tragedy involv¬ 
ing the pride of humans and punishment by the gods, neither 
the act nor pleasure was considered bad for all that; on the 
contrary, they tended toward the restoration of the highest 
state of being that man had achieved. 32 In general, sexual 
activity was perceived as natural (natural and indispensable) 
since it was through this activity that living creatures were 
able to reproduce, the species as a whole was able to escape 
extinction, 33 and cities, families, names, and religions were 
able to endure far longer than individuals, who were destined 
to pass away. The desires that led to the aphrodisia were 
classed by Plato among the most natural and necessary; and 
the pleasures that could be obtained from the aphrodisia had 
their cause, according to Aristotle, in necessary things that 
concerned the body and the life of the body in general. 34 In 
short, as Rufus of Ephesus was to point out, seeing that sexual 
activity was deeply and harmoniously grounded in nature, 
there was no way that it could be considered bad. 35 In this 
respect, the moral experience of the aphrodisia was of course 
radically different from the experience of the flesh that would 
develop later. 

But as natural and even necessary as it may have been 
considered, it was nonetheless the object of a moral concern. 
It called for a delimitation that would enable one to determine 
the proper degree and extent to which it could be practiced. 
'And yet, if it could pose questions of good and evil, this was 
not in spite of its naturalness, or because the latter might have 
been altered; it was precisely because of the way in which it 
had been organized by nature. Two traits marked the pleasure 
with which it was associated. First, there was its inferior char¬ 
acter: bearing in mind that for Aristippus and the Cyrenaics 
“pleasure does not differ from pleasure,” 36 sexual pleasure was 
generally characterized as being, not a bearer of evil, but 
ontologically or qualitatively inferior—for several reasons: it 
was common to animals and men (and thus did not constitute 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


49 


a specifically human trait); it was mixed with privation and 
suffering (in contrast to the pleasures of sight and hearing); it 
depended on the body and its necessities and it was aimed at 
restoring the organism to its state prior to need. 37 But there 
was also the fact that this conditioned, subordinate, and in¬ 
ferior pleasure was extremely acute; as Plato explains at the 
beginning of the Laws, if nature arranged for men and women 
to be attracted to one another, it was in order that procreation 
might be possible and the survival of the species might be 
ensured. 38 Now, this purpose was so important and it was so 
essential that humans produce descendants, that nature at¬ 
tached an extremely intense pleasure to the act of procreation. 
Just as animals are reminded of the need to nourish them¬ 
selves, thus assuring their individual survival, by the natural 
pleasure that is associated with eating and drinking, so the 
necessity of begetting offspring, of leaving a progeny behind, 
is constantly recalled by the pleasure and the desire that ac¬ 
company the mating of the sexes. The Laws thus refers to the 
existence of three basic appetites, relating to food, drink, and 
reproduction. All three are strong, imperative, and intense, 
but the third one in particular, although “the latest to 
emerge,” is “the keenest lust.” 39 Socrates asks his interlocutor 
in the Republic whether he knows of “a greater and sharper 
pleasure than the sexual.” 40 

It was just this natural acuteness of pleasure, together with 
the attraction it exerted on desire, that caused sexual activity 
to go beyond the limits that were set by nature when she made 
the pleasure of the aphrodisia an inferior, subordinate, and 
conditioned pleasure. Because of this intensity, people were 
induced to overturn the hierarchy, placing these appetites and 
their satisfaction uppermost, and giving them absolute power 
over the soul. Also because of it, people were led to go beyond 
the satisfaction of needs and to continue looking for pleasure 
even after the body had been restored. The tendency to rebel¬ 
lion and riotousness was the “stasiastic” potential of the sex¬ 
ual appetite; and the tendency to exaggeration, to excess, was 



50 


The Use of Pleasure 


its “hyperbolic” potential. 41 Nature had invested human be¬ 
ings with this necessary and redoubtable force, which was 
always on the point of overshooting the objective that was set 
for it. One understands why, in these conditions, sexual activ¬ 
ity required a moral discrimination that was, as we have seen, 
more dynamic than morphological. If it was necessary, as 
Plato said, to bridle it with the three strongest restraints: fear, 
law, and true reason; if it was necessary, as Aristotle thought, 
for desire to obey reason the way a child obeyed his tutor; if 
Aristippus himself advised that, while it was all right to “use” 
pleasures, one had to be careful not to be carried away by 
them 42 —the reason was not that sexual activity was a vice, nor 
that it might deviate from a canonical model; it was because 
sexual activity was associated with a force, an energeia, that 
was itself liable to be excessive. In the Christian doctrine of 
the flesh, the excessive force of pleasure had its principle in the 
Fall and in the weakness that had marked human nature ever 
since. For classical Greek thought, this force was potentially 
excessive by nature, and the moral question was how to con¬ 
front this force, how to control it and regulate its economy in 
a suitable way. 

The fact that sexual activity appeared in the form of a play 
of forces established by nature, but subject to abuse, related 
it to eating and the moral problems the latter tended to pose. 
This association between the ethics of sex and the ethics of the 
table was a constant factor in ancient culture. One could find 
countless examples of it. When, in the first book of the 
Memorabilia, he wants to show how useful Socrates was to his 
disciples, by his example and his observations, Xenophon sets 
forth the precepts and conduct of his master “concerning 
eating and drinking and the pleasures of love.” 43 The inter¬ 
locutors of the Republic, when they deal with the education 
of guardians, come to agree that moderation (sophrosyne) 
demands the threefold mastery of the pleasures of drink, sex, 
and food (potoi, aphrodisia, edodai ). 44 And Aristotle follows 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


51 


suit: in the Nicomachean Ethics, the three examples he gives 
of “common pleasures” are those of eating, drinking, and, for 
youths and vigorous men, the “pleasures of the bed.” 45 In 
these three forms of pleasure, he recognizes the same type of 
danger: that of exceeding what is necessary; he even identifies 
a physiological principle that they hold in common, noting 
pleasures of contact and touch in all three (according to him, 
food and drink do not cause their particular pleasure except 
by coming in contact with the tongue and especially the 
throat). 46 When he speaks in the Symposium, the doctor Eryx- 
imachus claims for his art the prerogative of advising on the 
manner in which one must make use of the pleasures of the 
bed and the table; according to him, it is doctors who ought 
to say how to enjoy rich food without making oneself sick; it 
also rests with them to prescribe, to those who practice physi¬ 
cal love—Eros Pandemos—how to have an orgasm without 
any resulting ill effects. 44 

It would be interesting, surely, to trace the long history of 
the connections between alimentary ethics and sexual ethics, 
as manifested in doctrines, but also in religious rituals and 
dietary rules; one would need to discover how, over a long 
period of time, the play of alimentary prescriptions became 
uncoupled from that of sexual morals, by following the evolu¬ 
tion of their respective importance (with the rather belated 
moment, no doubt, when the problem of sexual conduct be¬ 
came more worrisome than that of alimentary behaviors) and 
the gradual differentiation of their specific structure (the mo¬ 
ment when sexual desire began to be questioned in terms other 
than alimentary appetite). In any case, in the reflection of the 
Greeks in the classical period, it does seem that the moral 
problematization of food, drink, and sexual activity was car¬ 
ried out in a rather similar manner. Foods, wines, and rela¬ 
tions with women and boys constituted analogous ethical 
material; they brought forces into play that were natural, but 
that always tended to be excessive; and they all raised the 



52 


The Use of Pleasure 


same question: how could one, how must one “make use” 
(chresthai) of this dynamics of pleasures, desires, and acts? 
A question of right use. As Aristotle expresses it, “all men 
enjoy in some way or another both savoury foods and wines 
and sexual intercourse, but not all men do so as they ought 
[ouch' hos dei].”** 



2 


Chresis 


How does a man enjoy his pleasure “as one ought”? To 
what principles does he refer in order to moderate, limit, 
regulate that activity? What sort of validity might these princi¬ 
ples have that would enable a man to justify his having to obey 
them? Or, in other words, what is the mode of subjection that 
is implied in this moral problematization of sexual conduct? 

The goal of moral reflection on the aphrodisia was much 
less to establish a systematic code that would determine the 
canonical form of sexual acts, trace out the boundary of the 
prohibitions, and assign practices to one side or the other of 
a dividing line, than to work out the conditions and modalities 
of a “use”; that is, to define a style for what the Greeks called 
chresis aphrodision, the use of pleasures. The common expres¬ 
sion chresis aphrodision related, in a general way, to sexual 
activity (for example, people would speak of times of the year 
or the age in one’s life when it was good to chresthai aphrodisi- 
ois).' But the term also referred to the manner in which an 
individual managed his sexual activity, his way of conducting 
himself in such matters, the regimen he allowed himself or 
imposed on himself, the conditions in which he accomplished 
sexual acts, the share he allotted them in his life.* It was not 

•Plato talks about the right “possession and practice” (ktesis te kai chreia) of women 
and children, so that what was at issue was the whole range of relationships and forms 
of relations that one could have with them . 2 Polybius speaks of the chreia aphrodisi¬ 
on which, along with indulgence in luxurious clothes and food, characterized the 
habits of hereditary rulers and provoked discontent and revolution . 1 


53 



54 


The Use of Pleasure 


a question of what was permitted or forbidden among the 
desires that one felt or the acts that one committed, but of 
prudence, reflection, and calculation in the way one dis¬ 
tributed and controlled his acts. In the use of pleasures, while 
it was necessary to respect the laws and customs of the land, 
to keep from offending the gods, and to heed the will of nature, 
the moral rules to which one conformed were far removed 
from anything that might form a clearly defined code. * It was 
much more a question of a variable adjustment in which one 
had to take different factors into account: the element of want 
and natural necessity; that of opportuneness, which was tem¬ 
poral and circumstantial; that of the status of the individual 
himself. Chresis had to be decided on the basis of these differ¬ 
ent considerations. Thus, one can see a threefold strategy at 
work in this reflection on the use of pleasures: that of need, 
timeliness, and status. 

1. The strategy of need. The scandalous gesture of Dioge¬ 
nes is well known: when he needed to satisfy his sexual appe¬ 
tite, he would relieve himself in the marketplace. 5 Like many 
of the Cynics’ provocations, this one had a double meaning. 
It owed its impact to the public character of the act, of course, 
which went against every convention in Greece; it was cus¬ 
tomary to assert the need for privacy as a reason for making 
love only at night, and the care one took not to let oneself be 
seen engaging in this kind of activity was regarded as a sign 
that the practice of aphrodisia was not something that hon¬ 
ored the most noble qualities of mankind. It was against this 
rule of privacy that Diogenes directed his “performance” criti¬ 
cism. Diogenes Laertius reports that in fact he was in the habit 
of “doing everything in public, the works of Demeter and 
Aphrodite alike,” reasoning as follows: “If breakfast be not 
absurd, neither is it absurd to breakfast in the market-place.” 6 
But this parallel with food gave Diogenes’ action an additional 

•Aristotle’s Rhetoric defines moderation as that which makes us conduct ourselves 
with regard to the pleasures of the body “as the nomos requires .” 4 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


55 


meaning: the practice of the aphrodisia, which could not be 
shameful since it was natural, was nothing more or less than 
the satisfaction of a need; and just as the Cynic looked for the 
simplest food that might gratify his stomach (it seems that he 
tried eating raw meat), he likewise found in masturbation the 
most direct means of appeasing his sexual appetite. He even 
regretted that it was not possible to satisfy hunger and thirst 
in so simple a manner: “Would to heaven that it were enough 
to rub one’s stomach in order to allay one’s hunger.” 

In this, Diogenes was only pushing to its logical extreme 
one of the great precepts of the chresis aphrodision. He was 
reducing to a minimum the behavior that Antisthenes had 
already advocated in Xenophon’s Symposium: “If I ever feel 
a natural desire to have sex with women, I am so well satisfied 
with whatever chance puts in my way that those to whom I 
make my advances are more than glad to welcome me because 
they have no one else to consort with them. In a word, all these 
items appeal to me as being so conducive to enjoyment that 
I could not pray for greater pleasure in performing any one 
of them, but could pray rather for less—so much more plea¬ 
surable do I regard some of them than is good for one.” 7 
Antisthenes’ regimen is not very far removed in principle 
(even if the practical consequences are quite different) from 
several precepts or examples that Socrates, according to Xeno¬ 
phon, gave to his disciples. For if he recommended that those 
who were insufficiently fortified against the pleasures of love 
flee from the sight of beautiful boys, and go into exile if neces¬ 
sary, he did not in any case advocate a total, definitive, and 
unconditional abstention. The Socratic lesson, at least as 
Xenophon presents it, was that people should “limit them¬ 
selves to such indulgence as the soul would reject unless the 
need of the body were pressing, and such as would do no harm 
when the need was there.” 8 

But in this need-regulated use of the aphrodisia, the objec¬ 
tive was not to reduce pleasure to nothing; on the contrary, 
what was wanted was to maintain it and to do so through the 



56 


The Use of Pleasure 


need that awakened desire. Everyone knew that pleasure was 
dulled if it offered no satisfaction to the keenness of a desire: 
“To my friends, meat and drink bring sweet and simple enjoy¬ 
ment [hedeia . . . apolausis apragmon]," 1 says Virtue in Prodi- 
cus’ speech as reported by Socrates, “for they wait till they 
crave them.’’ 9 And in a discussion with Euthydemus, Socrates 
remarks that “hunger or thirst or desire [aphrodision epi- 
thumia] or lack of sleep are the sole causes of pleasure in 
eating and drinking and sexual indulgence, and in resting or 
sleeping, after a time of waiting and resistance until the mo¬ 
ment comes when these will give the greatest possible satisfac¬ 
tion [hos eni hedista]." 10 But if pleasure must be sustained 
through desire, this did not mean that, conversely, desires 
must be increased by recourse to pleasures that were not of a 
natural kind. It is fatigue, says Prodicus, and not continuous 
idleness, that ought to make one feel like sleeping; and if it was 
proper to satisfy sexual desires when they appeared, it was not 
good to create desires that went beyond needs. Need ought to 
serve as a guiding principle in this strategy, which clearly 
could never take the form of a precise codification or a law 
applicable to everyone alike in every circumstance. The strat¬ 
egy made possible an equilibrium in the dynamics of pleasure 
and desire: it kept this dynamics from “running away,” from 
becoming excessive, by setting the satisfaction of a need as its 
internal limit; and it prevented this natural force from revolt¬ 
ing, from usurping a place that was not its own, because it 
provided only for what was necessary to the body and was 
intended by nature, and nothing more. 

At the same time it enabled one to avoid immoderation, 
which was, strictly speaking, a behavior that did not have its 
basis in nature. It was for this reason that it could assume two 
forms against which the ethical regimen of pleasures had to 
struggle. There was an immoderation that might be called an 
immoderation of “plethora” or “fulfillment.” 11 There was also 
what might be called an immoderation of “artifice,” which 
was a product of the first type of immoderation: it consisted 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


57 


in seeking sensual pleasures in the gratification of unnatural 
desires; it was this type that led people to “get three cooks to 
give zest to eating, to buy costly wines, and to run to and fro 
in search of snow in the summer”; it was this type, too, that 
“used men as women” 12 in order to find new pleasures in the 
aphrodisia. Understood in this way, moderation could not 
take the form of an obedience to a system of laws or a codifica¬ 
tion of behaviors; nor could it serve as a principle for nullify¬ 
ing pleasures; it was an art, a practice of pleasures that was 
capable of self-limitation through the “use” of those pleasures 
that were based on need: “Self-control alone,” says Socrates, 
“causes them to endure the sufferings I have named, and 
therefore she alone causes them to experience any pleasure 
worth mentioning in such enjoyments.” 13 And this is how 
Socrates himself experienced them in everyday life, according 
to Xenophon: “He ate just sufficient food to make eating a 
pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found 
appetite the best sauce; and any kind of drink he found pleas¬ 
ant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.” 14 

2. The strategy of timeliness. Another strategy consisted in 
determining the opportune time, the kairos. This was one of 
the most important objectives, and one of the most delicate, 
in the art of making use of the pleasures. Plato emphasizes the 
point in the Laws: fortunate was the one (whether an individ¬ 
ual or a state) who knew what needed to be done in this sphere, 
“at the right time and in the right amount”; whoever, on the 
contrary, acted “without knowledge [anepistemonos] and at 
the wrong time [ektos ton kairon ]” would “live a life that is 
just the opposite.” 15 

One has to keep in mind that this theme of the “right time” 
had always had considerable importance for the Greeks, not 
only as a moral problem, but also as a question of science and 
technique. The exercise of practical skills as in medicine, gov¬ 
ernment, and navigation (a grouping that was quite traditional 
for them) implied that one was not content with knowing 



58 


The Use of Pleasure 


general principles but that one was able to determine the 
moment when it was necessary to act and the precise manner 
in which to do so in terms of existing circumstances. And in 
fact it was one of the essential aspects of the virtue of prudence 
that it made one capable of practicing the “politics of timeli¬ 
ness” in the different domains—whether this involved the city 
or the individual, the body or the soul—where it was impor¬ 
tant to seize the kairos. In the use of pleasures, morality was 
also an art of the “right time.” 

That time could be decided according to several scales. 
There was the scale of a person’s entire life. Doctors thought 
that it was not good to begin the practice of pleasures too 
young; they also thought that it could be harmful if one ex¬ 
tended it to an advanced age; it had its season in life. In 
general, the latter was limited to a period characterized not 
only as the span during which procreation was possible, but 
also that in which the offspring would be healthy, well formed, 
and robust.* There was also the scale of the year, with its 
seasons: as we shall see in Part Two, dietary regimens attached 
great importance to the correlation between sexual activity 
and climatic variation, between cold and heat, humidity and 
dryness. It was also recommended to choose the right time of 
day: one of Plutarch’s “table talks” deals with this problem, 
and proposes a solution that appears to have been traditional; 
dietary reasons, but also reasons of decency and religious 
considerations, argued for the evening, for this was the time 
most favorable to the body, the moment when darkness blot¬ 
ted out unseemly images, and when it was possible to insert 
the space of a night between that activity and the next morn¬ 
ing’s religious observances. 17 The choice of moment—of the 
kairos —ought to depend on other activities as well. If Xeno¬ 
phon could point to Cyrus as an example of moderation, this 

♦This period was thought to begin late; for Aristotle, sperm remained sterile up to 
the age of twenty-one. But the age a man had to wait for before he could expect fine 
offspring was later still: “After the age of twenty-one, women are fully ripe for 
child-bearing, but men go on increasing in vigor.”"

was not because he had renounced pleasures; it was because 
he knew how to distribute them properly over the course of 
his existence, not permitting them to divert him from his 
occupations, and allowing them only after a prior period of 
work had cleared the way for honorable recreation. 18 

The importance of the “right time” in sexual ethics appears 
rather clearly in a passage of the Memorabilia dealing with 
incest. Socrates states unequivocally that the precept that 
“parents shall not have sexual intercourse with their children 
nor children with their parents” constitutes a universal dic¬ 
tum, laid down by the gods. He sees the proof of this in the 
fact that those who break the rule receive a punishment. Now, 
the punishment consists in this: regardless of the intrinsic 
qualities that the incestuous parents might possess, their off¬ 
spring will come to no good. And why is this? Because the 
parents failed to respect the principle of the “right time,” 
mixing their seed unseasonably, since one of them was neces¬ 
sarily much older than the other: for people to procreate when 
they were no longer “in full vigor” was always “to beget 
badly.” 19 Xenophon and Socrates do not say that incest is 
reprehensible only in the form of an “inopportune” action; but 
it is remarkable that the evil of incest is manifested in the same 
way and with the same consequences as the lack of regard for 
the proper time. 

3. The strategy of status. The art of making use of pleasure 
also had to be adapted to suit the user and his personal status. 
The author of the Erotic Essay (attributed to Demosthenes) 
restates this principle, taking his cue from the Symposium: 
every sensible person knows very well that love relations with 
a boy are not “absolutely either honorable or shameful but for 
the most part vary according to the persons concerned,” so 
that it would be “unreasonable to adopt the same attitude” in 
every case. 20 

It may well be a trait common to all societies that the rules 
of sexual conduct vary according to age, sex, and the condition

of individuals, and that obligations and prohibitions are not 
imposed on everyone in the same manner. But, restricting 
ourselves to the case of Christian morality, this specification 
occurs within the framework of an overall system that defines 
the value of the sexual act in terms of general principles, 
indicates the conditions in which it may be legitimate or not, 
according to whether one is married or not, bound by vows 
or not, etc.; this is an instance of modulated universality. It 
seems, on the other hand, that in the classical ethics, with the 
exception of a few precepts that applied to everyone, standards 
of sexual morality were always tailored to one’s way of life, 
which was itself determined by the status one had inherited 
and the purposes one had chosen. The same Demosthenes of 
the Erotic Essay addresses Epicrates in order to “counsel him 
on the means of rendering his life still more worthy of es¬ 
teem”; he does not want to see the young man make decisions 
that are not based on “the right advice on the conduct of life”; 
and this good advice is not given in order to review the general 
principles of behavior, but to point up the legitimate difference 
that exists among moral criteria: “we do not reproach men of 
humble and insignificant natural gifts even when they commit 
a dishonorable act”; on the other hand, if they are someone 
like Epicrates himself, who has “attained distinction, even a 
bit of negligence in some matter of high honor brings dis¬ 
grace.” 21 It was a generally accepted principle of government 
that the more one was in the public eye, the more authority 
one had or wanted to have over others, and the more one 
sought to make one’s life into a brilliant work whose reputa¬ 
tion would spread far and last long—the more necessary it was 
to adopt and maintain, freely and deliberately, rigorous stan¬ 
dards of sexual conduct. Such was the counsel given by Simo¬ 
nides to Hiero concerning “meat and drink and sleep and 
love”: these were pleasures that all creatures alike seemed to 
enjoy, whereas the love of honor and praise was peculiar to 
humans, and it was that love which enabled one to endure 
dangers and privations. 22 And this was also the manner in 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

which Agesilaus conducted himself, again according to Xeno¬ 
phon, with regard to the pleasures “that prove too strong for 
many men”; indeed, he thought that “a ruler’s superiority 
over ordinary men should be shown not by weakness but by 
endurance.” 23 

Moderation was quite regularly represented among the 
qualities that belonged—or at least should belong—not just to 
anyone but particularly to those who had rank, status, and 
responsibility in the city. When the Socrates of the Memora¬ 
bilia describes for Critobulus the gentleman whose friendship 
is worth seeking, he places moderation on the list of qualities 
that characterize a man worthy of social esteem—a list that 
includes being ready to render a service to a friend, being 
disposed to return kindnesses received, and being accom¬ 
modating in business matters. 24 In order to show the advan¬ 
tages of moderation to his disciple Aristippus, who “was 
rather intemperate in such matters,” Socrates, still according 
to Xenophon, asks the question: if he had to educate two 
youths, one of whom would go on to lead an ordinary life and 
the other would be destined to command, which of the two 
would he teach to “control his passions” so that they would 
not hinder him from doing what he would have to do? 25 Else¬ 
where in the Memorabilia, Socrates submits that since people 
prefer to have slaves who are not intemperate, all the more 
when it comes to choosing a leader, “should we choose one 
whom we know to be the slave of the belly, or of wine, or lust, 
or sleep?” 26 It is true that Plato would give the entire state the 
virtue of moderation; but he does not mean by this that all 
would be equally self-controlled: sophrosyne would character¬ 
ize the city in which those who ought to be ruled would obey, 
and those who were destined to rule would in fact rule: hence 
there would be a multitude of “appetites and pleasures and 
pains” in children, women, and slaves, as well as in the inferior 
majority; “but those desires that are simple and measured and 
directed by reasoning with intelligence and right belief” would 
be found “in but few people who are the best by nature and 



62 


The Use of Pleasure 


the best educated.” In the moderate state, the passions of the 
unprincipled multitude would be controlled by “the desires 
and the knowledge of the fewer and the better.” 27 

We are a long way from a form of austerity that would tend 
to govern all individuals in the same way, from the proudest 
to the most humble, under a universal law whose application 
alone would be subject to modulation by means of casuistry. 
On the contrary, here everything was a matter of adjustment, 
circumstance, and personal position. The few great common 
laws—of the city, religion, nature—remained present, but it 
was as if they traced a very wide circle in the distance, inside 
of which practical thought had to define what could rightfully 
be done. And for this there was no need of anything resem¬ 
bling a text that would have the force of law, but rather, of 
a techne or “practice,” a savoir-faire that by taking general 
principles into account would guide action in its time, accord¬ 
ing to its context, and in view of its ends. Therefore, in this 
form of morality, the individual did not make himself into an 
ethical subject by universalizing the principles that informed 
his action; on the contrary, he did so by means of an attitude 
and a quest that individualized his action, modulated it, and 
perhaps even gave him a special brilliance by virtue of the 
rational and deliberate structure his action manifested.

Enkrateia 


The interiority of Christian morality is often contrasted 
with the exteriority of a pagan morality that would consider 
acts only in their concrete realization, in their visible and 
manifest form, in their degree of conformity with rules, and 
in the light of opinion or with a view to the memory they leave 
behind them. But this traditionally accepted opposition may 
well miss the essential elements of both. What is called Chris¬ 
tian interiority is a particular mode of relationship with 
oneself, comprising precise forms of attention, concern, deci¬ 
pherment, verbalization, confession, self-accusation, strug¬ 
gle against temptation, renunciation, spiritual combat, and so 
on. And what is designated as the “exteriority” of ancient 
morality also implies the principle of an elaboration of self, 
albeit in a very different form. The evolution that occurred— 
quite slowly at that—between paganism and Christianity did 
not consist in a gradual interiorization of rules, acts, and 
transgressions; rather, it carried out a restructuration of the 
forms of self-relationship and a transformation of the practices 
and techniques on which this relationship was based. 

Classical language had a term for designating this form of 
relationship with oneself, this “attitude” which was necessary 
to the ethics of pleasures and which was manifested through 
the proper use one made of them: enkrateia. As a matter of 
fact, for a long time the word remained rather close to 
sophrosyne: one often finds them employed together or alter- 

63

The Use of Pleasure 


natively, with very similar meanings. When Xenophon speaks 
of moderation—which, together with piety, wisdom, courage, 
and justice, was among the five virtues he usually recognized 
—he employs the words sophrosyne and enkrateia inter¬ 
changeably.' Plato refers to this proximity of the two words 
when Socrates, questioned by Callicles concerning what he 
meant by “ruling himself” (auton heauton archein), replies 
that it consists in “being temperate, master of himself [so- 
phrona onta kai enkrate auton heautou ], ruling the pleasures 
and appetites within him [archein ton hedonon kai epithumi- 
o/i].” 2 And when, in the Republic, he considers the four cardi¬ 
nal virtues in turn—wisdom, courage, justice, and moderation 
(sophrosyne) —he defines the latter by enkrateia: “Moderation 
[soph rosy ne\ is a certain orderliness and mastery [kosmos kai 
enkrateia ] over certain pleasures and appetites.” 3 * 

We may note, however, that while the meanings of these 
two words are very close, they stop short of being exact syno¬ 
nyms. Each refers to a somewhat different mode of relation¬ 
ship to self. The virtue of sophrosyne is described rather as a 
very general state that ensures that one will do “what is fitting 
as regards both gods and men” 4 —that is, one will be not only 
moderate but righteous and just, and courageous as well.f In 
contrast, enkrateia is characterized more by an active form of 
self-mastery, which enables one to resist or struggle, and to 
achieve domination in the area of desires and pleasures. Ac¬ 
cording to Helen North, Aristotle was the first to distinguish 
systematically between sophrosyne and enkrateia. 6 The former 
is characterized in the Nicomachean Ethics by the fact that the 
subject deliberately chooses reasonable principles of action, 
that he is capable of following and applying them, that he 
holds to the “right mean” between insensitivity and excess (a 
middle course that is not equidistant between the two, because 

•Aristotle says that some people believe that one who is sophron is enkrates and 
karterikos. 

tCompare: “The correct apportionment is one which honors most the good things 
pertaining to the soul, provided it has moderation.”’

moderation is actually much further away from excess than 
from insensitivity), and that he derives pleasure from the mod¬ 
eration he displays. The opposite of sophrosyne is the immod¬ 
eration (akolasia) that is expressed by deliberately choosing 
bad principles, following them of one’s own accord, surrender¬ 
ing even to the weakest desires, and taking pleasure in bad 
conduct: the immoderate individual is shameless and incorri¬ 
gible. Enkrateia, with its opposite, akrasia, is located on the 
axis of struggle, resistance, and combat; it is self-control, ten¬ 
sion, “continence”; enkrateia rules over pleasures and desires, 
but has to struggle to maintain control. Unlike the “moder¬ 
ate” man, the “continent” one experiences pleasures that are 
not in accord with reason, but he no longer allows himself to 
be carried away by them, and his merit will be greater in 
proportion as his desires are strong. As an opposite, akrasia 
is not, like immoderation, a deliberate choosing of bad princi¬ 
ples; it invites comparison, rather, with those cities that have 
good laws but are incapable of enforcing them; the incontinent 
individual lets himself be overcome in spite of himself, and 
despite the reasonable principles he embraces, either because 
he does not have the strength to put them into practice or 
because he has not given them sufficient thought: this explains 
why the incontinent person can come to his senses and achieve 
self-mastery. 7 Thus, enkrateia can be regarded as the prerequi¬ 
site of sophrosyne, as the form of effort and control that the 
individual must apply to himself in order to become moderate 
(sophron). 

In any case, the term enkrateia in the classical vocabulary 
seems to refer in general to the dynamics of a domination of 
oneself by oneself and to the effort that this demands. 

1. To begin with, this exercise of domination implies an 
agonistic relation. The Athenian of the Laws reminds Cleinias 
of this: if it is true that the man who is blessed with courage 
will attain “only half his potential” without “experience and 
training” in actual combat, it stands to reason that he will not 



66 


The Use of Pleasure 


be able to become moderate (sophron) “if he has not fought 
triumphantly against the many pleasures and desires [pollais 
hedonais kai epithumiais dia me mac he me nos] using the help of 
speech, deed, and art [logos, ergon, techne] in games and in 
serious pursuits.” 8 These are almost the same words that Anti¬ 
phon the Sophist employed on his own account: “He is not 
wise [sophron] who has not tried the ugly and the bad; for then 
there is nothing he has conquered [kratein ] and nothing that 
would enable him to assert that he is virtuous [kosmios]." 9 
One could behave ethically only by adopting a combative 
attitude toward the pleasures. As we have seen, the aphrodisia 
were made not only possible but desirable by an interplay of 
forces whose origin and finality were natural, but whose po¬ 
tential, by the fact that they had their own energy, was for 
revolt and excess. These forces could not be used in the moder¬ 
ate way that was fitting unless one was capable of opposing, 
resisting, and subduing them. Of course, if it was necessary to 
confront them, this was because they were inferior appetites 
that humans happen to share—like hunger and thirst—with 
the animals; 10 but this natural inferiority would not of itself be 
a reason for having to combat them, if there was not the 
danger that, winning out over all else, they would extend their 
rule over the whole individual, eventually reducing him to 
slavery. In other words, it was not their intrinsic nature, their 
disqualification on principle, that necessitated this “polemi¬ 
cal” attitude toward oneself, but their possible ascendancy and 
dominion. Ethical conduct in matters of pleasure was contin¬ 
gent on a battle for power. This perception of the hedonai and 
epithumiai as a formidable enemy force, and the correlative 
constitution of oneself as a vigilant adversary who confronts 
them, struggles against them, and tries to subdue them, is 
revealed in a whole series of expressions traditionally em¬ 
ployed to characterize moderation and immoderation: setting 
oneself against the pleasures and desires, not giving in to them, 
resisting their assaults, or on the contrary, letting oneself be 
overcome by them, 11 defeating them or being defeated by 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


67 


them, 12 being armed or equipped against them. 13 It is also 
revealed in metaphors such as that of the battle that has to be 
fought against armed adversaries, or that of the acropolis-soul 
assaulted by a hostile band and needing a solid garrison for its 
defense, or that of hornets that set upon reasonable and mod¬ 
erate desires, killing them or driving them out unless one 
manages to rid oneself of these attackers. 14 It is expressed, too, 
by such themes as that of the untamed forces of desire that 
invade the soul during its slumber if it has not had the fore¬ 
sight to take the necessary precautions. 15 The relationship to 
desires and pleasures is conceived as a pugnacious one: a man 
must take the position and role of the adversary with respect 
to them, either according to the model of the fighting soldier 
or the model of the wrestler in a match. One should keep in 
mind that the Athenian of the Laws, when he speaks of the 
need to restrain the three basic appetites, invokes the aid of 
“the Muses and the gods of contests [theoi agonioi ].” 16 The 
long tradition of spiritual combat, which was to take so many 
diverse forms, was already clearly delineated in classical 
Greek thought. 

2. This combative relationship with adversaries was also 
an agonistic relationship with oneself. The battle to be fought, 
the victory to be won, the defeat that one risked suffering— 
these were processes and events that took place between one¬ 
self and oneself. The adversaries the individual had to combat 
were not just within him or close by; they were part of him. 
To be sure, we would need to account for the various theoreti¬ 
cal formulations that were proposed concerning this differen¬ 
tiation between the part of oneself that was supposed to fight 
and the part that was supposed to be defeated. Parts of the soul 
that ought to maintain a certain hierarchical relationship 
among themselves? Body and soul understood as two realities 
with different origins? Forces straining toward different goals 
and working against one another like the two horses of a team? 
But in any case, the thing to remember in trying to define the 



68 


The Use of Pleasure 


general style of this ascetics is that the adversary that was to 
be fought, however far removed it might be by nature from 
any conception of the soul, reason, or virtue, did not represent 
a different, ontologically alien power. The conceptual link 
between the movement of concupiscence, in its most insidious 
and most secret forms, and the presence of the Other, with its 
ruses and its power of illusion, was to be one of the essential 
traits of the Christian ethics of the flesh. In the ethics of the 
aphrodisia, the inevitability and difficulty of the combat 
derived, on the contrary, from the fact that it unfolded as a 
solo contest: to struggle against “the desires and the pleas¬ 
ures” was to cross swords with oneself. 

In th t Republic, Plato stresses how strange, and at the same 
time somewhat ludicrous and outmoded, is a familiar expres¬ 
sion that he himself had resorted to several times: it is the one 
that consists in saying that a person is “stronger” or “weaker” 
than himself (kreitton, hetton heautou ). 17 Indeed, there is para¬ 
dox in claiming that one is stronger than oneself, since this 
implies that one is also, by the same token, weaker than one¬ 
self. But according to Plato, the expression is supported by the 
fact of a prior distinction between two parts of the soul, a 
better part and a worse, and that with regard to the victory 
or the defeat of oneself over oneself, the speaker places himself 
on the side of the first: “The expression self-control seems to 
want to indicate that in the soul of the man himself there is 
a better part and a worse part; whenever what is by nature the 
better part is in control of the worse, this is expressed by 
saying that the man is self-controlled or master of himself, and 
this is a term of praise. When, on the other hand, the smaller 
and better part, because of poor upbringing or bad company, 
is overpowered by the larger and worse, this is made a re¬ 
proach and called being defeated by oneself, and a man in that 
situation is called uncontrolled.” 18 And it is made clear at the 
beginning of the Laws that this antagonism of oneself toward 
oneself is meant to structure the ethical attitude of the individ¬ 
ual vis-a-vis desires and pleasures: the reason that is given for 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


69 


the need of a ruling authority and a legislative authority in 
every state is that even in peacetime all states are at war with 
one another; in the same way one must assume that if “all are 
enemies of all in public,” then “in private each is an enemy 
of himself”; and of all the victories it is possible to win, “the 
first and best” is the victory “of oneself over oneself,” whereas 
“being defeated by oneself is the most shameful and at the 
same time the worst of all defeats.” 19 

3. Such a “polemical” attitude with respect to oneself 
tended toward a result that was quite naturally expressed as 
victory—a victory much more impressive, says the Laws, than 
those won in wrestling and running contests. 20 This victory 
was sometimes characterized by the complete extirpation or 
expulsion of desires. 21 * But much more often, it was defined 
by the setting up of a solid and stable state of rule of the self 
over the self; the intensity of the desires and pleasures did not 
disappear, but the moderate subject controlled it well enough 
so as never to give way to violence. The famous test of Socra¬ 
tes, in which he proves capable of resisting seduction by Al- 
cibiades, does not show him “purified” of all desire for boys: 
it reveals his ability to resist whenever and however he 
chooses. Such a test would meet with disapproval from Chris¬ 
tians because it would testify to the abiding presence—for 
them immoral—of desire. But long before them, Bion the 
Borysthenite made light of it, declaring that if Socrates felt 
desire for Alcibiades, he was foolish to abstain, and if he felt 
none, his conduct was entirely unremarkable. 23 Similarly, in 
Aristotle’s analysis, enkrateia, defined as mastery and victory, 
presupposes the presence of desires, and is all the more valu¬ 
able as it manages to control those that are violent. 24 Soph ro¬ 
sy ne itself, although defined by Aristotle as a state of virtue, did 
not imply the suppression of desires but rather their control: 
Aristotle places it in an intermediary position between a self- 

*In the Nicomachean Ethics, it is a question of “bidding pleasure be gone,” as the 
old people of Troy wanted to do with Helen." 



70 


The Use of Pleasure 


indulgence (akolasia) in which one gladly abandons oneself to 
one’s pleasures, and an insensitivity (anaisthesia )—extremely 
rare, it should be added—in which one feels no pleasure; the 
moderate individual is not one who has no desires but one who 
desires “only to a moderate degree, not more than he should, 
nor when he should not.’’ 25 

In the domain of pleasures, virtue was not conceived as a 
state of integrity, but as a relationship of domination, a rela¬ 
tion of mastery. This is shown by the terms that are used— 
whether in Plato, Xenophon, Diogenes, Antiphon, or Aris¬ 
totle—to define moderation: “rule the desires and the pleas¬ 
ures,” “exercise power over them,” “govern them” (kratein, 
archein). There is an aphorism that captures this general con¬ 
ception of pleasure; interestingly, it is attributed to Aristippus, 
who had a rather different theory of pleasure from that of 
Socrates: “It is not abstinence from pleasures that is best, but 
mastery over them without ever being worsted” (to kratein kai 
me hettasthai hedonon ariston, ou to me chresthai ). 26 In other 
words, to form oneself as a virtuous and moderate subject in 
the use he makes of pleasures, the individual has to construct 
a relationship with the self that is of the “domination-submis¬ 
sion,” “command-obedience,” “mastery-docility” type (and 
not, as will be the case in Christian spirituality, a relationship 
of the “elucidation-renunciation,” “decipherment-purifica¬ 
tion” type). This is what could be called the “heautocratic” 
structure of the subject in the ethical practice of the pleasures. 

4. The development of this heautocratic form was pat¬ 
terned after several models: for example, in Plato there is the 
model of the team with its driver, and in Aristotle, that of the 
child with the adult (our desiring faculty ought to comply with 
the prescriptions of reason “as the child should live according 
to the direction of his tutor”). 27 But it was related to two great 
schemas in particular. That of domestic life, first of all: just as 
a household could not be in good order unless the rank and 
authority of the master was respected within it, so a man 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


71 


would be moderate only insofar as he was able to rule his 
desires as if they were his servants. Conversely, immoderation 
could be likened to a household that was mismanaged. At the 
beginning of the Oeconomicus —which deals precisely with the 
role of the master of the house and the art of ruling one’s wife, 
one’s estate, and one’s servants—Xenophon describes the dis¬ 
organized soul. It is at once a counter-example of what a 
well-ordered household should be, and a portrait of those bad 
masters who, incapable of governing themselves, bring ruin to 
their estates; in the soul of the immoderate man, “harsh” 
masters (gluttony, drunkenness, lust, ambition) enslave the 
man who should be governing, and after exploiting him in his 
youth, abandon him to grow old in misery. 28 The model of 
civic life is also called on in order to define the moderate 
attitude. It is a familiar theme in Plato that desires can be 
likened to a low-born populace that will grow agitated and 
rebellious unless it is kept in check; 29 but the strict correlation 
between the individual and the city, which is the mainstay of 
Plato’s thinking in the Republic, enables him to elaborate on 
the “civic” model of moderation and its opposite, page after 
page. There, the ethics of pleasure is of the same order of 
reality as the political structure: “If the individual is like the 
city, the same structure must prevail in him”; and he will be 
self-indulgent when he lacks the power structure, the arc he, 
that would allow him to defeat, to rule over (kratein) the 
inferior powers; then “his soul must be full of servitude and 
lack freedom”; the soul’s “best parts” will be enslaved and “a 
small part, the most wicked and mad, is master.” 30 At the end 
of the next to last book of the Republic, after having set up 
the model of the city, Plato acknowledges that the philosopher 
will have little chance of encountering a state so perfect in this 
world or of serving his function within it; but he goes on to 
say that, nevertheless, the “paradigm” of the city is laid up in 
heaven for him who wants to contemplate it; looking upon it, 
the philosopher will be able to “set up the government of his 
soul” (heauton kratoikizein): “It makes no difference whether 



72 


The Use of Pleasure 


it exists anywhere or will exist. He would take part in the 
public affairs of that city only, not of any other.” 31 Individual 
virtue needed to be structured like a city. 

5 . A struggle of this kind required training. The metaphor 
of the match, of athletic competition and battle, did not serve 
merely to designate the nature of the relationship one had with 
desires and pleasures, with their force that was always liable 
to turn seditious or rebellious; it also related to the preparation 
that enabled one to withstand such a confrontation. As Plato 
says, a man will not be able to oppose or defeat them if he is 
agymnastos. 32 Exercise was no less indispensable in this order 
of things than in the case of other techniques one acquired: 
mathesis alone was not sufficient; it had to be backed up by 
a training, an askesis. This was one of the great Socratic 
lessons; it did not contradict the principle that said one could 
not willfully do wrong, knowing that it was wrong; it gave this 
knowledge a form that was not reducible to the mere aware¬ 
ness of a principle. Speaking in reference to the accusations 
brought against Socrates, Xenophon takes care to distinguish 
his teaching from that of the philosophers—or “self-styled 
lovers of wisdom”—for whom once man has learned what it 
is to be just or moderate (sophron), he can become unjust or 
dissolute. Like Socrates, Xenophon objects to this theory: if 
one does not exercise one’s body, one cannot sustain the func¬ 
tions of the body (ta tou somatos erga); similarly, if one does 
not exercise the soul, one cannot sustain the functions of the 
soul, so that one will not be able to “do what one ought to do 
nor avoid what one ought not to do.” 33 It is for this reason that 
Xenophon thinks that Socrates cannot be held accountable for 
Alcibiades’ misbehavior: the latter was not a victim of the 
teaching he received, but rather, after all his successes with 
men, women, and a whole populace made him a champion, he 
acted like many athletes: once victory was won, he thought he 
could “neglect his training” (amelein tes askeseos ). 34 

Plato returns often to this Socratic principle of askesis. He 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


73 


represents Socrates showing Alcibiades or Callicles that they 
have no right to involve themselves with the affairs of the city 
or to govern others if they have not first learned what is 
necessary and trained accordingly: “And then, when we have 
practiced it [i askesantes ] together this way, then finally, if you 
think we ought to, we’ll undertake political business.” 35 And 
he associates this requirement of practice with the need to 
attend to oneself. This epimeleia heautou, care of the self, 
which was a precondition that had to be met before one was 
qualified to attend to the affairs of others or lead them, in¬ 
cluded not only the need to know (to know the things one does 
not know, to know that one is ignorant, to know one’s own 
nature), but to attend effectively to the self, and to exercise and 
transform oneself. 36 The doctrine and practice of the Cynics 
also accorded a good deal of importance to askesis; indeed, the 
Cynic life as a whole could be seen as a sort of continuous 
exercise. Diogenes advocated training the body and the soul 
at the same time: each of the two exercises “was worthless 
without the other, good health and strength being no less 
useful than the rest, since what concerns the body concerns 
the soul as well.” The object of this twofold training was both 
to enable the individual to face privations without suffering, 
as they occurred, and to reduce every pleasure to nothing 
more than the elementary satisfaction of needs. Considered as 
a whole, this exercise implied a reduction to nature, a victory 
over self, and a natural economy that would produce a life of 
real satisfactions: “Nothing in life,” Diogenes maintained, 
“has any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice; 
and this is capable of overcoming anything [pan eknikesai ]. 

. . . Instead of useless toils men should choose such as nature 
recommends, whereby they might have lived happily. . . . For 
even the despising of pleasure is itself most pleasurable, when 
we are habituated to it; and just as those accustomed to a life 
of pleasure feel disgust when they pass over to the opposite 
experience, so those whose training has been of the opposite 
kind derive more pleasure from despising pleasure than from 



74 


The Use of Pleasure 


the pleasures themselves [hedion auton ton hedonon kataphro- 
nousi ].” 37 

The importance of exercise would not be neglected in the 
subsequent philosophical tradition. In fact it was considerably 
amplified: new exercises were added, and procedures, objec¬ 
tives, and possible variants were defined; their effectiveness 
was debated; askesis in its different forms (training, medita¬ 
tion, tests of thinking, examination of conscience, control of 
representations) eventually became a subject matter for teach¬ 
ing and constituted one of the basic instruments used in the 
direction of souls. By contrast, in the texts of the classical 
period one finds relatively few details on the concrete form 
that the ethical askesis could take. Doubtless the Pythagorean 
tradition recognized many exercises: dietary regimens, review¬ 
ing of one’s misdeeds at the end of the day, or meditation 
practices that ought to precede sleep so as to ward off bad 
dreams and encourage the visions that might come from the 
gods. Plato makes a precise reference to these evening spiritual 
preparations in a passage of the Republic in which he evokes 
the danger of desires that are always apt to invade the soul. 38 
But, apart from these Pythagorean practices, one finds few 
instances—whether in Xenophon, Plato, Diogenes, or Aris¬ 
totle—where askesis is specified as an exercise in self-control. 
There are two likely reasons for this: first, exercise was re¬ 
garded as the actual practice of what one needed to train for; 
it was not something distinct from the goal to be reached. 
Through training, one became accustomed to the behavior 
that one would eventually have to manifest.* Thus Xenophon 
praises Spartan education for teaching children to endure hun¬ 
ger by rationing their food, to endure cold by giving them only 
one garment, and to endure suffering by exposing them to 
physical punishments, just as they were taught to practice 
self-control by being made to show the strictest modesty in 

•Compare Plato in the Laws: "Whatever a man intends to become good at, this he 
must practice [meleiean] from childhood; whether he’s playing or being serious, he 
should spend his time with each of the things that pertain to the activity."”

demeanor (walking in the streets in silence, with downcast 
eyes and with hands hidden beneath their cloaks). 40 Similarly, 
Plato proposes subjecting young people to tests of courage that 
would expose them to simulated dangers; this would be a 
means of training and improving them, and a means of gaug¬ 
ing their merit at the same time: just as one leads “colts into 
noise and tumult to see if they are fearful, so we must expose 
our young to fears and pleasures to test them, much more 
thoroughly than one tests gold in fire, and see whether a 
guardian is hard to bewitch and behaves well in all circum¬ 
stances as a good guardian of himself and of the cultural 
education he has received.” 41 In the Laws, Plato goes so far 
as to imagine a drug that has not yet been invented: it would 
make everything look frightening to anyone who ingested it, 
and it could be used for trying one’s courage: either in private 
“out of a sense of shame at being seen before he was in what 
he considered good condition,” or in a group and even in 
public “in the company of many fellow drinkers,” to show 
that one was able to overcome “the power of the necessary 
transformation effected by the drink.” 42 In the same way, 
banquets could be planned and accepted as tests of self-con¬ 
trol, so to speak, based on this artificial and ideal model. 
Aristotle expresses this circularity of ethical apprenticeship 
and learnable virtue in a simple phrase: “By abstaining from 
pleasures we become temperate and it is when we have become 
so that we are most able to abstain from them.” 43 

As for the other reason that may explain the absence of a 
specific art for exercising the soul, it has to do with the fact 
that self -mastery and the mastery of others were regarded as 
having the same form; since one was expected to govern one¬ 
self in the same manner as one governed one’s household and 
played one’s role in the city, it followed that the development 
of personal virtues, of enkrateia in particular, was not essen¬ 
tially different from the development that enabled one to rise 
above other citizens to a position of leadership. The same 
apprenticeship ought to make a man both capable of virtue 



76 


The Use of Pleasure 


and capable of exercising power. Governing oneself, managing 
one’s estate, and participating in the administration of the 
city were three practices of the same type. Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus shows the continuity and isomorphism between 
these three “arts,” as well as the chronological sequence by 
which they were to be practiced in the life of an individual. 
The young Critobulus declares that he is now capable of ruling 
himself, that he will no longer allow himself to be dominated 
by his desires and pleasures (Socrates reminds him that the 
latter are like servants who are best kept under supervision); 
therefore it is time for him to marry and with the help of his 
wife to administer his household; and, as Xenophon points out 
several times, this domestic government—understood as the 
management of a household and the cultivation of a domain, 
the maintenance or development of an estate—constituted, 
when given the right amount of dedication, a remarkable 
physical and moral training for anyone who aimed to fulfill his 
civic obligations, establish his public authority, and assume 
leadership functions. Generally speaking, anything that would 
contribute to the political education of a man as a citizen 
would also contribute to his training in virtue; and conversely, 
the two endeavors went hand in hand. Moral askesis formed 
part of the paideia of the free man who had a role to play in 
the city and in dealings with others; it had no need of separate 
methods; gymnastics and endurance trials, music and the 
learning of vigorous and manly rhythms, practice in hunting 
and warfare, concern with one’s demeanor in public, acquiring 
the aidos that would lead to self-respect through the respect 
one showed for others—all this was a means of educating the 
man who would be of service to his city, and it was also moral 
training for anyone who intended to master himself. Com¬ 
menting on the tests of contrived fear that he recommends, 
Plato speaks of them as a means of identifying those boys who 
are most likely to be “the best men for themselves and for the 
city”; those will be the ones recruited to govern: “The one who 
is thus tested as a child, as a youth, and as an adult, and comes

out of it untainted [ akeratos] is to be made a ruler as well as 
a guardian.” 44 And in the Laws, when the Athenian wants to 
define what he means by paideia, he characterizes it as what 
trains “from childhood in virtue” and makes one “desire and 
love to become a perfect citizen who knows how to rule and 
be ruled with justice.” 45 

In a word, we can say that the theme of an askesis, as a 
practical training that was indispensable in order for an indi¬ 
vidual to form himself as a moral subject, was important— 
emphasized even—in classical Greek thought, especially in 
the tradition issuing from Socrates. And yet, this “ascetics” 
was not organized or conceived as a corpus of separate prac¬ 
tices that would constitute a kind of specific art of the soul, 
with its techniques, procedures, and prescriptions. It was not 
distinct from the practice of virtue itself; it was the rehearsal 
that anticipated that practice. Further, it made use of the same 
exercises as those that molded the citizen: the master of him¬ 
self and the master of others received the same training. It 
would not be long before this ascetics would begin to have an 
independent status, or at least a partial and relative autonomy. 
In two ways: there was to be a differentiation between the 
exercises that enabled one to govern oneself and the learning 
of what was necessary in order to govern others; there was also 
to be a differentiation between the exercises themselves and 
the virtue, moderation, and temperance for which they were 
meant to serve as training: their procedures (trials, examina¬ 
tions, self-control) tended to form a particular technique that 
was more complex than the mere rehearsal of the moral be¬ 
havior they anticipated. The time would come when the art 
of the self would assume its own shape, distinct from the 
ethical conduct that was its objective. But in classical Greek 
thought, the “ascetics” that enabled one to make oneself into 
an ethical subject was an integral part—down to its very form 
—of the practice of a virtuous life, which was also the life of 
a “free” man in the full, positive and political sense of the 
word.

Freedom and 
Truth 


1. “Tell me, Euthydemus, do you think that freedom is a 
noble and splendid possession both for individuals and for 
communities?” “Yes, I think it is, in the highest degree.” 
“Then do you think that the man is free who is ruled by bodily 
pleasures and is unable to do what is best because of them?” 
“By no means.” 1 

Sophrosyne was a state that could be approached through 
the exercise of self-mastery and through restraint in the prac¬ 
tice of pleasures; it was characterized as a freedom. If it was 
so important to govern desires and pleasures, if the use one 
made of them constituted such a crucial ethical problem, this 
was not because the Greeks hoped to preserve or regain an 
original innocence; nor was it in general—except of course in 
the Pythagorean tradition—because they wanted to maintain 
a purity;* it was because they wanted to be free and to be able 
to remain so. This could be regarded as further proof, if such 
were needed, that freedom in classical Greek thought was not 
considered simply as the independence of the city as a whole, 
while the citizens themselves would be only constituent ele- 

•Obviously I am not suggesting that the theme of purity was absent from the Greek 
ethics of pleasures in the classical period. It occupied a place of considerable impor¬ 
tance among the Pythagoreans, and it was very important for Plato. However, it does 
seem that on the whole, as regards desires and pleasures, ethical conduct was con¬ 
ceived as a matter of domination. The emergence and development of an ethics of 
purity, with its correlative practices of the self, was a historical phenomenon that was 
to have far-reaching consequences.

ments, devoid of individuality or interiority. The freedom that 
needed establishing and preserving was that of the citizens of 
a collectivity of course, but it was also, for each of them, a 
certain form of relationship of the individual with himself. The 
organization of the city, the nature of its laws, the forms of 
education, and the manner in which the leaders conducted 
themselves obviously were important factors for the behavior 
of citizens; but conversely, the freedom of individuals, under¬ 
stood as the mastery they were capable of exercising over 
themselves, was indispensable to the entire state. Consider this 
passage from Aristotle’s Politics: “A state is good in virtue of 
the goodness of the citizens who have a share in the govern¬ 
ment. In our state all the citizens have a share in the govern¬ 
ment. We have therefore to consider how a man can become 
a good man. True, it is possible for all to be good collectively, 
without each being good individually. But the better thing is 
that each individual citizen should be good. The goodness of 
all is necessarily involved in the goodness of each.” 2 The indi¬ 
vidual’s attitude toward himself, the way in which he ensured 
his own freedom with regard to himself, and the form of 
supremacy he maintained over himself were a contributing 
element to the well-being and good order of the city. 

This individual freedom should not, however, be under¬ 
stood as the independence of a free will. Its polar opposite was 
not a natural determinism, nor was it the will of an all-power¬ 
ful agency: it was an enslavement—the enslavement of the self 
by oneself. To be free in relation to pleasures was to be free 
of their authority; it was not to be their slave. 

Of the dangers carried by the aphrodisia, dishonor was not 
the most serious; the greatest danger was bondage to them. 
Diogenes was in the habit of saying that servants were slaves 
of their masters, and that immoral people were slaves of their 
desires (tousdephaulous tais epithumiais douleuein). 3 Socrates 
cautions Critobulus against this kind of servitude at the begin¬ 
ning of the Oeconomicus, and Euthydemus is similarly cau¬ 
tioned in a dialogue of the Memorabilia that is a hymn to 



80 


The Use of Pleasure 


self-control considered as freedom: “To do what is best ap¬ 
pears to you to be freedom, and so you think that to have 
masters who will prevent such activity is bondage.” “I am sure 
of it.” “You feel sure then that the incontinent are bond slaves. 

. . . And what sort of slavery do you believe to be the worst?” 
“Slavery to the worst masters, I think.” “The worst slavery, 
therefore, is the slavery endured by the incontinent. . . .” 
“Socrates, I think you mean that he who is at the mercy of the 
bodily pleasures has no concern whatever with virtue in any 
form.” “Yes, Euthydemus; for how can an incontinent man be 
any better than the dullest beast?” 4 

But this freedom was more than a nonenslavement, more 
than an emancipation that would make the individual inde¬ 
pendent of any exterior or interior constraint; in its full, posi¬ 
tive form, it was a power that one brought to bear on oneself 
in the power that one exercised over others. In fact, the person 
who, owing to his status, was under the authority of others 
was not expected to find the principle of his moderation within 
himself; it would be enough for him to obey the orders and 
instructions he was given. This is what Plato explains in re¬ 
gard to the craftsman: what is degrading in his case is that the 
best part of the soul “is naturally weak and cannot rule the 
animals within but pampers them and can learn nothing but 
ways to flatter them”; now, what should be done so that this 
man might be governed by a reasonable principle, “similar to 
that which rules the best man”? The only solution is to place 
him under the authority of this superior man: “he must be 
enslaved to the best man, who has a divine ruler within him¬ 
self.” 5 On the other hand, the mart who ought to lead others 
was one who had to be completely in command of himself: 
both because, given his position and the power he wielded, it 
would be easy for him to satisfy all his desires, and hence to 
give way to them, but also because disorderly behavior on his 
part would have its effects on everyone and in the collective 
life of the city. In order not to be excessive, not to do violence, 
in order to avoid the trap of tyrannical authority (over others)

coupled with a soul tyrannized by desires, the exercise of 
political power required, as its own principle of internal regu¬ 
lation, power over oneself. Moderation, understood as an 
aspect of dominion over the self, was on an equal footing 
with justice, courage, or prudence; that is, it was a virtue 
that qualified a man to exercise his mastery over others. The 
most kingly man was king of himself (basilikos, basileuon 
heautou ). 6 

Hence the importance given in the ethics of pleasures to two 
exemplary moral figures. On the one hand, there was the 
vicious tyrant; he was incapable of mastering his own passions 
and was therefore always prone to abuse his power and to do 
violence (hubrizein) to his subjects. He provoked disturbances 
in his state and caused the citizens to rebel against him. The 
sexual abuses of the despot, when he undertook to dishonor 
the citizens’ children (boys or girls), were often invoked as an 
initial justification for plots aimed at overthrowing tyrannies 
and restoring liberty: this was the case with Pisistratus at 
Athens, Periander in Ambracia, and others mentioned by 
Aristotle in Book V of the Politics . 7 Opposite the tyrant, there 
was the positive image of the leader who was capable of exer¬ 
cising a strict control over himself in the authority he exer¬ 
cised over others. His self-rule moderated his rule over others. 
A case in point is Xenophon’s Cyrus, who was in a better 
position than anyone else to abuse power, but who let it be 
known in his court that he had mastered his emotions: “He 
secured at court great correctness of conduct on the part of 
his subordinates, who gave precedence to their superiors; and 
thus he also secured from them a great degree of respect and 
politeness toward one another.” 8 Similarly, when Isocrates’ 
Nicocles praises the moderation and marital fidelity that he 
himself practices, he refers to the demands of his political 
office: how can a man expect to obtain the obedience of others 
if he is unable to subdue his own desires? 9 It is in terms of 
prudence that Aristotle advises the absolute ruler not to suc¬ 
cumb to any debauchery; he ought to take into consideration 



82 


The Use of Pleasure 


the attachment of gentlemen for their honor; for this reason, 
it would be imprudent for him to subject them to the humilia¬ 
tion of corporal punishment; for the same reason, he ought to 
refrain from “outrage of the young.” “When he indulges him¬ 
self with the young, he is doing so not in the license of power 
but because he is generally in love. In all such cases, too, he 
should atone for the dishonors which he appears to inflict by 
the gift of still greater honors.” 10 And we may recall that this 
was the question that was debated by Socrates and Callicles: 
should those who rule others be thought of as “rulers or 
ruled” (archontas e archomenous) as concerns themselves?— 
this self-rule being defined by the fact of being sophron and 
enkrates; that is, “ruling the pleasures and appetites that are 
in himself.” 11 

The day would come when the paradigm most often used 
for illustrating sexual virtue would be that of the woman, or 
girl, who defended herself from the assaults of a man who had 
every advantage over her; the safeguarding of purity and vir¬ 
ginity, and faithfulness to commitments and vows, were to 
constitute the standard test of virtue. This figure was not 
unknown in antiquity, certainly; but it does seem that, for 
Greek thought, a more representative model of the virtue of 
moderation, one more expressive of the latter’s specific nature, 
was that of the man, the leader, the master who was capable 
of curbing his own appetite even when his power over others 
allowed him to indulge it as he pleased. 

2. What was affirmed through this conception of mastery 
as active freedom was the “virile” character of moderation. 
Just as in the household it was the man who ruled, and in the 
city it was right that only men should exercise power, and not 
slaves, children, or women, so each man was supposed to 
make his manly qualities prevail within himself. Self-mastery 
was a way of being a man with respect to oneself; that is, a way 
of commanding what needed commanding, of coercing what 
was not capable of self-direction, of imposing principles of 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


83 


reason on what was wanting in reason; in short, it was a way 
of being active in relation to what was by nature passive and 
ought to remain so. In this ethics of men made for men, the 
development of the self as an ethical subject consisted in set¬ 
ting up a structure of virility that related oneself to oneself. It 
was by being a man with respect to oneself that one would be 
able to control and master the manly activity that one directed 
toward others in sexual practice. What one must aim for in the 
agonistic contest with oneself and in the struggle to control the 
desires was the point where the relationship with oneself 
would become isomorphic with the relationship of domi¬ 
nation, hierarchy, and authority that one expected, as a man, 
a free man, to establish over his inferiors; and it was this prior 
condition of “ethical virility” that provided one with the right 
sense of proportion for the exercise of “sexual virility,” ac¬ 
cording to a model of “social virility.” In the use of male 
pleasures, one had to be virile with regard to oneself, just as 
one was masculine in one’s social role. In the full meaning of 
the word, moderation was a man’s virtue. 

This does not mean of course that women were not expected 
to be moderate, that they were not capable of enkrateia, or 
that the virtue of sophrosyne was unknown to them. But where 
women were concerned, this virtue was always referred in 
some way to virility. An institutional reference, since modera¬ 
tion was imposed on them by their condition of dependence 
in relation to their families, their husbands, and their procrea¬ 
tive function, which ensured the perpetuation of the family 
name, the transmission of wealth, and the survival of the city. 
But there was also a structural reference, since in order for a 
woman to be moderate, she had to establish a relationship of 
superiority and domination over herself that was virile by 
definition. It is significant that Socrates, in Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus, after hearing Ischomachus praise the merits of 
the wife he has himself educated, declares (not without first 
invoking the goddess of austere matrimony): “By Hera, Is¬ 
chomachus, you display your wife’s masculine understanding 



84 


The Use of Pleasure 


[andrike dianoia ].” To which, in order to introduce the lesson 
in fastidious deportment he has given his wife, Ischomachus 
gives a reply that reveals the two essential elements of this 
virtuous virility of women—strength of character and depen¬ 
dence on the man: “There are other instances of her high¬ 
mindedness [megalophron ] that I am willing to relate to you, 
instances of her obeying me quickly in some matter after 
hearing it only once.” 12 

We know that Aristotle explicitly rejected the Socratic ar¬ 
gument for a basic unity of virtue, which implied that this was 
identical in men and women. And yet, he does not describe 
feminine virtues that would be exclusively feminine; those he 
attributes to women are defined with reference to one essential 
virtue, which achieves its full and complete form in men. And 
he sees the reason for this in the fact that the relation between 
men and women is “political”; it is the relation of ruler to 
ruled. For the relation to be in good order, both partners must 
have a share in the same virtues; but each will possess them 
in his own way. The one who rules—i.e., the man—“possesses 
moral goodness in its full and perfect form,” whereas the 
ruled, including women, need only have “moral goodness to 
the extent required of them.” As concerns the man, therefore, 
moderation and courage are a full and complete “ruling” 
virtue; as for the moderation or courage of the woman, they 
are “serving” virtues; in other words, the man stands both as 
a complete and finished model of these virtues and as the 
principle motivating their practice. 13 

That moderation is given an essentially masculine structure 
has another consequence, which is symmetrical and opposite 
to the one just discussed: immoderation derives from a passiv¬ 
ity that relates it to femininity. To be immoderate was to be 
in a state of nonresistance with regard to the force of pleasures, 
and in a position of weakness and submission; it meant being 
incapable of that virile stance with respect to oneself that 
enabled one to be stronger than oneself. In this sense, the man 
of pleasures and desires, the man of nonmastery (akrasia) or 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


85 


self-indulgence (akolasia) was a man who could be called 
feminine, but more essentially with respect to himself than 
with respect to others. In the experience of sexuality such as 
ours, where a basic scansion maintains an opposition between 
masculine and feminine, the femininity of men is perceived in 
the actual or virtual transgression of his sexual role. No one 
would be tempted to label as effeminate a man whose love for 
women leads to immoderation on his part; that is, short of 
doing a whole job of decipherment that would uncover the 
“latent homosexuality” that secretly inhabits his unstable and 
promiscuous relation to them. In contrast, for the Greeks it 
was the opposition between activity and passivity that was 
essential, pervading the domain of sexual behaviors and that 
of moral attitudes as well; thus, it was not hard to see how a 
man might prefer males without anyone even suspecting him 
of effeminacy, provided he was active in the sexual relation 
and active in the moral mastering of himself. On the other 
hand, a man who was not sufficiently in control of his pleas¬ 
ures—whatever his choice of object—was regarded as “femi¬ 
nine.” The dividing line between a virile man and an 
effeminate man did not coincide with our opposition between 
hetero- and homosexuality; nor was it confined to the opposi¬ 
tion between active and passive homosexuality. It marked the 
difference in people’s attitudes toward the pleasures; and the 
traditional signs of effeminacy—idleness, indolence, refusal to 
engage in the somewhat rough activities of sports, a fondness 
for perfumes and adornments, softness (malakia )—were not 
necessarily associated with the individual who in the nine¬ 
teenth century would be called an “invert,” but with the one 
who yielded to the pleasures that enticed him: he was under 
the power of his own appetites and those of others. On seeing 
a boy who was too dressed-up, Diogenes would get annoyed, 
but he allowed for the fact that such a feminine appearance 
could just as well betray a taste for women as for men. 14 In the 
eyes of the Greeks, what constituted ethical negativity par 
excellence was clearly not the loving of both sexes, nor was it 



86 


The Use of Pleasure 


the preferring of one’s own sex over the other; it consisted in 
being passive with regard to the pleasures. 

3. This freedom-power combination that characterized 
the mode of being of the moderate man could not be conceived 
without a relation to truth. To rule one’s pleasures and to 
bring them under the authority of the logos formed one and 
the same enterprise: moderation, says Aristotle, desires only 
“what the rational principle [orthos logos ] directs.” 15 We are 
familiar with the long debate that developed concerning the 
role of knowledge in the practice of virtue in general and 
moderation in particular. Xenophon, in the Memorabilia, 
calls attention to Socrates’ argument to the effect that wisdom 
and moderation cannot be separated: to those who raise the 
possibility of one’s knowing what ought to be done and yet 
proceeding to do the contrary, Socrates replies that immoder¬ 
ate individuals are always ignorant as well, for in any case men 
“choose and follow the course which they judge most advanta¬ 
geous.” 16 These principles are discussed at length by Aristotle, 
without his critique ending a debate that would continue in 
and around Stoicism. But whether or not one granted the 
possibility of doing wrong while knowing it to be wrong, and 
whatever the mode of knowledge that one assumed in those 
who acted in defiance of the principles that they knew, there 
was one point that was not contested: one could not practice 
moderation without a certain form of knowledge that was at 
least one of its essential conditions. One could not form oneself 
as an ethical subject in the use of pleasures without forming 
oneself at the same time as a subject of knowledge. 

The relationship to the logos in the practice of pleasures was 
described by Greek philosophy of the fourth century in terms 
of three principal forms. First, there was a structural form: 
moderation implied that the logos be placed in a position of 
supremacy in the human being and that it be able to subdue 
the desires and regulate behavior. Whereas in the immoderate 
individual, the force that desires usurps the highest place and 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


87 


rules tyrannically, in the individual who is sophron, it is reason 
that commands and prescribes, in consonance with the struc¬ 
ture of the human being: “it is fitting that the reasonable part 
should rule,” Socrates says, “it being wise and exercising fore¬ 
sight on behalf of the whole soul”; and he proceeds to define 
the sophron as the man in whom the different parts of the soul 
are in agreement and harmony, when the part that commands 
and the part that obeys are at one in their recognition that it 
is proper for reason to rule and that they should not contend 
for its authority. 17 And in spite of all the differences that 
opposed the Platonic tripartition of the soul and the Aris¬ 
totelian conception at the time of the Nicomachean Ethics, it 
is still in terms of the superiority of reason over desire that 
sophrosyne is characterized in that text: “in an irrational being 
the desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it tries every source 
of gratification,” so that desire will grow excessive if one is not 
“chastened and made obedient to authority”; and this author¬ 
ity is that of the logos to which “the appetitive element” (to 
epithumetikon) must submit. 18 

But the exercise of the logos in the practice of moderation 
is also described in terms of an instrumental form. In fact, 
since one’s domination of the pleasures ensures a use that is 
adaptable to needs, times, and circumstances, a practical rea¬ 
son is necessary in order to determine, as Aristotle says, “the 
things he ought, as he ought, and when he ought.” 19 Plato 
emphasizes that it is important for the individual and for the 
city not to use the pleasures “without knowledge [anepistemon- 
ds] and at the wrong time [ ektos ton kairon]." 20 And from a 
similar viewpoint, Xenophon shows that the man of modera¬ 
tion is also the man of dialectics—competent to command and 
discuss, capable of being the best—for, as Socrates explains 
in the Memorabilia, “only the self-controlled have power to 
consider things that matter most, and sorting them out after 
their kind, by word and deed alike to prefer the good and re¬ 
ject the evil.” 21 

In Plato the exercise of the logos in the practice of modera- 



88 


The Use of Pleasure 


tion appears in a third form: that of the ontological recogni¬ 
tion of the self by the self. The need to know oneself in order 
to practice virtue and subdue the desires is a Socratic theme. 
But a text like the great speech in the Phaedrus, telling of the 
voyage of souls and the birth of love, fills in the details. This 
text is doubtless the first description in ancient literature of 
what will later be known as “spiritual combat.” Here one is 
far from the impassiveness and the feats of endurance and 
abstinence of the sort that Socrates was able to display accord¬ 
ing to Alcibiades of the Symposium, for the Phaedrus presents 
a whole drama of the soul struggling with itself and against 
the violence of its desires. These different elements were des¬ 
tined to have a long career in the history of spirituality: the 
distress that takes hold of the soul, so alien that the latter 
cannot even give it a name; the anxiety that keeps the soul on 
the alert; the mysterious seething; the suffering and pleasure 
that alternate and intermix; the movement that transports 
one’s being; the struggle between opposing powers; the lapses, 
the wounds, the pains, the reward and the final appeasement. 
Now, throughout this narrative that claims to reveal the true 
nature of the human and divine soul, the relation to truth 
plays a fundamental role. When the soul is caught up in a 
frenzy of love, driven wild and deprived of self-control, it is 
indeed because it had beheld “the realities that are outside the 
heavens” and perceived their reflection in an earthly beauty; 
but it is also because its memories carry it “towards the reality 
of Beauty,” and because it “sees her again enthroned in her 
holy place attended by Chastity,” that it holds back, that it 
undertakes to restrain physical desire and seeks to rid itself of 
everything that might burden it down and prevent it from 
rediscovering the truth that it has seen. 22 The relation of the 
soul to truth is at the same time what founds Eros in its 
movement, its force, and its intensity, and what helps it to 
become detached from all physical enjoyment, enabling it to 
become true love. 

The point is obvious: be it in the form of a hierarchical

structure of the human being, in the form of a practice of 
prudence or of the soul’s recognition of its own being, the 
relation to truth constituted an essential element of modera¬ 
tion. It was necessary for the measured use of pleasures, neces¬ 
sary for controlling their violence. But it is important to note 
that this relation to truth never took the form of a decipher¬ 
ment of the self by the self, never that of a hermeneutics of 
desire. It was a factor constituting the mode of being of the 
moderate subject; it was not equivalent to an obligation for the 
subject to speak truthfully concerning himself; it never opened 
up the soul as a domain of potential knowledge where barely 
discernible traces of desire needed to be read and interpreted. 
The relation to truth was a structural, instrumental, and onto¬ 
logical condition for establishing the individual as a moderate 
subject leading a life of moderation; it was not an epistemolog¬ 
ical condition enabling the individual to recognize himself in 
his singularity as a desiring subject and to purify himself of the 
desire that was thus brought to light. 

4. Now, while this relation to truth, constitutive of the 
moderate subject, did not lead to a hermeneutics of desire, it 
did on the other hand open onto an aesthetics of existence. 
And what I mean by this is a way of life whose moral value 
did not depend either on one’s being in conformity with a code 
of behavior, or on an effort of purification, but on certain 
formal principles in the use of pleasures, in the way one dis¬ 
tributed them, in the limits one observed, in the hierarchy one 
respected. Through the logos, through reason and the relation 
to truth that governed it, such a life was committed to the 
maintenance and reproduction of an ontological order; more¬ 
over, it took on the brilliance of a beauty that was revealed to 
those able to behold it or keep its memory present in mind. 
Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle often provide glimpses of this 
moderate existence whose hallmark, grounded in truth, was 
both its regard for an ontological structure and its visibly 
beautiful shape. For example, this is the way Socrates de-

scribes it in the Gorgias, supplying his own answers to the 
questions he puts to a silent Callicles: “The virtue of each 
thing, a tool, a body, and, further, a soul and a whole animal, 
doesn’t come to be present in the best way just at random, but 
by some structure and correctness and craft [taxis, orthotes, 
techne ], the one that is assigned to each of them. Is this so? 
I say so. Then the virtue of each thing is something structured 
and ordered by a structure? I would say so myself. Then it is 
some order [kosmos tis] —the proper order for each of the 
things that are—which makes the thing good by coming to be 
present in it? I myself think so. Then a soul with its proper 
order is better than a disordered soul? It must be. But now the 
soul which has order is orderly? Of course it is. And the 
orderly soul is temperate? It certainly must be. Then the tem¬ 
perate soul is good. . . . And so I set these things down this 
way, and say that these things are true. And if they are true, 
then apparently the man who wants to be happy must pursue 
and practice temperance [diokteon kai asketeon]." 2i 

As if echoing this text that links moderation with the beauty 
of a soul whose order corresponds to its real nature, the Re¬ 
public will show, conversely, how the brilliance of a soul and 
that of a body are incompatible with the excess and violence 
of the pleasures: “When a man’s soul has a beautiful character 
[kala ethe ], and his body matches it in beauty and is thus in 
harmony with it, that harmonizing combination, sharing the 
same mould, is the most beautiful spectacle for anyone who 
has eyes to see.” “It certainly is.” “And that which is most 
beautiful is most lovable [< erasmiotaton ].” “Of course. . . .” 
“Tell me this, however, is excessive pleasure compatible with 
moderation?” “How can it be since it drives one to frenzy?” 
“Or with the other virtues?” “In no way.” “Well then, is it 
compatible with violence and lack of restraint [hubris, 
akolasia]T' “Very much so.” “Can you think of a greater and 
sharper pleasure than the sexual?” “No, nor a madder one.” 
“But the right kind of love [ho orthos eros ] is to love a well- 
behaved and beautiful person with moderation and restraint?” 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures 


91 


“Certainly.” “The right kind of love has nothing frenzied or 
licentious about it?” “Nothing.” 24 

We may also recall Xenophon’s idealized description of 
Cyrus’ court, which presented a vision of beauty for its own 
enjoyment, due to the perfect dominion that each individual 
exercised over himself; the ruler publicly exhibited a mastery 
and a restraint that spread to everyone, issuing out from them, 
according to the rank they held, in the form of a moderate 
conduct, a respect for oneself and for others, a caref ul supervi¬ 
sion of the soul and the body, and a frugal economy of acts, 
so that no involuntary and violent movement disturbed the 
beautiful order that seemed to be present in everyone’s mind: 
“Among them you would never have detected any one raising 
his voice in anger or giving vent to his delight in boisterous 
laughter; but on seeing them you would have judged that they 
were in truth making a noble life their aim. ” 25 The individual 
fulfilled himself as an ethical subject by shaping a precisely 
measured conduct that was plainly visible to all and deserving 
to be long remembered. 

The foregoing is only a rough sketch for preliminary pur¬ 
poses; a few general traits that characterized the way in which, 
in classical Greek thought, sexual practice was conceptualized 
and made into an ethical domain. The elements of this domain 
—the “ethical substance”—were formed by the aphrodisia; 
that is, by acts intended by nature, associated by nature with 
an intense pleasure, and naturally motivated by a force that 
was always liable to excess and rebellion. The principle ac¬ 
cording to which this activity was meant to be regulated, the 
“mode of subjection,” was not defined by a universal legisla¬ 
tion determining permitted and forbidden acts; but rather by 
a savoir-faire, an art that prescribed the modalities of a use 
that depended on different variables (need, time, status). The 
effort that the individual was urged to bring to bear on himself, 
the necessary ascesis, had the form of a battle to be fought, a 
victory to be won in establishing a dominion of self over self,

modeled after domestic or political authority. Finally, the 
mode of being to which this self-mastery gave access was 
characterized as an active freedom, a freedom that was indis- 
sociable from a structural, instrumental, and ontological rela¬ 
tion to truth. 

As we shall see, this moral reflection developed themes of 
austerity—concerning the body, marriage, and love of boys— 
that show a resemblance to the precepts and interdictions that 
were to appear later on. But we must not let this apparent 
continuity obscure the fact that the ethical subject would no 
longer be constituted in the same manner. In the Christian 
morality of sexual behavior, the ethical substance was to be 
defined not by the aphrodisia, but by a domain of desires that lie 
hidden among the mysteries of the heart, and by a set of acts 
that are carefully specified as to their form and their conditions. 
Subjection was to take the form not of a savoir-faire, but of a 
recognition of the law and an obedience to pastoral authority. 
Hence the ethical subject was to be characterized not so much 
by the perf ect rule of the self by the self in the exercise of a virile 
type of activity, as by self-renunciation and a purity whose 
model was to be sought in virginity. This being the case, one can 
understand the significance that was attached, in Christian 
morality, to two opposite yet complementary practices: a 
codification of sexual acts that would become more and more 
specific, and the development of a hermeneutics of desire to¬ 
gether with procedures of self-decipherment. 

Putting it schematically, we could say that classical antiq¬ 
uity’s moral reflection concerning the pleasures was not di¬ 
rected toward a codification of acts, nor toward a hermeneutics 
of the subject, but toward a stylization of attitudes and an 
aesthetics of existence. A stylization, because the rarefaction of 
sexual activity presented itself as a sort of open-ended require¬ 
ment. The textual record is clear in this regard: neither the 
doctors who made recommendations about the regimen one 
should follow, nor the moralists who demanded that husbands 
respect their wives, nor those who gave advice concerning the 
right conduct to manifest in the love of boys, ever say exactly 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

what ought or ought not to be done in the way of sexual acts or 
practices. And it is very unlikely that this was owing to the 
authors’ reticence or sense of shame; rather, it was because the 
problem was elsewhere: sexual moderation was an exercise of 
freedom that took form in self-mastery; and the latter was 
shown in the manner in which the subject behaved, in the 
self-restraint he displayed in his virile activity, in the way he 
related to himself in the relationship he had with others. It was 
this attitude—much more than the acts one committed or the 
desires one concealed—that made one liable to value judg¬ 
ments. A moral value that was also an aesthetic value and a 
truth value since it was by aiming at the satisfaction of real 
needs, by respecting the true hierarchy of the human being, and 
by never forgetting where one stood in regard to truth, that one 
would be able to give one’s conduct the form that would assure 
one of a name meriting remembrance. 

Now we will see how some of the great themes of sexual 
austerity—themes that would have a historical destiny ex¬ 
tending well beyond Greek culture—were formed and elabo¬ 
rated in the thought of the fourth century. I will not start from 
the general theories of pleasure and virtue; rather, I will take 
as my source material the existing and recognized practices by 
which men sought to shape their conduct: their dietary prac¬ 
tice, their practice of domestic government, their courtship 
practice as expressed in amorous behavior. I will try to show 
how these three practices were conceptualized in medicine or 
philosophy and how these reflections resulted in various 
recommendations, not for codifying sexual conduct in a pre¬ 
cise way, but for “stylizing” it: stylizations within dietetics, 
understood as an art of the everyday relationship of the indi¬ 
vidual with his body; in economics as an art of a man’s behav¬ 
ior as head of a family; and in erotics as an art of the reciprocal 
conduct of a man and a boy in a love relationship.* 

•Henri Joly’s work Le Renversement platonicien offers an example of how Greek 
thought can be analyzed from the standpoint of the relationships that existed between 
the field of practices and philosophical reflection. 




PART TWO 

Dietetics 





The moral reflection of the Greeks on sexual behavior did 
not seek to justify interdictions, but to stylize a freedom—that 
freedom which the “free” man exercised in his activity. This 
produced a state of affairs that might well seem paradoxical 
at first glance: the Greeks practiced, accepted, and valued 
relations between men and boys; and yet their philosophers 
dealt with the subject by conceiving and elaborating an ethics 
of abstention. They were quite willing to grant that a married 
man might go in search of sexual pleasures outside of mar¬ 
riage, and yet their moralists conceived the principle of a 
matrimonial life in which the husband would have relations 
only with his own wife. They never imagined that sexual 
pleasure was in itself an evil or that it could be counted among 
the natural stigmata of a transgression; and yet their doctors 
worried over the relationship between sexual activity and 
health, and they developed an entire theory concerning the 
dangers of sexual practice. 

Let us begin by considering this last point. First of all, it 
should be noted that f or the most part their reflection was not 
concerned with analyzing the different pathological effects of 
sexual activity; nor did they seek to organize this behavior as 
a domain in which normal behavior might be distinguished 
from abnormal and pathological practices. These themes were 
not totally absent of course. But this was not what constituted 
the general theme of the inquiry into the relationships between 
the aphrodisia, health, life, and death. The main objective of 
this reflection was to define the use of pleasures—which condi¬ 
tions were favorable, which practice was recommended, 
which rarefaction was necessary—in terms of a certain way of 
caring for one’s body. The preoccupation was much more 


97

The Use of Pleasure 


“dietetic” than “therapeutic”: a matter of regimen aimed 
at regulating an activity that was recognized as being impor¬ 
tant for health. The medical problematization of sexual be¬ 
havior was accomplished less out of a concern for eliminating 
pathological forms than out of a desire to integrate it as 
fully as possible into the management of health and the 
life of the body.

Regimen in 
General 


In order to appreciate the importance the Greeks ascribed 
to regimen, and to understand the general interpretation they 
gave to “dietetics” and the way in which they linked its prac¬ 
tice to medicine, we can refer to two origin stories: one is 
found in the Hippocratic collection, the other in Plato. 

The author of the treatise on Ancient Medicine, far from 
considering regimen as an adjacent practice associated with 
the medical art—one of its applications or extensions—attrib¬ 
utes the birth of medicine to a primordial and essential preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen. 1 According to him, mankind set itself 
apart from animal life by means of sort of dietary disjunction. 
In the beginning, the story goes, men did eat the same kind 
of food as animals: meat and raw plants. This type of nourish¬ 
ment was apt to toughen the most vigorous individuals, but 
it was hard on the weaker ones; in a word, people died young 
or old. Consequently, men sought a diet that was better suited 
“to their nature”: it was this regimen that still characterized 
the present way of life. But with this milder diet, illness had 
become less immediately fatal, and it was realized that the 
food healthy people ate was not suited to people who were ill: 
they needed other nourishment. Medicine thus came into 
being as an appropriate “diet” for the sick, emerging from a 
search for the specific regimen for their condition. In this tale 
of genesis, it is dietetics that appears to be initial; it gives rise 
to medicine as one of its particular applications. 


99

The Use of Pleasure 


Plato—being rather suspicious of dietetic practice, or at 
least fearful of the excesses he associates with it, for political 
and ethical reasons we shall consider below—thinks, on the 
contrary, that the concern with regimen was born of a change 
in medical practices: 2 in the beginning, the god Asclepius 
taught men how to cure illnesses and heal wounds by means 
of drastic and effective remedies. According to Plato, Homer 
provides evidence of this practice of simple treatments in the 
account he gives of the cures of Menelaus and Eurypylus 
beneath the walls of Troy: the blood of the wounded was 
sucked, emollients were poured over their wounds, and they 
were made to drink wine sprinkled with barley meal and 
grated cheese.* It was later, when men had forsaken the 
rough, healthy life of former times, that one would attempt to 
follow illnesses “step by step” and, by means of a protracted 
regimen, to sustain those who were in bad health precisely 
because, no longer living as they should, they were victims of 
lasting sicknesses. According to this genesis, dietetics came 
into existence as a kind of medicine for soft times; it was 
designed for mismanaged lives that sought to prolong them¬ 
selves. But it is clear that if, for Plato, dietetics was not an 
original art, this was not because regimen (diaite) was unim¬ 
portant; the reason people did not concern themselves with 
dietetics in the time of Asclepius or his first successors was 
that the “regimen” that men actually followed, the manner in 
which they nourished themselves and exercised their bodies, 
was in accord with nature. 4 Viewed from this perspective, 
dietetics did represent one modality in medicine, but it did not 
become an extension of the art of healing until the day when 
regimen as a way of life became separated from nature; and 
while it always constituted a necessary accompaniment of 
medicine, this was simply because one could not treat a person 
without rectifying the lifestyle that made him sick in the first 
place. 5 

’Actually the details given by Plato are not exactly those that one finds in the 
Iliad. >

In any case, whether dietetic knowledge was considered an 
original art or seen as a later derivation, it is clear that “diet” 
itself—regimen—was a fundamental category through which 
human behavior could be conceptualized. It characterized the 
way in which one managed one’s existence, and it enabled a 
set of rules to be affixed to conduct; it was a mode of prob- 
lematization of behavior that was indexed to a nature which 
had to be preserved and to which it was right to conform. 
Regimen was a whole art of living. 

1. The area that a properly designed regimen ought to 
cover was defined by a list that became almost conventional 
as time went on. It is the list found in Book VI of the Epidem¬ 
ics; it included “exercises \ponoi\ foods [sitia], drinks \pota ], 
sleep [hypnoi], and sexual relations [aphrodisia ]"—everything 
that needed to be “measured.” 6 Among the exercises, those 
that were natural (walking, strolling) were distinguished from 
those that were violent (foot races, wrestling); and it was 
determined which ones ought to be practiced and with what 
intensity, depending on the time of day, the season of the year, 
the age of the subject, the food he had consumed. Exercises 
might be combined with baths—hot or cold, and also depend¬ 
ing on season, age, activities, and meals already eaten or to be 
prepared. The alimentary regimen—food and drink—had to 
take into consideration the nature and quantity of what one 
ingested, the general condition of the body, the climate, and 
the activities one engaged in. Evacuations—purges and vomit¬ 
ing—served to correct alimentary practice and its excesses. 
Sleep, too, comprised different components, which could be 
made to vary according to the regimen: the time allotted to it, 
the hours one chose, the quality of the bed, its hardness, its 
warmth. Hence regimen had to take account of numerous 
elements in the physical life of a man, or at least that of a free 
man, and this meant day by day, all day long, from getting up 
in the morning to going to bed at night. When broken down 
into its component parts, regimen looks like a real daily rou-

tine: thus the regimen suggested by Diodes follows the course 
of an ordinary day, moment by moment, from waking up on 
through to the evening meal and the onset of sleep, with 
attention given along the way to the very first exercises, the 
ablutions and massagings of the body and the head, the walks, 
the private activities and the gymnasium, lunch, napping, and 
another round of walking and gymnasium activities, oiling 
and massage, dinner. At all times, and encompassing all of a 
man’s activities, regimen problematized the relation to the 
body and developed a way of living whose forms, options, and 
variables were determined by a concern with the body. But the 
body was not the only thing in question. 

2. In the different areas where it was required, regimen 
needed to establish a measure: “even a pig would know,” says 
one of the interlocutors in the Platonic dialogue The Lovers: 
“in everything connected with the body,” what is useful is 
“the right measure,” and not what is large or small in quan¬ 
tity. 7 Now, this measure is to be understood as referring not 
only to the corporal realm but to the moral realm as well. The 
Pythagoreans, who doubtless played an important part in the 
development of dietetics, strongly emphasized the correlation 
between the care given the body and the concern for preserv¬ 
ing the purity and harmony of the soul. While it is true that 
they expected medicine to purge the body and music to cleanse 
the soul, they also credited song and instruments with benefi¬ 
cial effects on the equilibrium of the organism. 8 The many 
alimentary taboos they set for themselves had cultural and 
religious significance; and the criticism they directed against 
every abuse connected with eating, drinking, exercises, and 
sexual activities had both the authority of a moral precept and 
the utility of sound advice for health.* 

*“For bodily ailments, he had curative tunes which he sang that got sick people on 
their feet again. Others made one forget pain, calmed fits of anger, drove out immod¬ 
erate desires. Now for his diet: for lunch honey, for dinner a biscuit and vegetables, 
meat infrequently. ... In this way his body kept the same condition, as if on a straight 
line, without being sometimes healthy, sometimes sick, and without growing heavier 



Dietetics 


103 


Even outside the strictly Pythagorean context, regimen was 
regularly defined with reference to these two associated di¬ 
mensions of good health maintenance and proper care of the 
soul. This was because the one implied the other, but also 
because the resolve to follow a measured and reasonable regi¬ 
men and the diligence one manifested in the actual task were 
themselves evidence of an indispensable moral fortitude. 
Xenophon’s Socrates calls attention to this correlation when 
he advises young people to exercise their bodies regularly by 
practicing gymnastics. He sees this as a means of ensuring that 
they will be able to defend themselves better in warfare, to 
avoid earning a coward’s reputation as a soldier, to best serve 
their native land, and to obtain high rewards (and hence to 
bequeath wealth and status to their descendants). He believes 
the practice will provide protection against illnesses and infir¬ 
mities of the body; but he also points up the good effects of 
gymnastics that accrue, he says, where one would least expect 
to see them: in the mind, for an unhealthy body causes forget¬ 
fulness, loss of courage, bad temper, and madness, so that in 
the end the knowledge one has acquired may even be dis¬ 
lodged from the soul. 10 

But it was also the case that the severity of a physical 
regimen, with the determination that was required in order to 
keep to it, called for an essential moral firmness, which made 
its observance possible. Moreover, as Plato saw it, this was the 
real justification for these practices by which one sought to 
acquire strength, beauty, and physical health. Not only will 
the judicious man, says Socrates in Book IX of the Republic, 
“not abandon his body to the irrational pleasure of the beast”; 
not only will he not “turn himself that way”; he will do more: 
“It is not even health he aims at, nor does he consider it 
important that he should be strong, healthy, or beautiful, 
unless he acquires moderation as a result.” The physical regi- 

and stouter, then thinner and leaner; and by his expression, his soul always showed 
the same character [to homoion ethos].” It seems that Pythagoras also gave advice 
on regimen to athletes.’ 



104 


The Use of Pleasure 


men ought to accord with the principle of a general aesthetics 
of existence in which the equilibrium of the body was one of 
the conditions of the proper hierarchy of the soul: “He will 
cultivate harmony in his body for the sake of consonance in 
his soul”—which will enable him to conduct himself like a 
true musician (mousikos). 11 Physical regimen must not, there¬ 
fore, be too intensely cultivated for its own sake. 

The possibility of a danger in the very practice of “diet” was 
readily acknowledged. For if the aim of regimen was to pre¬ 
vent excesses, one might exaggerate the importance one lent 
to it and the autonomy one permitted it to assume. This risk 
was generally perceived as having two forms. There was the 
danger of what might be called “athletic” excess; this was due 
to repeated workouts that overdeveloped the body and ended 
by making the soul sluggish, enveloped as it was within a 
too-powerful musculature; on several occasions Plato finds 
fault with this athletic forcing, declaring that he would want 
nothing of the sort for the young people of his city.* 

But there was also the danger of what could be called 
“valetudinary” excess; that is, the constant vigilance that one 
applied to one’s body, one’s health, to the least ailment. The 
best example of this excess was furnished, according to Plato, 
by an individual held to be one of the founders of dietetics, 
Herodicus the trainer; entirely taken up in the effort to avoid 
breaking the least rule of the regimen he had imposed on 
himself, he “trained” away for years, while living the life of 
a dying man. This attitude drew two reproaches from Plato. 
It was characteristic of idle men who were of no use to the city; 
there was a telling comparison that could be made with those 
serious craftsmen who would not stop to swathe their heads 
on account of a migraine, for they had no time to lose in petty 
medical treatments. But it was also characteristic of those 
who, in order to keep from losing their hold on life, tried their 

•Aristotle also criticizes the excesses of the athletic regimen and of certain kinds of 
training . 12 



Dietetics

utmost to delay the term that had been appointed by nature. 
The practice carried the danger—moral but political as well 
—of exaggerating one’s care of the body (peritte epimeleia tou 
somatos ). 13 Asclepius, whose treatment was confined to po¬ 
tions and surgery, was politically astute: he knew that in a 
well-governed state, no one had the leisure to spend his life 
being sick and having himself treated* 

3. The distrust of excessive regimens shows that the pur¬ 
pose of diet was not to extend life as far as possible in time nor as 
high as possible in performance, but rather to make it useful 
and happy within the limits that had been set for it. Nor was 
diet supposed to determine the conditions of existence once and 
for all. A regimen was not good if it only permitted one to live in 
one place, with one type of food, and if it did not allow one to be 
open to any change. The usefulness of a regimen lay precisely in 
the possibility it gave individuals to face different situations. It 
is in these terms that Plato contrasts the regimen of athletes, 
which is so strict that they cannot depart from it without 
becoming “seriously and violently ill,” with the regimen he 
would like to see adopted for his warriors. They need to be like 
dogs always on the alert; in their campaigns they will “endure 
frequent changes of drinking water and food, of summer and 
winter weather” and still maintain an “unvarying health.” 15 
Plato’s warriors would have special responsibilities no doubt. 
But more general regimens also obeyed this same principle. 
The author of the Regimen in the Hippocratic collection is 
careful to emphasize that his advice is not addressed to a 
privileged minority of idle individuals, but to the great majority 
of people, to “those who work, those who travel, go on sea 
voyages, expose themselves to sun and cold.” 16 This passage 
has sometimes been interpreted as indicating a particular inter¬ 
est in the forms of active and professional life. The thing to 

•In the Timaeus, Plato asserts that the life span of every living creature is determined 
by fate.'* 



106 


The Use of Pleasure 


note, however, is the concern it shows—one that was shared by 
ethics and medicine—with preparing the individual for a mul¬ 
titude of possible circumstances. One could not and one should 
not expect regimen to circumvent fate or to alter nature. What 
could be expected of it was that it would enable one to react, 
with some degree of readiness, to unforeseen events as they 
occurred. Dietetics was a strategic art in the sense that it ought 
to permit one to respond to circumstances in a reasonable, 
hence usef ul, manner. 

In the vigilance it brought to bear on the body and its 
activities, dietetics necessitated two quite particular forms of 
attention on the part of the individual. It required what might 
be called a “serial” attention; that is, an attention to se¬ 
quences: activities were not simply good or bad in themselves; 
their value was determined in part by those that preceded 
them or those that followed, and the same thing (a certain 
food, a type of exercise, a hot or cold bath) would be recom¬ 
mended or advised against according to whether one had 
engaged in or was about to engage in such or such other 
activity (the practices that followed one after the other ought 
to counterbalance one another in their effects, but the contrast 
between them must not be too extreme). The practice of regi¬ 
men also implied a “circumstantial” vigilance, a sharply 
focused yet wide-ranging attention that must be directed to¬ 
ward the external world, its elements, its sensations: the cli¬ 
mate of course, the seasons, the hours of the day, the degree 
of humidity and dryness, of heat or cold, the winds, the char¬ 
acteristic features of a region, the layout of a city. And the 
relatively detailed instructions that are given by the Hippo¬ 
cratic regimen were meant to help the individual who familiar¬ 
ized himself with them to modulate his way of living 
according to all these variables. Regimen should not be under¬ 
stood as a corpus of universal and uniform rules; it was more 
in the nature of a manual for reacting to situations in which 
one might find oneself, a treatise for adjusting one’s behavior 
to fit the circumstances.

4. Lastly, dietetics was a technique of existence in the 
sense that it was not content to transmit the advice of a doctor 
to an individual, who would then be expected to apply it 
passively. Without going into the history of the dispute be¬ 
tween medicine and gymnastics over the issue of their respec¬ 
tive competence to determine the proper regimen, we must 
keep in mind that diet was not thought of as an unquestioning 
obedience to the authority of another; it was intended to be a 
deliberate practice on the part of an individual, involving 
himself and his body. In order to follow the right regimen, it 
was of course necessary to listen to those who knew, but this 
relationship was supposed to take the form of persuasion. If 
it was to be reasonable, properly adjusting itself to time and 
circumstances, the diet of the body had also to be a matter of 
thought, deliberation, and prudence. Whereas medications 
and operations acted upon the body, and the body submitted 
to that action, regimen addressed itself to the soul, and incul¬ 
cated principles in the soul. Thus, in the Laws, Plato distin¬ 
guishes between two kinds of doctors: those who are good for 
slaves (they are usually slaves themselves) and who confine 
themselves to giving prescriptions without offering any expla¬ 
nation; and the freeborn doctors who attend to free men. 17 Not 
contenting themselves with prescriptions, they enter into con¬ 
versation with the patient and gather information from him 
and his friends; they instruct him, exhort him, and persuade 
him with arguments that, once he is convinced, are likely to 
cause him to lead the right kind of life. From the expert 
doctor, the free man could expect more than the means for a 
cure in the strict sense of the term; he ought to receive a 
rational framework for the whole of his existence.* A brief 
passage in the Memorabilia shows a clear perception of regi¬ 
men as a concrete and active practice of the relation to self. 

•See Plato’s Timaeus, where the author sums up what he has just said concerning 
regimen as follows: “Let this suffice for the treatment of the living creature as a whole 
and of its bodily part, and the way in which a man may best lead a rational life, both 
governing and being governed by himself.""

The Use of Pleasure 


In this text, one sees Socrates absorbed in the effort to make 
his disciples “independent,” irrespective of their social posi¬ 
tion. To this end he urges them to learn (either from him or 
from another teacher) whatever a gentleman should know, 
within the fixed limits of what is useful, and nothing beyond 
that: they should learn the essentials in the fields of geometry, 
astronomy, and arithmetic. But he also recommends that they 
“take care of their health.” And this “care,” which should be 
supported by accepted knowledge, should also develop into a 
vigilant attentiveness to themselves: self-observation, accom¬ 
panied—significantly—by taking notes: “Everyone should 
watch himself throughout his life, and notice what sort of 
meat and drink and what form of exercise suit his constitution, 
and how he should regulate them in order to enjoy good 
health.” To become an art of existence, good management of 
the body ought to include a setting down in writing carried out 
by the subject concerning himself; with the help of this note¬ 
taking, the individual would be able to gain his independence 
and choose judiciously between what was good and bad for 
him: “For by such attention to yourselves you can discover 
better than any doctor what suits your constitution.” 19 

In short, the practice of regimen as an art of living was 
something more than a set of precautions designed to prevent 
illnesses or complete their cure. It was a whole manner of 
forming oneself as a subject who had the proper, necessary, 
and sufficient concern for his body. A concern that permeated 
everyday life, making the major or common activities of exis¬ 
tence a matter both of health and of ethics. It defined a circum¬ 
stantial strategy involving the body and the elements that 
surrounded it; and finally, it proposed to equip the individual 
himself for a rational mode of behavior. What place was it 
agreed that the aphrodisia should have in this reasonable and 
natural management of life?

The Diet of 
Pleasures 


Two treatises of dietetics have come down to us. Both be¬ 
long to the Hippocratic collection. The older of the two, also 
the shorter, is the Peri diaites hygiaines (A Regimen for 
Health); it was long regarded as constituting the last part of 
the treatise The Nature of Man. 1 The other, the Peri diaites, 
is also the more developed. In addition, Oribasius included in 
his Medical Collection a text on hygiene by Diodes, which 
gives a meticulously detailed set of rules for everyday life. 2 
And lastly, this same Diodes, who lived at the end of the 
fourth century, has been credited with a very brief text that 
was collected in the works of Paul of Aegina; in this text, the 
author tells how to recognize the first signs of illness in oneself 
and offers a few general rules of seasonal regimen. 3 

Whereas A Regimen for Health does not say a word on the 
subject of the aphrodisia, the Peri diaites includes a series of 
recommendations and prescriptions relating to the question. 
The first part of the work is presented as a reflection on the 
general principles that should determine the organization of 
the regimen. The author acknowledges that some of his many 
predecessors have managed to give good advice on various 
particular points; however, none of them was able to present 
an adequate treatment of the subject matter they proposed to 
discuss, the reason being that in order to “treat correctly 
concerning human diet,” it is necessary to “acquire knowledge 
and discernment” of human nature in general, of man’s origi- 

109 



110 


The Use of Pleasure 


nal constitution (he ex arches systasis), and of the principle 
that ought to have control within the body (to epicrateon en 
toi somati). 4 The author considers the two fundamental ele¬ 
ments of regimen to be alimentation and exercise; the latter 
causes expenditures that food and drink serve to compensate. 

The second part of the text discusses the practice of dietetics 
from the standpoint of the properties and effects of the ele¬ 
ments that go into the regimen. After some remarks on places 
—high or low, dry or wet, exposed to such and such a wind 
—the author undertakes a review of foods (barley or wheat, 
considered in terms of the fineness of grinding, the time at 
which the dough was kneaded, the quantity of water that was 
mixed with the flour; meats, differentiated in terms of their 
varied origins; fruits and vegetables, evaluated according to 
their different varieties), then baths (hot, cold, taken before or 
after meals), vomitings, sleep, natural exercises (like those of 
hearing, voice, thought, or walking) and violent exercises 
(such as running, arm motions, wrestling, and punchball, per¬ 
formed in the dust or with an oiled body). In this enumeration 
of the elements of regimen, sexual activity (lagneie) is barely 
mentioned—between baths and oilings on one side, and vomit¬ 
ings on the other—and such mention as it does get is only 
owing to its three effects. Two of these are qualitative: a warm¬ 
ing due to the violence of the exercise (ponos), and to the 
elimination of a humid element; but also a moistening because 
the exercise has caused some of the flesh-parts to melt. A third 
effect is quantitative: the evacuation causes weight loss. “Sex¬ 
ual intercourse reduces, moistens, and warms. It warms owing 
to the fatigue and the excretion of moisture; it reduces owing 
to the evacuation; it moistens because of the-remnant in the 
body of matters melted by the fatigue.” 5 

On the other hand, in the third part of this Regimen, one 
does find a certain number of prescriptions concerning the 
aphrodisia. In its first pages, this part resembles a sort of great 
calendar of health, a permanent almanac of the seasons and 
the regimens appropriate to them. But the author notes that 



Dietetics 


111 


it is not possible to give a general formula for determining the 
correct balance between exercises and foods. He stresses the 
need to take account of the differences among things, individu¬ 
als, places, and times; 6 the almanac is thus not to be read as 
a set of imperative recipes but as strategic principles that one 
must know how to adapt to circumstances. In short, whereas 
the second part of the text dealt more with the elements of 
regimen in themselves, with a view to their intrinsic properties 
(and the aphrodisia are mentioned only in passing), the third 
part, in its beginning, is especially concerned with situational 
variables. 

The year is divided into four seasons, of course. But these 
in turn are subdivided into shorter periods of a few weeks or 
even a few days. This is because the peculiar characteristics of 
each season often develop in stages; and further, it is always 
risky to alter one’s regimen abruptly; like excesses, sudden 
changes have harmful consequences—“ ‘Little by little’ [to 
kata mikron] is a safe rule, especially in cases of change from 
one thing to another.” Which means that “in each season the 
various items of regimen should be changed gradually [kata 
mikron]." 1 Thus, the winter regimen should be subdivided as 
the season itself demands, into a period of forty-four days that 
extend from the setting of the Pleiades to the solstice, then into 
an exactly equivalent period followed by a relaxation of the 
regimen. Spring begins with a period of thirty-two days, from 
the rising of Arcturus and the arrival of the swallows to the 
equinox; within this time span, the season should be divided 
into six periods of eight days. Then comes the summer season, 
which comprises two phases: from the rising of the Pleiades 
to the solstice, and from the solstice to the equinox. From that 
time to the setting of the Pleiades, one should spend forty- 
eight hours preparing for the “winter regimen.” 

The author does not provide a complete regimen for these 
small subdivisions. Rather, he defines, more or less in detail, 
an overall strategy that depends on the qualities that are char¬ 
acteristic of each of these times of the year. This strategy is 



112 


The Use of Pleasure 


based on a principle of compensation, if not opposition or 
resistance: the cold of one season should be counterbalanced 
by a warming regimen lest the body become chilled; inversely, 
extreme heat calls for a soothing, cooling regimen. But it 
should also obey the principle of imitation and conformity: a 
mild season that progresses gradually needs a mild and gradu¬ 
ated regimen; in the period when plants prepare for their 
growth, humans should do likewise, preparing to develop their 
bodies; similarly, just as trees harden and brace themselves 
against the harsh days of winter, men should toughen them¬ 
selves by not fleeing the cold but by exposing themselves to it 
“courageously.” 8 

This is the general context in which the aphrodisia are to 
be regulated, taking account of the effects they may have on 
the interaction of heat and cold, of dryness and moisture, 
according to the general notions that one finds in the second 
part of the text. Recommendations concerning them are 
placed for the most part between alimentary prescriptions and 
advice on exercises and evacuations. Winter, from the setting 
of the Pleiades to the spring equinox, is a season in which 
regimen should have a drying and warming effect, considering 
the coldness and wetness of the season: hence, roasted rather 
than boiled meats, whole-wheat bread, small portions of dry 
vegetables, slightly diluted wine, but in small amounts; nu¬ 
merous exercises of every sort (running, wrestling, walking); 
baths that should be cold after running workouts, which al¬ 
ways heat up the body, and hot after all the other exercises; 
more frequent sexual relations, especially for older men whose 
bodies tend to become chilled; emetics three times per month 
for those with moist constitutions, two times per month for 
those who are dry. 9 During the spring period, when the air is 
warmer and dryer, and when one must prepare for the growth 
of the body, one should eat as many boiled meats as roasted, 
together with moist vegetables; take baths; decrease the quan¬ 
tity of sexual relations and emetics; vomit only two times per 
month, then even less frequently, so that the body will main- 



Dietetics 


113 


tain “a pure flesh.” After the rising of the Pleiades, with the 
coming of summer, dryness is what regimen must fight 
against: drink light wines, white and diluted; eat barley cakes, 
boiled or raw vegetables, if they can be eaten without over¬ 
heating the body; abstain from emetics and reduce sexual 
activity to a minimum (toisi de aphrodisioisin hos hekista); 
exercise less; avoid running, which dessicates the body, as well 
as walking in the sun, giving preference instead to wrestling 
in the dust. 10 As one gets nearer to the rising of Arcturus and 
the autumn equinox, the regimen must be made milder and 
more moist; nothing specific is said about sexual regimen. 

Diodes’ Regimen is much less developed than that of Hip¬ 
pocrates. However, it is quite detailed in its treatment of daily 
routine, which takes up a large part of the text: from the 
massages that should immediately follow getting up from bed, 
in order to reduce the stiffness of the body, to the positions to 
take in bed when it is time to lie down (“neither too extended 
nor too bent,” and never on one’s back), all the important 
moments of the day are examined, with the baths, the rub- 
downs, the oilings, the evacuations, the walks, and the foods 
that ought to accompany them." The question of sexual pleas¬ 
ures and their modulation is considered only in connection 
with seasonal variations, and only after some general princi¬ 
ples of balance are called to mind: “It is a very important point 
for health that our body’s potency not be diminished by an¬ 
other potency.” But the author restricts himself to brief 
generalities: first, no one should “make frequent and continual 
use of sexual intercourse”; the latter is more suitable for “cold, 
moist, atrabilious, and flatulent persons,” and least suitable 
for thin ones; there are periods in life when it is more harmful, 
as in the case of old people or for those who are “in the period 
that extends from childhood to adolescence.” 12 As for the 
presumably later text, taken to be a letter from Diodes to 
King Antigonus, the economy of pleasures it sets forth is very 
close in its general outline to that of Hippocrates: at winter 
solstice, which is the time when one is most susceptible to 



114 


The Use of Pleasure 


catarrh, sexual practice should not be restricted. During the 
time of the Pleiades’ ascent, a period in which bitter bile is 
dominant in the body, one must indulge in sexual acts with a 
good deal of moderation. One should even forgo them com¬ 
pletely at summer solstice time, when black bile takes over in 
the organism; and it is necessary to abstain from sexual activ¬ 
ity, as well as from any vomiting, till the autumn equinox. 13 * 

Several aspects of this regimen of pleasures merit our atten¬ 
tion. First, there is the limited space given to the problem of 
sexual relations compared with that accorded to exercises, and 
especially to food. As far as the thinking on dietetics was 
concerned, the question of foods—considered in terms of their 
peculiar qualities, and of the circumstances in which they were 
consumed (whether the seasons of the year or the particular 
state of the organism)—was a good deal more important than 
sexual activity. In addition, it should be noted that the preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen was never focused on the form of the 
acts: nothing was said about the types of sexual relations, 
nothing about the “natural” position or about unseemly prac¬ 
tices, nothing about masturbation, nor anything about the 
questions—which would later become so important—of coi¬ 
tus interruptus and methods of contraception.! The aphrodi- 
sia were considered in the aggregate, as an activity whose 
significance was not determined by the various forms it could 
take; one needed to ask oneself only whether the activity ought 
to take place, how frequently, and in what context. The prob- 
lematization was carried out primarily in terms of quantity 
and circumstances. 

Moreover, this quantity was not evaluated in the form of a 
precise numerical determination. One always remained within 
the compass of a general assessment: use pleasures “more 
amply” (pleon), or in smaller amounts (elasson), or as little as 

•This seasonal rhythm f6r sexual regimen was accepted for a long time. One encoun¬ 
ters it again in imperial times in the writings of Celsus. 

tSee, however, Diodes’ remarks about sleeping in the dorsal position, which induces 
nocturnal emissions. 14 



Dietetics 


115 


possible (hos hekista). Which did not mean that it was useless 
to concentrate one’s attention on the problem, but rather that 
it was not possible to determine in advance and for everyone, 
the rhythm of an activity that engaged an interplay of qualities 
—dryness, heat, moisture, cold—between the body and its 
milieu. If in fact sexual acts were a proper concern of regimen, 
and if they required “moderation,” this was because they 
produced—through the motions of the body and the ejacula¬ 
tion of semen—warming, cooling, drying, and moistening 
effects. They raised or lowered the level of each of the elements 
that were responsible for the body’s equilibrium. Hence they 
also altered the relationship between this equilibrium and the 
interaction of these elements in the outside world: heating or 
drying, which might be good for a cold, moist body, would be 
less so if the season and the climate were themselves hot and 
dry. It was not the function of regimen to prescribe quantities 
and determine rhythms: given relations that could only be 
defined in terms of their general characteristics, the role of 
regimen was to negotiate qualitative changes and make such 
readjustments as were necessitated by circumstances. We may 
note in passing that the author of the Aristotelian Problems 
seems to have been the only one to draw from one of the 
best-known principles of this qualitative psychology (namely, 
that women are generally cold and moist while men are hot 
and dry) the inference that the active season for sexual rela¬ 
tions was not the same for both sexes: summer was when 
women were most disposed to sexual intercourse, whereas 
men felt the strongest inclination in winter. 15 

Thus, dietetics problematized sexual practice not as a set of 
acts to be differentiated according to their forms and accord¬ 
ing to the value of each of them, but as an “activity” the whole 
of which should be given free rein or curtailed depending on 
chronological considerations. A point that allows us to draw 
a parallel between this regimen and certain regulations found 
later, in the Christian pastoral ministry. There too, in fact, 
some of the criteria used for delimiting sexual activity are 



116 


The Use of Pleasure 


temporal in nature. But those criteria are not only more pre¬ 
cise; they operate in a completely different way: they deter¬ 
mine times when sexual practice is permitted and other times 
when it is forbidden; and this strict partition is established in 
reference to different variables: the liturgical year, menstrual 
cycles, the period of pregnancy, or the time subsequent to 
childbirth.* In the ancient medical regimens, on the other 
hand, the variations were gradual; and instead of being orga¬ 
nized according to the binary form of permitted and forbid¬ 
den, they suggest a constant oscillation between more and less. 
The sexual act was not considered as a licit or an illicit practice 
according to the temporal boundaries within which it was 
inscribed: situated at the point of intersection between the 
individual and the world, temperament and climate, the quali¬ 
ties of the body and those of the seasons, it was viewed as an 
activity that could be more or less pernicious in its conse¬ 
quences and should therefore be subjected to a more or less 
restrictive economy. It was a practice that demanded reflec¬ 
tion and prudence. So it was not a question of determining the 
“working days” of sexual pleasures, uniformly and for every¬ 
one, but of how best to calculate the opportune times and the 
appropriate frequencies. 

*On this point, J. L. Flandrin’s book Un Temps pour embrasser (1983) should be 
consulted. Citing sources from the seventh century, it shows the importance of the 
divisions between permitted times and forbidden times, together with the many forms 
taken by that rhythmic ordering. One sees how this distribution of time was different 
from the circumstantial strategies of Greek dietetics.

Risks and 
Dangers 


The regimen of the aphrodisia, with the need to moderate 
their practice, did not operate on the assumption that sexual 
acts in themselves and by nature were bad. They were not the 
object of any disqualification based on principle. The question 
that was raised concerning them had to do with use, a use that 
was to be modulated according to the condition of the body 
and external circumstances. However, the need to have re¬ 
course to a careful regimen and to bring vigilant attention to 
bear on sexual practice was justified by two sets of reasons that 
reveal a certain anxiety about the effects of this activity. 

1. The first set of reasons concerns the effects of the sexual 
act on the individual’s body. Granted there were constitutions 
for which sexual activity was beneficial on the whole: this was 
the case for those suffering from an abundance of phlegm— 
for intercourse facilitated the elimination of fluids which 
would otherwise become corrupt, giving rise to that humor— 
or for those whose digestion was bad, whose body consumed 
itself, and whose belly was cold and dry. 1 But for others, 
whose bodies and heads were congested with humors, its 
effects were largely detrimental. 2 

Yet, despite this neutral valuation, this contextual ambiva¬ 
lence, sexual activity was the object of a rather constant suspi¬ 
cion. Diogenes Laertius reports a phrase by Pythagoras in 
which the general requirements of a seasonal regimen are 

117 



118 


The Use of Pleasure 


directly associated with a need for continuous rarefaction and 
a conviction that the aphrodisia are intrinsically harmful: 
“Keep to the winter for sexual pleasures, in summer abstain; 
they are less harmful in autumn and spring, but they are 
always harmful and not conducive to health.” And he goes on 
to cite this response from Pythagoras to the person who asked 
him when the best time was for making love: “When you want 
to lose what strength you have.” 3 But the Pythagoreans were 
not the only ones by any means to manifest this sort of appre¬ 
hension; the rule of “as little as possible” and the pursuit of 
the “lesser evil” are also invoked in texts whose aims are 
purely medical or hygienic: Diodes’ Regimen proposes to 
establish the conditions in which the use of pleasures would 
cause “the least harm” (hekista enochlei); and the Aristotelian 
Problems, where the effects of the sexual act are compared to 
those of pulling a plant from the ground, which always dam¬ 
ages the roots, advises one to have relations only in case of a 
pressing need. 4 In this dietetics, whose business it was to deter¬ 
mine when it was beneficial and when it was harmful to prac¬ 
tice the pleasures, one perceives the emergence of a general 
tendency toward a restrictive economy. 

This distrust is apparent in the idea that several of the most 
important organs are affected by sexual activity and may suffer 
from its abuses. Aristotle remarks that the brain is the first 
organ to feel the consequences of the sexual act, for it is the 
“coldest part” of the whole body; by withdrawing a “pure 
natural heat” from the organism, the emission of semen in¬ 
duces a general cooling effect. 5 Diodes places the gall bladder, 
kidneys, lungs, eyes, and spinal cord among the organs that 
are particularly exposed to the effects of pleasure’s excesses. 6 
According to the Problems, it is especially the eyes and the 
loins that are affected, either because they contribute to the act 
more than the other organs, or because the excessive heat 
produces a liquefaction within them. 7 

These manifold organic correlations explain the various 
pathological consequences that were associated with sexual 



Dietetics 


119 


activity when it did not obey the rules of an indispensable 
economy. It should be remarked that one finds little mention 
—in the case of men at least*—of the troubles that might be 
caused by total abstinence. Illnesses due to a poor distribution 
of sexual activity were much more often illnesses of excess. 
Such as the famous “dorsal phthisis” defined by Hippocrates 
in the treatise Diseases and redescribed with the same etiology 
over a very long span of Western medicine: it was a disease 
that “attacks young married people in particular” and “people 
fond of sexual intercourse” (philolagnoi); its point of origin 
was the marrow (considered to be the part of the body where 
the sperm is located, as we shall see); it gave a tingling sensa¬ 
tion that descended the length of the spinal column; the sperm 
discharged spontaneously during sleep, in the urine and the 
stools; the patient became sterile. When the disease was ac¬ 
companied by breathing difficulties and headaches, he could 
die from it. A regimen of softening food and evacuation might 
bring about a cure, but only after a whole year of abstention 
from wine, exercise, and aphrodisia . 9 The Epidemics also men¬ 
tion subjects in whom an abuse of pleasures brought on serious 
illnesses: in the case of a resident of Abdera, sexual relations 
and drinking had resulted in a fever, accompanied at the start 
by nausea, heart pain, thirst, dark urine, and a parched 
tongue; the cure was finally obtained on the twenty-fourth 
day, after several remissions and recurrences of fever; but a 
young man from Meliboea died in the midst of a delirium after 
a twenty-four-day illness, which had begun with intestinal and 
respiratory troubles, subsequent to repeated abuses of alcohol 
and sexual pleasures. 10 

By contrast, the regimen of athletes, often criticized for its 
exaggerations, was cited as an example of the beneficial effects 
that could result from sexual abstinence. Plato calls attention 

*But we shall see further on that sexual intercourse was regarded as a health factor 
where women were concerned. The author of the Problems observes, however, that 
healthy, well-nourished men experience bile attacks if they do not engage in sexual 
activity.' 



120 


The Use of Pleasure 


to this in the Laws, in regard to Iccus of Tarentum, a winner at 
Olympia: he was so set on victory, and “possessed in his soul 
such art, and such courage mixed with moderation that he 
never touched a woman—or a boy, for that matter—during the 
entire time of his intensive training.” Tradition said that the 
same was true of Crison, Astylus, and Diopompus." Several 
related themes converged on this practice no doubt: that of a 
ritual abstention which, in contests and battles alike, formed 
one of the conditions for success; that of a moral victory which 
the athlete needed to win over himself if he wished to be capable 
and worthy of assuring his superiority over others; but also that 
of an economy necessary for his body in order to conserve 
strength, which the sexual act would waste on the outside. 
Whereas women needed sexual relations so that the discharge 
necessary to their organism might occur in a regular manner, 
men could—in certain cases at least—retain all their semen; far 
from causing them harm, strict abstinence on their part would 
preserve their force in its entirety, accumulate it, concentrate it, 
and carry it finally to a higher level. 

Hence a paradox resides in this preoccupation with a regi¬ 
men by which one sought both an equitable distribution of an 
activity that could not in itself be regarded as a vice, and a 
restrictive economy in which “less” seemed almost always 
preferable to “more.” While it was natural that the body 
produce a vigorous substance having the capacity to procre¬ 
ate, the very act that roused the organism and cast it out into 
the world actually risked being as dangerous in its effects as 
it was harmonious with nature in its principle. The whole 
body, with its most important or most fragile organs, risked 
paying a high price for an expenditure that nature had 
nonetheless willed; and to retain that substance which sought 
by its own power to escape, could be a means of charging the 
body with its most intense energy. 

2. A concern about progeny also motivated the vigilance 
that one needed to display in the use of pleasures. For while 



Dietetics 


121 


it was granted that nature had organized the union of the sexes 
in order to provide people with a lineage and to ensure the 
survival of the species; and also granted that, for the same 
reason, she had associated the sexual relation with such a keen 
pleasure, this lineage was recognized as being fragile, at least 
in terms of its quality and worth. It was dangerous for the 
individual to take his pleasure at random; but if he procreated 
at random and no matter how, the future of his family would 
be placed in jeopardy. In the Laws, Plato solemnly under¬ 
scores the importance of the precautions that had to be taken 
for this purpose that concerned parents and the city as a 
whole. There were measures to be taken at the time of the first 
sexual act between the two partners on the occasion of mar¬ 
riage: all the values and all the dangers traditionally associated 
with inaugural acts were present here: on that day and night, 
it was necessary to refrain from any misdeed with respect to 
the matter at hand, “for the beginning, which among human 
beings is established as a god, is the saviour of all things—if 
She receives the proper honor from each of those who make 
use of Her.” But it was also necessary to be cautious each day 
during the whole life of the marriage: indeed, no one knew 
“what day or night” the deity would assist in a conception; 
hence “throughout the whole year and all one’s life,” espe¬ 
cially during the period of procreation, one must “be careful 
and avoid doing anything that voluntarily brings on sickness 
or involves insolence or injustice. Otherwise, one will neces¬ 
sarily stamp these effects on the souls and bodies of the em¬ 
bryos”; one ran the risk of “begetting offspring who are 
irregular, untrustworthy, and not at all straight in character 
or body.” 12 

The dangers that were suspected and hence the precautions 
that were recommended related to three important questions. 
The age of the parents, first of all. The age at which a man was 
thought to be capable of producing the finest offspring was 
relatively late: from thirty to thirty-five, according to Plato; 
whereas in the case of girls he limited the age for marriage to 



122 


The Use of Pleasure 


the years between sixteen and twenty. 13 * The same chronologi¬ 
cal disparity appears in Aristotle; he holds it to be absolutely 
necessary in order to ensure a vigorous progeny, and he calcu¬ 
lates that with this age gap the husband and wife will arrive 
together at the age when fertility declines and when in any 
case it will hardly be desirable for procreation to take place. 
Moreover, children who are conceived during this period of 
life will offer the advantage of reaching the right age in time 
to relieve their parents’ burden in their declining years: 
“Women should therefore marry about the age of eighteen, 
and men at thirty-seven or thereabouts. If those ages are ob¬ 
served, union will begin while the bodies of both partners are 
still in their prime.” 15 

Another important question was the “diet” of parents: 
avoid excesses of course, be careful not to procreate in a state 
of drunkenness, but also follow a general and continuous regi¬ 
men. Xenophon praises Lycurgus’ legislation and measures 
that were taken to assure healthy offspring by providing for 
vigorous parents; girls who were destined to be mothers were 
not to drink wine, or if they did, only when it was diluted with 
water; bread and meats were carefully measured out to them; 
like men, they were supposed to do physical exercises; Lycur¬ 
gus even instituted “races and trials of strength for women 
competitors and for men, believing that if both parents are 
strong they produce more vigorous offspring.” l6 t Aristotle, on 
the other hand, was against a strenuous athletic regimen; he 
preferred a regimen suitable for a citizen, one that ensured the 
disposition the citizen needed for his activity (euexia politike): 
“The best habit is one which comes midway between the 
athletic and the valetudinarian, some amount of exertion must 
therefore go to its making. But the exertion must not be vio¬ 
lent or specialized, as is the case with the athlete; it should

rather be a general exertion, directed to all the activities of a 
free man.” 18 For women, he was in favor of a regimen that 
would give them the same kind of qualities.* 

As for the time of year or season that was most conducive 
to obtaining a fine progeny, it was seen as depending on a 
whole cluster of complex elements; it was no doubt precau¬ 
tions of this sort, among other things, that would occupy the 
attention of the women inspectors—in Plato’s scheme—who 
were to oversee the good conduct of married couples during 
the ten years within which they were required or allowed to 
procreate. 20 Aristotle mentions briefly the knowledge that the 
doctors of his day and the naturalists were capable of impart¬ 
ing on this subject. According to him, the husband and wife 
ought to acquaint themselves with all these lessons: “doctors 
can tell them all they need to know about the times of good 
physical condition” (according to convention, winter is best); 
as for the “physicists,” they “hold that the north wind is better 
than the south.” 21 

In view of all these obligatory precautions, it is clear that 
procreative practice required a great deal of attention, indeed 
a whole moral attitude, if one wished to avert all the dangers 
that threatened it and to achieve the desired results. Plato 
insists that both spouses must keep in mind (dianoeisthai) that 
they are expected to present the city with “the noblest and best 
children possible.” They should earnestly reflect on the task, 
guided by the principle that human beings accomplish what 
they set out to do “if they reflect intelligently upon themselves 
and the deed itself,” whereas they fail “if they don’t apply 
their intelligence to it, or if they lack intelligence.” Therefore, 
“the groom should reflect intelligently [prosecheto ton noun ] 
on the bride and the making of children and the bride should 
do likewise—especially during the time when they don’t yet 

* According to Xenophon, it was so that they might have vigorous offspring that the 
young married couples of Sparta were not supposed to have relations very often: 
“With this restriction on intercourse the desire of the one for the other must necessar¬ 
ily be increased, and their offspring was bound to be more vigorous than if they were 
surfeited with one another .” 19 



124 


The Use of Pleasure 


have children.” 22 We may recall in this connection an observa¬ 
tion that appears in the Aristotelian Problems: if it is so often 
the case that the children of human beings do not resemble 
their parents, the reason is that the latter, at the time of the 
sexual act, had many other things on their minds instead of 
thinking only of what they were doing at that moment. 23 Later 
on, in the world of the flesh, it would be a rule necessary for 
justifying the sexual act, that it must be performed with a 
single purpose in mind, that of procreation. Here, however, 
such an intention was not necessary in order for sexual inter¬ 
course to avoid being a mortal sin. Yet, in order for it to 
achieve its aim, enabling the individual to live on in his chil¬ 
dren and to contribute to the security of the city, a whole 
mental endeavor was necessary: an unfailing concern for the 
dangers that surrounded the use of pleasures, threatening the 
purpose that nature gave them.* 

* Plato, in the Laws, would have women lead a life sheltered from overly intense 
pleasures and pains.”

Act, Expenditure, 
Death 


And yet, while the use of pleasures constituted a problem 
in the individual’s relationship with his own body, and made 
it difficult to define a regimen for him, the reason lay not 
simply in the fact that this use was suspected of being the 
source of certain illnesses or that people feared its conse¬ 
quences for their offspring. The sexual act was certainly not 
perceived by the Greeks as an evil; for them it was not the 
object of a moral disqualification. But the texts bear witness 
to an anxiety concerning the activity itself. And this anxiety 
revolved around three focal points: the very form of the act, 
the cost it entailed, and the death to which it was linked. It 
would be a mistake to see in Greek thought only a positive 
valuation of the sexual act. Medical and philosophical reflec¬ 
tion describes it as posing a threat, through its violence, to the 
control and mastery that one ought to exercise over oneself; 
as sapping the strength the individual should conserve and 
maintain, through the exhaustion it caused; and as prefiguring 
the death of the individual while assuring the survival of the 
species. If the regimen of pleasures was important, this was 
not simply because excess might lead to an illness; it was 
because in sexual activity in general man’s mastery, strength, 
and life were at stake. To give this activity the rarefied and 
stylized form of a regimen was to ensure oneself against future 
ills; it was also to form, exercise, and prove oneself an individ¬ 
ual capable of controlling his violence and of allowing it to 


125 



126 


The Use of Pleasure 


operate within appropriate limits, of keeping the source of his 
energy within himself, and of accepting his death while pro¬ 
viding for the birth of his descendants. The physical regimen 
of the aphrodisia was a health precaution; at the same time, 
it was an exercise—an askesis —of existence. 

1. The violence of the act. Plato was thinking about the 
aphrodisia when, in the Philebus, he described the effects of 
pleasure when it is mixed with a little distress: pleasure “takes 
possession of a man, sometimes making him leap about in 
ecstasy, so that he changes complexion, takes up all kinds of 
strange positions, pants in strange ways, and is driven com¬ 
pletely out of his senses with mad cries and shouts.... He feels 
bound to say to himself, as do others, that he is almost dying 
with enjoyment when he indulges in these delights. The more 
unrestrained and intemperate [ akolastoteros, aphronesteros ] 
he is, the more fervently he goes after them in wholehearted 
pursuit.” 1 

Hippocrates has been credited with the statement that or¬ 
gasm has the form of a brief epileptic seizure: at any rate, that 
is what Aulus Gellius reports: “Hippocrates, a man of divine 
wisdom, believed of venery [coitus venereus] that it was part 
of the horrible disease which our countrymen call comitalis, 
or the ‘election disease’; for these are his very words as they 
have come down to us: ‘coition is a brief epilepsy’ [ten synou- 
sian einai mikran epilepsian ].” 2 Actually the phrase comes 
from Democritus. The Hippocratic treatise The Seed, which 
in its first pages gives a detailed description of the sexual act, 
accords with another tradition, that of Diogenes of Apollonia; 
the model this tradition (also represented by Clement of Alex¬ 
andria) referred to was not the pathological model of epilepsy, 
but the mechanical model of a heated, foaming fluid: “Some 
people,” reports The Pedagogue, “suppose that the semen of 
living creatures is the foamy substance of the blood. The blood 
being greatly agitated during the intertwining of bodies, and 
heated by the natural warmth of the male, forms a froth and 



Dietetics

spreads through the spermatic veins. According to Diogenes 
of Apollonia, this phenomenon would explain the term aphro- 
disia. ” 3 This general theme of fluids, agitation, and spreading 
foam is treated in The Seed from the Hippocratic collection, 
in the form of a description organized entirely around what 
might be called the “ejaculatory schema”; it is this schema 
that is carried over unchanged from man to woman, and used 
to decipher the relationships between male and female roles in 
terms of confrontation and contest, but also domination and 
regulation of the one by the other. 

The sexual act is analyzed, from start to finish, as a violent 
mechanical action that is directed toward the emission of 
sperm. 4 First, the rubbing of the genitals and the movement 
given to the whole body produce a general warming effect; the 
latter, combined with agitation, gives the humor, diffused into 
the whole body, a greater fluidity, so that it begins to “foam” 
(aphrein), “in the same way as all other fluids produce foam 
when they are agitated.” At this stage a phenomenon of “sepa¬ 
ration” (apokrisis) occurs; the most vigorous part of this 
foaming fluid, “the most potent and the richest” (to ischyrota- 
ton kaipiotaton) is carried to the brain and the spinal marrow, 
descending its length to the loins. Then the warm foam passes 
to the kidneys and from there through the testicles to the 
penis, from which it is expelled by means of a violent spasm 
(tarache). This process, which is voluntary at the beginning 
when there is sexual union and “rubbing of the genitals,” can 
also unfold in an entirely involuntary manner. This is what 
occurs in the case of nocturnal emission, an occurrence men¬ 
tioned by the author of The Seed: when work or another 
activity has caused the body to be heated, the fluid starts to 
produce foam spontaneously; it “behaves as in coition,” and 
ejaculation takes place, accompanied by dream images, no 
doubt following the frequently invoked principle that dreams, 
or at least some of them, reveal the current state of the body. 5 

The Hippocratic description establishes a general isomor¬ 
phism between the man’s sexual act and that of the woman. 



128 


The Use of Pleasure 


The process is the same, except that in the case of the woman 
the heating starts in the womb stimulated by the male sex 
organ during intercourse: “In the case of women, it is my 
contention that when during intercourse the vagina is rubbed 
and the womb is disturbed, an irritation is set up in the womb 
which produces pleasure and heat in the rest of the body. A 
woman also releases something from her body, sometimes into 
the womb, and sometimes externally as well.” 6 There is the 
same type of substance and the same formation (sperm formed 
from blood through warming and separation); there is also the 
same mechanism and the same terminal act of ejaculation. 
The author does bring out certain differences, however, relat¬ 
ing not to the nature of the act but to its peculiar violence, and 
to the intensity and duration of the pleasure that accompanies 
it. In the act itself, the woman’s pleasure is much less intense 
than that of the man, because in the case of the latter the 
excretion of fluid occurs abruptly and with much greater vio¬ 
lence. In the case of the woman, on the other hand, the pleas¬ 
ure begins at the start of the act and lasts as long as intercourse 
itself. Throughout intercourse her pleasure depends on the 
man; it does not cease until “the man releases the woman”; 
and if she happens to reach orgasm before him, this does not 
mean her pleasure ends—it is only experienced in a different 
way. 7 

Between these two acts having the same form in the man 
and in the woman, the Hippocratic text posits a relation that 
is causal and competitive at the same time: a contest, as it 
were, where the male plays the role of instigator and where he 
should always have the final victory. In order to explain the 
effects of the man’s pleasure on that of the woman, the text 
appeals—as do other, no doubt ancient passages from the 
Hippocratic collection—to the two elements of water and fire, 
and to the reciprocal effects of heat and cold; the male liquor 
sometimes acts as the stimulant, sometimes as the dampener; 
as for the female element, always hot, it is sometimes repre- 



Dietetics 


129 


sented by flame and sometimes by a liquid. If the woman’s 
pleasure intensifies “at the moment the sperm arrives in the 
womb,” this happens in the way a flame suddenly flares up 
when one pours wine on it; if, on the other hand, the man’s 
ejaculation puts an end to the woman’s pleasure, it is like 
pouring a cold liquid on very hot water: the boiling stops 
immediately. 8 Two similar acts, therefore, bringing analogous 
substances into play, but substances endowed with opposing 
qualities that confront one another in sexual union: force 
against force, cold water against boiling, alcohol on a flame. 
But, in any case, it is the male act that determines, regulates, 
stimulates, dominates. It is the male act, too, that ensures the 
health of the female organs by ensuring that they function 
properly: “If women have intercourse with men their health 
is better than if they do not. For in the first place, the womb 
is moistened by intercourse, whereas when the womb is drier 
than it should be it becomes extremely contracted, and this 
extreme contraction causes pain to the body. In the second 
place, intercourse by heating the blood and rendering it more 
fluid gives an easier passage to the menses; whereas if the 
menses do not flow, women’s bodies become prone to sick¬ 
ness.” 9 For the woman’s body, penetration by the man and 
absorption of sperm are the primary source of the equilibrium 
of its qualities and the key stimulus for the necessary flow of 
its humors. 

This “ejaculatory schema,” through which sexual activity 
as a whole—and in both sexes—was always perceived, shows 
unmistakably the near-exclusive domination of the virile 
model. The female act was not exactly the complement of the 
male act; it was more in the nature of a duplicate, but in the 
form of a weakened version that depended on the male act 
both for health and for pleasure. By focusing entirely on this 
moment of emission—of foamy excretion, seen as the essential 
part of the act—one placed at the core of sexual activity a 
process that was characterized by its violence, an all but irre- 



130 


The Use of Pleasure 


pressible mechanics, and a force that escaped control. But one 
also raised—as an important problem in the use of pleasures 
—a question of economy and expenditure. 

2. Expenditure. The sexual act extracted from the body a 
substance that was capable of imparting life, but only because 
it was itself tied to the existence of the individual and claimed 
a portion of that existence. By expelling their semen, living 
creatures did not just evacuate a surplus fluid, they deprived 
themselves of elements that were valuable for their own 
existence. 

All the various authors do not give the same explanation for 
this preciousness of the sperm. The Seed seems to refer to two 
conceptions of the origin of sperm. According to one of these, 
it originates in the head: formed in the brain, it descends via 
the marrow to the lower parts of the body. By Diogenes 
Laertius’ account, this was the general principle of the Py¬ 
thagorean conception: the sperm was held to be “a clot of 
brain containing hot vapor within it”; from that fragment of 
matter the whole body would subsequently be formed, with its 
“flesh, sinews, bones, hairs”; from the hot ether that it con¬ 
tained, the soul of the embryo would be born, along with 
sensation. 10 This privileging of the head in the formation of 
semen is echoed in the Hippocratic text, where there is the 
statement that for men who have had an incision made next 
to the ear, while they remain capable of sexual intercourse, 
they have a semen that is small in quantity, weak, and sterile: 
“For the greater part of the sperm travels from the head past 
the ears into the spinal marrow: now when the incision has 
formed a scar, this passage becomes obstructed.” 11 But this 
importance given to the head is not incompatible, in the trea¬ 
tise The Seed, with the general principle that semen issues 
from the body as a whole: a man’s sperm “comes from all the 
fluid in the body” through “veins and nerves which extend 
from every part of the body through the penis”; it is secreted 
“from the whole body—from the hard parts as well as the soft, 



Dietetics 


131 


and from the total bodily fluid” in its four forms. 12 A woman 
also “ejaculates from the entire body”; and if boys and girls 
are not able to secrete semen before puberty, this is because 
at that age the veins are so small and narrow that they “pre¬ 
vent the passage of sperm.” 13 In any case, emanating from the 
whole body, or coming for the most part from the head, semen 
is regarded as the result of a process that separates, isolates, 
and concentrates “the most potent part” of the bodily fluid: 
to ischyrotaton. This force is manifested in the rich and foamy 
nature of semen, and in the violence with which it is expelled; 
it is also evidenced by the weakness that is always felt after 
coition, however small the amount excreted. 14 

Actually, the origin of semen remained a topic of debate in 
the medical and philosophical literature. But no matter what 
explanations were submitted, they had to account for what 
enabled semen to transmit life, to give rise to another living 
creature. And where did the seminal substance get its potency 
if not from the source of life that was found in the individual 
from whom it came? The life that it imparted had to have been 
borrowed and separated from the living being where it origi¬ 
nated. In every emission of sperm there was something that 
issued, and was withdrawn, from the most precious elements 
of the individual. The creator in the Timaeus thus rooted this 
seed in what constituted, for humans, the nexus of the body 
and the soul, of death and immortality. This nexus was the 
marrow (which, in its round cranial part, housed the seat of 
the immortal soul): “For it was in this that the bonds of life 
by which the soul is bound to the body were fastened, and 
implanted the roots of the mortal kind.” 15 From this source 
flowed, via the two dorsal veins, the moisture which the body 
needed and which remained enclosed within it; this was also 
the source of the semen that was emitted through the sex 
organ to conceive another individual. Living beings and their 
offspring had one and the same life principle. 

Aristotle’s analysis is very different from those of both Plato 
and Hippocrates. Different as to localizations, different as to 



132 


The Use of Pleasure 


mechanisms. And yet here, too, one finds the same principle 
of precious loss. In the Generation of Animals, the sperm is 
explained as the residue (perittoma) of nutriment: the end 
product, concentrated in very small quantities and useful in 
the same way as is the raw material for growth that the 
organism draws from food. For Aristotle, in fact, the final 
processing of what alimentation brings into the body furnishes 
a material, one portion of which is conveyed to all parts of the 
body, causing them to grow, imperceptibly, every day—while 
the other portion awaits the expulsion that will enable it, once 
inside the womb of a woman, to give rise to the formation of 
an embryo. 16 The development and reproduction of the indi¬ 
vidual thus depend on the same elements and have their 
source in the same substance. The growth elements and the 
seminal fluid are doublets resulting from an alimentary proc¬ 
essing that maintains the life of one individual and makes 
possible the birth of another. Given these conditions, it is 
understandable that the discharge of this semen constitutes an 
important event for the body: it withdraws a substance that 
is precious, being the end result of a lengthy distillation by the 
organism and concentrating elements which, in accordance 
with nature, might have gone “to all parts of the body,” and 
hence might have made it grow if they had not been removed 
from the body. It is also understandable why this discharge— 
which is entirely possible at an age when a human being needs 
only to renew his organism without having to develop it—does 
not take place in early youth when all the resources of nourish¬ 
ment are used for development; at that age, “all the nutriment 
is used up too soon,” says Aristotle; it is understandable, too, 
that in old age, the production of sperm slows down: “The 
organism does not concoct enough.” 17 The entire life of the 
individual—from youth, when one needs to grow, to old age, 
when one has so much trouble sustaining oneself—is marked 
by this relation of complementarity between the power to 
procreate and the capacity to develop or continue existing. 

Whether the semen is drawn from the whole organism, or 



Dietetics 


133 


originates where the body and the soul are joined to one 
another, or is formed at the end of a lengthy internal process¬ 
ing of food, the sexual act that expels it constitutes a costly 
expenditure for the human being. Pleasure may well accom¬ 
pany it, as nature intended, so that men would think of provid¬ 
ing themselves with descendants; it nonetheless constitutes a 
hard jolt for the being itself, involving as it does the relinquish¬ 
ing of a whole portion of that which contains a “being itself.” 
This is how Aristotle explains the “obvious” dejection that 
follows intercourse 18 ; it is also how the author of the Problems 
explains the dislike felt by young men for the first woman with 
whom they chanced to have sexual relations. 19 Although the 
volume is small—proportionately larger, however, in men 
than in other animals—living creatures deprive themselves of 
a whole portion of the elements that are essential to their own 
existence. 20 One sees how in certain instances, as in the case 
of dorsal consumption described by Hippocrates, the misuse 
of sexual pleasure might lead to death. 

3. Death and Immortality. It was not just the fear of exces¬ 
sive expenditure that caused medical and philosophical reflec¬ 
tion to associate sexual activity with death. This reflection also 
linked them together in the very principle of reproduction, by 
holding that the purpose of reproduction was to compensate 
for the passing away of living beings and to provide the species 
as a whole with the eternity that could not be given to each 
individual. If animals united in sexual intercourse, and if this 
relation gave them descendants, it was in order that the species 
might—as the Laws puts it—endlessly accompany the march 
of time. This was its way of cheating death: leaving “the 
children of children” behind it while remaining the same, it 
“partakes of immortality by means of coming-in to-being.” 21 
For Aristotle and Plato alike, the sexual act was at the point 
of junction of an individual life that was bound to perish—and 
from which, moreover, it drew off a portion of its most pre¬ 
cious resources—and an immortality that assumed the con- 



134 


The Use of Pleasure 


crete form of a survival of the species. Between these two lives, 
the sexual relation constituted, as Plato says, an “artifice” 
(mechane) that was designed to join them together so that the 
first might, in its own way, participate in the second; this 
mechane provided the individual with an “offspring” of him¬ 
self (apoblastema). 

In Plato this link, contrived and natural at the same time, 
is sustained by the longing for self-perpetuation and immortal¬ 
ity, which characterizes every perishable creature. 22 In the 
Symposium, Diotima points out that such a longing exists in 
animals which, seized by the urge to procreate, “fall prey to 
a violent love-sickness,” and they are “ready to die if need be 
in order to secure the survival of their progeny.” 23 It also exists 
in the human animal who, once his life is over, does not want 
to lie in a grave uncelebrated and “nameless.” 24 This is why, 
according to the Laws, he should marry and provide himself 
with descendants in the best possible circumstances. But it is 
this same desire that makes some individuals who love boys 
eager, not to sow their seed in the body, but to engender in the 
soul and to give birth to that which is, of itself, beautiful. 25 In 
Aristotle, in certain early texts like the treatise On the Soul, 
sexual activity’s connection with death and immortality is still 
expressed in the somewhat “Platonizing” form of a desire for 
participation in the eternal; 26 in later texts such as the treatise 
On Generation and Corruption, or Generation of Animals, it 
is conceived in the form of a differentiation and distribution 
of beings in the natural order, according to a set of ontological 
principles concerning being, nonbeing, and the better. Propos¬ 
ing to explain in terms of final causes why there is procreation 
of animals and separate existence of the sexes, the second book 
of the Generation of Animals invokes a few basic principles 
governing the relationships of the myriads of beings to being 
per se. First, some things are eternal and divine, while others 
can be or not be; second, the beautiful and divine is always the 
better and what is not eternal can participate in the better and 
the worse; third, it is better to be than not to be, to live than 



Dietetics 


135 


not to live, to be animate than inanimate. And, observing that 
beings who are subject to becoming can be eternal only with¬ 
in the limits of their capability, he concludes that this is 
why there is generation of animals, and that the latter, 
excluded from eternity as individuals, can be eternal as 
a species: “numerically,” an animal “cannot be eternal, 
for the substance of things that are is particular; and if it 
were such, it would be eternal—but it is possible for it as 
a species.” 27 

Hence sexual activity was located within the broad parame¬ 
ters of life and death, of time, becoming, and eternity. It 
became necessary because the individual was fated to die, and 
in order that he might in a sense escape death. To be sure, 
these philosophical speculations were not immediately present 
in reflection regarding the use of pleasures and their regimen. 
But notice the solemnity with which Plato refers to these 
themes in the “persuasive” legislation—laws that must be of 
first importance since they were to be “the first laid down in 
every city”—that he proposes concerning marriage: “A man 
is to marry after he reaches the age of thirty and before he 
reaches thirty-five, bearing in mind that there is a sense in 
which the human species has by a certain nature a share in 
immortality, and that it is the nature of everyone to desire 
immortality in every way. For the desire to become famous 
and not to lie nameless after one has died is a desire for such 
a thing. Thus the species of human beings has something in 
its nature that is bound together with all of time, which it 
accompanies and will always accompany to the end. In this 
way the species is immortal; by leaving behind the children of 
children and remaining one and the same for always, it par¬ 
takes of immortality by means of coming-into-being.” 28 The 
interlocutors of the Lam know that these lengthy considera¬ 
tions are not part of the customary practice of legislators. But 
the Athenian remarks that things are the same in this sphere 
as in medicine; the latter, when it speaks to reasonable and free 
men, cannot be content to lay down precepts; it must explain, 



136 


The Use of Pleasure 


give reasons, and persuade so that the patient might regulate 
his way of living. To give such explanations about the individ¬ 
ual and the species, time and eternity, life and death, is to 
ensure that citizens will accept, “in a frame of mind more 
favorably disposed and therefore more apt to learn some¬ 
thing,” the prescriptions that are meant to regulate their sex¬ 
ual activity and their marriage, the reasonable regimen of their 
moderate life. 29 

Greek medicine and philosophy concerned themselves with 
the aphrodisia and the use that ought to be made of them if 
one wished to care properly for one’s body. This problematiza- 
tion did not lead to a drawing of distinctions among those acts, 
their possible forms and varieties, in order to decide which 
ones were admissible and which were harmful or “abnormal.” 
By considering them in the aggregate, as the manifestation of 
a generic activity, it sought to determine the principles that 
would enable individuals to engage in them at the appropriate 
intensity and to distribute them in the right way, according to 
circumstances. Yet the clearly restrictive tendencies of such an 
economy attest to an anxiety about this sexual activity. An 
anxiety that related to the possible consequences of abuses; an 
anxiety that also related—especially so—to the act itself, 
which was always perceived in terms of a male, ejaculatory, 
“paroxystic” schema that appeared to adequately define all 
sexual activity. We see, then, that the importance that was 
accorded to the sexual act and to the forms of its rarefaction 
was owing not only to its negative effects on the body, but to 
what it was in itself and by nature: a violence that confounded 
the will, an expenditure that wasted the body’s resources, a 
procreation that was linked to the future death of the individ¬ 
ual. The sexual act did not occasion anxiety because it was 
associated with evil but because it disturbed and threatened 
the individual’s relationship with himself and his integrity as 
an ethical subject in the making; if it was not properly mea¬ 
sured and distributed, it carried the threat of a breaking forth 



Dietetics 


137 


of involuntary forces, a lessening of energy, and death without 
honorable descendants. 

We may note that these three great themes of preoccupation 
are not peculiar to ancient culture: indications of this anxiety, 
which identify the sexual act with the “virile” form of semen 
and associate it with violence, exhaustion, and death, could 
doubtless be found frequently elsewhere. For example, the 
documents assembled by Van Gulik, pertaining to ancient 
Chinese culture, seem to show the presence of this same the¬ 
matic complex: fear of the irrepressible and costly act, dread 
of its harmful consequences for the body and health, represen¬ 
tation of the man-woman relationship in the form of a contest, 
preoccupation with obtaining descendants of good quality by 
means of a well-regulated sexual activity. 30 But the ancient 
Chinese “bedroom” treatises responded to that anxiety in a 
manner completely different from what one finds in classical 
Greece. The dread one felt when faced with the violence of the 
act and the fear of losing one’s semen were answered by meth¬ 
ods of willful retention; the encounter with the other sex was 
perceived as a way to come into contact with the vital princi¬ 
ple the latter held in her possession and, by absorbing it, to 
internalize it for one’s own benefit. So that a well-managed 
sexual activity not only precluded any danger, it could also 
result in a strengthening of one’s existence and it could be a 
means of restoring one’s youthfulness. Elaboration and exer¬ 
cise in this case concerned the act itself, its unfolding, the play 
of forces that sustained it, and of course the pleasure with 
which it was associated; the nullification or indefinite post¬ 
ponement of its completion enabled one both to carry it to its 
highest degree in the realm of pleasure and to turn it to one’s 
greatest advantage in life. In this “erotic art,” which sought, 
with pronounced ethical concerns, to intensify insofar as pos¬ 
sible the positive effects of a controlled, deliberate, multifari¬ 
ous, and prolonged sexual activity, time—a time that 
terminated the act, aged the body, and brought death—was 
exorcised.

The Use of Pleasure 


It would also be easy to find in the Christian doctrine of 
the flesh closely related themes of anxiety: the involuntary 
violence of the act, its kinship with evil, and its place in the 
play of life and death. But in the irrepressible force of desire 
and the sexual act, Saint Augustine was to see one of the 
main stigmata of the Fall (that involuntary movement repro¬ 
duced in the human body man’s rebellion against God); the 
Christian pastoral ministry was to set the rules of economy, 
on a precise calendar and according to a detailed morphol¬ 
ogy of acts; and the doctrine of marriage was to give the 
procreative finality the dual role of ensuring the survival or 
even the proliferation of God’s people, and of making it pos¬ 
sible for individuals to avoid pledging their souls to eternal 
death through indulgence in that activity. In short, this was 
a juridico-moral codification of acts, moments, and inten¬ 
tions that legitimated an activity that was of itself a bearer of 
negative values; and it inscribed it in the dual order of the 
ecclesiastical institution and the matrimonial institution. The 
time of rites and the time of legitimate procreation could 
absolve it of blame. 

Among the Greeks, these same anxiety themes (violence, 
expenditure, and death) took shape within a reflection that did 
not aim at a codification of acts, nor at the creation of an erotic 
art; rather, its objective was to develop a technique of exis¬ 
tence. This technique did not require that the acts be divested 
of their primordial naturalness; nor did it attempt to augment 
their pleasurable effects; it sought to distribute them in the 
closest conformity with what nature demanded. The material 
it sought to elaborate was not, as in an erotic art, the unfolding 
of the act; nor was it the conditions of the act’s institutional 
legitimation, as it would be in Christianity; it was much more 
the relationship between oneself and that activity “considered 
in the aggregate,” the ability to control, limit, and apportion 
it in the right manner. This techne created the possibility of 
forming oneself as a subject in control of his conduct; that is, 
the possibility of making oneself like the doctor treating sick-

ness, the pilot steering between the rocks, or the statesman 
governing the city*—a skillful and prudent guide of himself, 
one who had a sense of the right time and the right measure. 
We can thus understand why the necessity of a regimen for the 
aphrodisia was underscored so insistently, while so few details 
were given regarding the troubles that an abuse could bring 
about, and very few particulars concerning what one should 
or shouldn’t do. Because it was the most violent of all the 
pleasures, because it was more costly than most physical ac¬ 
tivities, and because it participated in the game of life and 
death, it constituted a privileged domain for the ethical forma¬ 
tion of the subject: a subject who ought to be distinguished by 
his ability to subdue the tumultuous forces that were loosed 
within him, to stay in control of his store of energy, and to 
make his life into an oeuvre that would endure beyond his own 
ephemeral existence. The physical regimen of pleasures and 
the economy it required were part of a whole art of the self. 

♦These three “arts of governing” were often likened to one another, as arts that 
demanded a knowledge and prudence attuned to circumstances; they were also 
comparable because they were knowledges that were associated with an ability to 
command. They were frequently referred to where it was a question of an individual's 
search for the principles or the authority that would help him to “conduct himself.”

The Wisdom of 
Marriage 


How, in what form, and why were sexual relations between 
husband and wife “problematical” in Greek thought? What 
reason was there to be worried about them? And above all, 
what reason was there to question the husband’s behavior, to 
reflect on the moderation it necessitated, and—in a society so 
strongly marked by the rule of “free men”—to make it a 
theme of moral preoccupation? It looks as if there were none, 
or in any case very little. At the end of the legal argument 
Against Neaera, attributed to Demosthenes, the author deliv¬ 
ers a sort of aphorism that has remained famous: “Mistresses 
we keep for the sake of pleasure, concubines for the daily care 
of our persons, but wives to bear us legitimate children and to 
be faithful guardians of our households.”' 

With a formula like this one, which seems to speak of a 
strict distribution of roles, we could not be further from the 
arts of conjugal pleasure such as one finds, according to Van 
Gulik, in ancient China. There, prescriptions concerning the 
woman’s obedience, her respect, and her devotion were closely 
linked with advice on the correct erotic behavior to manifest 
in order to increase the partners’ pleasure, or at least that of 
the man, and with opinions on the right conditions for obtain¬ 
ing the best possible progeny. 2 This was because, in that 
polygamous society, the wife found herself in a competitive 
situation where her status was tied directly to her ability to 
give pleasure; questions concerning sexual behavior and the 

143 




144 


The Use of Pleasure 


forms of its possible improvement formed part of the society’s 
reflection about existence; the skillful practice of pleasures and 
the equilibrium of married life belonged to the same set of 
concerns. 

The Against Neaera formula is also far removed from what 
one finds in the Christian doctrine and its pastoral application, 
but for entirely different reasons. In that strictly monogamous 
situation, the man was to be prohibited from going in pursuit 
of any other form of pleasure beyond the pleasure he was 
allowed to take with his lawful wife; and even that pleasure 
was to pose a number of problems, seeing that the stated goal 
of sexual relations was not in sensual delight but in procrea¬ 
tion. Around this central cluster of themes, a whole inquiry 
was to develop regarding the status of pleasures within the 
conjugal relationship. In this case, the problematization did 
not grow out of a polygamous structure but out of a monoga¬ 
mous obligation; and it did not seek to tie the quality of the 
relationship to the intensity of pleasure and the variety of 
partners, but on the contrary it sought to dissociate, insofar 
as possible, the constancy of a single conjugal relationship 
from the pursuit of pleasure.* 

The formula expressed in Against Neaera appears to have 
been based on an altogether different system. On the one hand, 
this system operated on the principle of a single lawful wife; 
but on the other hand, it very clearly located the domain of 
pleasures outside the marital relationship. In it, marriage 
would encounter the sexual relation only in its reproductive 
function, while the sexual relation would raise the question of 
pleasure only outside of marriage. And consequently one does 
not see why sexual relations would be a problem in married 

•We have to be careful not to schematize, not to reduce the Christian doctrine or 
marital relations to the procreative function, excluding pleasure. In actual fact, the 
doctrine was to be complex and open to discussion, and it was to have numerous 
variants. But the thing to bear in mind in our context is that the question of pleasure 
in the conjugal relationship and the question of the place it ought to be given, of the 
precautions that one had to take against it, as well as of the concessions that one had 
to grant it (taking account of the weakness and lustfulness of the other), constituted 
an active focus of reflection.

life, unless it was a matter of the husband’s obtaining legiti¬ 
mate and promising descendants. Thus, it is quite logical that 
one finds in Greek thought technical and medical inquiries 
concerning sterility and its causes, 3 considerations from the 
viewpoint of dietetics and hygiene on how to have healthy 
children (and boys rather than girls)/ political and social 
reflections on the best possible matching of marriage partners, 5 
and finally, juridical debates on the conditions in which 
descendants could be considered legitimate and have the 
benefit of citizenship (this was what was at issue in Against 
Neaera). 

Moreover, one fails to see why the problematization of 
sexual relations between spouses would take other forms or 
become attached to other questions, given the status of mar¬ 
ried couples in Athens and the obligations to which both 
husband and wife were held. The definition of what was al¬ 
lowed, forbidden, and prescribed for spouses by the institution 
of marriage in matters of sexual practice was simple enough, 
and clearly symmetrical enough so that additional moral regu¬ 
lation did not appear necessary. As far as women were con¬ 
cerned, in fact, they were bound by their juridical and social 
status as wives; all their sexual activity had to be within the 
conjugal relationship and their husband had to be their exclu¬ 
sive partner. They were under his power; it was to him that 
they had to give their children, who would be citizens and 
heirs. In case of adultery, the punishment meted out was 
private, but it was also public (a woman guilty of adultery no 
longer had the right to appear in public religious ceremonies): 
as Demosthenes says, the law “has declared that our women 
may be inspired with a fear sufficient to make them live soberly 
[sophronein], and avoid all vice [meden hamartanein ] and, as 
their duty is, to keep to their household tasks”; the law warns 
them that “if a woman is guilty of any such sin, she will be 
outcast from her husband’s home and from the sanctuaries of 
the city.” 6 The familial and civic status of a married woman 
made her subject to the rules of a conduct that was character- 



146 


The Use of Pleasure 


ized by a strictly conjugal sexual practice. It was not that 
virtue was of no use to women, far from it; but their sophrosyne 
had the role of ensuring that they would manage, by an exer¬ 
cise of will and reason, to respect the rules that were laid down 
for them. 

For his part, the husband was bound by a certain number 
of obligations toward his wife (one of Solon’s laws 7 required 
the husband to have sexual relations with his wife at least 
three times a month if she was an “heiress”).* But having 
sexual relations only with his lawful wife did not by any means 
form part of his obligations. It is true that every man, whoever 
he might be, married or not, had to respect a married woman 
(or a girl under parental control); but this was because she was 
under someone else’s authority; it was not his own status that 
prevented him, but that of the girl or woman who was the 
object of his attack. His offense was essentially against the man 
who held authority over the woman; this was why, if he was 
an Athenian, he would be punished less severely if he commit¬ 
ted rape, overcome by the voracity of his desire, than if he 
deliberately and artfully seduced a woman; as Lysias says in 
On the Murder of Eratosthenes, seducers “corrupt their vic¬ 
tims’ souls, thus making the wives of others more closely 
attached to themselves than to their husbands, and get the 
whole house into their hands, and cause uncertainty as to 
whose the children really are.” 9 The rapist violated only the 
woman’s body, while the seducer violated the husband’s au¬ 
thority. All things considered, the married man was prohib¬ 
ited only from contracting another marriage; no sexual 
relation was forbidden him as a consequence of the marriage 
obligation he had entered into; he could have an intimate 
affair, he could frequent prostitutes, he could be the lover of 
a boy—to say nothing of the men or women slaves he had in 

*One also finds evidence of an obligation in regard to conjugal duties in Pythagorean 
teaching, as reported by Diogenes Laertius: “Hieronymus, however, says that, when 
he had descended into Hades ... he saw under torture those who had neglected to 
fulfill their conjugal duties [lous me thelontes syneinai lais heauton gunaixi].” 1

his household at his disposal. A man’s marriage did not re¬ 
strict him sexually. 

Juridically, this meant that adultery was not a breach of the 
marriage contract if it was committed by one of the two part¬ 
ners. It constituted an infraction only in cases where a married 
woman had relations with a man who was not her husband; 
it was the marital status of the woman, never that of the man, 
that made it possible to define a relation as adultery. And from 
a moral standpoint, it is clear that there did not exist for the 
Greeks that category of “mutual fidelity” which would later 
introduce into married life a sort of “sexual right” having 
moral weight, juridical effects, and religious significance. The 
principle of a double monopoly, making exclusive partners of 
the two spouses, was not required in the marital relation. For 
while the wife belonged to the husband, the husband belonged 
only to himself. Reciprocal sexual fidelity, as a duty, a com¬ 
mitment, and a feeling shared equally, did not constitute the 
necessary guarantee nor the highest expression of married life. 
All this favors the conclusion that sexual pleasures posed their 
problems, and while married life posed problems of its own, 
there were few meeting points between the two problematiza- 
tions. At any rate, marriage ought not to have raised any 
questions as far as the ethics of pleasure was concerned, for 
the reasons we have just considered: in the case of one of the 
partners—the wife—the restrictions were defined by status, 
law, and custom, and they were guaranteed by punishments 
or sanctions; in the case of the other—the husband—marital 
status did not impose precise rules on him, except to designate 
the woman from whom he must expect to obtain his legitimate 
heirs. 

We cannot stop at that, however. It is true that, at least 
during that era, marriage—and within marriage, sexual rela¬ 
tions between partners—did not constitute a very intense 
focus of questioning; it is true that less thought seems to have 
been given to sexual conduct in the relation that one might 
have with one’s wife than in the relation that one might have 



148 


The Use of Pleasure 


with one’s own body, or, as we shall see, in the relationship 
with boys. But it would be incorrect to think that things were 
so simple that the behavior of women—as wives—was too 
imperiously set to need any reflection, or that the behavior of 
men—as husbands—was so free that there was no need to 
question oneself concerning it. First, we have many statements 
about feelings of jealousy; wives commonly reproached their 
husbands for the pleasures they would go elsewhere to enjoy, 
and the fickle wife of Euphiletus took exception to his intima¬ 
cies with a mere slave girl. 10 More generally, public opinion 
expected a man who was about to be married to exhibit a 
certain change in his sexual behavior; it was understood that 
during youthful bachelorhood (it often happened that men 
would not marry before they reached thirty) one would read¬ 
ily tolerate an intensity and variety of pleasures that it was 
good to curtail after marriage, even though the latter did not 
explicitly impose any precise limitation. But apart from these 
common behaviors and attitudes, there also existed a concep¬ 
tual thematics of marital austerity. The moralists—some of 
them, at any rate—gave it to be understood in clear terms that 
a married man could not rightly feel free to indulge in pleas¬ 
ures as if he were not married. One was to hear Nicocles, in 
the speech Isocrates attributes to him, declare not only that 
he ruled his subjects justly, but that since his marriage he had 
had sexual relations only with his own wife. And Aristotle was 
to assert in the Politics that intercourse “of the husband with 
another woman, or the wife with another man” must be con¬ 
sidered “a dishonorable action.” An isolated and unimportant 
phenomenon? Already the birth of a new ethics? But as few 
in number as these texts are, and especially considering how 
far removed they are from real social practice and from the 
actual behavior of individuals, it is still pertinent to ask our¬ 
selves: why did moral reflection concern itself with the sexual 
behavior of married men? What was the nature of this con¬ 
cern, what was its origin, and what were its forms? 

We will do well in this connection to avoid two interpreta¬ 
tions, neither one of which seems entirely adequate. 



Economics 


149 


One of them would consist in thinking that intercourse 
between husband and wife had no other function for the 
Greeks in the classical period than the calculation which allied 
two families, two strategies, and two fortunes, and which had 
the sole objective of producing descendants. The Against Nea- 
era aphorism, which seems to sharply differentiate the roles 
that ought to be played in a man’s life by the courtesan, the 
concubine, and the wife, has sometimes been read as a triparti¬ 
tion that implies exclusive functions: sexual pleasure on one 
side, everyday life on the other, and for the wife nothing more 
than the maintenance of the line of descent. But one has to 
consider the context in which this harsh-sounding maxim was 
formulated. It was part of a litigant’s attempt to invalidate the 
apparently legitimate marriage of one of his enemies, as well 
as the claim to citizenship of the children born of that mar¬ 
riage. And the arguments given had to do with the wife’s birth, 
her past as a prostitute, and her current status, which could 
only be that of a concubine. The object therefore was not to 
show that pleasure was to be sought elsewhere than with the 
legal wife, but that legitimate descendants could not be ob¬ 
tained except with the wife herself. This is why, as Lacey 
comments, it would be a mistake to interpret this text as 
offering a definition of three distinct roles; it is more in the 
nature of a cumulative enumeration, to be read as follows: 
pleasure is the only thing a courtesan can give; as for the 
concubine, she is capable of providing the satisfactions of 
everyday life besides; but only the wife can exercise a certain 
function that is owing to her special status: she can bear 
legitimate children and ensure the continuity of the family 
institution. 11 It needs to be understood that in Athens mar¬ 
riage was not the only kind of union that was accepted; it 
actually formed a particular and privileged union, which alone 
could lead to matrimonial cohabitation and legitimate off¬ 
spring. Further, there exists a good deal of evidence testifying 
to the value that was attached to the wife’s beauty, to the 
importance of the sexual relations that one might have with 
her, and to the existence of mutual love (as in the play of Eros 



150 


The Use of Pleasure 


and Anteros that unites Niceratus and his wife in Xenophon’s 
Symposium). 11 The radical separation between marriage and 
the play of pleasures and passions is doubtless not an adequate 
formula for characterizing marital life in antiquity. 

By being too intent on detaching Greek marriage from 
affective and personal implications that did in fact assume 
much greater importance in later times, and by insisting on 
distinguishing it from subsequent forms of conjugality, one is 
led, by an opposite impulse, to draw too close a parallel be¬ 
tween the austere ethics of the philosophers and Christian 
morality. Often in these texts where good behavior is con¬ 
ceived, evaluated, and regulated in the form of “sexual 
fidelity,” people are tempted to perceive the first draft of a still 
nonexistent moral code: the code that was to symmetrically 
impose the same obligation on the two spouses to engage in 
sexual relations only within the marital union, and the same 
duty to give these relations procreation as the privileged if not 
exclusive aim. There is a tendency to regard the passages that 
Xenophon or Isocrates devote to the husband’s duties as “ex¬ 
ceptional in view of the morals of the time.” 13 They are excep¬ 
tional inasmuch as they are rare. But even so, is that a reason 
to see in them the anticipation of a future ethics or the sign 
heralding a new sensibility? That these texts have shown a 
retrospective similarity to later formulations is a fact. Does it 
suffice to sever this moral reflection and this demand for aus¬ 
terity from contemporaneous behaviors and attitudes? Is it a 
reason for seeing in them the isolated forerunner of an ethics 
to come? 

If one is willing to examine these texts, not for the bit of 
code they formulate, but for the manner in which the sexual 
behavior of men is problematized, one soon realizes that this 
problematization did not have to do with the marriage tie itself 
and with the direct, symmetrical, and reciprocal obligation 
that might derive from it. To be sure, it was insofar as he was 
married that a man needed to restrict his pleasures, or at least 
his partners; but being married in this case meant, above all. 



Economics 


151 


being the head of a family, having authority, exercising a 
power whose locus of application was in the “home,” and 
fulfilling household obligations that affected his reputation as 
a citizen. This is why reflection on marriage and the good 
behavior of husbands was regularly combined with reflection 
concerning the oikos (house and household). 

Thus, it becomes clear that the principle that obligated a 
man to have no partner outside the couple he formed was 
different in nature from that which tied a woman to an analo¬ 
gous obligation. In the case of the woman, it was insofar as 
she was under the authority of her husband that this obliga¬ 
tion was imposed on her. In the man’s case, it was because he 
exercised authority and because he was expected to exhibit 
self-mastery in the use of this authority, that he needed to limit 
his sexual options. For the wife, having sexual relations only 
with her husband was a consequence of the fact that she was 
under his control. For the husband, having sexual relations 
only with his wife was the most elegant way of exercising his 
control. This was not nearly so much the prefiguration of a 
symmetry that was to appear in the subsequent ethics, as it 
was the stylization of an actual dissymmetry. The restriction, 
which was analogous in what it allowed or forbade the two 
spouses, did not cover the same manner of “conducting one¬ 
self.” This is exemplified very well in a text devoted to the way 
in which a man was to conduct the affairs of his household and 
conduct himself as the master of the household.

Ischomachus’ 

Household 


Xenophon’s Oeconomicus contains the most fully devel¬ 
oped treatise on married life that classical Greece has left us. 
The text is presented as a set of precepts concerning the way 
to manage one’s estate. In conjunction with some specific 
advice on administering the domain, supervising the workers, 
undertaking different kinds of cultivation, applying the right 
techniques at the right time, and selling or buying as one 
should and when one should, Xenophon develops a number 
of general ideas: considerations on the need, in these matters, 
to rely on rational practices, which he sometimes designates 
by the term “knowledge” (episteme) and sometimes by the 
term signifying art or technique (techne); considerations on 
the goal to have in view (to preserve and develop the estate); 
and lastly, considerations on the means of achieving this ob¬ 
jective—that is, on the art of ruling. It is this theme that recurs 
most often through the whole length of the text. 

The mileu in which this analysis is placed is socially and 
politically quite distinct. It is the small society of landholders 
who must maintain and increase the family wealth and be¬ 
queath it to those who bear their name. Xenophon explicitly 
contrasts this world with that of craftsmen, whose life is not 
beneficial either to their own health (because of their way of 
living), or to their friends, or to the city (seeing that they do 
not have the leisure to attend to its affairs). 1 The activity of 
landowners, on the other hand, is practiced in the market- 

152

153 


place, in the agora, where they can fulfill their duties as friends 
and as citizens, as well as in the oikos. But the oikos comprises 
more than just the house proper; it also includes the fields and 
possessions, wherever they may be located (even outside the 
boundaries of the city): “whatever someone possesses is part 
of his household”; it defines a whole sphere of activities. 2 And 
this activity is connected to a lifestyle and an ethical order. 
The landowner’s existence, if he takes proper care of his estate, 
is good for him first of all; in any case it is an endurance 
exercise, physical training that is good for the body, for its 
health and vigor; it also encourages piety by making it possible 
to offer rich sacrifices to the gods; it favors friendship relations 
by providing the occasion to show generosity, to satisfy fully 
one’s hospitality obligations, and to manifest one’s beneficence 
toward other citizens. Further, this activity is useful to the 
entire city in that it adds to its wealth and especially because 
it supplies it with good defenders: the landowner, being used 
to strenuous work, is a strong soldier and the wealth he pos¬ 
sesses motivates him to courageously defend the homeland. 3 

All these personal and civic advantages of the landowner’s 
life center on what is given to be the principal merit of the 
“economic” art: it teaches the practice of commanding and is 
indissociable from the latter. To manage the oikos is to com¬ 
mand, and being in charge of the household is not different 
from the power that is to be exercised in the city. Socrates says 
to Nicomachides in the Memorabilia: “Don’t look down on 
businessmen. For the management of private concerns differs 
only in point of number from that of public affairs. In other 
respects they are much alike . . . those who take charge of 
public affairs employ just the same men when they attend to 
their own; and those who understand how to employ them are 
successful directors of public and private concerns.” 4 The dia¬ 
logue on “economics” is structured as a grand analysis of the 
art of commanding. The beginning of the text evokes Cyrus 
the Younger, who personally supervised the cultivation of his 
land, worked in his garden as a daily practice, and who had 



154 


The Use of Pleasure 


in this way acquired so much skill at leading men that when 
he was obliged to go to war, none of his soldiers ever deserted 
his army; rather than abandon him, they preferred to die 
fighting near his corpse. 5 In symmetrical fashion, the end of 
the text evokes the replica of that model ruler, such as one 
might find personified in those “great-minded” leaders whose 
armies always followed them without faltering, or in the estate 
master whose kingly ways sufficed to stir the workers to 
greater efforts as soon as they saw him, without his having to 
lose his temper, threaten, or punish. The domestic art was of 
the same nature as the political art or the military art, at least 
insofar as all three involved ruling others. 6 

It is in this framework of an art of “economy” that Xeno¬ 
phon introduces the problem of the relations between husband 
and wife. Now, the wife, as mistress of the house, is a key 
figure in the management of the oikos and she is essential for 
its good government. Socrates asks Critobulus: “Is there any¬ 
one to whom you entrust more serious matters than to your 
wife?”; and a little later, he adds: “I hold that a woman who 
is a good partner in the household is a proper counterweight 
to the man in attaining the good”; and in this sphere, “when 
things turn out well, the households increase, but when done 
badly, the households diminish.” 7 But, in spite of the wife’s 
importance, nothing has really prepared her to play the re¬ 
quired role, given her extreme youth, first of all, and the very 
brief education she has received (“Did you marry her when 
she was a very young girl and had seen and heard as little as 
possible?”), and also the near-total absence of relations with 
her husband, with whom she rarely converses (“is there any¬ 
one with whom you discuss fewer things than with your 
wife?”). 8 This is precisely where the need exists for the hus¬ 
band to establish relations with his wife that are for the pur¬ 
pose of training and guidance at the same time. In a society 
in which girls were given at a very young age—often around 
fifteen—to men who were often twice as old as they, the 
marital relationship, for which the oikos served as a support

and context, took the form of a pedagogy and a government 
of behavior. This was the husband’s responsibility. When the 
wife’s conduct, instead of bringing profit to the husband, 
caused him only detriment, who should get the blame? The 
husband. “When sheep fare badly, we usually fault the shep¬ 
herd, and when a horse behaves badly, we usually speak badly 
of the horseman; as for the woman, if she has been taught the 
good things by the man and still acts badly, the woman could 
perhaps justly be held at fault; on the other hand, if he doesn’t 
teach the fine and good things but makes use of her as though 
she is quite ignorant of them, wouldn’t the man justly be held 
at fault?” 9 

We see, then, that relations between spouses are not ques¬ 
tioned in themselves; they are not first seen as the simple 
relationship of a couple comprised of a man and a woman who 
might, in addition, have to attend to a house and family. 
Xenophon deals at length with the marital relation, but in an 
indirect, contextual, and technical fashion: he deals with it in 
the context of the oikos, as one aspect of the husband’s govern¬ 
mental responsibility and with a view to determining how the 
husband will be able to make his wife into the co-worker, the 
partner, the synergos he needs for the reasonable practice of 
economy. 

Ischomachus is asked to show that this technique can be 
taught; he has nothing more, and nothing less, in the way of 
teaching credentials than the fact of being a “gentleman”; he 
once found himself in the same situation as Critobulus is in; 
he married a woman who was quite young—she was fifteen, 
and her education had scarcely taught her more than how to 
make a cloak and how to give out the wool to the spinner 
maids; 10 but he had trained her so well and had made her such 
a valuable partner that he could put the house in her care 
while he went about his work, whether this was in the fields 
or in the agora —that is, in those places where male activity 
ought to be exercised in a privileged way. Thus, Ischomachus 
will set forth the principles of “economy,” the art of managing 



156 


The Use of Pleasure 


the oikos, for the benefit of Socrates and Critobulus. Before 
giving advice on administering an agricultural domain, he will 
quite naturally begin by speaking of the household proper, 
whose administration must be well thought out if one wishes 
to have the time to take care of the animals and the fields, and 
if one does not want all the effort expended there to be wasted 
on account of domestic disorder. 

1. Ischomachus recalls the first principle of marriage by 
citing the discourse he remembers having addressed to his 
young wife shortly after marriage, when she had become “ac¬ 
customed” to her husband and “domesticated to the extent 
that we could have discussions”: “Tell me, woman, have you 
thought yet why it was that I took you and your parents gave 
you to me?” Ischomachus answers the question himself: “I 
considered for myself, and your parents for you, whom we 
might take as the best partner for the household and chil¬ 
dren.” 11 The marriage bond is thus represented in its original 
dissymmetry—the man decides for himself whereas it is the 
family that decides for the young woman—and in its dual 
finality: the house and the children. We may note, further, that 
the question of descendants is left aside for the moment and 
that before being trained for motherhood, the young woman 
must become a good mistress of the house. 12 And Ischoma¬ 
chus shows that this role is that of partner; the respective 
contribution of each does not have to be taken into considera¬ 
tion,* but only the way each one acts with a view to the 
common goal, which is “to keep their substance in the best 
condition but also to add as much as possible to it by fine and 
just means.” 14 One should note this emphasis on the necessary 
equalization of initial differences between the husband and the 
wife, and on the partnership that must be established between 
them; and yet it is clear that this community, this koinonia, 
is not established in the dual relation between two individuals, 

•Ischomachus stresses this cancelling of differences between spouses, differences that 
may be substantial in terms of what each partner contributes. 1 ’

but is mediated by a common purpose, which is the household: 
its maintenance and also the dynamics of its increase. This will 
serve as a starting point for analyzing the forms of that “com¬ 
munity” and the specific nature of the roles that the two 
marriage partners should play. 

2. In order to define the respective functions of the two 
spouses in the household, Xenophon starts from the notion of 
the “shelter” (stegos): it seems that when the gods created the 
human couple, they were thinking of offspring and of the 
perpetuation of the race, of the support one needs in old age, 
and of the necessity “not to live in the open air, like beasts” 
—humans “obviously need shelter.” At first it looks as if 
descendants provide the family with its temporal dimension 
and shelter gives it its spatial organization. But things are a 
little more complex than that. The “shelter” does delimit an 
outside and an inside, the first being the man’s domain and the 
second constituting the privileged place of the woman; but it 
is also the place where they bring in, store, and preserve that 
which has been acquired; to shelter is to provide for future 
distribution at the right times. Outside, therefore, the man 
sows, cultivates, plows, and tends the flocks; he brings back 
the things he has produced, earned, or acquired through ex¬ 
change. Indoors, the woman for her part receives, preserves, 
and allocates according to need. Generally speaking, it is the 
husband’s activity that brings provisions into the house, but 
it is the wife’s management that regulates their expenditure. 15 
The two roles are exactly complementary and the absence of 
one would make the other useless: “My guarding and distribu¬ 
tion of the indoor things would look somewhat ridiculous,” 
says the wife, “if it weren’t your concern to bring in something 
from outside.” To which the husband replies that if there were 
no one to keep secure the things that are brought into the 
house, he would look as ridiculous as “those who are said to 
draw water with a leaking jar.” 16 Thus, two places, two forms 
of activity, and two ways of organizing time: on one side (that 



158 


The Use of Pleasure 


of the man), production, the rhythm of the seasons, waiting 
for the harvest, respecting and foreseeing the opportune time; 
on the other side (that of the woman), preservation and ex¬ 
penditure, ordering and distributing what is needed, orderly 
storage above all: Ischomachus dwells at length on all the 
advice he remembers giving his wife on how to store things in 
the space of the house so that she might find what she has put 
away, thus making her home a place of order and memory. 

In order that they might work together in the exercise of 
these different functions, the gods endowed each of the two 
sexes with particular qualities. Physical traits, first of all: to 
men, who must work in the open air “plowing, sowing, plant¬ 
ing, herding,” they gave the capacity to endure cold, heat, and 
journeys on foot; women, who work indoors, were given bod¬ 
ies that are less resistant. Character traits as well: women have 
a natural fear, but one that has positive effects—it induces 
them to be mindful of the provisions, to worry about losing 
them, to be in dread of using them up. The man, on the other 
hand, is brave, for he is obliged to defend himself outdoors 
against everything that might cause him injury. In short, “the 
god directly prepared the woman’s nature for indoor works 
and the man for works of the open air.” 17 But he also equipped 
them with common qualities: since in their respective roles 
men and women have to “give and take,” since in their activity 
as household managers they have to gather in and mete out, 
they both received memory and diligence (mneme and epi- 
meleia ). 18 

Hence each of the two marriage partners has a nature, a 
form of activity, and a place, which are defined in relation to 
the necessities of the oikos. That they remain steadfast part¬ 
ners is a good thing in the eyes of the “law,” the nomos —i.e., 
the regular custom that conforms exactly to nature’s inten¬ 
tions, assigns each person his role, and defines what is good 
and fine to do and not to do. This “law” declares good (kala) 
“what the god has brought forth each to be capable of”: hence 
“it is a finer thing [kallion \ for the woman to stay indoors than 



Economics 


159 


to spend her time in the open” and not good for the man “to 
stay indoors instead of concerning himself with outdoor 
things.” To alter this division, going from one activity to the 
other, is to be in contempt of this nomos; it is at the same time 
to go against nature and to abandon one’s place: “When some¬ 
one acts in a way contrary to what the god has brought forth, 
perhaps in causing some disorder [atakton ] he is noticed by 
the gods and pays the penalty for neglecting his own works or 
for doing the woman’s works.” 19 The natural oppositeness of 
man and woman and the specificity of their aptitudes are 
indissociably tied to the good order of the household; they are 
designed for this order, and inversely, order demands them as 
obligations. 

3. This text, so detailed when it is a matter of determining 
the division of household tasks, is quite discrete on the ques¬ 
tion of sexual relations, both in terms of their place in the 
marital relationship and in regard to the prohibitions that 
might result from marriage as such. It is not that the impor¬ 
tance of having descendants is neglected; the fact is noted 
several times in the course of Ischomachus’ speech: he re¬ 
marks that it is one of the main objectives of marriage;* he also 
points out that nature has endowed the woman with a special 
affection that makes her better suited to take care of children; 
and he remarks how fortunate it is when one grows old to find 
the support that one needs in one’s children. 21 But nothing is 
said in this text about either procreation itself or the precau¬ 
tions to take in order to have the finest possible offspring: it 
is not yet time to take up this kind of question with the young 
bride. 

And yet several passages do refer to sexual conduct, to the 
necessary moderation and to the physical attachment between 
husband and wife. We first have to recall the very beginning 
of the text, where the two interlocutors start to talk about 

*He specifies that the deity brings the man and woman together with a view to 
children, and the law makes them partners with a view to the household . 20 



160 


The Use of Pleasure 


economy as a knowledge that enables one to manage a house¬ 
hold. Socrates evokes those people who have the talents and 
resources but refuse to put them to work because they obey 
invisible masters or mistresses within themselves: indolence, 
softness of soul, insouciance, but also—mistresses more inflex¬ 
ible than the others—gluttony, drunkenness, lust, and foolish, 
expensive ambitions. Those who yield to this sort of despotism 
of the appetites will only bring ruin to their bodies, their souls, 
and their households. 22 But Critobulus prides himself on hav¬ 
ing already defeated these enemies; his moral training has 
supplied him with a sufficient amount of enkrateia: “On exam¬ 
ining myself I seem to find I am fairly self-controlled in such 
matters, so that if you advise me about what I might do to 
increase my household, it seems to me I wouldn’t be prevented 
from doing it, at least by those things you call mistresses.” 23 
This is what entitles Critobulus to say that he is now ready to 
play the role of master of a household and to learn the difficult 
tasks that are involved. It has to be understood that marriage, 
the functions of a head of a family, and the government of an 
oikos presuppose that one has acquired the ability to govern 
oneself. 

Further on, in Ischomachus’ listing of different qualities 
with which nature has supplied each of the two sexes in order 
for them to play their domestic roles, he mentions self-control 
(enkrateia). He does not describe it as a trait belonging specifi¬ 
cally to the man or the woman, but as a virtue common to both 
sexes, like memory and diligence; individual differences may 
modulate the distribution of this quality; and what shows its 
high value in married life is that it is awarded to the better of 
the marriage partners: be it the husband or the wife, the better 
one has the larger share of this virtue. 24 

Now, in the case of Ischomachus, we see how his self- 
restraint is manifested for its own sake and how it guides that 
of his wife. As a matter of fact, there is an incident spoken of 
in the dialogue that relates rather explicitly to certain aspects 
of the sexual life of the couple: I am thinking of the one having 



Economics 


161 


to do with makeup and face paint. 25 This is an important 
theme in ancient morality, for adornment posed the problem 
of the relationships between truth and the pleasures, and by 
bringing the play of artifice into the latter, it confused the 
principles of their natural regulation. The question of coquetry 
in Ischomachus’ wife has nothing to do with her faithfulness, 
which is taken for granted throughout the text; nor does it 
concern her lack of thrift: it is a matter of knowing how the 
wife can display herself and be recognized by her husband as 
an object of pleasure and a sexual partner in the marital rela¬ 
tion. It is this question that Ischomachus addresses, in the 
form of a lesson, one day when, thinking to please him (by 
seeming to have “a fairer complexion” than she really has, 
“rosier” cheeks, and a “taller and more slender” figure), his 
wife appears before him perched on high sandals and all made 
up with ceruse and alkanet dye. Ischomachus will respond to 
this reprehensible behavior by giving a two-part lesson. 

The first part is negative; it consists in criticizing makeup 
as deception. This deception may fool strangers, but there is 
no way it can delude a man with whom one lives and who 
therefore has the possibility of seeing his wife when she rises 
from her bed, when she is sweating or in tears, and when she 
leaves her bath. But most important, Ischomachus criticizes 
this trickery for violating a basic principle of marriage. Xeno¬ 
phon does not appeal directly to the long-lived and often 
encountered aphorism that said marriage was a community 
(koinonia) of property, of life, and of bodies; but it is clear that 
the theme of a threefold community is at work throughout the 
text: a community of property concerning which the author 
declares that each partner ought to forget the share he or she 
has contributed; a community of life that makes the prosperity 
of the estate one of its objectives; and a community of bodies 
that is explicitly emphasized (ton somaton koinonesantes). 
Now, the community of property rules out deception; and the 
man would behave badly toward his wife if he made her think 
he possessed more than was really the case; in the same way, 



162 


The Use of Pleasure 


they must not try to deceive one another about their bodies; 
for his part, he would not apply vermilion to his face; in the 
same way, she must not embellish herself with ceruse. The just 
community of bodies demands this consideration. The attrac¬ 
tion that should come into play between husband and wife is 
the kind that expresses itself naturally—as in every animal 
species—between male and female: “Just as the gods have 
made horses most pleasant to horses, oxen to oxen, and sheep 
to sheep, so human beings [anthropoi] suppose the undisguised 
body of a human being is most pleasant.” 26 It is natural attrac¬ 
tion that should serve as the basis for sexual relations between 
spouses and for the community of bodies they constitute. 
Ischomachus’ enkrateia rejects all the artifices that people use 
in order to increase desires and pleasures. 

But a question arises: how can the wife remain an object of 
desire for her husband? How can she be sure of not being 
supplanted someday by someone younger and prettier? The 
young wife of Ischomachus asks him directly: what can she do 
not just to seem beautiful but to be beautiful and remain so? 27 
And once again, by a logic that may appear strange to us, the 
household and the government of the household will be the 
crucial factor. According to Ischomachus, at any rate, the 
wife’s real beauty is sufficiently guaranteed by her household 
occupations, provided that she goes about them in the right 
way. He explains that by performing her appointed tasks, she 
will not sit about, huddled up like a slave, or remain idle like 
a coquette. She will stand, she will observe, she will supervise, 
she will go from room to room checking the work that is in 
progress; standing and walking will give her body that certain 
demeanor, that carriage which in the eyes of the Greeks cha¬ 
racterized the physique of the free individual (Ischomachus 
will later show that a man becomes vigorous as a soldier and 
free citizen through his active participation in the responsibili¬ 
ties of a taskmaster). 28 In the same way, it is good for the 
mistress of the house to mix flour and knead dough, and to 
shake out and fold the bedcovers. 29 In this way the body’s 



Economics 


163 


handsomeness will be shaped and maintained; the condition of 
mastery has its physical version, which is beauty. Further, the 
wife’s clothes have a freshness and elegance that set her apart 
from her servants. In any case, she will always enjoy an advan¬ 
tage over the latter from the fact that she seeks willingly to 
please instead of being obliged to submit under compulsion 
like a slave girl. Here Xenophon seems to be referring to the 
same principle he evokes elsewhere: the pleasure that one 
takes by force is much less agreeable than that which is freely 
offered. 30 It is the latter pleasure that the wife can give her 
husband. Thus, by virtue of the forms of a physical beauty that 
is indissociable from her privileged status and by virtue of her 
unconstrained willingness to gratify (charizesthai), the mis¬ 
tress of the household will always be preeminent over the 
other women of the household. 

In this text devoted to the “masculine” art of governing a 
household—wife, servants, estate—there is no allusion to the 
sexual faithfulness of the wife or to the fact that her husband 
should be her only sexual partner: this is taken for granted as 
a necessary principle. As for the self-restrained attitude of the 
husband, it is never defined as the monopoly over all his sexual 
activity which he would concede to his wif e. What is at stake 
in this reflective practice of marital life, what appears as essen¬ 
tial to the orderliness of the household, to the peace that must 
reign within it, and to the woman’s expectations, is that she 
be able, as the lawful wife, to keep the preeminent place that 
marriage has assigned to her: not to see another woman given 
preference over her, not to suffer a loss of status and dignity, 
not to be replaced at her husband’s side by another—this was 
what mattered to her above all else. For the threat to marriage 
did not come from the pleasure which the husband happened 
to enjoy here or there, but from the rivalries that might form 
between the wife and the other women over one’s position in 
the household and over the order of precedence to be ob¬ 
served. The “faithful” husband (pistos) was not the one who 
linked the state of marriage to the renunciation of all sexual 



164 


The Use of Pleasure 


pleasure enjoyed with someone else; it was the husband who 
steadfastly maintained the privileges to which the wife was 
entitled by marriage. Moreover, this is how the “betrayed” 
women who appear in Euripides’ tragedies understand the 
matter. Medea complains bitterly of Jason’s “unfaithfulness”: 
he has forsaken her for a royal bride and he will beget descend¬ 
ants who will reduce his children by Medea to a state of 
humiliation and servitude. 31 What makes Creusa lament the 
imagined “betrayal” of Xuthus is the thought of living “a 
childless life, in a house forsaken and solitary”; it is that—at 
least this is what she is made to believe—“into her house,” 
which was the house of Erechtheus, will come “a motherless 
nobody, some slave’s brat.” 32 

This preeminence of the wife, which the husband must 
protect, was implied by the act of marriage. But it was not 
acquired once and for all; it was not guaranteed by any moral 
pledge on the part of the husband; even in addition to the 
possibility of repudiation and divorce, there was always the 
threat of a de facto loss of prestige. Now, what Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus and Ischomachus’ discourse show is that while 
the husband’s wisdom—his enkrateia but also his knowledge 
as head of a family—was always ready to acknowledge the 
wife’s privileges, the wife, if she was to preserve them, must 
in return exercise her function in the house and accomplish 
the tasks that were associated with it in the best possible way. 
Ischomachus does not promise his wife at the outset either 
“sexual fidelity” in the way we understand it, or even that she 
will never have to fear any other preference on his part; but 
just as he assures her that her activity as mistress of the house, 
her bearing and her way of dressing, will give her a greater 
charm than that of the servants, he also assures her that she 
can keep the place of honor in the house until old age. And 
he suggests a kind of contest between the two of them to see 
who behaves best and who is the most diligent in caring for 
the household; if she manages to win, she will then have 
nothing more to fear from any sort of rival, even a young one. 



Economics 


165 


“But the most pleasant thing of all: if you look to be better 
than I and make me your servant, you will have no need to 
fear that with advancing age you will be honored any less in 
the household, and you may trust that as you grow older, the 
better a partner you prove to be for me, and for the children 
a better guardian of the household, by so much more will you 
be honored in the household.” 33 

In this ethics of married life, the “fidelity” that is recom¬ 
mended to the husband is therefore something quite different 
from the sexual exclusivity that marriage imposes on the wife. 
It has to do with maintaining the wife’s status and privileges, 
and her preeminence over other women. And while it does 
imply a certain reciprocity of behavior between the man and 
the woman, this is in the sense that the man’s faithfulness 
would correspond not so much to the good sexual conduct of 
the wife, which is always presupposed, but to the way in which 
she conducts the household and conducts herself in the house¬ 
hold. A reciprocity, then, but a fundamental dissymmetry 
since the two interdependent behaviors are not based on the 
same exigencies and do not obey the same principles. The 
husband’s self-restraint pertains to an art of governing—gov¬ 
erning in general, governing oneself, and governing a wife who 
must be kept under control and respected at the same time, 
since in relation to her husband she is the obedient mistress 
of the household.

Three Policies of 
Moderation 


Other texts, dating from the fourth century and the begin¬ 
ning of the fifth, also develop the theme that the state of 
marriage calls for at least some form of sexual moderation. 
Three of these texts are especially noteworthy: the passage in 
the Laws where Plato discusses the rules and obligations of 
marriage; Isocrates’ exposition concerning the way Nicocles 
manages his life as a married man; and a treatise on economics 
attributed to Aristotle and definitely a product of his school. 
These texts are very different from one another in their subject 
matter: the first offers a system of authoritarian regulation of 
behaviors in the context of an ideal city; the second character¬ 
izes the personal lifestyle of an autocrat who is respectful of 
himself and others; the third seeks to define the principles that 
any man will find useful for directing his household. In any 
case, unlike Xenophon’s Oeconomicus, none of them refers to 
the appropriate way of life of a landowner nor consequently 
to the tasks associated with the management of an estate, tasks 
that he must assume in complementarity with his wife. In spite 
of the differences that separate them, these texts all seem to 
emphasize—more clearly than that of Xenophon—a demand 
resembling something that could be called the principle of 
“double sexual monopoly”; that is, they seem to want to local¬ 
ize a whole class of sexual activity, both for the man and for 
the woman, in the marital relation alone. In the same way as 
his spouse, the man is presented as being obligated, or at least 

166 



Economics 


167 


disposed, not to seek his pleasure with anyone else but her. A 
demand for a certain symmetry, therefore; and a tendency to 
define marriage not just as the privileged place, but perhaps 
as the only place for morally acceptable sexual relations. How¬ 
ever, a reading of these three texts shows that it would clearly 
be a mistake to project onto them retrospectively a principle 
of “reciprocal sexual fidelity” like the one that served as a 
juridico-moral pillar for later forms of matrimonial practice. 
The fact is that in all these texts, the obligation the husband 
is under, or the recommendation that is made to him, to be 
moderate to the extent of having no other sexual partner but 
his own wife is not the result of a personal commitment he 
might make with respect to her; it is the result of a political 
regulation that is imposed by fiat in the case of the Platonic 
laws, or—in the case of Isocrates or Aristotle—by the hus¬ 
band himself through a sort of deliberate self-limitation of 
his power. 

1. Thus, when it is stipulated in the Laws that one should 
marry at the proper age (for men, between the ages of twenty- 
five and thirty-five), beget children in the best possible condi¬ 
tions, and not have relations—whether one is a man or a 
woman—with anyone other than one’s marriage partner, all 
these injunctions take the form, not of a voluntary ethics, but 
of a coercive regimentation; it is true that the author remarks 
several times on the difficulty of legislating in this area and on 
the desirability for some measures to take the form of an 
ordinance only in the case of disorders and where the greatest 
number is no longer capable of moderation. 1 In any case, the 
principles of this moral code are always directly referred to the 
needs of the state, and never to the internal demands of the 
household, the family, or married life: one should bear in mind 
that the good marriage is the one that benefits the city and it 
is for the sake of the latter that the children ought to be “the 
noblest and best possible.” 2 Unions that—with respect to pro¬ 
portions beneficial to the state—should not be instances of the 



168 


The Use of Pleasure 


rich marrying the rich; 3 meticulous inspections that would 
verify that young couples are carefully preparing themselves 
for the procreative task; 4 the injunction, backed up by penal¬ 
ties, to inseminate only one’s lawful wife without having any 
other sexual relations during the period in which one is capa¬ 
ble of procreation 5 —all this is tied to the particular structures 
of an ideal city and is rather foreign to a style of moderation 
based on the voluntary pursuit of moderation.* 

It should be noted, however, that Plato puts only a limited 
amount of trust in the law when it is a question of regulating 
sexual conduct. He does not believe it will achieve adequate 
results if one does not use measures other than its prescrip¬ 
tions and threats for controlling such violent desires. 7 More 
effective means of persuasion are needed for this, and Plato 
lists four. (1) Public opinion: Plato refers to what happens in 
the case of incest; how is it, he asks, that men have come to 
the point where they don’t even feel any desire for their broth¬ 
ers and sisters, their sons and daughters, however beautiful 
they may be? The explanation is that they have heard it said 
constantly that these acts are “hateful to the gods” and that 
no one has ever had the occasion to hear different pronounce¬ 
ments on the subject; what is needed, therefore, in regard to 
all blameworthy sexual acts, is for “the unanimous public 
voice” to be similarly “sanctified.” (2) Glory: Plato cites the 
example of athletes who, in their desire to win a victory in the 
games, place themselves under a strict regimen, not going near 
a woman, or a boy either, the whole time of their training: 
surely victory over those internal enemies, the pleasures, is 
finer than the victory one may win over rivals. 9 (3) The honor 
of the human being: Here Plato gives an example that will be 
used often subsequently; he speaks of those animals which live 
in bands, each in the midst of others, but “which live celibate, 

•Note that once past the age limit for having children, “the man or woman 
who behaves moderately [sophrorion kai sophronousa] in all such respects should be 
accorded an entirely good reputation; he who behaves in the opposite fashion should 
be honored in the opposite way—or rather dishonored .” 6 



Economics 


169 


pure, and chaste”; when the age for procreation is reached, 
they separate from the group and pair into couples that will 
last. Now, it will be noticed that this animal conjugality is not 
cited as a natural principle that would be universal, but rather 
as a challenge that men ought to take up: how could calling 
attention to such a practice fail to prompt reasonable men to 
prove themselves “superior to the beasts.” 10 (4) Shame: By 
reducing the frequency of sexual activity, shame will “weaken 
the sway of this mistress”; without there being the need to 
prohibit the acts, it will be held “noble to engage in them if 
one escapes notice,” and people will have to learn that to 
commit them openly is “shameful” by “the custom laid down 
in habit and unwritten law.” 11 

Hence Plato’s legislation does set a requirement that is 
symmetrical for the man and the woman, each on their own 
account. It is because they have a certain role to play for the 
common purpose—that of father and mother of future citizens 
—that they are bound exactly in the same way by the same 
laws, which impose the same restrictions on both. But it is 
important to see that this symmetry in no way implies that 
husband and wife are held to “sexual fidelity” by a personal 
bond that would be intrinsic to the matrimonial relation and 
constitute a mutual commitment. The symmetry is not based 
on a direct and reciprocal relation between the two, but on an 
element that dominates both of them: principles and laws to 
which they are both subjected in the same way. It is true that 
their compliance must be voluntary, the result of an internal 
persuasion; but the latter does not involve an attachment they 
should have for one another; it involves the reverence one 
should feel for the law, or the concern one should have for 
oneself, one’s reputation, one’s honor. The relation of the 
individual to himself and to his city in the form of respect or 
shame, honor or glory—not the relation to the other person 
—is what imposes this obedience. 

And we may note that in Plato’s proposal for the law con¬ 
cerning “the choices of love,” he envisages two possible for- 



170 


The Use of Pleasure 


mulations. According to one, every individual would be for¬ 
bidden to touch any woman of good birth who is not his lawful 
wife, to procreate outside of marriage, and to “go against 
nature and sow sterile seed in males.” The other formulation 
repeats the prohibition against male love relations, making it 
absolute this time; as for extramarital sexual relations, he 
contemplates punishment only in cases where the wrongdoing 
would not go unnoticed by “all men and women.”* Clearly, 
then, the double obligation to limit sexual activities relates to 
the stability of the city, to its public morality, to the conditions 
of good procreation, and not to the reciprocal obligations that 
attach to a dual relation between husbands and wives. 

2. In the text by Isocrates, which has the form of an 
address by Nicocles to his fellow citizens, an explicit connec¬ 
tion is established between the views on moderation and mar¬ 
riage it sets forth and the exercise of political power. This 
speech is a companion piece to the one Isocrates addressed to 
Nicocles shortly after the latter came to power: the orator gave 
the young man advice on personal conduct and government, 
advice that ought to serve him well for the rest of his life. 
Nicocles’ speech is supposed to be an address by the monarch 
in which he explains to his subjects how they ought to behave 
toward him. Now, the whole first part of the text is devoted 
to justifying his power: the merits of a monarchical regime, the 
rights of the ruling family, the personal qualities of the ruler; 
and it is only once these justifications have been given that the 
obedience and attachment the citizens owe their ruler will be 
defined. By reason of his special virtues, the monarch is enti¬ 
tled to demand his subjects’ submission. Nicocles will there¬ 
fore dwell at some length on the qualities he sees himself as 
having: first, the justice— dikaiosyne —he has manifested in 

♦Note that, at least in the first formulation of the law, Plato seems to say that only 
women who are "free” and of “good birth” are forbidden to a married man. At any 
rate this is how Dies translates the passage. Robin interprets the text as meaning that 
this law applies only to free men of good birth . 12

financial affairs, in matters of penal jurisdiction, and in the 
good relations he has established or reestablished with the 
foreign powers; 13 next, his sophrosyne, his moderation, which 
he speaks of as if it were nothing but the control of sexual 
pleasures. And he explains the forms and reasons of this mod¬ 
eration in direct connection with the sovereign authority he 
exercises in his country. 

The last consideration he invokes concerns his lineage and 
the necessity of a bastardless race that can claim the distinc¬ 
tion of a noble birth and the continuity of a genealogy that can 
be traced all the way back to the gods: “Nor was I of the same 
mind as most kings in regard to the begetting of children. I 
did not think I should have some children by a woman of 
humbler station and others by one of higher degree, nor that 
I should leave after me bastard progeny, as well as progeny of 
legitimate birth; but that all my children should be able to 
trace their lineage back through the same father and the same 
mother to Evagoras, my father, among mortals, to the Aea- 
cides among the demigods, and to Zeus among the gods, and 
that not one of the children sprung from my loins should be 
cheated of this noble origin.” 14 

Another reason for Nicocles to be moderate has to do with 
the continuity and homogeneity between the government of a 
state and that of a household. This continuity is defined in two 
ways: by the principle that one should respect all associations 
(koinoniai) that one has formed with others; thus Nicocles 
does not want to be like those men who respect their other 
commitments but behave badly toward a wife, despite the 
lifelong association (koinonia pantos tou biouj they have 
formed with her: since one does not feel obliged to suffer any 
hurt from one’s wife, one must not make her suffer any be¬ 
cause of the pleasures that one enjoys; the king who wishes to 
be just must be so with his own wife. 15 But there is also the 
continuity and a kind of isomorphism between the good order 
that should reign in the monarch’s house and the order that 
should prevail in his government: “If kings are to rule well, 



172 


The Use of Pleasure 


they must try to preserve harmony, not only in the states over 
which they hold dominion, but also in their own households 
and in their places of abode; for all these things are the works 
of temperance and justice.” 16 

The link between moderation and power that Nicocles re¬ 
fers to throughout the text is conceived primarily as an essen¬ 
tial relationship between dominion over others and dominion 
over oneself, following the general principle that was stated in 
the discourse addressed to Nicocles: “Govern yourself no less 
than your subjects, and consider that you are in the highest 
sense a king when you are a slave to no pleasure, but rule over 
your desires more firmly than over your people.” 17 As for this 
self-mastery as a moral precondition for leading others, Nico¬ 
cles starts out by proving that he has it: unlike so many 
tyrants, he has not used his power to possess himself of other 
men’s wives and children by force; he has been mindful of how 
attached men are to their spouses and their progeny and of 
how often political crises and revolutions originated in abuses 
of this nature; 18 * he has therefore taken the greatest care to 
avoid such reproaches: no one can charge him with having 
had physical relations “with any person other than his wife” 
from the time he took the supreme office. 20 Nicocles has more 
positive reasons for being moderate, however. First, he wants 
to be an example to his fellow citizens; doubtless this does not 
mean that he expects the inhabitants of his country to practice 
the same sexual faithf ulness as he; it is unlikely that he intends 
to make a general rule of it; the strictness of his morals should 
be understood as a general invitation to be virtuous and as a 
model standing against the laxity that is always harmful to the 
state. 21 This principle of a rough analogy between the morals 
of the prince and those of the people was alluded to in the 
address to Nicocles: “Let your own self-control [sophrosyne] 
stand as an example to the rest, realizing that the manners 
[ethos] of the whole state are copied from its rulers. Let it be 

*We may note that Isocrates does remark on the people's forbearance for leaders who 
take their pleasure everywhere but still govern justly . 1 ' 1

a sign to you that you rule wisely if you see all your subjects 
growing more prosperous and more temperate [euporoterous 
kai sophronesterous gignomenous ] because of your oversight 
[epimeleia]." 22 But Nicocles would not be content merely to 
make the majority behave like him; at the same time, and 
without there being a contradiction, he wants to be distin¬ 
guished from others, from the elite and even from those who 
are the most virtuous. What we are dealing with, therefore, is 
the moral formula of example (to be a model for everyone by 
being better than the best) combined with the political formula 
of competition for personal power in an aristocracy and the 
principle of a stable basis for wise and moderate tyranny (to 
be, in the eyes of the people, better endowed with virtue than 
the most virtuous): “I saw that while the majority of people 
are masters of themselves in other matters, even the best are 
slaves to the passions whose objects are boys and women; and 
therefore I wanted to show that I could be strong in those 
things in which I should be superior, not merely to people 
in general, but even to those who pride themselves on their 
virtue.” 23 

But it is essential to understand that this virtue that func¬ 
tions as an example and a sign of superiority does not owe its 
political value simply to the fact that it is an honorable behav¬ 
ior in everyone’s eyes. In reality, as far as the subjects are 
concerned, it reveals the form of relationship that the prince 
maintains with himself. This is an important political point 
because it is this relationship with the self that modulates and 
regulates the use the prince makes of the power he exercises 
over others. It is therefore important in itself, for the visible 
excellence it displays, and because of the rational frame that 
braces it. This is why Nicocles points out that his sophrosyne 
has passed a test before everyone’s witness; there are clearly 
circumstances and ages in which it is not difficult to show that 
one can be just and forgo money and pleasure; but when one 
assumes power in the midst of one’s youth, to give proof of 
moderation then constitutes a kind of qualifying test. 24 More- 



174 


The Use of Pleasure 


over, he makes it clear that his virtue is not just a matter of 
nature but a result of reasoning (logismos) as well: conse¬ 
quently, his good behavior will not be due to chance or cir¬ 
cumstance; it will be deliberate and constant. 

Thus, the prince’s moderation, tested in the most hazardous 
of situations, and ensured by the continuous exercise of rea¬ 
son, serves as the basis of a sort of compact between the ruler 
and the ruled: the latter can obey him, seeing that he is master 
of himself. One can demand the subjects’ obedience, since it 
is warranted by the prince’s virtue. The prince is indeed capa¬ 
ble of moderating the power he exercises over others by means 
of the mastery he establishes over himself. This is in fact how 
the passage ends where Nicocles, having finished talking about 
himself, draws on what he has said in order to exhort his 
subjects to obey him: “The reason I have spoken at some 
length about myself ... is that I might leave you no excuse 
for not doing willingly and zealously whatever I counsel and 
command.” 25 The prince’s relationship with himself and the 
manner in which he forms himself as an ethical subject are an 
important component of the political structure; his austerity 
is part of it, contributing to its solidity. The prince, too, must 
practice an ascesis and exercise himself: “Therefore, no athlete 
is so called upon to train his body as is a king to train his soul; 
for not all the public festivals in the world offer a price compa¬ 
rable to those for which you who are kings strive every day 
of your lives.” 26 * 

3. As for the Economics attributed to Aristotle, we are 
aware of the difficulties with respect to the date of its composi¬ 
tion. The text that forms Books I and II is rather generally 
recognized as being from the “right period”—either edited 
from notes by an immediate disciple of Aristotle or the work 
of one of the very first generations of Peripatetics. In any case, 
we can leave aside the third part for the moment, or at least 

*The theme of the prince’s private virtue as a political problem would merit a whole 
study of its own.

the Latin text, which has been regarded as a “version” or an 
“adaptation” of the “lost” third book of the Economics. Much 
shorter and infinitely less rich than the text by Xenophon, 
Book I is likewise presented as a reflection on the art (techne) 
of economics. It aims to explain how to “own” a household 
and how to “make use of” it (ktesasthai, chresasthai). 27 The 
text purports to be an art of governing, and not so much things 
as people. This is in keeping with a principle stated elsewhere 
by Aristotle; namely, that in economics one is more concerned 
with persons than with inanimate property. 28 And the treatise 
Economics actually does devote the bulk of its instructions 
(without giving much space to the techniques of cultivation, 
as Xenophon does) to the tasks of leadership, oversight, and 
control. It is a master’s manual, for a master who must “con¬ 
cern himself” (epimelein) first and foremost with his wife. 29 

This text promotes more or less the same values as the 
treatise by Xenophon: praise of agriculture, which is capable 
of forming “virile” individuals, unlike the handicrafts and 
trades; affirmation of its primordial and fundamental charac¬ 
ter as determined by nature, and of its integral value for the 
city. 30 But many of its elements also carry the Aristotelian 
stamp; in particular, the emphasis on both the natural basis 
of the marital relation and the specificity of its form in human 
society. 

The partnership (koinonia) of man and woman is presented 
by the author as being something that exists “by nature” and 
as being exemplified among the animals: “their common life 
has necessarily arisen.” 31 This is a constant argument in Aris¬ 
totle—whether in the Politics, where this necessity is linked 
directly to procreation, or in the Nicomachean Ethics, which 
presents man as being a naturally “syndastic” creature des¬ 
tined to live in pairs. 32 But the author of the Economics re¬ 
marks that this koinonia has peculiar features not found in the 
other animal species: other animals practice forms of associa¬ 
tion that go well beyond mere procreative coupling, so it is not 
that; 33 it is that in humans, the finality of the tie that unites 



176 


The Use of Pleasure 


man and woman concerns not just “being” but “well-being” 
(einai, eu einai )—an important distinction in Aristotle. In 
humans, in any case, the existence of the couple allows for 
mutual help and support throughout existence; as for their 
offspring, they do not merely ensure the survival of the species; 
they are a means of “securing advantage” for the parents, for 
“the care which parents bestow on their helpless children 
when they are themselves vigorous is repaid to them in old age 
when they are helpless by their children, who are then in full 
vigor.” 34 And it was with this life enhancement in mind that 
nature arranged man and woman in the way that she did; it 
was with a view to their common life that “she organized both 
sexes.” The first is strong, the second is held back by fear; one 
finds his health in movement, the other is inclined to live a 
sedentary life; one brings provisions back to the house, the 
other watches over what is there; one nurtures the children, 
the other educates them. In a manner of speaking, nature has 
programmed the household economy and the parts that both 
spouses must take within it. Here, starting from Aristotelian 
principles, the author links up with the general outline of a 
traditional description, which had already been illustrated by 
Xenophon. 

It is immediately after this analysis of natural complemen¬ 
tarities that the author of the Economics addresses the ques¬ 
tion of sexual behavior. And this comes in a brief, elliptical 
passage that is worth quoting in its entirety: “First, then, he 
must do her no wrong, for thus a man is less likely himself to 
be wronged. This is indicated by the general law, as the Py¬ 
thagoreans say, that one least of all should injure a wife as 
being ‘a suppliant and taken from her hearth.’ Now wrong 
inflicted by a husband is the formation of connections outside 
his own house [thyraze synousiai ].” 35 It is hardly surprising 
that nothing is said about the wife’s conduct, since in her case 
the rules are well known and since we are dealing here with 
a manual for masters: it is their way of acting that is in 
question. We may also note that there is nothing said—here 



Economics 


177 


or in Xenophon—about what the husband’s sexual behavior 
should be with respect to his wife, nothing about fulfilling the 
marital obligation, or about the rules of modesty. But the main 
concern is elsewhere. 

We may note first of all that the text situates the question 
of sexual relations squarely within the general framework of 
relations of justice between husband and wife. Now, what do 
these relations involve? What forms must they have? In spite 
of the text’s declaration a little earlier regarding the need to 
determine what kind of “association” (homilia) should unite 
man and woman, nothing is said in the Economics concerning 
its general form or its principle. In other texts, however, and 
particularly in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Politics, Aris¬ 
totle does reply to this question when he analyzes the political 
nature of the marriage tie; that is, the type of authority that 
is exercised within marriage. In his view, the relationship 
between man and wife is plainly nonegalitarian, since it is the 
man’s role to govern the wife (the reverse situation, which can 
be due to several causes, is “contrary to nature”). 36 However, 
this inequality must be carefully distinguished from three 
other inequalities: that which separates the master from the 
slave (the wife is a free being), that which separates a father 
from his children (and which makes for a kingly type of 
authority), and lastly, that which in a city separates the citi¬ 
zens who rule from those who are ruled. While the husband’s 
authority is in fact weaker, less total than in the first two 
relations, it does not have the provisional character one finds 
in the “political” relation in the strict sense of the term; that 
is, in relations between citizens in a state. This is because 
under a free constitution the citizens take turns ruling and 
being ruled, whereas in the household the man must always 
maintain superiority. 37 An inequality of free beings, therefore, 
but one that is permanent and based on a natural difference. 
It is in this sense that the political form of the association of 
husband and wife will be aristocracy: a government in which 
it is always the best who rules, but where everyone receives his 



178 


The Use of Pleasure 


share of authority, his role, and his functions according to his 
merit and his worth. As the Nicomachean Ethics expresses it: 
“The association of man and wife seems to be aristocratic; for 
the man rules in accordance with his fitness [kat’axian], and 
in those matters in which man should rule”; which implies, as 
in every aristocratic government, that he will delegate to his 
wife the part she is suited to play (if he tried to do everything 
by himself, the husband would transform his authority into an 
“oligarchy”). 38 The relationship with the wife is thus posited 
as a question of justice which is linked directly to the “politi¬ 
cal” nature of the marriage bond. Between father and son, says 
the Magna Moralia, the relationship cannot be one of justice, 
at least so long as the son has still not gained his independence, 
for he is only “a part of his father”; nor can it be a question 
of justice between master and servants unless by this is meant 
a justice “of the economic or household kind.” The same does 
not hold with the wife: doubtless the latter is and will always 
be inferior to the man, and the justice that should govern 
relations between spouses cannot be the same as the justice 
that obtains between citizens; and yet, because of their resem¬ 
blance, man and wife should be in a relationship that “ap¬ 
proaches near to political justice.” 39 Now, in the Economics 
passage where it is a question of the sexual behavior that the 
husband ought to exhibit, the author seems to be referring to 
a very different kind of justice; recalling a Pythagorean obser¬ 
vation, he declares that the wife is like “a suppliant and taken 
from her hearth.” However, a closer look at this passage 
indicates that this reference to the suppliant—and more gener¬ 
ally, to the fact that the wife was born in another household 
and that in her husband’s house she is not “at home”—is not 
meant to define the type of relations that should ordinarily 
obtain between a man and his wife. These relations, in their 
positive form and their conformity with the nonegalitarian 
justice that should govern them, had been spoken of indirectly 
in the preceding passage. We may suppose that by evoking the 
figure of the suppliant the author is saying that the marriage 



Economics 


179 


itself does not authorize the wife to demand sexual faithf ulness 
of her husband, but that there is something in the married 
woman’s situation that calls for restraint and limitation on the 
part of the husband. The thing to note is precisely her position 
of weakness, which makes her subject to the benevolence of 
her husband, like a suppliant who has been taken from her 
household of birth. 

As for the nature of these unjust acts, it is not at all easy 
to specify in terms of the Economics. The text speaks of 
thyraze synousiai (“outside connections”). The word synousiai 
can signify a particular sexual union; it can also mean a “com¬ 
merce”, an “intimate relationship.” If we had to give the word 
its narrowest meaning here, it would denote any sexual act 
committed “outside the house,” which would constitute an 
injustice with regard to the wife. Such a standard appears 
rather improbable in a text that holds rather closely to the 
current thinking about ethics. If, on the other hand, we give 
the word synousia the more general meaning of “relation¬ 
ship,” we can easily see why there would be injustice in the 
exercise of an authority that is supposed to mete out to each 
according to his value, his merit, and his status: an extramari¬ 
tal liaison, a concubinage, and perhaps illegitimate children 
would be serious instances of derogation from the respect that 
is owing to the wife. In any case, as far as the husband’s sexual 
relations are concerned, anything that threatens the privileged 
position of the wife in the aristocratic government of the 
household also compromises the necessary and essential jus¬ 
tice of that government. Understood in this way, the formula¬ 
tion found in the Economics is not far removed in its concrete 
significance from what Xenophon implied by having Ischoma- 
chus promise his wife never to violate her privileges and status 
so long as she behaved well.* It should be noted, moreover, 
that the themes evoked in the lines that immediately follow are 

*It should be remarked, however, that Ischomachus was evoking situations of rivalry 
that could be produced by relations with the maidservants of the household, whereas 
here it is exterior liaisons that appear threatening. 



180 


The Use of Pleasure 


quite close to those of Xenophon: the husband’s responsibility 
in the moral training of his spouse and the criticism of adorn¬ 
ment (kosmesis) as mendacity and trickery that must not be 
allowed to come between spouses. But whereas Xenophon 
makes the husband’s moderation an appropriate style for a 
vigilant and wise master of a household, the Aristotelian text 
seems to place it within the multifarious interaction of the 
different forms of justice that should govern relations of hu¬ 
mans in society. 

It is no doubt difficult to identify exactly which sexual 
practices the author of the Economics would allow or forbid 
the husband who wished to conduct himself properly. Even 
so, it does seem that the husband’s moderation—whatever its 
precise form—does not derive from the personal bond be¬ 
tween the spouses and that it is not imposed on him in the 
same way that strict faithfulness can be required of the wife. 
It is in the context of an unequal distribution of powers and 
functions that the husband has to privilege his wife; and it is 
through a voluntary attitude—based on interest and wisdom 
—that he will be able, as one who knows how to manage an 
aristocratic authority, to judge what is owing to each individ¬ 
ual. The husband’s moderation in this case is still an ethics of 
power that one exercises, but this ethics is conceived as one 
of the forms of justice. This is a nonegalitarian and formal way 
of defining the association between husband and wife and the 
place that their respective virtues ought to have in that associ¬ 
ation. Let us not forget that this way of thinking about marital 
relations did not in the least exclude the kind of intensity that 
was acknowledged in relations of friendship. The Nicoma- 
chean Ethics brings together all these elements—justice, ine¬ 
quality, virtue, the aristocratic form of government; and it is 
through them that Aristotle defines the special nature of the 
husband’s friendship for his wife; this philia between spouses 
“is the same as that which is found in an aristocracy; for it is 
in accordance with excellence—the better gets more of what 
is good, and each gets what befits him; and so, too, with the 



Economics 


181 


justice in these relations.” 40 And further on, Aristotle adds: 
“How man and wife and in general friend and friend ought 
mutually to behave seems to be the same question as how it 
is just for them to behave.” 41 * 

One thus finds, in Greek thought of the classical period, 
elements of a marriage ethics that seems to demand on the 
part of both spouses a similar renunciation of all extramarital 
sexual activity. Now, the rule prescribing an exclusively con¬ 
jugal sexual practice, which in theory was imposed on the wife 
by her status and by the laws of the city and the family alike 
—it seems that some people may have believed that this rule 
was applicable to men as well; at any rate, this is the lesson 
that seems to emerge from Xenophon’s Oeconomicus and 
from the Aristotelian Economics, or from certain texts by 
Plato and Isocrates. These few texts appear quite isolated in 
the midst of a society in which neither the laws nor the cus¬ 
toms contained any such requirements. True. But it does not 
appear possible to see in this the first outlines of an ethics of 
reciprocal conjugal fidelity, or the beginnings of a codification 
of married life to which Christianity was to give a universal 
form, an imperative value, and the support of a whole institu¬ 
tional system. 

There are several reasons for this. Except in the Platonic 
city, where the same laws apply to everyone in the same way, 
the moderation that is demanded of the husband does not have 
the same ethical basis or the same forms as that which is 
imposed on the wife; in the latter case, these derive directly 

•It should be noted that in the ideal city described by Aristotle in the Politics, 
relations between husband and wife are defined in a way that is rather similar to what 
one finds in Plato. The obligation to procreate will be lifted when the parents risk 
being too old: “from that time forward we must regard them as indulging in inter¬ 
course for reasons of health, or for some similar cause.” As for adulterous relations 
of the husband with another woman or the wife with another man, they will rightly 
be regarded as a disgraceful action (trie kalon) “in whatever shape or form, during 
all the period of their being married and being called husband and wife.” For reasons 
easy to understand, this offense will have legal consequences— atimia —if it is com¬ 
mitted “during the period of bringing children into the world .” 42 



182 


The Use of Pleasure 


from a de jure situation, and from a statutory dependence that 
places her under the authority of her husband; in the case of 
the husband, they depend on a choice, on a willingness to give 
his life a certain form. A matter of style, as it were: the man 
is called upon to temper his conduct in terms of the mastery 
he intends to bring to bear on himself, and in terms of the 
moderation with which he aims to exercise his mastery over 
others. Whence the fact that this austerity is presented—in 
Isocrates, for instance—as a refinement whose exemplary 
value does not take the form of a universal principle; whence, 
too, the fact that the renunciation of every relation outside the 
conjugal relation is not explicitly prescribed by Xenophon or 
perhaps even by the Aristotelian author, and it does not take 
the form of a permanent commitment in Isocrates but that of 
an achievement instead. 

Furthermore, whether the prescription is symmetrical (as in 
Plato) or not, the moderation that is demanded of the husband 
is not based on the special nature and peculiar form of the 
conjugal relationship. No doubt it is because he is married that 
his sexual activity must undergo some restrictions and accept 
a certain delimitation. But it is the status of a married man, 
not the relation to the wife, that requires this: married—in 
Plato’s city—according to the forms that the state will decide, 
and in order to provide it with the citizens it needs; married 
and thus having to manage a household that should prosper 
in an orderly fashion and be maintained in a condition that 
will be, in everyone’s eyes, the image and proof of a good 
government (Xenophon and Isocrates); married and obligated 
to apply the rules of justice in the forms of inequality appropri¬ 
ate to marriage and to the wife’s nature (Aristotle). There is 
nothing in all this that would rule out personal feelings of 
attachment, affection, and concern. But it should be clearly 
understood that it is never vis-a-vis the wife that this sophro- 
syne is necessary, in the association that joins them together 
as individuals. The husband is self-obligated in this respect, 
since the fact of being married commits him to a particular 



Economics 


183 


interplay of duties and demands in which his reputation, his 
relation to others, his prestige in the city, and his willingness 
to lead a fine and good existence are at stake. 

One understands, therefore, how the man’s moderation and 
the wife’s virtue could be presented as two simultaneous re¬ 
quirements, each deriving, in its own way and its own forms, 
from the state of marriage; and yet it is as if the question of 
sexual practice as an element—a crucial element—of the con¬ 
jugal relationship were hardly raised. Later, sexual relations 
between spouses, the form they should take, the acts that were 
permitted, the rules of decency they should observe—but also 
the intensity of the bonds they manifested and drew closer— 
were to be an important subject of reflection. The entire sexual 
life between husbands and wives was to give rise, in the Chris¬ 
tian pastoral ministry, to a codification that was often quite 
detailed; but already before this, Plutarch had broached ques¬ 
tions concerning not only the form of sexual relations between 
spouses but their affective significance as well; he had under¬ 
scored the importance of reciprocal pleasures for the mutual 
attachment of husband and wife. This new ethics would be 
characterized, not simply by the fact that man and wife would 
be restricted to one sexual partner, the spouse, but also by the 
fact that their sexual activity would be problematized as an 
essential, decisive, and especially delicate component of their 
personal conjugal relation. Nothing of the sort is visible in the 
moral reflection of the fourth century B.C. This is not to sug¬ 
gest that sexual pleasures had little importance in the married 
life of the Greeks of that period, or that they did not contrib¬ 
ute to a couple’s mutual understanding: that is another ques¬ 
tion in any case. But in order to understand the working out 
of sexual conduct as a moral problem, it is necessary to em¬ 
phasize that, in classical Greek thought, the sexual behavior 
of the two spouses was not questioned from the standpoint of 
their personal relationship. What occurred between them as¬ 
sumed importance from the moment it became a question of 
having children. Apart from that, their mutual sex life was not 



184 


The Use of Pleasure 


an object of reflection and prescription: the point of prob- 
lematization was in the moderation that each of the two part¬ 
ners needed to show for reasons and in forms corresponding 
to their sex and their status. Moderation was not a matter 
shared between them and requiring concern on the part of the 
one for the other. In this we are f ar from the Christian teach¬ 
ing where each spouse would have to ensure the other’s chas¬ 
tity, being careful not to cause him or her to commit the sin 
of the flesh—either through indecent entreaties or through 
harsh refusals. For the Greek moralists of the classical epoch, 
moderation was prescribed to both partners in matrimony; 
but it depended on two distinct modes of relation to self, 
corresponding to the two individuals. The wife’s virtue 
constituted the correlative and the proof of a submissive 
behavior; the man’s austerity was part of an ethics of self¬ 
delimiting domination.

The use of pleasures in the relationship with boys was a 
theme of anxiety for Greek thought—which is paradoxical in 
a society that is believed to have “tolerated” what we call 
“homosexuality.” But perhaps it would be just as well if we 
avoided those two terms here. 

As matter of fact, the notion of homosexuality is plainly 
inadequate as a means of referring to an experience, forms of 
valuation, and a system of categorization so different from 
ours. The Greeks did not see love for one’s own sex and love 
for the other sex as opposites, as two exclusive choices, two 
radically different types of behavior. The dividing lines did not 
follow that kind of boundary. What distinguished a moderate, 
self-possessed man from one given to pleasures was, from the 
viewpoint of ethics, much more important than what differen¬ 
tiated, among themselves, the categories of pleasures that in¬ 
vited the greatest devotion. To have loose morals was to be 
incapable of resisting either women or boys, without it being 
any more serious than that. When he portrays the tyrannical 
man—that is, one “in whose soul dwells the tyrant Eros who 
directs everything” 1 —Plato shows him from two equivalent 
angles, so that what we see in both instances is contempt for 
the most fundamental obligations and subjection to the rule of 
pleasure: “Do you think he would sacrifice his long beloved 
and irreplaceable mother for a recently acquired mistress 
whom he can do without, or, for the sake of a young boy

recently become dear to him, sacrifice his aged and irreplace¬ 
able father, his oldest friend, beat him, and make his parents 
slaves of those others if he brought them under the same 
roof?” 2 When Alcibiades was censured for his debauchery, it 
was not for the former kind in contradistinction to the latter, 
it was, as Bion the Borysthenite put it, “that in his adolescence 
he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as a young 
man the wives from their husbands.” 3 

Conversely, if one wanted to show that a man was self- 
controlled, it was said of him—as Plato said concerning Iccus 
of Tarentum 4 —that he was able to abstain from relations with 
boys and women alike; and, according to Xenophon, the ad¬ 
vantage that Cyrus saw in relying on eunuchs for court service 
was that they were incapable of offending the honor of either 
women or boys. 5 So it seemed to people that of these two 
inclinations one was not more likely than the other, and the 
two could easily coexist in the same individual. 

Were the Greeks bisexual, then? Yes, if we mean by this that 
a Greek could, simultaneously or in turn, be enamored of a 
boy or a girl; that a married man could have paidika; that it 
was common for a male to change to a preference for women 
after “boy-loving” inclinations in his youth. But if we wish to 
turn our attention to the way in which they conceived of this 
dual practice, we need to take note of the fact that they did 
not recognize two kinds of “desire,” two different or compet¬ 
ing “drives,” each claiming a share of men’s hearts or appe¬ 
tites. We can talk about their “bisexuality,” thinking of the 
free choice they allowed themselves between the two sexes, but 
for them this option was not referred to a dual, ambivalent, 
and “bisexual” structure of desire. To their way of thinking, 
what made it possible to desire a man or a woman was simply 
the appetite that nature had implanted in man’s heart for 
“beautiful” human beings, whatever their sex might be. 6 

True, one finds in Pausanias’ speech a theory of two loves, 7 
the second of which—Urania, the heavenly love—is directed 
exclusively to boys. But the distinction that is made is not

between a heterosexual love and a homosexual love; Pausanias 
draws the dividing line between “the love which the baser sort 
of men feel”—its object is both women and boys, it only looks 
to the act itself (to diaprattesthai )—and the more ancient, 
nobler, and more reasonable love that is drawn to what has 
the most vigor and intelligence, which obviously can only 
mean the male sex. Xenophon’s Symposium shows very well 
that the choice between girls and boys in no way relates to the 
distinction between two tendencies or to the opposition be¬ 
tween two forms of desire. The dinner is given by Callias in 
honor of the very young Autolycus whom he is enamored of; 
the boy’s beauty is so striking that he draws looks from all the 
guests as “the sudden glow of a light at night draws all eyes 
to itself”; “there was not one . . . who did not feel his soul 
strangely stirred by the boy.” 8 Now, among the participants, 
several were engaged or married, like Niceratus—who felt a 
love for his wife that she reciprocated, in the play of Eros and 
Anteros—or Critobulus, who was nonetheless still of an age 
to have suitors and male lovers; 9 further, Critobulus tells of his 
love for Cleinias, a boy he has met at school and, in a comic 
joust with Socrates, he matches his own beauty against that 
of the latter; the contest prize is to be a kiss from a boy and 
one from a girl: the boy and girl belong to a Syracusan who 
has taught them a dance whose graceful charm and acrobatic 
movements are the delight of everyone present. He has also 
taught them to mime the loves of Dionysus and Ariadne; and 
the guests, who have just heard Socrates say what true love for 
boys should be, all feel extremely “excited” (aneptoromenoi) 
on seeing this “Dionysus truly handsome” and this “Ariadne 
truly fair” exchanging real kisses; one can tell from the lovers’ 
vows pronounced by the young acrobats that they “are now 
permitted to satisfy their long cherished desires.” 10 So many 
different incitements to love put everyone in the mood for 
pleasure: at the end of the Symposium, some ride off on their 
horses to reunite with their wives, while Callias and Socrates 
leave to rejoin the handsome Autolycus. At this banquet

where they felt a common enchantment with the beauty of a 
girl or the charm of boys, men of various ages kindled the 
appetite for pleasure or serious love—love that some would 
look for in women, others in young men. 

To be sure, the preference for boys or girls was easily recog¬ 
nized as a character trait: men could be distinguished by the 
pleasure they were most fond of; 11 a matter of taste that could 
lend itself to humorous treatment, not a matter of topology 
involving the individual’s very nature, the truth of his desire, or 
the natural legitimacy of his predilection. People did not have 
the notion of two distinct appetites allotted to different in¬ 
dividuals or at odds with each other in the same soul; rather, 
they saw two ways of enjoying one’s pleasure, one of which was 
more suited to certain individuals or certain periods of exis¬ 
tence. The enjoyment of boys and of women did not constitute 
two classificatory categories between which individuals could 
be distributed; a man who preferred paidika did not think of 
himself as being “different” from those who pursued women. 

As for the notions of “tolerance” or “intolerance,” they too 
would be completely inadequate to account for the complexity 
of the phenomena we are considering. To love boys was a 
“free” practice in the sense that it was not only permitted by 
the laws (except in particular circumstances), it was accepted 
by opinion. Moreover, it found solid support in different (mili¬ 
tary or educational) institutions. It had religious guarantees in 
rites and festivals where the protection of the divine powers 
was invoked on its behalf. 12 And finally, it was a cultural 
practice that enjoyed the prestige of a whole literature that 
sang of it and a body of reflection that vouched for its excel¬ 
lence. Mixed in with all this, however, there were some quite 
different attitudes: a contempt for young men who were too 
“easy,” or too self-interested; a disqualification of effeminate 
men, who were so often mocked by Aristophanes and the 
comic authors;* a disallowance of certain shameful behaviors, 

•For example, Cleisthenes in the Acharnians or Agathon in the Thesmophoriazusae.

such as that of the catamites, which Callicles could not bear 
to talk about despite his boldness and plainness of speech, and 
which he saw as the proof that not every pleasure could be 
good and honorable.* Indeed, it seems that this practice— 
though it was common and accepted—was surrounded by a 
diversity of judgments, that it was subjected to an interplay of 
positive and negative appraisals so complex as to make the 
ethics that governed it difficult to decipher. And there was a 
clear awareness of this complexity at the time; at least, that 
is what emerges from the passage in Pausanias’ speech where 
he shows how hard it is to know if people in Athens are in 
favor of or hostile to that form of love. On one hand, it was 
accepted so well—better still: it was valued so highly—that 
certain kinds of behavior on the part of male lovers were 
honored which were judged to be folly or dishonesty on the 
part of anyone else: the prayers, the entreaties, the stubborn 
wooings, all their false vows. But on the other hand, one noted 
the care fathers took to protect their sons from love affairs, 
how they demanded that tutors prevent them from occurring, 
and one heard boys’ comrades teasing each other for accepting 
such relationships.' 4 

Simple linear schemas do not enable us to understand the 
singular kind of attention that people of the fourth century 
gave to the love of boys. We need to take up the question 
afresh, using terms other than those of “tolerance” toward 
“homosexuality.” And instead of trying to determine the ex¬ 
tent to which the latter was free in ancient Greece (as if we 
were dealing with an unvarying experience uniformly sub¬ 
tending mechanisms of repression that change in the course of 
time), it would be more worthwhile to ask how and in what 
form the pleasure enjoyed between men was problematic. 
How did people think of it in relation to themselves? What 

*“Socrates: The life of the catamites (ho ton kinaidon bios) isn’t that strange and 
shameful and wretched? Or will you dare to say that these people are happy if they 
have what they need without restriction? —Callicles: Aren’t you ashamed to lead the 
discussion to such things, Socrates?’’ ,, 



192 


The Use of Pleasure 


specific questions did it raise and what debate was it brought 
into? In short, given that it was a widespread practice, and the 
laws in no way condemned it, and its attraction was com¬ 
monly recognized, why was it the object of a special—and 
especially intense—moral preoccupation? So much so that it 
was invested with values, imperatives, demands, rules, advice, 
and exhortations that were as numerous as they were em¬ 
phatic and singular. 

To put things in a very schematic way: we tend nowadays 
to think that practices aimed at pleasure, when they are car¬ 
ried out between two partners of the same sex, are governed 
by a desire whose structure is particular; but we agree—if we 
are “tolerant”—that this is not a reason to refer them to a 
moral standard, to say nothing of a legislation, different from 
the one that is shared by all. We focus our questioning on the 
singularity of a desire that is not directed toward the other sex; 
and at the same time, we affirm that this type of relation 
should not be assigned a lesser value, nor given a special 
status. Now, it seems that the Greeks thought very differently 
about these things: they believed that the same desire attached 
to anything that was desirable—boy or girl—subject to the 
condition that the appetite was nobler that inclined toward 
what was more beautiful and more honorable; but they also 
thought that this desire called for a particular mode of behav¬ 
ior when it made a place for itself in a relationship between 
two male individuals. The Greeks could not imagine that a 
man might need a different nature—an “other” nature—in 
order to love a man; but they were inclined to think that the 
pleasures one enjoyed in such a relationship ought to be given 
an ethical form different from the one that was required when 
it came to loving a woman. In this sort of relation, the pleas¬ 
ures did not reveal an alien nature in the person who ex¬ 
perienced them; but their use demanded a special stylistics. 

And it is a fact that male loves were the object, in Greek 
culture, of a whole agitated production of ideas, observations, 
and discussions concerning the forms they should take or the 



Erotics 


193 


value one might attribute to them. It would be less than ade¬ 
quate if we saw in this discursive activity only the immediate 
and spontaneous representation of a free practice that chanced 
to express itself naturally in this fashion, as if all that was 
needed for a behavior to become a domain of inquiry or a focus 
of theoretical and moral concerns was that it not be prohib¬ 
ited. But we would be just as remiss if we assumed that these 
texts were only an attempt to clothe the love one could direct 
to boys in an honorable justification: such an undertaking 
would presuppose condemnations or disqualifications, which 
in fact were declared much later. Rather, we must try and 
learn how and why this practice gave rise to an extraordinarily 
complex problematization. 

Very little remains of what Greek philosophers wrote on the 
subject of love and on the subject of that love in particular. 
The idea that one can justifiably form concerning these reflec¬ 
tions and their general thematics is bound to be rather uncer¬ 
tain considering that such a limited number of texts have been 
preserved; moreover, nearly all these belong to the Socratic- 
Platonic tradition, while we do not have, for example, the 
works that Diogenes Laertius mentions, by Antisthenes, Di¬ 
ogenes the Cynic, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Zeno, Chrysippus, 
and Crantor. Nevertheless, the speeches that are more or less 
ironically reported by Plato can give us some notion of what 
was at issue in these reflections and debates on love. 

1. The first thing to note is that the philosophical and 
moral reflections concerning love did not cover the whole field 
of sexual relations. Attention was focused for the most part on 
a “privileged” relationship—a problem area, an object of spe¬ 
cial concern: this was a relationship that implied an age differ¬ 
ence and, connected with it, a certain difference of status. The 
relationship that concerned people, that they discussed and 
reflected upon, was not the one that joined together two ma¬ 
ture adult males or two schoolboys of the same age; it was the 
relationship that developed between two men (and nothing 



194 


The Use of Pleasure 


prevented them from both being young and rather near in age 
to one another) who were considered as belonging to two 
distinct age groups and one of whom was still quite young, had 
not finished his education, and had not attained his definitive 
status.* It is the existence of this disparity that marked the 
relationship that philosophers and moralists concerned them¬ 
selves with. This special attention should not lead us to draw 
hasty conclusions either about the sexual behaviors of the 
Greeks or about the details of their tastes (even though there 
is evidence from many areas of their culture that very young 
men were both represented and recognized as highly desirable 
erotic objects). We must not imagine in any case that only this 
type of relation was practiced; one finds many references to 
male love relationships that did not conform to this schema 
and did not include this “age differential.” We would be just 
as mistaken to suppose that, though practiced, these other 
forms of relations were frowned upon and regarded as un¬ 
seemly. Relations between young boys were deemed com¬ 
pletely natural and in keeping with their condition.f On the 
other hand, people could mention as a special case—without 
censure—an abiding love relationship between two men who 
were well past adolescence.^ Doubtless for reasons having to 
do, as we shall see, with the polar opposition of activity and 
passivity, an opposition regarded as necessary, relations be¬ 
tween two grown men were more apt to be an object of criti¬ 
cism and irony. Passivity was always disliked, and for an adult 
to be suspected of it was especially serious. But whether these 

•Although the texts often refer to this difference of age and status, it should be noted 
that the real age that is given for the partners tends to “float.” 1 ' Further, we see 
characters who play the role of lover in relation to some, and that of beloved in 
relation to others: e.g., Critobulus in Xenophon’s Symposium, where he tells of his 
love for Cleinias, whom he has met at school and who is a very young man like 
himself ." 1 

tin the Charmides, Plato describes the arrival of a youth whom everyone fastened 
their eyes upon, adults and boys, “down to the very smallest.””

latter was already a man in his prime. F. Buffiere notes in this connection an anecdote 
told by Aelian."

relations met with easy acceptance or tended to be suspect, the 
important thing for the moment is to see that they were not 
an object of moral solicitude or of a very great theoretical 
interest. Without being ignored or nonexistent, they did not 
belong to the domain of active and intense problematization. 
The attention and concern was concentrated on relations in 
which one can tell that much was at stake: relations that could 
be established between an older male who had finished his 
education—and who was expected to play the socially, mor¬ 
ally, and sexually active role—and a younger one, who had 
not yet achieved his definitive status and who was in need of 
assistance, advice, and support. This disparity was at the heart 
of the relationship; in fact, it was what made it valuable and 
conceivable. Because of it, the relationship was considered in 
a positive light, made a subject of reflection; and where it was 
not apparent, people sought to discover it. Thus, one liked to 
talk about the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus, trying 
to determine what differentiated them from one another and 
which of the two had precedence over the other (since 
Homer’s text was ambiguous on this point).* A male relation¬ 
ship gave rise to a theoretical and moral interest when it was 
based on a rather pronounced difference on either side of the 
threshold separating adolescence from manhood. 

2. It does not appear that the privilege accorded to this 
particular type of relation can be attributed solely to the peda¬ 
gogical concerns of moralists and philosophers. We are in the 
habit of seeing a close connection between the Greek love of 
boys and Greek educational practice and philosophical in¬ 
struction. The story of Socrates invites this, as does the way 
in which the love of boys was constantly portrayed in antiq¬ 
uity. In reality, a very large context contributed to the valori¬ 
zation and elaboration of the relationship between men and 
adolescents. The philosophical reflection that took it as a 

‘Homer gave one the advantage of birth, the other that of age; one was stronger, the 
other more intelligent. 1 '' 



196 


The Use of Pleasure 


theme actually had its roots in practices that were widespread, 
accepted, and relatively complex. Unlike other sexual rela¬ 
tions, it seems—or in any case, more than they—the relations 
that united man and boy across a certain age and status 
threshold separating them were the object of a sort of rituali- 
zation, which by imposing certain rules on them gave them 
form, value, and interest. Even before they were taken up by 
philosophical reflection, these relations were already the pre¬ 
text for a whole social game. 

“Courtship” practices had formed around them. Doubtless 
these practices did not have the complexity found in other arts 
of loving such as those that would be developed in the Middle 
Ages. But by the same token, they were something quite differ¬ 
ent from the formalities that one observed in order to qualify 
for the hand of a young lady. They defined a whole set of 
conventional and appropriate behaviors, making this relation a 
culturally and morally overloaded domain. These practices— 
the reality of which has been amply documented by K. J. 
Dover 20 —defined the mutual behavior and the respective 
strategies that both partners should observe in order to give 
their relations a “beautiful” form; that is, one that was aestheti¬ 
cally and morally valuable. They determined the role of the 
erastes and that of the eromenos. The first was in a position of 
initiative—he was the suitor—and this gave him rights and 
obligations; he was expected to show his ardor, and to restrain 
it; he had gifts to make, services to render; he had functions to 
exercise with regard to the eromenos; and all this entitled him 
to expect a just reward. The other partner, the one who was 
loved and courted, had to be careful not to yield too easily; he 
also had to keep from accepting too many tokens of love, and 
from granting his favors heedlessly and out of self-interest, 
without testing the worth of his partner; he must also show 
gratitude for what the lover had done for him. Now, this 
courtship practice alone shows very well that the sexual rela¬ 
tion between man and boy did not “go without saying”: it had 
to be accompanied by conventions, rules of conduct, ways of 



Erotics 


197 


going about it, by a whole game of delays and obstacles de¬ 
signed to put off the moment of closure, and to integrate it into 
a series of subsidiary activities and relations. In other words, 
while this type of relation was fully accepted, it was not a 
matter of “indifference.” One would be missing the essential 
thing if one regarded all these precautions that were taken and 
the interest that was shown merely as the proof that this love 
was freely engaged in; it would be to ignore the distinction that 
was made between this sexual behavior and all the others whose 
recommended modalities were of little concern. All these 
preoccupations make it clear that pleasure relations between 
men and adolescent boys already constituted a delicate factor 
in society, an area so sensitive that one could not fail to be 
concerned about the conduct of the participants on both sides. 

3. But we may note at once a considerable difference in 
comparison with that other focus of interest and inquiry, mat¬ 
rimonial life: in the case of relations between men and boys, 
we are dealing with a game that was “open,” at least up to a 
certain point. 

Open “spatially.” In economics and the art of the house¬ 
hold, we saw a binary spatial structure where the spaces of the 
two marriage partners were carefully distinguished (the exte¬ 
rior for the husband, the interior for the wife; the men’s quar¬ 
ters on one side, the women’s on the other). With boys, the 
game unfolded in a very different space: a common space, at 
least from the time when they had reached a certain age—the 
space of the street and the gathering places, with some 
strategically important points (such as the gymnasium); but a 
space in which everyone moved about freely,* so that one had 
to pursue a boy, chase after him, watch for him in those places 
where he might pass and catch hold of him where he happened 
to be; it was a theme of ironic complaint on the part of lovers, 
that they were obliged to haunt the gymnasium, go hunting 

•In the schools, this freedom was supervised and limited. 2 ' 



198 


The Use of Pleasure 


with the eromenos, and pant alongside him in exercises, which 
they were no longer in any condition to do. 

But, more important, the game was also open in that one 
could not exercise any statutory authority over the boy, as 
long as he was not slaveborn—he was free in his choices, in 
what he accepted or rejected, in his preferences or his deci¬ 
sions. In order to get from him something that he always had 
the right to refuse, one had to be able to persuade him; anyone 
who wished to remain his favorite had, in his eyes, to outshine 
such rivals as might present themselves, and for this it was 
necessary to highlight one’s achievements, one’s qualities, or 
one’s presents; but the decision was the boy’s alone to make: 
in this game that one had initiated, one was never sure of 
winning. And yet this was the very thing that made it interest¬ 
ing. Nothing illustrates this better than the charming com¬ 
plaint of Hiero the tyrant, as reported by Xenophon. 22 Being 
a tyrant, he explains, does not make things pleasant either in 
regard to a wife or in regard to a boy. Fora tyrant cannot help 
but take a wife from an inferior family, thus losing all the 
advantages of marrying into a family “of greater wealth and 
influence.” As for the boy—and Hiero is enamored of Da'ilo- 
chus—the fact of having despotic power at one’s disposal 
raises other obstacles; the favors that Hiero would like so 
much to obtain, he would like the boy to give them out of 
friendship and of his own accord; but “to take them from him 
by force,” he would sooner desire “to do himself an injury.” 
To take something from one’s enemy against his will is the 
greatest of pleasures; but when it comes to the favors of boys, 
the sweetest are those that are freely granted. For example, 
what a pleasure it is to “exchange looks, how pleasant his 
questions and answers; how very pleasant and ravishing 
are the struggles and bickerings. But to take advantage of a 
favorite against his will seems to me more like brigan¬ 
dage than love.” 

In the case of marriage, the problematization of sexual 
pleasures and of the practices associated with them was car- 



Erotics 


199 


ried out on the basis of the statutory relation that empowered 
the husband to govern the wife, other individuals, the estate, 
and the household; the essential question concerned the mod¬ 
eration that needed to be shown in exercising power. In the 
case of the relationship with boys, the ethics of pleasures 
would have to bring into play—across age differences—subtle 
strategies that would make allowance for the other’s freedom, 
his ability to refuse, and his required consent. 

4. In this problematization of relationships with adoles¬ 
cent boys, the question of timing was important, but it was 
raised in a singular fashion; what mattered was not, as in 
dietetics, the opportune moment for the act, nor, as in eco¬ 
nomics, the continual maintenance of a relational structure; 
rather, it was the difficult question of precarious time and 
fugitive passage. It was expressed in different ways—as a prob¬ 
lem of “limit” first of all: what was the age limit after which 
a boy ought to be considered too old to be an honorable 
partner in a love relation? At what age was it no longer good 
for him to accept this role, nor for his lover to want to assign 
it to him? This involved the familiar casuistry of the signs of 
manhood. These were supposed to mark a threshold, one that 
was all the more intangible in theory as it must have very often 
been crossed in practice and as it offered the possibility of 
finding fault with those who had done so. As we know, the first 
beard was believed to be that fateful mark, and it was said that 
the razor that shaved it must sever the ties of love. 23 In any 
case, one should note that people criticized not only boys who 
were willing to play a role that no longer corresponded to their 
virility, but also the men who frequented overaged boys. 24 The 
Stoics were criticized for keeping their lovers too long—up to 
the age of twenty-eight—but the argument they gave, which 
was more or less an extension of that given by Pausanias in 
the Symposium (he held that in order to make sure that men 
became attached only to youths of merit, the law should pro¬ 
hibit relations with boys who were too young), 25 shows that 



200 


The Use of Pleasure 


this limit was less a universal rule than a subject of debate that 
permitted a variety of solutions. 

This attention to the period of adolescence and its bounda¬ 
ries no doubt helped to increase people’s sensitivity to the 
juvenile body, to its special beauty, and to the different signs 
of its development; the adolescent physique became the object 
of a kind of cultural valorization that was quite pronounced. 
That the male body might be beautiful, well beyond its first 
bloom, was something that the Greeks were not blind to nor 
inclined to forget; classical figure sculpture paid more atten¬ 
tion to the adult body; and it is recalled in Xenophon’s Sympo¬ 
sium that in choosing garland-bearers for Athena, they were 
careful to select the most beautiful old men. 26 But in the sphere 
of sexual ethics, it was the juvenile body with its peculiar 
charm that was regularly suggested as the “right object’’ of 
pleasure. And it would be a mistake to think that its traits 
were valued because of what they shared with feminine 
beauty. They were appreciated in themselves or in their juxta¬ 
position with the signs and guarantees of a developing virility. 
Strength, endurance, and spirit also formed part of this 
beauty; hence it was good in fact if exercises, gymnastics, 
competitions, and hunting expeditions reinforced these quali¬ 
ties, guaranteeing that this gracefulness would not degenerate 
into softness and effeminization. 27 The feminine ambiguity 
that would be perceived later (and already in the course of 
antiquity, even) as a component—more exactly, as the secret 
cause—of the adolescent’s beauty, was, in the classical period, 
more something from which the boy needed to protect himself 
and be protected. Among the Greeks there was a whole moral 
aesthetics of the boy’s body; it told of his personal merit and 
of that of the love one felt for him. Virility as a physical mark 
should be absent from it; but it should be present as a preco¬ 
cious form and as a promise of future behavior: already to 
conduct oneself as the man one has not yet become. 

But this sensibility was also connected with feelings of anxi¬ 
ety in the face of those rapid changes and the nearness of their 



Erotics

completion; by a sense of the fleeting character of that beauty 
and of its legitimate desirability; and by fear, the double fear 
so often expressed in the lover, of seeing his beloved lose his 
charm, and in the beloved, of seeing his lover turn away from 
him. And the question that was then posed concerned the 
possible conversion—an ethically necessary and socially use¬ 
ful one—of the bond of love (doomed to disappear) into a 
relation of friendship, of philia. The latter differed from the 
love relation, out of which it would ideally and sometimes 
actually be formed: it was lasting, having no other limit than 
life itself; and it obliterated the dissymmetries that were im¬ 
plied in the erotic relation between man and adolescent. It was 
one of the frequent themes in moral reflection on this type of 
relation, that these relations needed to rid themselves of their 
precariousness: a precariousness that was due to the incon¬ 
stancy of the partners, and that was a consequence of the boy’s 
growing older and thereby losing his charm; but it was also 
a precept, since it was not good to love a boy who was past 
a certain age, just as it was not good for him to allow himself 
to be loved. This precariousness could be avoided only if, in 
the fervor of love, philia —friendship—already began to de¬ 
velop: philia, i.e., an affinity of character and mode of life, a 
sharing of thoughts and existence, mutual benevolence. 28 The 
beginning of this cultivation of indestructible friendship in the 
love relation is what Xenophon is describing when he portrays 
two lovers who look into each other’s faces, converse, confide 
in one another, rejoice together or feel a common distress over 
successes and failures, and look after each other: “It is by 
conducting themselves thus that men continue to love their 
mutual affection and enjoy it down to old age.”* 

5. On a very general level, this inquiry concerning rela¬ 
tionships with boys took the form of a reflection on love. This 

•This whole passage of Socrates’ speech is a good illustration of the anxiety that was 
felt in view of the precariousness of male love relationships, and of the role that the 
permanence of friendship was supposed to play in the scheme of things.”

fact should not lead us to conclude that for the Greeks Eros 
had no place except in this type of relation, and that it could 
not play a part in relations with a woman: Eros could unite 
human beings no matter what their sex happened to be; in 
Xenophon, one can see that Niceratus and his wife are joined 
together by the ties of Eros and Anteros. 30 Eros was not neces¬ 
sarily “homosexual,” nor was it exclusive of marriage; and the 
marriage tie did not differ from the relation with boys by being 
incompatible with love’s intensity and reciprocity. The differ¬ 
ence was elsewhere. Matrimonial morality, and more precisely 
the sexual ethics of the married man, did not depend on the 
existence of an erotic relation in order to constitute itself and 
define its rules (although it was quite possible for this kind of 
bond to exist between marriage partners). On the other hand, 
when it was a matter of determining what use they might 
make of their pleasures within the relationship, then the refer¬ 
ence to Eros became necessary; the problematization of their 
relationship belonged to an “erotics.” This was because, in the 
case of two spouses, marital status, management of the oikos, 
and maintenance of the lineage could create standards of be¬ 
havior, define the rules of that behavior, and determine the 
forms of the requisite moderation. But in the case of a man or 
boy who were in a position of reciprocal independence and 
between whom there was no institutional constraint, but 
rather an open game (with preferences, choices, freedom of 
movement, uncertain outcome), the principle of regulation of 
behaviors was to be sought in the relation itself, in the nature 
of the attraction that drew them toward one another, and in 
the mutual attachment that connected them. Hence the prob¬ 
lematization would be carried out in the form of a reflection 
on the relation itself: an inquiry that was both theoretical 
about love and prescriptive about the way one lived. 

But in actual fact, this art of loving was intended for two 
classes of individuals. To be sure, the wife and her behavior 
were not completely absent from reflection on economics; but 
she was placed under her husband’s exclusive authority and 



Erotics 


203 


while it was right that she be respected in her privileges, this 
was insofar as she proved worthy of respect, the important 
thing being that the head of a family remain master of himself. 
The boy, on the other hand, could be expected to maintain the 
reserve that was appropriate at that age; with his possible 
refusals (dreaded but honorable) and his eventual acceptances 
(desired but likely to be suspect), he constituted an indepen¬ 
dent center vis-a-vis the lover. And this erotics would have to 
be deployed from one fixed point of this elliptical configura¬ 
tion to the other. In economics and dietetics, the voluntary 
moderation of the man was based mainly on his relation to 
himself; in erotics, the game was more complicated; it implied 
self-mastery on the part of the lover; it also implied an ability 
on the part of the beloved to establish a relation of dominion 
over himself; and lastly, it implied a relationship between their 
two moderations, expressed in their deliberate choice of one 
another. One can even note a certain tendency to privilege the 
boy’s point of view. The questions that were raised had to do 
with his conduct in particular, and it was to him that one 
offered observations, advice, and precepts: as if it were impor¬ 
tant above all to constitute an erotics of the loved object, or 
at least, of the loved object insofar as he had to form himself 
as a subject of ethical behavior; this is in fact what becomes 
apparent in a text like the eulogy of Epicrates, attributed to 
Demosthenes.

A Boy’s Honor 


In comparison with the two great Symposiums, Plato’s and 
Xenophon’s, and with the Phaedrus, Demosthenes’ Erotic 
Essay appears rather mediocre. A formulaic speech, it is both 
the encomium of a young man and an exhortation addressed 
to him. This was in fact the traditional function of encomiums, 
and the function that Xenophon alludes to in the Symposium: 
“in the very act of flattering Callias, you are educating him to 
conform to the ideal.” 1 Praise and lesson at the same time, 
therefore. But despite the banality of the themes and their 
treatment—a kind of insipid Platonism—it is possible to dis¬ 
cover a few traits that were characteristic of other discourses 
on love and of the way in which the question of “pleasures” 
was posed within them. 

1. One preoccupation animates the entire text. It finds 
expression in a vocabulary that refers constantly to honor and 
shame. Throughout the speech it is a question of aischyne, 
that shame which is both the dishonor with which one can be 
branded and the feeling that causes one to turn away from it; 
it is a question of that which is ugly and shameful (aischron), 
in contrast to that which is fine, or both fine and honorable. 
Much is said, too, about that which results in blame and 
contempt (oneidos, epitime), as opposed to that which brings 
honor and leads to a good reputation (endoxos, entimos). In 
any case, Epicrates’ admirer states his objective from the very 

204 



Erotics 


205 


start of the Erotic Essay: may this praise bring honor to his 
beloved, and not shame, as sometimes happens when eulogies 
are delivered by indiscreet suitors. 2 And he returns again and 
again to this concern: it is important that the young man 
remember that because of his birth and standing, the least 
negligence where honor is at stake may well cover him with 
shame; he must always keep in mind the example of those 
who, by being vigilant, have managed to preserve their honor 
in the course of their relationship; 3 he must take care not to 
“dishonor his natural qualities” and not to disappoint the 
hopes of those who are proud of him. 4 * 

The behavior of young men thus appears to have been a 
domain that was especially sensitive to the division between 
what was shameful and what was proper, between what re¬ 
flected credit and what brought dishonor. It was this question 
that preoccupied those who chose to reflect on young men, on 
the love that was manifested for them and the conduct they 
needed to exhibit. Pausanias, in Plato’s Symposium, calls at¬ 
tention to the diversity of morals and customs having to do 
with boys. He points out what is considered “disgraceful” or 
“good” in Elis, in Sparta, in Thebes, in Ionia or in areas under 
Persian rule, and lastly, in Athens. 6 And Phaedrus recalls the 
principle that should be one’s guide in the love of young men 
as well as in life in general: “shame at what is disgraceful and 
ambition for what is noble; without these feelings neither a 
state nor an individual can accomplish anything great or 
fine.” 7 But it should be remarked that this question was not 
confined to a few exacting moralists. A young man’s behavior, 
his honor and his disgrace were also the object of much social 
curiosity; people payed attention to this, spoke about it, 
remembered it. For example, in order to attack Timarchus, 
Aeschines had no qualms about rehashing the gossip that may 
have gone round many years previously, when his adversary 
was still a very young man. 8 Moreover, the Erotic Essay shows 

•Aristotle’s Rhetoric shows the importance of the categories of kalon and aischron 
in speeches of praise.’ 



206 


The Use of Pleasure 


very well in passing just what sort of distrustful solicitude a 
boy could quite naturally be subjected to by his entourage; 
people watched him, spied on him, remarked on his demeanor 
and his relations; vicious tongues were active around him; 
spiteful people were ready to blame him if he showed arro¬ 
gance or conceit, but they were also quick to criticize him if 
he was too gracious. 9 Naturally, one cannot help but think 
about what the situation of girls in other societies must have 
been when—the age for marriage being much earlier for 
women—their premarital conduct became an important 
moral and social concern, of itself and for their families. 

2. But in regard to the Greek boy, the importance of his 
honor did not concern—as it would later in the case of the 
European girl—his future marriage; rather, it related to his 
status, his eventual place in the city. Of course, there is abun¬ 
dant evidence that boys of dubious reputation could exercise 
the highest political functions; but there is also evidence that 
this very thing could be held against them—without counting 
the substantial judicial consequences that certain kinds of mis¬ 
conduct might produce: theTimarchus affair makes this clear. 
The author of the Erotic Essay points it out to the young 
Epicrates; part of his future, including the rank he will be able 
to occupy in the city, depends this very day on the manner, 
honorable or not, in which he conducts himself: considering 
that the city cannot call upon just anyone, it will have to take 
account of established reputations; 10 and the man who scoffs 
at good advice will be punished all his life for his blindness. 
Two things are necessary, therefore: to mind one’s own con¬ 
duct when one is still very young, but also to look after the 
honor of younger men, when one has grown older. 

This transitional age, when the young man was so desirable 
and his honor so fragile, thus constituted a trial period: a time 
when his worth was tested, in the sense that it had to be 
formed, exercised, and measured all at the same time. A few 
lines at the end of the text point up the testlike characteristics 



Erotics 


207 


that the boy’s behavior assumed in this period of his life. In 
exhorting Epicrates, the author of the encomium reminds him 
that he will be put to the test (agon), and that the debate will 
be a dokimasia : 11 this was the word that designated the exami¬ 
nation upon whose completion young men were enrolled 
among the ephebi or citizens were admitted to certain magis¬ 
tracies. The young man’s conduct owed its importance and the 
attention that everyone needed to give it, to the fact that 
everyone saw it as a qualifying test. The text says this plainly, 
moreover: “I think . . . that the city will appoint you to be in 
charge of some department of her business, and in proportion 
as your natural gifts are more conspicuous it will judge you 
worthy of greater responsibilities and will the sooner desire to 
make trial of your abilities.” 12 

3. What exactly was being tested? And with respect to 
what type of behavior was Epicrates supposed to draw the line 
between that which was honorable and that which was dis¬ 
graceful? The test pertained to the familiar points of Greek 
education: the demeanor of the body (carefully avoid rha- 
thymia, the sluggishness which was always a defamatory 
sign); one’s gaze (in which aidos, dignity, could be read), one’s 
way of talking (don’t take the easy option of silence, but be 
able to mix serious talk with casual talk); and the quality of 
one’s acquaintances. 

But it was especially in the sphere of amorous conduct that 
the distinction between what was honorable and what was 
shameful operated. On this point, we may note first of all that 
the author—and this is what makes the text both a eulogy of 
love and praise of a young man—criticizes the opinion that 
would tie a boy’s honor to the systematic rejection of suitors: 
doubtless certain lovers defile the relation itself (lymainesthai 
toi pragmati ), 13 but one should not put them in the same class 
as those admirers who show moderation. The text does not 
draw the boundary line of honor between those who spurn 
their suitors and those who accept them. For a Greek youth, 



208 


The Use of Pleasure 


to be pursued by would-be lovers was obviously not a dis¬ 
honor: it was, rather, the visible mark of his qualities; the 
number of admirers could be an object of legitimate pride, and 
sometimes an object of vainglory. But to accept the love rela¬ 
tion, to enter the game (even if one did not play exactly the 
game the lover proposed) was not considered to be a disgrace 
either. The man who praises Epicrates explains to him that 
being beautiful and being loved constitute a double stroke of 
fortune (eutychia ); 14 it only remains for him to make the right 
use (orthos chresthai) of it. It is this point that the text empha¬ 
sizes and makes a “point of honor,” so to speak; these things 
(ta pragmata) are not, in themselves and absolutely, good or 
bad; they vary according to who practices them (para tous 
chromenous ). 15 It is “use” that determines their moral value, 
according to a principle that one sees often formulated else¬ 
where; in any case, we find quite similar expressions in the 
Symposium: “The truth of the matter I believe to be this. 
There is, as I stated at first, no absolute right and wrong in 
love, but everything depends upon the circumstances; to yield 
to a bad man in a bad way is wrong, but to yield to a worthy 
man in a right way is right.” 16 

Now, as for knowing precisely how the distribution of 
honor is to be carried out in the love relation, one must admit 
that the text is extremely elliptical. While it does offer specifics 
regarding what Epicrates should do or has done in order to 
exercise his body and develop his courage, or to acquire the 
philosophical knowledge that he will need, nothing is said 
concerning what is acceptable or objectionable in physical 
relations. One thing is clear: not everything should be refused 
(the young man “grants his favors”), but not everything 
should be consented to: “No one finds himself disappointed of 
favors from you which it is just and fair to ask, but no one is 
permitted even to hope for such liberties as lead to shame. So 
great is the latitude your discreetness permits to those who 
have the best intentions; so great is the discouragement it 
presents to those who would fling off restraint.” 17 The modera- 



Erotics 


209 


tion—the sophrosyne —that is one of the major qualities re¬ 
quired of boys clearly implies a discrimination in physical 
contacts. But it is not possible to infer from this text the acts 
and gestures that honor would compel one to refuse. It should 
be noted that in the Phaedrus the lack of precision is almost 
as great, even though the theme is developed more fully. 
Throughout the first two speeches on the advisability of yield¬ 
ing to a lover or a nonlover, and in the great fable of the soul 
as a team with its restive steed and its obedient steed, Plato’s 
text shows that the question of what constitutes “honorable” 
practice is crucial: and yet the acts are never designated except 
by expressions like “to gratify” or “to grant one’s favors” 
(charizesthai), “to do the thing” (diaprattesthai), “to derive 
the greatest possible pleasure from the beloved,” “to obtain 
what one wants” (pleithesthai), “to enjoy” (apolauesthai). A 
reticence inherent in this type of discourse? Without doubt, 
the Greeks would have found it improper that someone would 
call by name, in a set speech, things that were only vaguely 
alluded to even in polemics and law court addresses. One 
imagines, too, that it was hardly necessary to insist on distinc¬ 
tions that were common knowledge: everyone must have 
known what it was honorable or shamef ul f or a boy to consent 
to. But we may also recall an observation that was made in our 
discussion of dietetics and economics, where it became appar¬ 
ent that moral reflection was less concerned with specifying 
the codes to be respected and the list of acts that were permit¬ 
ted and prohibited than it was concerned with characterizing 
the type of attitude, of relationship with oneself that was 
required. 

4. Actually, while the text does not indicate the practical 
forms that are to be respected and the physical boundaries that 
are not to be crossed, it does at least designate the general 
principle that determines the way to conduct oneself in these 
matters. The entire eulogy of Epicrates refers to an agonistic 
context in which the worth and brilliance of the young man 



210 


The Use of Pleasure 


must affirm itself through his superiority over others. Let us 
quickly review these motifs that were so frequent in set 
speeches. The individual being eulogized is greater than the 
praise that one offers him, and the words risk being less beauti¬ 
ful than the one to whom they are addressed; or the boy 
surpasses all others in physical and moral qualities; not only 
his gifts but his conversation places him above all others; 
among all the exercises in which one can excel, he has chosen 
the most noble, the most rewarding; his soul is prepared for 
“the rivalries of ambition,” and not content to distinguish 
himself by one quality, he combines “all the qualities of which 
a man might justly feel proud.” 18 

However, the merit of Epicrates is not just in this abun¬ 
dance of qualities that enable him to outstrip all his rivals and 
bring glory to his parents; 19 it also consists in the fact that with 
respect to all those who approach him he always maintains his 
eminent worth; he does not allow himself to be dominated by 
any of them; they all want to draw him into their intimacy— 
the word synetheia has both the general meaning of living 
together and the specific meaning of sexual relations—but he 
surpasses them in such a way, he gains such an ascendancy 
over them that they derive all their pleasure from the friend¬ 
ship they feel for him. 20 By not yielding, not submitting, re¬ 
maining the strongest, triumphing over suitors and lovers 
through one’s resistance, one’s firmness, one’s moderation 
(sophrosyne )—the young man proves his excellence in the 
sphere of love relations. 

Given this general indication, must we imagine a precise 
code based on the analogy—so familiar to the Greeks—be¬ 
tween positions in the social field (with the difference between 
“the first ones” and the others, the great who rule and those 
who obey, the masters and the servants) and the form of sexual 
relations {with dominant and subordinate positions, active 
and passive roles, penetration carried out by the man and 
undergone by his partner)? To say that one must not yield, not 
let others get the best of one, not accept a subordinate position 



Erotics 


211 


where one would get the worst of it, is doubtless to exclude 
or advise against sexual practices that would be humiliating 
for the boy, putting him in a position of inferiority. 21 

But it is likely that the principle of honor and maintenance 
of “superiority” refers—beyond a few precise prescriptions— 
to a kind of general style: it was not good (especially in the 
eyes of public opinion) for a boy to behave “passively,” to let 
himself be manipulated and dominated, to yield without re¬ 
sistance, to become an obliging partner in the sensual pleas¬ 
ures of the other, to indulge his whims, and to offer his body 
to whomever it pleased and however it pleased them, out of 
weakness, lust, or self-interest. This was what dishonored boys 
who accepted the first comer, who showed off unscrupulously, 
who passed from hand to hand, who granted everything to the 
highest bidder. This was what Epicrates did not and would not 
do, mindful as he was of the opinion people had of him, of the 
rank he would have to hold, and of the useful relations he 
might enter into. 

5. I would like just to mention again briefly the role that 
the author of the Erotic Essay has philosophy play in this 
safeguarding of honor and these contests of superiority by 
which the boy is invited to test himself in a manner that befits 
his age. This philosophy, whose content is not specified apart 
from a reference to the Socratic theme of epimeleia heautou, 
“care of the self,” 22 and to the necessity, also Socratic, of 
combining knowledge and exercise (episteme, melete )—this 
philosophy is not presented as a guide for leading a different 
life, nor for abstaining from all the pleasures. It is invoked by 
Demosthenes as an indispensable complement of the other 
tests: “Reflect that ... of all things the most irrational is to 
be ambitious for wealth, bodily strength, and such things, and 
for their sake to submit to many tests . . . but not to aim at 
the improvement of the mind, which has supervision over all 
other powers.” 23 What philosophy can show, in fact, is how to 
become “stronger than oneself’ and when one has become so, 



212 


The Use of Pleasure 


it also enables one to prevail over others. It is by nature a 
leadership principle since it alone is capable of directing 
thought: “Of the powers residing in human beings we shall 
find that thought leads all the rest and that philosophy alone 
is capable of directing it rightly and training it.” 24 It is clear 
that philosophy is an asset that is necessary for the young 
man’s wise conduct; not, however, in order to guide him to¬ 
ward another form of life, but to enable him to exercise self- 
mastery and to triumph over others in the difficult game of 
ordeals to be undergone and honor to be safeguarded. 

The entire Erotic Essay revolves, as we see, around the 
problem of this twofold superiority over oneself and over oth¬ 
ers in that difficult phase when the boy’s youth and beauty 
attract one man after the other, each trying to “get the best” 
of him. In dietetics, it was mainly a question of mastery over 
oneself and over the violence of a perilous act; in economics, 
it was a question of the control that one had to exercise over 
oneself in the practice of the authority that one exercised over 
one’s wife. Here, where erotics takes the boy’s point of view, 
the problem is to see how the boy is going to be able to achieve 
self-mastery in not yielding to others. The point at issue is not 
the sense of measure that one brings to one’s own power, but 
the best way to measure one’s strength against the power of 
others while ensuring one’s own mastery over self. In this 
regard, a brief narration that appears in the middle of the 
speech acquires a symbolic value. It is a commonplace account 
of a chariot race, but a direct relation is established between 
the little sports drama that is reported and the public test that 
the young man undergoes in his behavior with his suitors. We 
see Epicrates driving his team (a likely reference to the Phae- 
drus)\ he is on the verge of defeat, his chariot is about to be 
smashed to pieces by an opposing team; the crowd, despite the 
taste it ordinarily has for accidents, cheers for the hero, while 
he, “stronger even than the vigor of his team, manages to win 
the victory over the most favored of his rivals.” 25 

This prosaic address to Epicrates is certainly not one of the 



Erotics 


213 


highest forms of Greek reflection on love. But in its very 
banality it does bring out some important aspects of “the 
Greek problem of boys.” The young man—between the end 
of childhood and the age when he attained manly status— 
constituted a delicate and difficult factor for Greek ethics and 
Greek thought. His youth with its particular beauty (to which 
every man was believed to be naturally sensitive) and the 
status that would be his (and for which, with the help and 
protection of his entourage, he must prepare himself) formed 
a “strategic” point around which a complex game was re¬ 
quired; his honor—which depended in part on the use he 
made of his body and which would also partly determine his 
future role and reputation—was an important stake in the 
game. For him, there was a test in all this, one that demanded 
diligence and training; there was also, for others, an occasion 
for care and concern. At the very end of his eulogy of Epi- 
crates, the author declares that the life of the boy, his bios, 
must be a “common” work; and, as if it were a matter of a 
work of art to be finished, he urges all who know Epicrates to 
give this future figure “the greatest possible brilliance.” 

Later, in European culture, girls or married women, with 
their behavior, their beauty, and their feelings, were to become 
themes of special concern; a new art of courting them, a 
literature that was basically romantic in form, an exacting 
morality that was attentive to the integrity of their bodies and 
the solidity of their matrimonial commitment—all this would 
draw curiosity and desires around them. No matter what 
inferior position may have been reserved for them in the fam¬ 
ily or in society, there would be an accentuation, a valoriza¬ 
tion, of the “problem” of women. Their nature, their conduct, 
the feelings they inspired or experienced, the permitted or 
forbidden relationship that one might have with them were to 
become themes of reflection, knowledge, analysis, and pre¬ 
scription. It seems clear, on the other hand, that in classical 
Greece the problematization was more active in regard to 
boys, maintaining an intense moral concern around their frag- 



214 


The Use of Pleasure 


ile beauty, their corporal honor, their ethical judgment and 
the training it required. What is historically singular is not 
that the Greeks found pleasure in boys, nor even that they 
accepted this pleasure as legitimate; it is that this acceptance 
of pleasure was not simple, and that it gave rise to a whole 
cultural elaboration. In broad terms, what is important to 
grasp here is not why the Greeks had a fondness for boys but 
why they had a “pederasty”; that is, why they elaborated a 
courtship practice, a moral reflection, and—as we shall see— 
a philosophical asceticism, around that fondness.

The Object of 
Pleasure 


In order to understand how the use of the aphrodisia was 
problematized in reflection on the love of boys, we have to 
recall a principle, which is doubtless not peculiar to Greek 
culture, but which assumed considerable importance within it 
and exercised a decisive authority in its moral valuations. I am 
referring to the principle of isomorphism between sexual rela¬ 
tions and social relations. What this means is that sexual 
relations—always conceived in terms of the model act of pene¬ 
tration, assuming a polarity that opposed activity and passiv¬ 
ity—were seen as being of the same type as the relationship 
between a superior and a subordinate, an individual who 
dominates and one who is dominated, one who commands and 
one who complies, one who vanquishes and one who is van¬ 
quished. Pleasure practices were conceptualized using the 
same categories as those in the field of social rivalries and 
hierarchies: an analogous agonistic structure, analogous oppo¬ 
sitions and differentiations, analogous values attributed to the 
respective roles of the partners. And this suggests that in 
sexual behavior there was one role that was intrinsically hon¬ 
orable and valorized without question: the one that consisted 
in being active, in dominating, in penetrating, in asserting 
one’s superiority. 

This principle had several consequences relating to the sta¬ 
tus of those who were supposed to be the passive partners in 
this activity. Slaves were at the master’s disposition, of course: 

215 



216 


The Use of Pleasure 


their condition made them sexual objects and this was taken 
for granted—so much so that people could be astonished that 
the same law would forbid the rape of slaves and that of 
children. In order to explain this anomaly, Aeschines submits 
that the aim was to show, by prohibiting violence even in the 
case of slaves, what a serious thing it was when directed at 
children of good birth. As for the woman’s passivity, it did 
denote an inferiority of nature and condition; but there was no 
reason to criticize it as a behavior, precisely because it was in 
conformity with what nature intended and with what the law 
prescribed. On the other hand, everything in the way of sexual 
behavior that might cause a free man—to say nothing of some¬ 
one who, by birth, fortune, and prestige, held or should hold 
one of the first ranks among men—to bear the marks of inferi¬ 
ority, submission to domination, and acceptance of servitude, 
could only be considered as shameful: a shame that was even 
greater if he offered himself as the obliging object of another’s 
pleasure. 

Now, in a game regulated according to such principles, the 
position of the (freeborn) boy was difficult. To be sure, he was 
still in an “inferior” position in the sense that he was a long 
way from benefiting from the rights and powers that would be 
his when he attained the full enjoyment of his status. And yet 
his place was not assimilable to that of a slave, nor to that of 
a woman. This was true even in the context of the household 
and the family. A passage from Aristotle’s Politics makes this 
clear. Discussing the relations of authority and forms of gov¬ 
ernment that are appropriate for the family, Aristotle defines 
the positions of the slave, the wife, and the (male) child in 
relation to the head of the family. Governing slaves, Aristotle 
says, is not like governing free beings; to govern a wife is to 
exercise a “political” authority in which relations are perma¬ 
nently unequal; in contrast, the governing of children can be 
called “royal” because it is based “on affection and seniority.” 1 
Indeed, the deliberative faculty is lacking in the slave; it is 
present in the woman, but she doesn’t exercise the decision-

making function in her house; in the boy, the deficiency relates 
only to his incomplete development. And while the moral 
education of women is important, seeing that they constitute 
half the free population, that of male children is more so, for 
it concerns future citizens who will participate in the govern¬ 
ment of the city. 2 We can see, therefore, that the specific 
nature of the boy’s position, the particular form of his depen¬ 
dence, and the manner in which he is to be treated, even in 
the space where the considerable power of the patriarch is 
exercised, were marked by the status that would be his in 
future years. 

The same held true up to a point in the game of sexual 
relations. Among the various legitimate “objects,” the boy 
occupied a special position. He was definitely not a forbidden 
object; in Athens, certain laws protected free children (from 
adults, who at least for a time did not have the right to go into 
the schools; from slaves, who incurred the death penalty if 
they tried corrupting them; and from their fathers or tutors, 
who were punished if they prostituted them); 3 but nothing 
prevented or prohibited an adolescent from being the openly 
recognized sexual partner of a man. Yet there was a sort of 
intrinsic difficulty in this role: something that simultaneously 
made it hard to define clearly and specify exactly what the role 
implied in the sexual relation, and nonetheless drew attention 
to this point and made people attach much importance and 
value to what should or should not occur in that regard. All 
this constituted something of a blind spot and a point of 
overvaluation. The role of the boy was a focus of a good deal 
of uncertainty, combined with an intense interest. 

Aeschines, in Against Timarchus, makes use of a law that 
is very interesting in itself because it concerns the effects of 
civic and political disqualification that a man’s sexual miscon¬ 
duct—“prostitution” in the precise sense—could entail in that 
it would prohibit him from subsequently “becoming one of the 
nine archons or discharging the office of priest or acting as an 
advocate for the state.” An individual who had prostituted

himself was debarred from holding any magistracy in the city 
or abroad, be it elective or conferred by lot. He could not serve 
as a herald or ambassador, nor become a prosecutor of ambas¬ 
sadors or a paid slanderer.* Further, he could not address the 
council or the assembly, even though he were “the most elo¬ 
quent orator in Athens.” 4 Hence this law made male prostitu¬ 
tion an instance of atimia —of public disgrace—that excluded 
a citizen from certain responsibilities.t But the way in which 
Aeschines conducts his prosecution, and tries through a 
strictly juridical discussion to compromise his adversary, 
points up the relation of incompatibility—ethical as much as 
legal—that was recognized as existing between certain sexual 
roles assumed by boys and certain social roles assumed by 
adults. 

Aeschines’ legal argumentation, which is based on Timar- 
chus’ “bad conduct” as alleged via rumors, gossip, and testi¬ 
mony, consists in going back and finding certain factors that 
constitute prostitution (number of partners, indiscriminate¬ 
ness, payment for services) whereas others are lacking (he 
hadn’t been registered as a prostitute and he hadn’t stayed in 
a house). When he was young and good-looking, he passed 
through many hands, and not always honorable ones since he 
is known to have lived with a man of servile status and in the 
house of a notorious lecher who surrounded himself with 
singers and zither players; he received gifts, he was kept, he 
took part in the excesses of his protectors; he is known to have 
been with Cedonides, Autocleides, Thersandrus, Misgolas, 
Anticles, Pittalacus, and Hegesandrus. Thus it is not possible 
to say simply that he has had many relationships (hetairekos), 
but that he has “prostituted” himself (peporneumenos): “For 

* Translator’s note. Foucault says here: “accusateur ou denonciateur salarie.” The 
relevant phrase from Aeschines’ speech, as translated by K. J. Dover in Greek 
Homosexuality, reads: “or take money for threatening false accusations.” Dover 
notes that this disqualification is fictitious, a rhetorical maneuver by Aeschines. 
Obviously, slander was not something that Athenian law explicitly condoned.

it was the fact of violating the disqualifications that resulted from having been a 
prostitute.’

the man who practices this thing with one person, and prac¬ 
tices it for pay, seems to me to be liable to precisely this 
charge.” 6 

But the accusation also operates on a moral level that makes 
it possible not only to establish the crime, but to compromise 
the adversary politically and in general. Perhaps Timarchus 
was not formally a professional prostitute, but he is definitely 
not one of those respectable men who make no secret of their 
taste for male loves and who maintain honorable relations 
with free boys, relations that are valuable to the young part¬ 
ner: Aeschines acknowledges that he is partial to this kind of 
love. He describes Timarchus as a man who in the course of 
his youth placed himself and showed himself to everyone, in 
the inferior and humiliating position of a pleasure object for 
others; he wanted this role, he sought it, took pleasure in it, 
and profited from it. And this is what Aeschines would have 
his audience see as morally and politically incompatible with 
civic responsibilities and the exercise of political power. A 
man who has been marked by this role which he was pleased 
to assume in his youth would not now be able to play, without 
provoking indignation, the role of a man who is over others 
in the city, who provides them with friends, counsels them in 
their decisions, leads them and represents them. What was 
hard for Athenians to accept—and this is the feeling that 
Aeschines tries to play upon in the speech against Timarchus 
—was not that they might be governed by someone who loved 
boys, or who as a youth was loved by a man; but that they 
might come under the authority of a leader who once iden¬ 
tified with the role of pleasure object for others. 

It is this feeling, moreover, that Aristophanes had appealed 
to so often in his comedies; the point of mockery and the thing 
that was meant to be scandalous were that these orators, these 
leaders who were followed and loved, these citizens who 
sought to seduce the people in order to rule over them, such 
as Cleon or Agyrrhius, were also individuals who had con¬ 
sented and still consented to play the role of passive, obliging 



220 


The Use of Pleasure 


objects. And Aristophanes spoke ironically of an Athenian 
democracy where one’s chances of being heard in the assembly 
were greater the more one had a taste for pleasures of this 
sort . 7 In the same way and the same spirit, Diogenes made fun 
of Demosthenes and the morals he had while pretending to be 
the leader (demagogos) of the Athenian people . 8 When one 
played the role of subordinate partner in the game of pleasure 
relations, one could not be truly dominant in the game of civic 
and political activity. 

The extent to which these criticisms and satires may have 
been justified in reality matters little. There is at least one 
thing that they show clearly by their mere existence: namely, 
the difficulty caused, in this society that accepted sexual rela¬ 
tions between men, by the juxtaposition of an ethos of male 
superiority and a conception of all sexual intercourse in terms 
of the schema of penetration and male domination. The conse¬ 
quence of this was that on the one hand the “active” and 
dominant role was always assigned positive values, but on the 
other hand it was necessary to attribute to one of the partners 
in the sexual act the passive, dominated, and inferior position. 
And while this was no problem when it involved a woman or 
a slave, the case was altered when it involved a man. It is 
doubtless the existence of this difficulty that explains both the 
silence in which this relationship between adults was actually 
enveloped, and the noisy disqualification of those who broke 
this silence by declaring their acceptance of, or rather, their 
preference for this “subordinate” role. It was also in view of 
this difficulty that all the attention was concentrated on the 
relationship between men and boys, since in this case one of 
the two partners, owing to his youth and to the fact that he 
had not yet attained manly status, could be—for a period that 
everyone knew to be brief—an admissible object of pleasure. 
But while the boy, because of his peculiar charm, could be a 
prey that men might pursue without causing a scandal or a 
problem, one had to keep in mind that the day would come 
when he would have to be a man, to exercise powers and 



Erotics 


221 


responsibilities, so that obviously he could then no longer be 
an object of pleasure—but then, to what extent could he have 
been such an object? 

Hence the problem that we may call the “antinomy of the 
boy” in the Greek ethics of aphrodisia. On the one hand, 
young men were recognized as objects of pleasure—and even 
as the only honorable and legitimate objects among the possi¬ 
ble male partners of men: no one would ever reproach a man 
for loving a boy, for desiring and enjoying him, provided that 
the laws and proprieties were respected. But on the other 
hand, the boy, whose youth must be a training for manhood, 
could not and must not identify with that role. He could not 
of his own accord, in his own eyes, and for his own sake, be 
that object of pleasure, even though the man was quite natu¬ 
rally fond of appointing him as an object of pleasure. In short, 
to delight in and be a subject of pleasure with a boy did not 
cause a problem for the Greeks; but to be an object of pleasure 
and to acknowledge oneself as such constituted a major diffi¬ 
culty for the boy. The relationship that he was expected to 
establish with himself in order to become a free man, master 
of himself and capable of prevailing over others, was at vari¬ 
ance with a form of relationship in which he would be an 
object of pleasure for another. This noncoincidence was eth¬ 
ically necessary. 

Such a difference explains certain characteristic features of 
the Greeks’ reflection on the love of boys. 

In the first place, there was an oscillation—enigmatic for us 
-—concerning the natural or “unnatural” character of that 
type of love. On one side, it was held for granted that the 
attraction to boys was natural in just the same way as all 
movement that carried one in the direction of the beautiful 
was natural. And yet it is not unusual to find the assertion that 
relations between men, or more generally, between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex, is para physin, beside nature. Of 
course one can infer that these two views indicate two different 
attitudes, one favorable and the other hostile to that kind of 



222 


The Use of Pleasure 


love. But the very possibility of these two opinions was proba¬ 
bly owing to the fact that while people deemed it quite natural 
that one might find pleasure with a boy, it was much harder 
to accept as natural that which made a boy an object of 
pleasure. So that one could take exception to the very act that 
was carried out between two male individuals on the grounds 
that it was para physin —because it feminized one of the part¬ 
ners, whereas the desire that one could have for beauty was 
nevertheless regarded as natural. The Cynics were not against 
the love of boys, even though they heaped sarcasm on all those 
boys whose passivity caused them to accept being estranged 
from their own nature, thus becoming “worse than they 
were.” 9 As for Plato, there is no reason to suppose that, having 
been a believer in male love as a youth, he later “got wise” to 
the extent that he condemned it as being a relationship “con¬ 
trary to nature.” It should be noted, rather, that at the begin¬ 
ning of the Lam, when he draws a contrast between relations 
with women as an element of nature and relations between 
men (or between women) as an effect of incontinence 
(akrasia), he is referring to the act of copulation itself (pro¬ 
vided for by nature for procreation) and he is thinking of 
institutions that are likely to promote or on the other hand 
pervert citizens’ morals. 10 Similarly, in the passage from Book 
VIII where he foresees the need—and the difficulty—of a law 
concerning sexual relations, the arguments he puts forward 
have to do with the harmfulness of “using” men and boys 
“like females” in sexual intercourse (mixis aphrodision): in the 
one seduced, how might a “courageous, manly disposition [to 
tes andreias ethos] be formed? And in the seducer, what would 
nurture “the offspring of the idea of a moderate man”? “Ev¬ 
eryone blames the softness of the one who gives in to the 
pleasures and is incapable of mastering them,” and “reproves 
the resemblance in image of the one who undertakes the imita¬ 
tion of the female.” 11 * 

*In the Phaedrus, the physical form of the relation where a man behaves like a 
"four-footed beast” is said to be “unnatural.”” 



Erotics 


223 


The problem of considering the boy as an object of pleasure 
was also manifested by a noticeable reticence on several 
points. There was a reluctance to evoke directly and in so 
many words the role of the boy in sexual intercourse: some¬ 
times quite general expressions are employed, such as “to do 
the thing” (diaprattesthai to pragma); l} other times the 
“thing” is designated by the very impossibility of naming it; 14 
or again—and this is what says most about the problem posed 
by the relation—people resorted to metaphorical terms that 
were “agnostic” or political: “to yield,” to “submit” (hype- 
retein), “to render a service” (therapeuein, hypourgein ). 15 

But there was also a reluctance to concede that the boy 
might experience pleasure. This “denial” should be interpre¬ 
ted both as the affirmation that such a pleasure could not exist 
and as the prescription that it ought not to be experienced. 
Having to explain why love so often turns into hatred when 
it is mediated by physical relations, Socrates, in Xenophon’s 
Symposium, speaks of the unpleasant feelings that may arise 
in a youth because of his relationship (homilein) with an aging 
man. But he immediately adds as a general principle: “A 
youth does not share in the pleasure of the intercourse as a 
woman does, but looks on, sober, at another in love’s intoxica¬ 
tion.” 16 Between the man and the boy, there is not—there 
cannot and should not be—a community of pleasure. The 
author of the Problems admits the possibility only for a few 
individuals and only in the case of an anatomical irregularity. 
And no one was more severely criticized than boys who 
showed by their willingness to yield, by their many relation¬ 
ships, or by their dress, their makeup, their adornments or 
their perfumes, that they might enjoy playing that role. 

Which does not mean, however, that when the boy hap¬ 
pened to give in, he had to do it coldly somehow. On the 
contrary, he was supposed to yield only if he had feelings of 
admiration, gratitude, or affection for his lover, which made 
him want to please the latter. The verb charizesthai was com¬ 
monly employed in order to indicate the fact that the boy 



224 


The Use of Pleasure 


“complied” and “grantedhis favors.” 17 The word does suggest 
that there was something other than a simple “surrender” by 
the beloved to the lover; the youth “granted his favors” 
through a movement that yielded to a desire and a demand on 
the part of the other, but was not of the same nature. It was 
a response; it was not the sharing of a sensation. The boy was 
not supposed to experience a physical pleasure; he was not 
even supposed quite to take pleasure in the man’s pleasure; he 
was supposed to feel pleased about giving pleasure to the 
other, provided he yielded when he should—that is, not too 
hastily, nor too reluctantly either. 

Sexual relations thus demanded particular behaviors on the 
part of both partners. A consequence of the fact that the boy 
could not identify with the part he had to play; he was sup¬ 
posed to refuse, resist, flee, escape. 18 He was also supposed to 
make his consent, if he finally gave it, subject to conditions 
relating to the man to whom he yielded (his merit, his status, 
his virtue) and to the benefit he could expect to gain from him 
(a benefit that was rather shameful if it was only a question 
of money, but honorable if it involved training for manhood, 
social connections for the future, or a lasting friendship). And 
in fact it was benefits of this kind that the lover was supposed 
to be able to provide, in addition to the customary gifts, which 
depended more on status considerations (and whose impor¬ 
tance and value varied with the condition of the partners). So 
that the sexual act, in the relation between a man and a boy, 
needed to be taken up in a game of refusals, evasions, and 
escapes that tended to postpone it as long as possible, but also 
in a process of exchanges that determined the right time and 
the right conditions for it to take place. 

Thus, the boy was expected to give—out of kindness and 
hence not for his own pleasure—something that his partner 
sought with a view to the pleasure he would enjoy; but the 
partner could not rightfully ask for it without a matching offer 
of presents, services, promises, and commitments that were 
altogether different in nature from the “gift” that was made

to him. Which explains that tendency which was so visibly 
marked in Greek reflection on the love of boys: how was this 
relation to be integrated into a larger whole and enabled to 
transform itself into another type of relationship, a stable 
relationship where physical relations would no longer be im¬ 
portant and where the two partners would be able to share the 
same feelings and the same possessions? The love of boys 
could not be morally honorable unless it comprised (as a result 
of the reasonable gifts and services of the lover and the re¬ 
served compliance of the beloved) the elements that would 
form the basis of a transformation of this love into a definitive 
and socially valuable tie, that of philia. 

One would be quite mistaken to think that since the Greeks 
did not prohibit this kind of relationship, they did not worry 
about its implications. It “interested” them more than any 
other sexual relation, and there is every indication that they 
were anxious about it. But we can say that in a thinking such 
as ours, the relationship between two individuals of the same 
sex is questioned primarily from the viewpoint of the subject 
of desire: how can it be that in a man a desire forms whose 
object is another man? And we know very well that it is in a 
certain structuring of this desire (in its ambivalence, or in 
what it lacks) that the rudiments of an answer will be sought. 
The preoccupation of the Greeks, on the other hand, did not 
concern the desire that might incline an individual to this kind 
of relationship, nor did it concern the subject of this desire; 
their anxiety was focused on the object of pleasure, or more 
precisely, on that object insofar as he would have to become 
in turn the master in the pleasure that was enjoyed with others 
and in the power that was exercised over oneself. 

It was here, at this point of problematization (how to make 
the object of pleasure into a subject who was in control of his 
pleasures), that philosophical erotics, or in any case Socratic- 
Platonic reflection on love, was to take its point of departure. 




PART FIVE 

True Love 





Erotics, as a purposeful art of love (the love of boys in 
particular), will be our topic in this section as well. But this 
time it will be treated as a developmental context for the 
fourth of the great austerity themes that have run through the 
ethics of pleasure over the entire course of its history in the 
Western world. After the relation to the body and to health, 
after the relation to wives and to the institution of marriage, 
and after the relation to boys, to their freedom and their 
virility—three motifs in the problematization of sexual activ¬ 
ity—I would like now to consider the relation to truth. For it 
is one of the most remarkable aspects of Greek reflection on 
the love of boys that not only does it show how—for reasons 
we have seen—this love constituted a sensitive point that de¬ 
manded an elaboration of behavior and a rather delicate styli¬ 
zation of the use of the aphrodisia, but it was around this issue 
that the question of the relations between the use of pleasures 
and access to truth was developed, in the form of an inquiry 
into the nature of true love. 

In the Christian and modern cultures these same questions 
—of truth, of love, and of pleasure—were to be framed, rather, 
in terms of the constituent elements of the man-woman rela¬ 
tionship: the themes of virginity, of spiritual matrimony, of 
the soul-wife soon marked the shift from a basically masculine 
scene—occupied by the erastes and the eromenos —to one 
dominated by the figures of femininity and of the relationship 
between the two sexes.* Much later, Faust would be an exam¬ 
ple of the way in which the question of pleasure and that of 
access, to knowledge would be linked to the theme of love for 

•Which does not mean that the figures of male love disappeared entirely. 1 


229 



230 


The Use of Pleasure 


woman, for her virginity, her purity, her fall, and her redemp¬ 
tive power. With the Greeks, on the other hand, reflection on 
the reciprocal ties between access to truth and sexual austerity 
seems to have been developed primarily in connection with the 
love of boys. Of course we have to make allowance for the fact 
that little has survived of the things that may have been said 
and recommended, in the Pythagorean circles of the period, 
concerning the relations between purity and knowledge. We 
also have to allow for the fact that we do not have the treatises 
on love that were written by Antisthenes, Diogenes the Cynic, 
Aristotle, or Theophrastus. It would be unwise, therefore, to 
generalize the particular features of the Socratic-Platonic doc¬ 
trine, as if the latter provided a compendium of all the forms 
the philosophy of Eros may have taken in classical Greece. All 
the same, it did remain a pole of reflection for a very long time, 
as texts such as Plutarch’s dialogue, Lucian’s Affairs of the 
Heart, or the speeches of Maximus of Tyre show very well. 

As it appears in the Symposium or the Phaedrus in any case, 
and considering the references it makes to other ways of dis¬ 
coursing on love, we can see the distance that separates this 
doctrine from the ordinary erotics that posed questions con¬ 
cerning the reciprocal good behavior of the young man and his 
suitor, and concerning the way in which behavior could accord 
with honor. We can also see how, while being deeply rooted in 
the habitual themes of the ethics of pleasure, it broached 
questions that would later have a very great importance for the 
transformation of this ethics into a morality of renunciation 
and for the constitution of a hermeneutics of desire. 

An entire large section of the Symposium and of the Phae¬ 
drus is devoted to the “reproduction”—imitation or pastiche 
—of what was customarily said in speeches on love. The “ref¬ 
erence speeches” of Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus, and 
Agathon in the Symposium; that of Lysias in the Phaedrus; 
and the first counter-speech by Socrates are of this type. They 
illuminate the background of the Platonic doctrine, the raw 
material that Plato elaborates and transforms when he re- 



True Love 


231 


places the problematics of “courtship” and honor with that of 
truth and ascesis. In these reference speeches, one element is 
essential: through the praise of love, of its power and its divin¬ 
ity, the question of consent comes up again and again: should 
the young man yield? To whom? In what conditions and with 
what guarantees? And can the individual who loves him jus¬ 
tifiably hope to see him yield easily? A question characteristic 
of an erotics conceived as an art of give and take between the 
one who courts and the one who is courted. 

It is this question that appears in the form of an absolutely 
general and amusingly tautological principle in the first speech 
of the Symposium at Agathon’s house: “shame [aischyne] at 
what is disgraceful [aischrois] and ambition for what is 
noble”; 2 but Pausanias immediately takes up the principle in 
a more serious way, differentiating between two loves, the one 
“whose only aim is the satisfaction of its desires,” and the 
other which desires above all to test the soul. 3 We may also 
note that in the Phaedrus the first two speeches—both of 
which will be dismissed, the first becoming the object of an 
ironic recapitulation, and the second, that of a reparative 
palinode—pose, each in its own way, the question of “to 
whom should one yield?”; and that they answer the question 
by saying that one must yield to the person who loves. And 
all these first speeches appeal to a common thematics: that of 
transitory loves that disintegrate when the beloved comes of 
age, leaving him stranded; 4 that of dishonorable relations that 
place the boy under the domination of the lover, 5 compromise 
him in the eyes of everyone, and alienate him from his family 
or from honorable relations from which he could benefit; 6 that 
of the feelings of disgust and contempt the lover might have 
for the boy due to the satisfactions the latter grants him, or 
the feelings of hatred the young man might experience for the 
aging man who imposes disagreeable relations on him; 7 that 
of the feminine role the boy is led to assume, and the effects 
of physical and moral deterioration that this kind of relation 
invites; 8 that of the often burdensome compensations, benefits, 



232 


The Use of Pleasure 


and services that the lover must impose on himself, obligations 
that he tries to escape by abandoning his erstwhile companion 
to shame and solitude. 9 All of that constituted the elementary 
problematics of the pleasures and their use in the love of boys. 
It was these difficulties that the customs, courtship practices, 
and regulated games of love attempted to overcome. 

One might think that Aristophanes’ speech in the Sympo¬ 
sium constituted an exception: in telling of the bisection of 
primeval human beings due to the wrath of the gods, their 
separation into two halves (males and females, or both halves 
being of the same sex, depending on whether the original 
individual was androgynous or entirely male or female), it 
seems to go far beyond the problems of the art of courtship. 
It raises the question of the nature of love; and it could pass 
for an amusing approach—ironically placed in the mouth of 
Aristophanes, the old adversary of Socrates—to the theses of 
Plato himself. Doesn’t it speak of lovers who are searching for 
their lost half, just as Plato’s souls remember and long for 
what used to be their homeland? However, restricting our¬ 
selves to the parts of the speech that concern male love, it is 
clear that Aristophanes also tends to answer the question of 
consent. And the thing that makes his speech and his irony 
unusual and a bit scandalous is that his answer is completely 
affirmative. Moreover, his mythical tale upsets the generally 
accepted principle of dissymmetry of age, feelings, and behav¬ 
ior between the lover and the beloved. He posits a symmetry 
and equality between the two, since he has them originate in 
the division of a single being; the same pleasure and the same 
desire attract the erastes and the eromenos to one another. A 
boy will naturally love men if he is half a male being: he will 
“take pleasure” in “lying beside males” and in “being ent¬ 
wined with them” (sympeplegmenoi ). 10 And far from revealing 
a feminine nature, this shows that he is the mere “tally” of a 
being that is entirely male. And Plato amuses himself by 
having Aristophanes reverse the reproach that the latter, in his 
comedies, had so often aimed at the politicians of Athens: “in 



True Love 


233 


after years they are the only men who show any real manliness 
in public life.” 11 In their youth they gave themselves to men 
because they were looking for their male half; for the same 
reason, once they are adults they will pursue boys. “Loving 
boys” and “cherishing lovers” (to be paiderastes and phileras- 
tes) n are the two sides of the same being. Hence, to the tradi¬ 
tional question of consent, Aristophanes gives an answer that 
is direct, simple, and entirely affirmative, and he thereby 
abolishes the game of dissymmetries that structured the com¬ 
plex relations between man and boy: the whole question of 
love and right conduct thus becomes nothing more than the 
problem of finding one’s lost half. 

Now, Socratic-Platonic erotics is radically different: not 
only because of the solution it proposes, but also and especially 
because it tends to frame the question in very different terms. 
Knowing the nature of true love will no longer be a matter of 
answering the question: who must one love and under what 
conditions can love be honorable both for the beloved and for 
the lover? Or at least, all these questions will be subordinated 
to another, primary and fundamental question: what is love in 
its very being? 13 

In order to measure the Platonic elaboration and the dis¬ 
tance that separates it from the prevailing erotics, it may be 
useful to recall the way in which Xenophon replies to this 
same question. He stresses the traditional elements: the oppo¬ 
sition between the love that seeks only the pleasure of the lover 
and that which also manifests a concern for the beloved him¬ 
self; the necessity of transforming ephemeral love into a mu¬ 
tual, egalitarian, and lasting friendship. Inth t Symposium and 
the Memorabilia, Xenophon presents a Socrates who draws a 
strict dividing line between love of the soul and love of the 
body, disqualifies the love of the body in his own person, 
makes love of the soul the true love and seeks in friendship 
(philia) the principle that gives value to every relation (sy- 
nousia ). 14 It follows that to join love of the soul to love of the 



234 


The Use of Pleasure 


body is not sufficient; one must rid every attachment of its 
physical dimensions (when one loves “the body and the soul 
at the same time,” it is the first that will dominate, and the 
fading of youth causes friendship itself to wither away);' 3 one 
should follow the example of Socrates and shun all contact, 
forgo the kisses that are likely to hinder the soul, and even take 
care that one’s body doesn’t touch another’s, and doesn’t feel 
its “bite.” 16 In positive terms, every relationship must be based 
on the constituent elements of friendship: benefits and services 
rendered, efforts for the improvement of the boy one loves, 
mutual affection, a permanent bond established once and for 
all. 17 Does this mean that for Xenophon (or for the Socrates 
that Xenophon portrays) there should not be any eros between 
two men, but only a relationship of philia? This is in fact the 
ideal that Xenophon claims to recognize in the Sparta of 
Lycurgus. 18 According to him, Spartan men who were at¬ 
tracted to the bodies of boys were declared “vile,” whereas 
people praised and encouraged “honest” adults who loved 
nothing but the soul of youths and aspired only to become 
friends with them; so that in Sparta “lovers were no less 
restrained in their love for children than were fathers with 
respect to their sons, or brothers with respect to their broth¬ 
ers.” But in the Symposium, Xenophon gives a less schematic 
image of this division. He outlines a conception of eros and its 
pleasures that would have friendship itself as the goal. Friend¬ 
ship, insofar as it implies a life in commott, reciprocal atten¬ 
tion, kindness to one another, and shared feelings, is not made 
a substitute for love or something that would take over from 
it in due time. Xenophon makes it the very thing lovers should 
be enamored of: erontes tes philias, he says, employing a char¬ 
acteristic expression that makes it possible to save eros, to 
maintain its force, but without giving it a concrete content 
apart from the behavior that results from the mutual and 
lasting affection of friendship. 19 

Platonic erotics is constructed very differently, even if the 
starting point of reflection is in the familiar question of the

place to assign the aphrodisia in the love relation. For in fact 
Plato takes up these traditional questions only in order to 
show how, in the hasty replies that are given to them, the basic 
problem is overlooked. 

The first two speeches of the Phaedrus, the naive speech 
of Lysias and the facetious speech of Socrates, argue that a 
boy should not yield to the one who loves him. Such talk, 
Socrates remarks, cannot tell the truth: “False is the tale [ 
ouk esti etymos logos] which says that because the lover is 
mad and the non-lover sane the non-lover should be given 
the preference when one might have a lover.” 20 In contrary 
fashion, and out of a concern to praise love instead of offend¬ 
ing it, the beginning speeches of the Symposium assert that it 
is fine to yield provided one does so in the right way, to a 
noble lover, 21 that there is nothing indecent or shameful in it, 
and that under the law of love “where there is mutual con¬ 
sent there is what the law proclaims to be right.” 22 These 
speeches are more respectf ul of love, but that does not make 
them any more etymoi than those of Lysias and his ironic 
fault-finder in the Phaedrus. 

Counterposed to them, the words of Diotima, reported in 
the Symposium, and the great fable of the Phaedrus, nar¬ 
rated by Socrates himself, stand as discourses etymoi: true 
discourses, and related by their origin to the truth that they 
tell. What makes them such? How are they different from 
the panegyrics or disqualifications that preceded them? The 
difference is not in the fact that Diotima or Socrates are 
more rigorous or more austere than the other interlocutors; 
they do not oppose these other speeches because the latter 
are too accommodating, making too much allowance for the 
body and the pleasures in a love that should be directed only 
to souls. They set themselves apart because they do not pose 
the problem in the same way; they carry out a certain num¬ 
ber of basic transformations and displacements with regard 
to the game of questions that were traditional in discussions 
about love. 



236 


The Use of Pleasure 


1. From the question of amorous behavior to an inquiry into 
the nature of love. In the debate as it is formulated in the 
other speeches, love and the intense and forceful movement 
that takes hold of the lover are presupposed; this love “being 
granted,” 23 the main point of preoccupation is in knowing how 
the two partners ought to conduct themselves; how, in what 
form, to what extent, with the help of what means of persua¬ 
sion or by giving what assurances of friendship, should the 
lover seek to attain “that to which he aspires”; and how, in 
what conditions, after what resistances and tests, should the 
beloved yield? A question of conduct, grounded in a preexist¬ 
ing love. Now, the subject of Diotima and Socrates’ inquiry 
is the very being of this love, its nature and its origin, that 
which makes it strong, and that which moves it so stubbornly 
or so madly toward its object: “What is the essential nature 
of Love, what are his characteristics, and then what are his 
works?” 24 An ontological inquiry and no longer a question of 
deontology. All the other interlocutors orient their speeches 
toward praise or criticism, toward the division between good 
and bad love, toward the delimitation of what one should and 
should not do; in the customary thematics with its search for 
appropriateness and its elaboration of an art of courtship, the 
primary object of reflection is conduct or the game of recipro¬ 
cal conducts. Plato puts this question aside, at least provision¬ 
ally, and, going beyond the division of good and bad, he raises 
the question of what it means to love.* 

Now, to state the question in this way implies, first of all, 
a displacement of the very object of discourse. Diotima re¬ 
proaches Socrates—and in fact all the authors of the preceding 
encomiums—for having looked to the “beloved” object (ton 
eromenon) for the principle of what needed to be said about 
love; they thus let themselves be blinded by the charm, beauty, 
and perfection of the beloved boy, and they mistakenly at¬ 
tributed his merits to love itself; the latter will manifest its 

‘After Phaedrus’ speeches, Socrates points out that there has to be in the mind of 
the speaker “knowledge of the truth about the subject of the speech.”" 



True Love 


237 


characteristic truth only if that truth is sought in its nature 
and not in its object. So it is necessary to leave off thinking 
about the beloved and redirect one’s inquiry to the one who 
loves (to eron), questioning him in his own condition. 26 The 
same thing will be done in the Phaedrus when, replying to the 
first two counter-panegyrics, Socrates makes his long detour 
via the theory of souls. But as a result of this displacement, 
the discourse on love will have to face the risk of being nothing 
more than an “encomium” (in the composite form of praise 
addressed both to love and to the beloved); it will have to 
speak—as in the Symposium —of the “intermediate” nature of 
love, the deficiency that characterizes it (since it does not 
possess the beautiful things that it desires), the parentage of 
poverty and contrivance, of ignorance and knowledge from 
which it is born; it will also have to speak, as in the Sympo¬ 
sium, of the way in which forgetfulness and remembrance of 
the supracelestial vision are mixed in love, and of the long 
road of suffering that will lead it finally to its goal. 

2. From the question of the boy's honor to that of love of truth. 
To say, as Diotima does, that it is better to turn one’s thoughts 
from the beloved object to the loving principle does not mean 
that the question of the object is no longer posed: on the 
contrary, the whole development that follows that basic for¬ 
mulation is devoted to determining what is loved when there 
is love. But as soon as one undertakes to speak of love in a 
discourse that aims to define its nature instead of praising that 
which one loves, the question of the object will be posed in 
different terms. 

In the traditional debate, the starting point for inquiry was 
on the side of the love object itself: given what the person 
whom one loved was, and what he was supposed to be—the 
beauty not only of his body but of his soul, the education that 
he. needed, the free, noble, manly, and courageous character 
he must acquire—what form of love was honorable, for him 
and for the lover? It was respect for the beloved, for his real 



238 


The Use of Pleasure 


nature, that ought to give its own form and its sober style to 
whatever one might ask of him. In the Platonic inquiry, on the 
other hand, it is reflection on the nature of love itself that 
ought to lead to a true determination of its object. Beyond the 
different beautiful objects that the amorous individual may 
become attached to, Diotima shows Socrates that love seeks 
to beget spiritual children, and to contemplate “absolute 
beauty” in its true nature, in its unalloyed purity, and in the 
“oneness of its form.” And in the Phaedrus, it is Socrates 
himself who shows how the soul, if it has a strong enough 
memory of what it has seen beyond the heavens, if it is ener¬ 
getically driven, and if it does not allow impure appetites to 
rob it of its momentum, will attach itself to the beloved object 
only insofar as the latter reflects and imitates beauty itself. 

One does find in Plato the theme that love should be di¬ 
rected to the soul of boys rather than to their bodies. But he 
was not the first or the only one to say this. It was a theme 
that ran through the traditional discussions on love, with 
consequences that varied in their rigor. Attributing the theme 
to Socrates, Xenophon gives it a radical form. What is peculiar 
to Plato is not the dichotomy, but the way in which he esta¬ 
blishes the inferiority of love for bodies. He bases this notion 
not on the dignity of the boy who is loved, but on that which, 
in the lover himself, determines the nature and form of his love 
(his desire for immortality, his yearning for the beautiful in its 
purity, the recollection of what he has seen beyond the heav¬ 
ens). Moreover (and both the Symposium and the Phaedrus 
are quite explicit on this point), he does not trace a clear, 
definitive, and uncrossable dividing line between the bad love 
of the body and the glorious love of the soul; however de¬ 
valued and inferior the relation to the body compared with 
that motion toward beauty, and however dangerous it can 
sometimes be since it cannot deflect and stop that motion, it 
is not excluded out of hand or condemned for all time. From 
one beautiful body to other beautiful bodies, according to the 
famous formula of the Symposium, and on to the beauty that 



True Love 


239 


is found in “occupations,” “rules of conduct,” “the sciences,” 
the motion is continuous, until one gazes at last upon “the vast 
ocean of beauty.” 27 And the same holds for the Phaedrus. 
While it praises the courage and perfection of souls who have 
not yielded, it does not promise punishment for those who, 
leading a life devoted to honor rather than to philosophy, let 
themselves be taken by surprise, so that, carried away by their 
passion, they chance to “commit the thing.” No doubt, at the 
moment when their souls leave their bodies, their lives here 
below having run their course, they will find themselves with¬ 
out wings (unlike what happens to those who have remained 
“masters of themselves”). So they will not be compelled to 
voyage in the underworld; the two lovers will accompany one 
another on the voyage beneath the heavens, until they in turn 
receive wings, “because of their love.” 28 For Plato, it is not 
exclusion of the body that characterizes true love in a funda¬ 
mental way; it is rather that, beyond the appearances of the 
object, love is a relation to truth. 

3. From the question of the dissymmetry of partners to that 
of the convergence of love. According to accepted conven¬ 
tions, it was understood that the Eros came from the lover; as 
for the beloved, he could not be an active subject of love on 
the same basis as the erastes. Doubtless a corresponding at¬ 
tachment, an Anteros, was expected of him. But the nature of 
this response was problematic: it could not be exactly symmet¬ 
rical to that which gave rise to it; more than the lover’s desire 
and pleasure, it was his benevolence, his good turns, his tender 
care, and his example that the boy was supposed to recipro¬ 
cate, and it was necessary to await the time when the tran¬ 
sports of love would cease and age would calm the passions 
and so remove the dangers before the two friends could 
become bound to one another by a relationship of exact 
reciprocity. 

But if Eros was a relation to truth, the two lovers could only 
be rejoined provided that the beloved too had been moved in 



240 


The Use of Pleasure 


the direction of truth by the force of the same Eros. In Pla¬ 
tonic erotics, the beloved cannot settle into the position of 
object in relation to the other’s love, simply waiting to receive, 
by the terms of the exchange to which he is entitled (since he 
is loved), the counsel he needs and the knowledge to which he 
aspires. It is right that he should actually become a subject in 
this love relation. In fact, this is the reason for the reversal, 
toward the end of the third speech of the Phaedrus, that 
changes the focus of the discussion from the lover to the one 
who is loved. Socrates has described the journey, the fervor, 
and the suffering of the one who loves, and the hard struggle 
he has had to conduct in order to gain control of his team. 
Now he turns his attention to the loved one: the young boy’s 
companions have perhaps made him think that it is not good 
to yield to a lover; nevertheless he begins to accept the com¬ 
pany of his lover; the latter’s presence excites him to distrac¬ 
tion; he in his turn feels uplifted by the rising wave of desire, 
wings and plumage start to grow in his soul. 29 Of course, he 
still does not know the true nature of that which he longs for, 
and he finds no words with which to name it; but he “throws 
his arms” around his lover and “gives him kisses.” 30 This 
moment is important: unlike what occurs in the art of court¬ 
ship, the “dialectic of love” in this case calls for two move¬ 
ments exactly alike on the part of the two lovers; the love is 
the same for both of them, since it is the motion that carries 
them toward truth. 

4. From the virtue of the loved boy to the master's love and 
wisdom. In the art of courtship, it fell to the lover to do the 
wooing; and even though he was expected to keep control of 
himself, it was clear that the compelling force of his love 
r/sked overcoming him in spite of himself. The solid point of 
resistance was the boy’s honor, his dignity, the reasonable 
obstinacy with which he might refuse. But from the moment 
when Eros appeals to truth, it is the one who is the more 
advanced on the road of love, the one who is more truly 



True Love 


241 


enamored of truth, who will best be able to guide the other and 
help him to keep from degrading himself in all the base pleas¬ 
ures. The one who is better versed in love will also be the 
master of truth; and it will be his role to teach the loved one 
how to triumph over his desires and become “stronger than 
himself.” In the love relation, and as a consequence of that 
relation to truth which now structures it, a new figure makes 
its appearance: that of the master, coming to take the place of 
the lover; moreover, this personage, through the complete 
mastery that he exercises over himself, will turn the game 
upside down, reverse the roles, establish the principle of a 
renunciation of the aphrodisia, and become, for all young men 
who are eager for truth, an object of love. 

This is doubtless the meaning that should be given to the 
description, in the last pages of the Symposium, of the rela¬ 
tions that Socrates maintains not only with Alcibiades, but 
also with Charmides, the son of Glaucon; with Euthydemus, 
the son of Diodes; and with many others in addition. 31 The 
distribution of roles is completely reversed: it is the young 
boys—those who are beautiful, with many suitors—who are 
enamored of Socrates; they dog his footsteps, they try to se¬ 
duce him, they would like very much to grant him their favors 
—that is, for him to communicate the treasure of his wisdom. 
They are in the position of erastes, and he, the old man with 
the ugly body, is in the position of eromenos. But what they 
are not aware of, and what Alcibiades discovers in the course 
of the famous “test,” is that Socrates is loved by them only to 
the extent that he is able to resist their seduction; which does 
not mean that he feels no love or desire for them, but that he 
is moved by the force of true love, and that he knows how 
truly to love the truth that must be loved. Diotima had said 
this before: it was he who was wisest of all on the subject of 
love. Henceforth the master’s wisdom (and no longer the boy’s 
honor) would mark both the object of true love and the princi¬ 
ple that kept one from “yielding.” 

The Socrates that appears in this passage is invested with 



242 


The Use of Pleasure 


powers that are characteristic of the traditional figure of the 
theios aner: physical endurance, the ability to make oneself 
indifferent to sensations, and the power to absent oneself from 
the body and to concentrate all the soul’s energy on oneself. 32 
But it should be understood that these powers are operative 
here in the quite particular game of Eros; they ensure the 
domination that Socrates is able to exercise over himself in the 
game; and hence they qualify him as the highest object of love 
to which young men might appeal, but at the same time, as 
the only one who can guide their love all the way to truth. Into 
the lover’s game where different dominations confronted one 
another (that of the lover seeking to get control of the beloved, 
that of the beloved seeking to escape, and seeking, by means 
of his resistance, to enslave the lover), Socrates introduces 
another type of domination: that which is exercised by the 
master of truth and for which he is qualified by the dominion 
he exercises over himself. 

Platonic erotics can thus be considered from three view¬ 
points. First, it is a way of responding to an inherent diffi¬ 
culty, for Greek culture, in relationships between men and 
boys: namely, the question of what status to give the latter as 
objects of pleasure. From this angle, Plato’s answer seems 
only more complex and more elaborate than those that 
might have been put forward in the various “debates” on 
love, or—by “Socrates”—in the texts of Xenophon. Actu¬ 
ally, Plato resolves the difficulty of the object of pleasure by 
bringing the question of the loved individual back to the na¬ 
ture of love itself; by structuring the love relation as a rela¬ 
tion to truth; by doubling it and placing it in the one who is 
loved as well as in the one who is in love; and by reversing 
the role of the loved young man, making him a lover of the 
master of truth. In this sense, one can say that it meets the 
challenge that was issued by Aristophanes’ fable: it gives the 
latter a true content. It shows how it is indeed the same love 
which, in the same movement, can make a man both paide- 
rastes and philerastes. The dissymmetries, the disparities, the 



True Love 


243 


resistances, and the evasions that organized the always diffi¬ 
cult relations between the erastes and the eromenos —the ac¬ 
tive subject and the pursued object—in the practice of love 
no longer have any justification; or rather, they can develop 
according to a completely different movement, by taking a 
completely different form, and by imposing a quite different 
game: that of a process in which the master of truth teaches 
the boy the meaning of wisdom. 

But it becomes apparent that Platonic erotics—and this is 
the other side of it—thereby introduces the question of truth 
into the love relation as a fundamental question. And this is 
in an altogether different form from that of the logos to which 
it is necessary to submit one’s appetites in the use of pleasures. 
The lover’s task, the accomplishment of which will in fact 
enable him to reach his goal, is to recognize the true nature 
of the love that has seized him. And here the answer to the 
challenge of Aristophanes transforms the answer the latter 
gave: it is not the other half of himself that the individual seeks 
in the other person; it is the truth to which his soul is related. 
Hence the ethical work he will have to do will be to discover 
and hold fast, without ever letting go, to that relation to truth 
which was the hidden medium of his love. And one thus sees 
how Platonic reflection tends to detach itself from a common 
problematization that revolved around the object and the sta¬ 
tus that ought to be given to him, in order to open a line of 
inquiry concerning love, which will revolve around the subject 
and the truth he is capable of. 

Socratic erotics, in the form that Plato gives it, does deal 
with questions that were customary in discussions on love. 
But it does not undertake to define proper conduct, where 
the sufficiently long resistance of the beloved would counter¬ 
balance the sufficiently valuable services of the lover. It tries 
to determine the self-movement, the kind of effort and work 
upon oneself, which will enable the lover to elicit and estab¬ 
lish his relation to true being. Instead of attempting once 
and for all to draw the line separating that which is honor- 



244 


The Use of Pleasure 


able from that which brings disgrace, it endeavors to de¬ 
scribe the progress of desire—with its difficulties, its ups and 
downs, and its setbacks—that leads to the point where it 
reencounters its own nature. The Symposium and the Phae- 
drus indicate a transition from an erotics structured in terms 
of “courtship” practice and recognition of the other’s free¬ 
dom, to an erotics centered on an ascesis of the subject and 
a common access to truth. The inquiry is thereby displaced: 
in reflection on the chresis aphrodision, it dealt with pleasure 
and its dynamics, the just practice and the right distribution 
of which were to be ensured through self-mastery. In the 
Platonic reflection on love, the inquiry concerns the desire 
that must be led to its true object (which is truth) by recog¬ 
nizing it for what it truly is. The life of moderation, of so- 
phrosyne, as it is described in the Laws, is a life “that is mild 
in every way, with gentle pains and gentle pleasures, a life 
characterized by desires that are mild [eremaiai hedonai, 
malakai epithumiai] and loves that are not mad [erotes ouk 
emmaneis ]”; 33 this statement speaks of an economy of pleas¬ 
ures ensured by the control that is exercised by oneself over 
oneself. To. the soul whose voyage and amorous strivings are 
described by the Phaedrus, it is also recommended, if she is 
to receive her reward beyond the heavens, to practice “an 
orderly regimen” (tetagmene diaite) that is possible because 
she is “mistress of herself’ and she is “heedful of measure,” 
she has “subjected the power of evil” and “liberated the 
power of virtue.” 34 But the struggle she has been able to sus¬ 
tain against the violence of her appetites, she would not have 
been able to conduct it without a twofold relation to truth: a 
relation to her own desire questioned in its being, and a rela¬ 
tion to the object of her desire recognized as a true being. 

Thus, we see where ground is broken for a future inquiry 
into desiring man. Which does not mean that Platonic erotics 
has suddenly and permanently taken leave of the ethics of 
pleasures and their use. We shall see on the contrary that the 
latter continued to develop and transform itself. But the tradi- 



True Love 


245 


tion of thought that stems from Plato was to play an important 
role when, much later, the problematization of sexual behav¬ 
ior would be reworked in terms of the concupiscent soul and 
the deciphering of its arcana. 

This philosophical reflection concerning boys suggests a 
historical paradox. To this male love, and more precisely to 
this love of young boys and adolescents—a love that was later 
to be so severely condemned for such a long time—the Greeks 
granted a legitimacy, which we are fond of seeing as proof of 
the freedom they granted themselves in this domain. And yet 
it was in connection with this love, much more than with 
health (which also preoccupied them) and much more than 
with women and marriage (the orderliness of which they 
nevertheless sought to maintain), that they spoke of the need 
to practice the strictest austerities. To be sure, except in a few 
instances, they did not condemn it or prohibit it. And yet it 
is in the reflection on love of boys that one sees the principle 
of “indefinite abstention” formulated; the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion, which Socrates exemplifies by his faultless resistance of 
temptation; and the theme that this renunciation has a high 
spiritual value by itself. In a way that may be surprising at 
first, one sees the formation, in Greek culture and in connec¬ 
tion with the love of boys, of some of the major elements of 
a sexual ethics that will renounce that love by appealing to the 
above principle: the requirement of a symmetry and reciproc¬ 
ity in the love relationship; the necessity of a long and arduous 
struggle with oneself; the gradual purification of a love that is 
addressed only to being per se, in its truth; and man’s inquiry 
into himself as a subject of desire. 

One would be missing the crucial point if one imagined that 
the love of boys gave rise to its own interdiction, or that an 
ambiguity peculiar to philosophy accepted its reality only by 
demanding its supercession. One should keep in mind that this 
“asceticism” was not a means of disqualifying the love of boys; 
on the contrary, it was a means of stylizing it and hence, by 
giving it shape and form, of valorizing it. The fact remains, 



246 


The Use of Pleasure 


however, that within this asceticism total abstention was pos¬ 
ited as a standard and privilege was given to the question of 
desire, so that elements were introduced that could not easily 
be accommodated in an ethics organized around a search for 
the right use of pleasures. 






Thus, in the field of practices that they singled out for 
special attention (regimen, household management, the 
“courting” of young men) and in the context of the discourses 
that tended to elaborate these practices, the Greeks questioned 
themselves about sexual behavior as an ethical problem, and 
they sought to define the form of moderation that it required. 

This does not mean that the Greeks in general concerned 
themselves with sexual pleasure only from these three points 
of view. One would find in the literature that they have left us 
much evidence of other themes and preoccupations. But re¬ 
stricting oneself, as I have tried to do here, to the prescriptive 
discourses by which they attempted to reflect on and regulate 
their sexual conduct, these three focuses of problematization 
appear to have been the most important ones by far. Around 
them, the Greeks developed arts of living, of conducting them¬ 
selves, and of “using pleasures” according to austere and de¬ 
manding principles. 

At first glance, one can have the impression that these three 
different forms of reflection bear a close resemblance to the 
forms of austerity that will be found later, in the Western, 
Christian societies. In any case, one may be tempted to correct 
the still rather commonly accepted notion of an opposition 
between a pagan thought that “tolerated” the practice of “sex¬ 
ual freedom” and the gloomy and restrictive moralities that 
succeeded it. In fact, though, it is important to recognize that 
the principle of a rigorous and diligently practiced sexual 
moderation is a precept that does not date either from Chris¬ 
tian times, obviously, or from late antiquity, or even from the 
rigorist movements—such as were associated with the Stoics, 
for example—of the Hellenistic and Roman age. As early as 


249 



250 


The Use of Pleasure 


the fourth century, one finds very clearly formulated the idea 
that sexual activity is sufficiently hazardous and costly in 
itself, and sufficiently linked to the loss of the vital substance, 
to require a meticulous economy that would discourage un¬ 
necessary indulgence. One also finds the model of a matrimo¬ 
nial relationship that would demand a similar abstention from 
all “extramarital” pleasure by either spouse. Furthermore, 
one finds the theme of the man’s renunciation of all physical 
relations with a boy. A general principle of moderation, a 
suspicion that sexual pleasure might be an evil, the schema of 
a strict monogamous fidelity, the ideal of an absolute chastity: 
obviously it was not according to such a model that the Greeks 
lived; but isn’t it the case that the philosophical, moral, and 
medical thought that formed in their midst formulated some 
of the basic principles that later ethics—and particularly those 
found in the Christian societies—seem to have only had to 
revive? We cannot stop there, however; the prescriptions may 
be formally alike, but this actually shows only the poverty and 
monotony of interdictions. The way in which sexual activity 
was constituted, recognized, and organized as a moral issue is 
not identical from the mere fact that what was allowed or 
prohibited, recommended or discouraged is identical. 

We have seen how sexual behavior was constituted, in 
Greek thought, as a domain of ethical practice in the form of 
the aphrodisia, of pleasurable acts situated in an agonistic field 
of forces difficult to control. In order to take the form of a 
conduct that was rationally and morally admissible, these acts 
required a strategy of moderation and timing, of quantity and 
opportunity; and this strategy aimed at an exact self-mastery 
—as its culmination and consummation—whereby the subject 
would be “stronger than himself’ even in the power that he 
exercised over others. Now, the requirement of austerity that 
was implied by the constitution of this self-disciplined subject 
was not presented in the form of a universal law, which each 
and every individual would have to obey, but rather as a 
principle of stylization of conduct for those who wished to give

their existence the most graceful and accomplished form pos¬ 
sible. If one wanted to assign an origin to those few great 
themes that shaped our sexual morality (the idea that pleasure 
belongs to the dangerous domain of evil, the obligation to 
practice monogamous fidelity, the exclusion of partners of the 
same sex), not only would it be a mistake to attribute them to 
that fiction called “Judeo-Christian” morality, it would be a 
bigger mistake to look behind them for the timeless operation 
of prohibition, or the permanent form of law. The sexual 
austerity that was prematurely recommended by Greek phi¬ 
losophy is not rooted in the timelessness of a law that would 
take the historically diverse forms of repression, one after the 
other. It belongs to a history that is more decisive for compre¬ 
hending the transformations of moral experience than the 
history of codes: a history of “ethics,” understood as the elabo¬ 
ration of a form of relation to self that enables an individual 
to fashion himself into a subject of ethical conduct. 

Further, each of the three great arts of self-conduct, the 
three major techniques of the self, that were developed in 
Greek thought—dietetics, economics, and erotics—proposed, 
if not a particular sexual ethics, then at least a singular modu¬ 
lation of sexual conduct. In this elaboration of the demands 
of austerity, not only did the Greeks not seek to define a code 
of conducts binding everyone, neither did they seek to orga¬ 
nize sexual behavior as a domain governed in all its aspects by 
one and the same set of principles. 

In dietetics, one finds a form of moderation defined by the 
measured and timely use of the aphrodisia; the practice of this 
moderation called for an attention centered mainly on the 
question of “the right time” and on the correlation between 
the variable states of the body and the changing proprieties of 
the seasons. And at the core of this preoccupation there was 
manifested a fear of violence, a dread of exhaustion, and a 
twofold anxiety about the survival of the individual and the 
maintenance of the species. In economics, one finds a form of 
moderation defined not by the mutual faithfulness of marriage

partners, but by a certain privilege, which the husband 
upholds on behalf of the lawf ul wife over whom he exercises 
his authority; the temporal objective in this case is not to seize 
the opportune moment, but to maintain, throughout life, a 
certain hierarchical structure appropriate to the household; it 
is with a view to ensuring this permanence that the man must 
fear all excess and practice self-control in the control he exer¬ 
cises over others. Lastly, the moderation that is required by 
erotics is of another type still, for even though it does not call 
for pure and simple abstention, we have seen that it tends in 
that direction and that it carries with it the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion of all physical relations with boys. This erotics is linked 
to a perception of time that is very different from that found 
in connection with the body and with marriage: it experiences 
a fleeting time that leads ineluctably to an end that is near. As 
for the concern that animates it, it is that of the respect that 
is owing to the virility of the adolescent and to his future status 
as a free man. It is no longer simply the problem of a man’s 
becoming the master of his pleasure; it is a problem of know¬ 
ing how one can make allowance for the other’s freedom in the 
mastery that one exercises over oneself and in the true love 
that one bears for him. And finally, it is in this reflection 
concerning the love of boys that Platonic erotics raises the 
question of the complex relations between love, the renuncia¬ 
tion of pleasures, and access to truth. 

It may be useful to recall something that K. J. Dover has 
written: “The Greeks neither inherited nor developed a belief 
that a divine power had revealed to mankind a code of laws 
for the regulation of sexual behavior; they had no religious 
institution possessed of the authority to enforce sexual prohi¬ 
bitions. Confronted by cultures older and richer and more 
elaborate than theirs, cultures which nonetheless differed 
greatly from each other, the Greeks felt free to select, adapt, 
develop and—above all—innovate.” 1 For them, reflection on 
sexual behavior as a moral domain was not a means of inter¬ 
nalizing, justifying, or formalizing general interdictions im-

posed on everyone; rather, it was a means of developing—for 
the smallest minority of the population, made up of free, adult 
males—an aesthetics of existence, the purposeful art of a free¬ 
dom perceived as a power game. Their sexual ethics, from 
which our own derives in part, rested on a very harsh system 
of inequalities and constraints (particularly in connection with 
women and slaves); but it was problematized in thought as the 
relationship, for a free man, between the exercise of his free¬ 
dom, the forms of his power, and his access to truth. 

Taking a very schematic, bird’s-eye view of the history of 
this ethics and its transformations over a long period of time, 
one notes first of all a shift of emphasis. It is clear that in 
classical Greek thought it was the relationship with boys that 
constituted the most delicate point, and the most active focus 
of reflection and elaboration; it was here that the problemati- 
zation called for the most subtle forms of austerity. Now, 
surveying the course of a very slow evolution, we can see this 
focus move elsewhere: it is around women that, little by little, 
the problems come to be centered. This does not mean that the 
love of boys will no longer be practiced, nor that it will cease 
to be expressed, nor that people will no longer raise questions 
about it. But it is women and the relation to women that will 
be stressed in moral reflection on sexual pleasures, whether in 
the form of the theme of virginity, of the importance assumed 
by marital conduct, or of the value attributed to relations of 
symmetry and reciprocity between husband and wife. And we 
can see a new shift of the focus of problematization (this time 
from women to the body) in the interest that was shown, 
starting in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in the 
sexuality of children, and, generally speaking, in the relation¬ 
ships between sexual behavior, normality, and health. 

But at the same time as these shifts, a certain unification 
occurred between the elements that were distributed among 
the different “arts” of using the pleasures. There was a doctri¬ 
nal unification—brought about in part by Saint Augustine— 
that made it possible to conceptualize, as parts of the same 



254 


The Use of Pleasure 


theoretical ensemble, the game of death and immortality, the 
institution of marriage, and the conditions of access to truth. 
But there was also a “practical” unification that recentered the 
different arts of existence around the decipherment of the self, 
purification procedures, and struggles against concupiscence. 
So that what was now at the core of the problematization of 
sexual conduct was no longer pleasure and the aesthetics of its 
use, but desire and its purifying hermeneutics. 

This change was the result of a whole series of transforma¬ 
tions. We have evidence of the beginnings of these transforma¬ 
tions, even before the development of Christianity, in the 
reflection of the moralists, philosophers, and doctors of the 
first two centuries of our era.

PART ONE 

Dreaming of 
One’s Pleasures 




I will begin by analyzing a rather singular text. It is a 
“practical” work dealing with everyday life, not a work of 
moral reflection or prescription. Of all the texts that have 
survived from this period, it is the only one that presents 
anything like a systematic exposition of the different forms of 
sexual acts. By and large it does not make direct and explicit 
moral judgments concerning those acts, but it does reveal 
schemas of valuation that were generally accepted. And one 
notes that the latter are quite close to the general principles 
that, already in the classical epoch, organized the ethical expe¬ 
rience of the aphrodisia. The book by Artemidorus thus con¬ 
stitutes a point of reference. It testifies to a perenniality and 
exemplifies a common way of thinking. For this very reason, 
it will allow us to measure what may have been uncommon 
and in part new in the work of philosophical and medical 
reflection on pleasure and sexual conduct that was undertaken 
in the same period.

I 

The Method of 
Artemidorus 


The Interpretation of Dreams by Artemidorus is the only 
text that remains, in full, of a literature that was abundant in 
antiquity: the literature of oneirocriticism. Artemidorus, writ¬ 
ing in the second century a.d., himself cites several works that 
were in use in his day: those of Nicostratus of Ephesus, Panya- 
sis of Halicarnassus, Apollodorus of Telmessus, Phoebus of 
Antioch, Dionysius of Heliopolis, and the naturalist Alexan¬ 
der of Myndus. 1 He makes favorable mention of Aristander of 
Telmessus, and he refers to the three books of the treatise by 
Geminus of Tyre, to the five books of Demetrius of Phalerum, 
and to the twenty-two books of Artemon of Miletus. 2 

Addressing the man to whom his work is dedicated, a cer¬ 
tain Cassius Maximus (possibly Maximus of Tyre, or his fa¬ 
ther, 3 who he says urged him “not to surrender my wisdom 
to silence”), Artemidorus declares that he “has not done any¬ 
thing else” but employ himself “always, day and night,” in the 
interpretation of dreams. 4 An emphatic statement of the sort 
that was rather customary in this kind of presentation? Per¬ 
haps. In any case Artemidorus did something quite different 
from compiling the most famous examples of prophetic 
dreams that were confirmed by reality. He undertook to write 
a work of method, and this in two senses: it was meant to be 
a manual for use in daily practice; it was also meant to be a 
theoretical treatise on the validity of interpretive procedures.

One should bear in mind that the analysis of dreams was 
one of the techniques of existence. Since images encountered 
in dreams, or some of them at least, were thought to be signs 
of reality or messages of the future, a high value was set on 
their decipherment; a reasonable life could scarcely dispense 
with the task. This was a very old popular tradition; it was also 
an accepted custom in cultured milieus. If it was necessary to 
consult the countless professionals of nocturnal images, it was 
also good to be able to interpret their signs oneself. There are 
innumerable testimonies showing the importance accorded 
the analysis of dreams as a life practice, one that was indis¬ 
pensable not only in dramatic circumstances but also in the 
everyday course of events. This was because in dreams the 
gods gave advice, guidance, and sometimes explicit com¬ 
mands. Moreover, even when the dream only announced an 
event without prescribing anything, even when one believed 
that the concatenation of future occurrences was inevitable, it 
was still good to have foreknowledge of things that were 
bound to happen, so that one might prepare for them. “Provi¬ 
dence,” says Achilles Tatius in The Adventures of Leucippe 
and Clitophon, “sometimes foreshows the future to men in 
dreams, not so that they may be able to avoid the sufferings 
fated for them, for they can never get the better of destiny, but 
in order that they may bear them with the more patience when 
those sufferings come; for when disasters come all together 
and unexpectedly, they strike the spirit with so severe and 
sudden a blow that they overwhelm it; while if they are an¬ 
ticipated, the mind, by dwelling on them beforehand, is able 
little by little to turn the edge of sorrow.” 5 Later, Synesius will 
express a completely traditional point of view when he re¬ 
marks that our dreams constitute an oracle who “dwells with 
us,” who accompanies us “if we go abroad; she is with us on 
the field of battle, she is at our side in the life of the city; she 
labors with us in the fields and barters with us in the market¬ 
place”; dreams are to be regarded as “a prophet who is always 
ready, a tireless and silent adviser.” Hence we should all make 



6 


The Care of the Self 


an effort to interpret our dreams, whoever we may be, “men 
and women, old and young, rich and poor, private citizens and 
public officials, inhabitants of the city and of the country, 
artisans and orators,” without regard “either to sex or age, to 
fortune or profession.” 6 It was in this spirit that Artemidorus 
wrote The Interpretation of Dreams. 

Artemidorus is mainly concerned to show the reader pre¬ 
cisely how to go about it: How does one contrive to break 
down a dream into constituent parts and establish its diagnos¬ 
tic meaning? How does one manage also to take this whole 
into account in the decipherment of each of its parts? The 
comparison that Artemidorus makes with the divinatory tech¬ 
niques of sacrificers is significant: they, too, “know how each 
individual sign fits into the whole,” and yet they “base their 
judgments as much on the total sum of the signs as on each 
individual sign.” 7 His book is thus a treatise on how to inter¬ 
pret. Almost entirely centered not on the prophetic marvels of 
dreams but on the techne that enables one to make them speak 
correctly, the work is addressed to several types of readers. 
Artemidorus wishes to supply an instrument for the use of 
professionals and technicians of analysis. This is the vision 
with which he hopes to inspire his son, the addressee of the 
fourth and fifth books: “what has been written here, as long 
as it remains with you alone, will make you a more excellent 
interpreter of dreams than anyone.” 8 He also intends to help 
those who, discouraged by the erroneous methods they have 
tried, may be tempted to give up this valuable practice. His 
book will serve as a salutary treatment— therapeia soteriddes 
—of those errors. 9 But he thinks, too, of the general reader 
who needs basic instruction. 10 In any case, he offers the book 
as a manual for living, a tool that can be used over the course 
of one’s existence and adapted to life’s changing circum¬ 
stances: “just as there is an order and sequence in actual 
events” so he has made an effort to “set down everything in 
an orderly fashion.” 

This “handbook-for-daily-living” aspect is quite noticeable 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


7 


when one compares Artemidorus’ text with the Tales of Aris¬ 
tides, an anxious valetudinarian who spent years harkening to 
the god that sent him dreams through all the extraordinary 
ups and downs of his illness and the countless treatments he 
undertook. One notes that in Artemidorus there is almost no 
place for religious enchantments; unlike many other texts of 
this kind, his work does not depend on cult therapeutics, even 
if, using a traditional formula, he evokes Apollo of Daldis, 
“my own native god,” who encouraged him and, appearing at 
his bedside, “all but commanded me to compose this work.” 11 
Moreover, he is careful to remark on the difference between 
his work and that of such oneirocritics as Geminus of Tyre, 
Demetrius of Phalerum, and Artemon of Miletus, who con¬ 
veyed prescriptions and cures given by Serapis. 12 The typical 
dreamer whom Artemidorus addresses is not a worried devo¬ 
tee who attends to injunctions given from above. He is an 
“ordinary” individual: generally a man (the dreams of women 
are noted as an aside, as possible variants in cases where the 
sex of the subject happens to change the meaning of the 
dream); a man who has a family, possessions, quite often a 
trade (he runs a business; he has a shop). He is apt to have 
servants and slaves (but the case is considered in which he has 
none). And, besides his health, his chief anxieties concern the 
life and death of his entourage, his enrichment, his impover¬ 
ishment, the marriage of his children, the functions he may be 
called upon to exercise in the city. In short, an average clien¬ 
tele. Artemidorus’ text is revelatory of a type of preoccupa¬ 
tions characteristic of ordinary people. 

But the work also has a theoretical interest at stake, which 
Artemidorus speaks of in the dedication to Cassius: he aims 
to refute the adversaries of oneiromancy. He wishes to con¬ 
vince the skeptics who do not believe in all those forms of 
divination by which one attempts to decipher the signs that 
foretell the future. Artemidorus will seek to establish these 
certitudes not so much by a plain exposition of his findings as 



8 


The Care of the Self 


by a carefully considered procedure of inquiry and a discus¬ 
sion of method. 

He does not mean to dispense with earlier texts; he has 
taken pains to read them, but not in order to recopy them, as 
many writers do; what interests him in the “already said” is 
not established authority but rather the breadth and variety of 
experience to be found there. And he has not searched for this 
experience in a few great authors, but has insisted on going to 
those places where it is formed. As he says in the dedication 
to Cassius Maximus, and later repeats, Artemidorus takes 
pride in the breadth of his inquiry. Not only has he compared 
innumerable works, he has patiently frequented the market 
stalls kept by dream readers and soothsayers at the crossroads 
of the Mediterranean world. “I, on the other hand, have not 
only taken special pains to procure every book on the interpre¬ 
tation of dreams, but have consorted for many years with the 
much-despised diviners of the marketplace. People who as¬ 
sume a holier-than-thou countenance and who arch their eye¬ 
brows in a superior way dismiss them as beggars, charlatans, 
and buffoons, but I have ignored their disparagement. Rather, 
in the different cities of Greece and at the great religious 
gatherings in that country, in Asia, in Italy and in the largest 
and most populous of the islands, I have patiently listened to 
old dreams and their consequences. For there was no other 
possible way in which to get practice in these matters.” 13 With 
regard to all that he has brought back, Artemidorus does not 
intend to impart it in the form of raw data; rather, he will 
submit it to “experience” (peira), which is for him the “guid¬ 
ing principle” and “witness” of everything he says. 14 What he 
means by this is that he will verify the information to which 
he refers by matching it against other sources, by comparing 
it with his own practice, and by subjecting it to argument and 
demonstration. In this way, nothing will be said “in the air,” 
nor by resorting to “mere conjecture.” One recognizes the 
methods of inquiry, the notions—e.g., the notions of historia 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


9 


and peira —and the forms of testing and “verification” that 
characterized the gathering of knowledge carried out in natu¬ 
ral history and medicine during this period, under the more 
or less direct influence of skeptical thought.* Artemidorus’ 
text offers the considerable advantage of presenting a careful 
reflection on a vast body of traditional njaterial. 

There is no question of looking in such a document for the 
formulations of an austere morality or the emergence of new 
standards of sexual conduct. What it does offer are indica¬ 
tions concerning current modes of valuation and generally 
accepted attitudes. Philosophical reflection is certainly not 
absent from the text, and one finds in it rather clear refer¬ 
ences to contemporary problems and debates; but these ref¬ 
erences concern the procedures of decipherment and the 
method of analysis, not value judgments and moral contents. 
The material on which the interpretations bear, the oneiric 
scenes they treat, as auguries, and the situations and events 
they announce, belong to a common and traditional land¬ 
scape. One can thus expect this text by Artemidorus to pro¬ 
vide evidence of a rather widespread moral tradition, which 
was doubtless rather deeply rooted in the past. But once 
again it must be kept in mind that while the text abounds in 
detail, while it presents in connection with dreams a catalog 
of different possible acts and relations, and is more system¬ 
atic in this regard than any other work from the same pe¬ 
riod, it is not in any sense a treatise on morality, which 
would be primarily concerned with formulating judgments 
abotit those acts and relations. It is only indirectly, through 
the decipherment of the dreams, that one can discern the 
valuations brought to bear on the scenes and acts repre¬ 
sented in the text. The ethical principles are not affirmed for 
their own sake; one can recognize them only through the 


*R. J. White, in his introduction to the English edition of Artemidorus, points to 
several traces of the empiricist and skeptical influence on Artemidorus. A. H. M. 
Kessels, however, asserts that Artemidorus was only a practitioner, who just inter¬ 
preted the dream that he had before him on a particular day. 15 



10 


The Care of the Self 


actual progression of the analysis, by interpreting the inter¬ 
pretations. This suggests that we should dwell for a moment 
on the procedures of decipherment that Artemidorus brings 
into play. We will then be able to decipher the ethics under¬ 
lying his analysis of sexual dreams. 

1. Artemidorus draws a distinction between two forms of 
nocturnal visions. First, there are the enypnia, dreams that 
express the present affects of the individual and “run their 
course in proximity to the mind.” One is in love, one desires 
the presence of the beloved, one dreams that the latter is 
there; or one goes without food, one feels hungry, one 
dreams of eating; or again, “a man who has stuffed himself 
with food dreams that he is vomiting or choking”; 16 a man 
who fears his enemies dreams that he is surrounded by them. 
This kind of dream has a simple diagnostic value. It is 
grounded in the current state of affairs (from present to pre¬ 
sent); it shows the sleeping subject his own state; it conveys 
that which is deficiency or excess in relation to the body, and 
that which is fear or desire in relation to the mind. 

The dream experiences called oneiroi are different. Their 
nature and function are readily discovered by Artemidorus in 
the three “etymologies” he submits. The oneiros is that which 
to on eirei, “tells what is real.” It tells what is, what is already 
inscribed in time’s unfolding and will come true as an event 
in the not-too-distant future. It is also that which acts on the 
soul and excites it— oneirai. The dream alters the soul, it 
fashions and shapes it; it leads it into dispositions and induces 
movements in it corresponding to what is shown. Further, one 
recognizes in this word oneiros the name of the beggar of 
Ithaca, Irus, who carried the messages that were entrusted to 
him. 17 Term by term, then, enypnion and oneiros are opposed 
to each other: the first speaks of the individual, the second of 
events in the world; one originates in the states of the body and 
the mind, the other anticipates the unwinding of the temporal 
chain; one manifests the action of the too-little and the too- 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


11 


much in the domain of appetites and aversions, the other alerts 
the soul and at the same time shapes it. On the one hand, the 
dreams of desire tell the soul’s reality in its present state. On 
the other hand, the dreams of being tell the future of the event 
in the order of the world. 

A second cleavage brings another form of distinction to 
each of the two categories of “nocturnal visions.” There is that 
which reveals itself clearly and transparently, requiring no 
decipherment or interpretation, and that which displays itself 
only figuratively, in images telling something different from 
their first appearance. In state dreams, desire can be manifes¬ 
ted by the easily recognizable presence of its object (one sees 
in a dream the woman one desires); but it can also be manifes¬ 
ted by another image exhibiting a more or less distant relation¬ 
ship with the object in question. An analogous difference 
obtains in event dreams. Some of them directly designate, by 
showing its actual appearance, that which already exists in the 
future mode: one sees in a dream the sinking of a ship on 
which one will later suffer shipwreck; one sees oneself struck 
by the weapon by which one will be wounded the next day. 
These are the so-called theorematic dreams. But, in other 
cases, the relation between image and event is indirect: the 
image of the ship that breaks apart on the rocks may signify 
not a shipwreck, or even a misfortune, but, for a slave who has 
this dream, his emancipation in the near future. These are the 
“allegorical” dreams. 

Now, the margin that exists between these two distinctions 
poses a practical problem for the interpreter. Given a particu¬ 
lar vision in sleep, how is one to know whether one is dealing 
with a state dream or an event dream? How does one deter¬ 
mine whether the image announces directly what it shows, or 
whether one must suppose that it stands for something else? 
Referring to this difficulty in the first pages of Book IV, Ar- 
temidorus emphasizes the importance of considering the indi¬ 
vidual who has the dream. It is quite certain, he explains, that 
state dreams will not appear to “virtuous” persons, for they 



12 


The Care of the Self 


have been able to subdue their irrational movements, hence 
their passions, their desires or fears; they also know how to 
keep their bodies balanced between deficiency and excess; for 
them, consequently, there are no disturbances, hence none of 
those “dreams” (enypnia) that are always to be understood as 
manifestations of affects. Moreover, it was a very frequent 
theme of moralists that virtue is marked by the disappearance 
of dreams that translate the appetites and involuntary move¬ 
ments of the mind and the body. “The sleeper’s visions,” said 
Seneca, “are as turbulent as his day.” 18 Plutarch cited Zeno in 
affirming that it is a sign of progress when a person no longer 
dreams that he derives pleasure from indecent actions. And he 
alluded to those individuals who have enough strength in their 
waking hours to combat and resist their passions, but who at 
night, “throwing off opinions and laws,” cease to feel any 
shame: then there awakens what is immoral and licentious 
within them. 19 

For Artemidorus, in any case, when state dreams occur 
they can take two forms. In most people, desire and aversion 
are manifested directly and without concealment; but in a man 
who knows how to interpret his own dreams, they are manifes¬ 
ted only through signs. This is because his mind “plays tricks 
on him in a rather ingenious way.” Thus a man with no 
experience in dream interpretation will see in a dream the 
woman he desires or the longed-for death of his master. The 
mistrustful or clever mind of the expert will, so to say, refuse 
to make manifest the state of desire in which he finds himself: 
it will resort to trickery, so that instead of simply seeing the 
woman he desires, the dreamer will see the image of something 
that signifies her: “a horse, a mirror, a ship, the sea, an animal 
that is female, a piece of feminine apparel.” As an example, 
Artemidorus cites a painter from Corinth, an expert inter¬ 
preter no doubt, who saw the roof of his house collapse in a 
dream and saw his own decapitation. One might have imag¬ 
ined that this was the sign of a future event, but in fact it was 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


13 


a state dream: the man wished for the death of his master— 
who is still living, Artemidorus notes in passing. 20 

As concerns the oneiroi, how does one recognize those that 
are transparent and “theorematic” in contrast to those that 
predict allegorically an event different from what they show? 
If one leaves aside the unusual images that obviously call for 
an interpretation, those that foretell an event are immediately 
confirmed by reality: the event follows them without delay. 
The theorematic dream opens directly onto the thing it an¬ 
nounces, not giving interpretation any possible purchase, nor 
allowing it the necessary time interval. Allegorical dreams are 
easily recognized, therefore, by the fact that they are not 
followed by a direct realization, which means that one should 
sei^e the occasion to interpret them. It should be added that 
virtuous individuals—who do not have enypnia but only onei¬ 
roi —ordinarily experience only the clear visions of theore¬ 
matic dreams. Artemidorus does not need to explain this 
privilege: it was traditional to suppose that the gods spoke 
directly to souls that were pure. Recall what Plato said in the 
Republic: “When he has quieted both spirit and appetites, he 
arouses his third part in which wisdom resides and thus takes 
his rest; you know that it is then that he best grasps reality.” 21 
And in the novel by Chariton of Aphrodisias, at the moment 
when Callirhoe is finally near the end of her trials, and when 
her long struggle to preserve her virtue is about to be re¬ 
warded, she has a “theorematic” dream that anticipates the 
conclusion of the story and constitutes both a presage and a 
promise on the part of the goddess protecting her: “When 
night came, she saw herself in a dream, once more a girl in 
Syracuse, entering the sacred precinct of Aphrodite and re¬ 
turning from it; now she was looking at Chaereas and observ¬ 
ing her wedding day; the whole city was decked with garlands 
and she herself was being escorted by her father and mother 
to the home of the groom.” 22 



14 


The Care of the Self 


We can construct a table of the relationships established by 
Artemidorus between the types of dreams, their ways of signi¬ 
fying, and the subject’s modes of being, as follows: 




state dreams 

event dreams 



direct 

through 

signs 

theorematic 

allegorical 

in 

virtuous 

individuals 

never

in 

ordinary 

individuals

inexperienced 

usually 




It is the last entry in the table—allegorical event dreams of 
the sort that ordinary people have—that defines the domain 
of oneirocriticism. It is here that interpretation is possible, 
since such visions are not transparent but make use of one 
image to convey another. And it is here that interpretation is 
useful, since it enables one to prepare for an event that is not 
immediate. 

2. Decipherment of the oneiric allegory is carried out by 
means of analogy. Artemidorus returns to this point several 
times: the art of oneirocriticism is based on the law of resem¬ 
blance; it operates through the “juxtaposition of similari¬ 
ties.” 23 Artemidorus brings this analogy into play on two 
levels. First, there is the natural analogy between the dream 
image and the elements of the future that it foretells. Ar¬ 
temidorus employs various means to detect this resemblance: 
qualitative identity (to dream of a malaise may signify a future 
“bad state” of health or fortune; to dream of mud signifies that 
the body will be congested with harmful substances); identity 
of words (a ram signifies authority because of the word associ¬ 
ation krios-kreion ); 24 symbolic affinity (to dream of a lion is 




Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


15 


a sign of victory for an athlete; to dream of tempests is a sign 
of misfortune); existence of a belief, a popular saying, a mytho¬ 
logical theme (a bear indicates a woman because of Callisto 
the Arcadian); 25 also membership in the same category of 
existence: thus marriage and death may represent each other 
in a dream, since both are regarded as a telos, an end (goal or 
term) for a man’s life; 26 and similarity of practices (“if a sick 
man dreams that he is marrying a maiden, it portends his 
death, for the same things that happen to a bridegroom hap¬ 
pen to a dead man”). 27 

There is also an analogy of value. And this is an essential 
point in that oneirocriticism has the function of determining 
whether the events that will take place are favorable or not. The 
whole domain of the dream’s signified is marked, in Ar- 
temidorus’ text, by the binary division between the good and 
the bad, the auspicious and the inauspicious, the fortunate and 
the unfortunate. The question then is this: How does the action 
that is represented in a dream make use of its own value to 
announce the event that will take place? The general principle 
is simple. A dream bears a favorable forecast if the action it 
represents is itself good. But how is this value to be measured? 
Artemidorus suggests six criteria. Is the represented action in 
conformity with nature? Is it in conformity with law? Is it in 
conformity with custom? Is it in conformity with the techne — 
that is, with the rules and practices that allow an action to 
achieve its ends? Is it in conformity with time (i.e., is it carried 
out at the right time and in the right circumstances)? Lastly, 
what of its name (does it have a name that is itself auspicious)? 
“It is a basic principle that everything that appears in accord¬ 
ance with nature, law, custom, craft, names, or time is good, 
but everything that is contrary to them is bad and inauspi¬ 
cious.” 28 Artemidorus goes on to say, however, that this princi¬ 
ple is not universal and that it involves exceptions. There can be 
a kind of reversal of values. Certain dreams that are “good in 
regard to their interior” may be “bad in regard to their exte¬ 
rior”: the action imagined in the dream is favorable (thus, to 
dream that one has dinner with a god is in itself positive), but 



16 


The Care of the Self 


the event prefigured is negative (for if the god is Cronos, bound 
in chains by his sons, the image signifies that one will go to 
prison). 29 Inversely, other dreams are “bad in regard to their 
interior” and “good in regard to their exterior”: a slave dreams 
that he is fighting in a war; this is a presage of his emancipation, 
for a soldier cannot be a slave. There is a considerable margin of 
variation, therefore, around the positive or negative signs and 
signifieds. What is involved is not an uncertainty that cannot be 
overcome, but a complex domain which demands that one take 
account of every aspect of the image in the dream and the 
circumstances of the dreamer. 

Before proceeding to the analysis of sexual dreams as it was 
practiced by Artemidorus, this rather long detour was neces¬ 
sary in order to understand the mechanics of the interpreta¬ 
tions and to determine how the moral valuations of sexual acts 
emerge in the divination of the dreams that represent them. 
It would be unwise in fact to use this text as a direct commen¬ 
tary on the value and legitimacy of sexual acts. Artemidorus 
does not say whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, 
to commit a particular act, but whether it is good or bad, 
favorable or ominous, to dream that one commits it. The 
principles that can be isolated do not therefore relate to the 
acts themselves but to their author, or rather to the sexual 
actor insofar as he represents, in the oneiric scene, the author 
of the dream and so enacts a presage of the good or evil that 
will befall him. The two main principles of oneirocriticism— 
namely, that the dream “tells what is real” and that it does so 
in the form of analogy—function here in the following way: 
the dream tells the event, the good fortune or misfortune, the 
prosperity or sorrow, that will characterize the subject’s mode 
of being in reality, and it tells it through a relationship of 
analogy with the mode of being—good or bad, favorable or 
unfavorable—of the subject as an actor on the sexual stage of 
the dream. One must not look in this text for a code specifying 
what should and should not be done; what it reveals instead 
is an ethics of the subject, one that was still common in the 
time of Artemidorus.

The Analysis 


Artemidorus devotes four chapters to sexual dreams—not 
counting the many scattered notations. 1 He organizes his anal¬ 
ysis around the distinction between three types of acts: those 
in conformity with the law (kata nomon), those contrary to 
the law (para nomon), and those contrary to nature (para 
physin). This division is far from being clear: none of these 
terms is defined. One does not see how the categories intercon¬ 
nect, or whether the category of “contrary to nature” should 
be understood as a subdivision of acts “contrary to the law.” 
Certain acts appear under two headings at once. We should 
not assume a rigorous classification that would assign every 
possible sexual act to the domain of the lawful, the unlawful, 
or the unnatural. Nevertheless, considered in detail, these 
groupings do have a certain intelligibility. 

1. Let us consider first the acts that are “in conformity 
with the law.” In retrospect, this chapter appears to mix to¬ 
gether things that are quite different: adultery and marriage, 
frequenting of prostitutes, resorting to household slaves, a 
servant’s masturbation. But in fact—leaving aside for now 
the meaning that should be given to this notion of conform¬ 
ity with the law—a passage from the chapter makes the pro¬ 
gression of the analysis rather clear. Artemidorus states as a 
general rule that women in dreams are “symbols of things 
that will happen to the dreamer, so that the character and 

17 



18 


The Care of the Self 


disposition of the woman determine what will happen to 
him.” 2 It needs to be understood, then, that for Artemidorus 
what determines the predictive meaning of a dream, and 
hence in a certain way the moral value of the act dreamed 
of, is the condition of the partner, and not the form of the 
act itself. Condition should be taken here in the broad sense: 
it is the social status of the “other”; it is the fact that he is 
married or not, is free or a slave, that he is young or old, 
rich or poor; it is his profession, it is the place where one 
meets him; it is the position he holds in relation to the 
dreamer (spouse, mistress, slave, young protege, etc.). One is 
thus able to see, beneath its apparent confusion, how the text 
unfolds: it follows the order of possible partners, according 
to their status, their connection to the dreamer, and the 
place where the dreamer encounters them. 

The first three figures evoked by the text reproduce the 
traditional series of the three categories of women to which 
one can have access: the wife, the mistress, and the prostitute. 
To dream of sexual intercourse with one’s own wife is a favor¬ 
able sign, because the wife is in a relationship of natural anal¬ 
ogy to the dreamer’s craft or profession. As with the latter, one 
engages with her in a recognized and legitimate activity; one 
benefits from her as from a prosperous occupation; the plea¬ 
sure that one derives from intercourse with her foretells the 
pleasure one will derive from the profits of one’s trade. There 
is no difference in this regard between the wife and the mis¬ 
tress. The case of prostitutes is different. Here the analysis set 
forth by Artemidorus is rather curious: in themselves women, 
as objects from which one derives pleasure, have a positive 
value; and prostitutes—whom the traditional vocabulary 
sometimes calls “workers”—are there to furnish these pleas¬ 
ures, and they “give themselves without refusing anything.” 
There is, however, “a little disgrace” in frequenting such 
women—disgrace and also expense—which no doubt detracts 
a little from the value of the event forecast by the dream that 
represents them. But more than anything else, it is the place 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


19 


of prostitution that introduces a negative value—for two rea¬ 
sons, one of which is linguistic in nature. If the brothel is 
designated by a word signifying shop or workshop (ergaste- 
rion), which has favorable implications, it is also called, like 
a cemetery, “a place for everyone,” “a common place.” The 
other reason touches on a point that is also frequently cited 
in the sexual ethics of the philosophers and physicians: the 
useless discharge of sperm, its waste, without the benefit of the 
offspring the woman can provide. Two reasons why going to 
prostitutes can, in a dream, portend death. 

To the conventional triad of wife, mistress, prostitute, Ar- 
temidorus adds the unknown women one encounters. In this 
case the dream’s value for the future depends on the social 
“value” of the woman it represents: Is she rich, well dressed, 
well provided with jewelry, and does she give herself willingly? 
If so, then the dream promises something beneficial. If she is 
old, ugly, poor, if she does not freely consent, the dream is 
inauspicious. 

The household provides another category of sexual part¬ 
ners: servants and slaves. Here one is in the domain of direct 
possession. It is not by analogy that slaves signify wealth; they 
are an integral part of it. It stands to reason, then, that the 
pleasure one enjoys in a dream with this type of personage 
indicates that one will “derive pleasure from one’s possessions, 
which will grow greater and more valuable.” One exercises a 
right; one reaps benefits from one’s property. Consequently, 
these are favorable dreams, which realize a status and a legiti¬ 
macy. The sex of the partner makes little difference of course; 
girl or boy, what matters is that one is dealing with a slave. 
On the other hand, Artemidorus does bring out an important 
distinction concerning the position of the dreamer in the sex¬ 
ual act. Is he active or passive? To place oneself “beneath” 
one’s servant in a dream, thus overturning the social hierar¬ 
chy, is ominous; it is a sign that one will suffer harm from this 
inferior or incur his contempt. And, confirming that it is 
indeed a question here, not of an offense against nature, but 



20 


The Care of the Self 


of an attack on social hierarchies and a threat against the 
proper ratio of forces, Artemidorus notes the similarly nega¬ 
tive value of dreams in which the dreamer is possessed by an 
enemy, or by his own brother, whether older or younger (the 
equality is broken). 

Next comes the group comprising friends and acquaint¬ 
ances. It is auspicious to dream that one has sexual intercourse 
with a woman whom one knows if she is not married and if 
she is rich, because a woman who offers herself gives not only 
her body but also things “pertaining to the body,” the things 
that she carries with her (clothes, jewelry, and generally 
speaking all the material goods she possesses). The dream is 
inauspicious, on the other hand, if she is a married woman, for 
she is under the authority of her husband. The law bars access 
to her and punishes adulterers, and the dreamer in this case 
must expect future punishment of the same type. And what 
if one dreams of having sex with a man? If the dreamer is a 
woman (this is one of the rare passages in the text where 
women’s dreams are taken into account), the dream is favor¬ 
able in every case, for it accords with the natural and social 
roles of women. If, however, it is a man who dreams of being 
possessed by another man, the distinguishing factor that ena¬ 
bles one to decide whether the dream has a positive or a 
negative value is the relative status of the two partners: the 
dream is good if one is possessed by a man older and richer 
than oneself (it is a promise of gifts); it is bad if the active 
partner is younger and poorer, or just poorer: clearly a sign 
of future expenditures. 

A last set of dreams in conformity with the law relates to 
masturbation. These dreams are very closely associated with 
the theme of slavery, because what is involved is a service that 
one renders oneself (hands are like servants who do the bid¬ 
ding of their master, the penis) and because the word that 
means “to bind to a post,” used in connection with the whip¬ 
ping of slaves, also means “to have an erection.” A slave who 
had dreamed he had masturbated his owner was in real life 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


21 


sentenced by him to a whipping. One sees the wide range of 
things that are “in conformity with the law.” The category 
encompasses marital acts and sexual relations with a mistress 
as well as intercourse, active or passive, with another man, and 
masturbation. 

2. The domain that Artemidorus regards as “contrary to 
the law” is, however, largely constituted by incest. 3 More¬ 
over, incest is understood in the very strict sense of sexual 
relations between parents and children. As for incest with 
brothers and sisters, it is assimilated into the category of 
father-daughter intercourse if it occurs between a brother 
and his sister. Between brothers, however, Artemidorus 
can’t seem to decide whether to place it in the category of 
kata nomon or in that of para nomon. In any case, he speaks 
of it under both rubrics. 

When a father dreams that he has sex with his daughter 
or his son, the signification is almost always unfavorable. 
This may be for immediate physical reasons: if the child is 
very young, the physical injury resulting from such an act is 
a sign pointing to his or her death (if the child is less than 
five years old) or sickness (if more than five years old but 
less than ten). If the child is older, the dream is still bad, 
because it brings into play impossible or disastrous relations. 
To take sexual pleasure in one’s own son, to “spend” one’s 
semen inside him, is a useless act, a wasteful expenditure by 
which nothing can be gained, and which therefore portends 
a considerable loss of money. To have intercourse with him 
when he is fully grown, seeing that a father and a son cannot 
coexist without conflict in a household where both wish to 
exercise authority, is necessarily a bad omen. This kind of 
dream is good in a single case: when the father undertakes a 
journey with his son and so has a joint project to carry out 
with him. But if, in dreams like this, the father is in a passive 
position (whether the dreamer is the son or the father), the 
indications are ominous: the order of hierarchies, the poles 



22 


The Care of the Self 


of domination and activity, are overturned. The sexual “pos¬ 
session” of the father by the son augurs hostility and con¬ 
flict.* To dream that one has sexual relations with one’s own 
daughter is not much better for the father. Either this “ex¬ 
penditure” in the body of a girl who one day will marry, and 
thus convey the father’s seed to another man, portends a 
substantial loss of money; or this intercourse, if the girl is 
already married, indicates that she will leave her husband, 
that she will return home, and that it will be necessary to 
provide for her. The dream is auspicious only in the case 
where, the father being poor, the daughter may return 
wealthy and therefore capable of providing for her father. 5 

In a way that may seem strange to us, incest with one’s 
mother (always envisaged by Artemidorus as incest of mother 
with son and never of mother with daughter) is often a bearer 
of favorable omens. Should one conclude, based on the Ar- 
temidorean principle of a correlation between predictive value 
and moral value, that mother-son incest is not fundamentally 
reprehensible? Or should one see this as one of the exceptions, 
provided for by Artemidorus, to the general principle that he 
puts forward? There is no question that Artemidorus consid¬ 
ers mother-son incest to be morally wrong. But it is note¬ 
worthy that he assigns it a predictive value that is often 
favorable, making the mother into a kind of model and matrix, 
as it were, of a large number of social relations and forms of 
activity. The mother is a man’s trade; to have intercourse with 
her thus signifies success and prosperity in one’s profession. 
The mother is one’s native land; whoever dreams of sexual 
relations with her can look forward to returning home if he 
is in exile, or he can expect success in political life. The mother 
is also the fertile ground from which one came: if a man is 
involved in a lawsuit when he has an incest dream, this means 


‘Note, however, that in an interpretation given in Book IV, to penetrate one’s son 
with a feeling of pleasure is a sign that he will live; to do so with a feeling of 
suffering is a sign that he will die. Artemidorus remarks that in this case it is the 
specific character of the pleasure that determines the meaning.* 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


23 


that he will win possession of the disputed property; if he is 
a farmer, he will have a rich harvest. But a dream of this sort 
represents a danger for sick men: to penetrate into this Mother 
Earth means that one will die. 

3. Acts “contrary to nature” occasion two successive de¬ 
velopments in Artemidorus. The first concerns deviations 
from the position set by nature (and this development is ap¬ 
pended to the interpretation of incest dreams). The second 
concerns relations in which it is the partner who by his own 
“nature” defines the unnatural character of the act. 6 

Artemidorus submits as a principle that nature has estab¬ 
lished a definite form of sexual act for each species, one and 
only one natural position from which animals do not deviate: 
“For example, some animals mount from behind, such as the 
horse, ass, goat, bull, stag, and the other four-footed animals. 
Others join their mouths first, such as the adder, the dove, and 
the weasel. . . . Others have no contact at all, but the females 
gather up the sperm that has been squeezed out by the males, 
as, for example, fish.” Similarly, humans have received a very 
specific mode of union from nature: the face-to-face position, 
with the man extended full length on top of the woman. In this 
form, sexual intercourse is an act of complete possession. Pro¬ 
vided that she “obeys” and is “willing,” the man is master “of 
the whole body of his mate.” All the other positions “have 
been discovered by yielding to wantonness and licentious¬ 
ness.” These unnatural relations always contain a portent of 
defective social relations (bad relationships, hostility) or a 
prediction of a worsening of one’s economic situation (one is 
uncomfortable, financially “embarrassed”). 

Among these “variants” of the sexual act, Artemidorus 
gives special attention to oral eroticism. His disapproval— 
and here he expresses an attitude frequently attested in an¬ 
tiquity 7 —is vehement: an “awful act,” a “moral wrong” 
whose representation in a dream can take on a positive value 
only if it refers to the professional activity of the dreamer (if 



24 


The Care of the Self 


he is a public speaker, flute player, or professor of rhetoric). 
Being a wasteful discharge of semen, this practice in a dream 
foretells a useless expenditure. As a custom not in harmony 
with nature, and one which makes it no longer possible to 
kiss or to share a meal, it portends a rift, enmity, and some¬ 
times death. 

But there are other ways to deviate from nature in sexual 
relations, by the very nature of one’s partners. Artemidorus 
lists five possibilities: relations with gods, with animals, or 
with corpses; relations with oneself; and relations between 
women. The presence of these last two categories among the 
acts defying nature is more enigmatic than that of the others. 
Sexual intercourse with oneself is not to be understood as 
masturbation; the latter is mentioned among the acts that are 
“in conformity with the law.’’ What is meant here by unnatu¬ 
ral relations with oneself is penetration of the penis into one’s 
own body, or kissing one’s own sex organ, or taking the sex 
organ into one’s mouth. The first type of dream foretells pov¬ 
erty, indigence, and suffering; the second promises the birth 
of children, if one does not yet have any, or their return, if they 
are absent; the last signifies that the children will die, that one 
will be deprived of women and mistresses (for one does not 
need women when one can gratify oneself), or that one will 
be reduced to extreme poverty. 

As for sexual relations between women, one might wonder 
why they appear in the category of “unnatural” acts, whereas 
relations between men are distributed under other rubrics 
(and essentially under that of acts in conformity with the law). 
The reason for this is no doubt in the form of intercourse 
Artemidorus has in mind, which is penetration. By some artifi¬ 
cial means or other, a woman contrives to usurp the role of 
the man, wrongfully takes his position, and possesses another 
woman. Between two men, penetration, the manly act par 
excellence, is not a transgression of nature (even if it can be 
considered as shameful or unseemly for one of the two to 
undergo it). By contrast, between two women a similar act, 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


25 


which is performed in defiance of what they both are and by 
resorting to subterfuge, is every bit as unnatural as human 
intercourse with a god or an animal. To dream of these acts 
signifies that the woman will engage in futile activities, that 
she will be separated from her husband, or that she will be¬ 
come a widow. Intercourse between two women can also sig¬ 
nify the communication or knowledge of feminine “secrets.”

Dream and Act 


Two traits should be noted because they mark the entire 
analysis of the sexual dream in Artemidorus. First, the 
dreamer is always present in his own dream. The sexual im¬ 
ages that Artemidorus deciphers never constitute a pure and 
simple phantasmagoria of which the dreamer would be the 
spectator and which would unfold before his eyes indepen¬ 
dently of him. He always takes part, and he does so as the 
leading actor. What he sees is himself in his sexual activity: 
there is an exact correspondence between the subject dream¬ 
ing of an act and the subject of the act as it is seen in the 
dream. Second, we may remark that in terms of his work as 
a whole, Artemidorus seldom treats sexual acts and plea¬ 
sures as signified or presaged elements; it is relatively excep¬ 
tional for an image given in a dream to forecast a sexual act 
or a deprivation of pleasure. 1 On the other hand, these acts 
and pleasures are grouped together, in the three chapters 
studied here, as components of the dream and as predictive 
elements. Artemidorus almost always has them figure on the 
side of the “signifiers,” and almost never on the side of the 
“signified.” They are images and not meanings, representa¬ 
tion and not represented event. Artemidorus’ interpretation 
will therefore place itself on a line traced between the actor 
of the sexual act and the dreamer of the dream, going in this 
way from subject to subject; and, starting from the sexual act 
and the role of the subject as he represents himself in his 

26 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


27 


dream, the work of interpretation will have as its object to 
decipher what is going to happen to the dreamer once he has 
returned to waking life. 

It is apparent at a glance that Artemidorus’ interpretation 
quite regularly discovers a social signification in sexual 
dreams. True, it sometimes happens that these dreams fore¬ 
cast an abrupt change in the state of one’s health—an illness 
or a recovery—and it happens, too, that they are signs of 
death. But in a much greater proportion, they refer to such 
events as success or failure in business, enrichment or im¬ 
poverishment, a family’s prosperity or reverse of fortune, an 
advantageous or disadvantageous undertaking, favorable mar¬ 
riages or ill-fated alliances, disputes, rivalries, reconciliations, 
good or bad luck in a public career, exile, condemnation. 
Sexual dreams foretell the dreamer’s destiny in social life; the 
actor that he is on the sexual stage of the dream anticipates 
the role that he will play in the theater of family life, profes¬ 
sional endeavor, and civic affairs. 

There are, to begin with, two reasons for this. One is entirely 
general in nature; it concerns a feature of language Ar¬ 
temidorus puts to frequent use. There exists in Greek—and in 
many other languages as well, to varying degrees—a very 
pronounced ambiguity between the sexual meaning and the 
economic meaning of certain terms. Thus, the word soma, 
which designates the body, also refers to riches and posses¬ 
sions; whence the possible equivalence between the “posses¬ 
sion” of a body and the possession of wealth. 2 Ousia is 
substance and fortune; it is also semen and sperm: the loss of 
the latter may mean expenditure of the former. 3 The term 
blabe, “damage,” may refer to economic setbacks, losses of 
money, but also to the fact that one is the victim of an act of 
violence and that one is a passive object in a sexual act. 4 * 
Artemidorus also plays on the polysemy of the vocabulary of 

‘See also Book IV, where it is said that to dream that one becomes a bridge signifies 
that one will be a prostitute: “If a woman or a handsome youth dream they turn into 
a bridge, they will become prostitutes and allow many to go over them.” \ rich man 
who had this same dream found himself in a situation in which he was “regarded 
contemptuously and was, in a certain sense, trampled under foot.”* 



28 


The Care of the Self 


debt: words signifying that one is bound to pay and one seeks 
to get free of the debt may also mean that one is pressed by 
a sexual need and that by satisfying it one is free of it. The 
word anagkaion, which is employed to designate the male 
organ, is at the intersection of these significations. 6 

Another reason has to do with the particular form and 
intended purpose of Artemidorus’ work: a man’s book that is 
addressed mainly to men in order to help them lead their lives 
as men. One must remember in fact that the interpretation of 
dreams is not regarded as a matter of pure and simple curios¬ 
ity; it is an activity that is useful for managing one’s existence 
and for preparing oneself for events that are going to occur. 
Since the nights tell the things of which the days will be made, 
it is good—if one is properly to live out his existence as a man, 
a master of a household, a father of a family—to be able to 
decipher the dreams that arise in one’s life. This is the perspec¬ 
tive of Artemidorus’ books: they are a guide that will aid the 
responsible man, the master of his house, to conduct himself 
in daily life according to the signs that may prefigure that life. 
Hence it is the fabric of this familial, economic, and social life 
that he strives to rediscover in the images of dreams. 

But that is not all: the interpretive practice at work in 
Artemidorus’ discourse shows that the sexual dream itself is 
perceived, formalized, analyzed as a social scene. If it foretells 
“good things and bad” in the domain of occupation, patri¬ 
mony, family, political career, status, friendships, and patron¬ 
age, this is because the sexual acts that the dream depicts are 
made up of the same elements as that domain. By following 
the analytic procedures Artemidorus uses, one sees clearly 
that the interpretation of aphrodisia dreams in terms of suc¬ 
cess or failure, social good fortune or misfortune, presupposes 
a sort of consubstantiality between the two domains. This is 
apparent on two levels: that of the elements of the dream that 
are taken up as materials for the analysis and that of the 
principles that make it possible to attribute a meaning (a 
predictive “value”) to those elements. 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


29 


1. What elements does Artemidorus single out for his 
analysis? 

The personages first of all. Concerning the dreamer himself, 
Artemidorus takes no account of his recent or distant past, for 
example, or of his state of mind, or generally of his passions 
either. What interests Artemidorus are the dreamer’s social 
attributes: the age group to which he belongs, whether or not 
he engages in business, whether he has political responsibili¬ 
ties, whether he is trying to get his children married, whether 
he is threatened by ruin or by the hostility of those close to 
him, and so forth. It is also as “personages” that the partners 
represented are considered. The oneiric world of Ar- 
temidorus’ dreamer is peopled by individuals who have few 
physical traits and who do not appear to have many affective 
or erotic ties to the dreamer himself. They figure as little more 
than social profiles: young people, old people (at any rate they 
are younger or older than the dreamer), rich people, or poor 
people; they are individuals who bring riches or ask for pres¬ 
ents; they are relatives who flatter or humiliate; they are su¬ 
periors to whom one had best yield or inferiors by whom one 
can rightfully profit; they are people from the household or 
from the outside; they are free men, women under a husband’s 
control, slaves, or professional prostitutes. 

As for what transpires between these personages and the 
dreamer, Artemidorus’ restraint is nothing short of remark¬ 
able. No caresses, no complicated combinations, no phantas¬ 
magoria; just a few simple variations around one basic form 
—penetration. It is the latter that seems to constitute the very 
essence of sexual practice, the only form, in any case, that 
deserves attention and yields meaning in the analysis of 
dreams. Much more than the body itself, with its different 
parts, much more than pleasure, with its qualities and intensi¬ 
ties, the act of penetration appears as a qualifier of sexual acts, 
with its few variants of position and especially its two poles 
of activity and passivity. What Artemidorus wants to know, 
the question that he asks constantly concerning the dreams he 



30 


The Care of the Self 


studies, is who penetrates whom. Is the dreaming subject 
(nearly always a man) active or passive? Is he the one who 
penetrates, dominates, enjoys? Is he the one who submits or 
is possessed? Whether it is a matter of relations with a son or 
with a father, with a mother or with a slave, the question 
comes back almost without fail (unless it is already implicitly 
answered): How did the penetration take place? Or more ex¬ 
actly: What was the position of the subject in regard to this 
penetration? All sexual dreams, even “lesbian” ones, are ex¬ 
amined from this viewpoint and from this viewpoint alone. 

Now, this act of penetration—the core of sexual activity, 
the raw material of interpretation, and the source of meaning 
for the dream—is directly perceived within a social scenogra- 
phy. Artemidorus sees the sexual act first and foremost as a 
game of superiority and inferiority: penetration places the two 
partners in a relationship of domination and submission. It is 
victory on one side, defeat on the other; it is a right that is 
exercised for one of the partners, a necessity that is imposed 
on the other. It is a status that one asserts, or a condition to 
which one is subjected. It is an advantage from which one 
benefits, or an acceptance of a situation from which others are 
allowed to benefit. Which brings us to the other aspect of the 
sexual act. Artemidorus also sees it as an “economic” game 
of expenditure and profit: profit, the pleasure that one takes, 
the agreeable sensations that one experiences; expenditure, the 
energy necessary for the act, the loss of semen—that precious 
vital substance—and the fatigue that ensues. Much more than 
all the variables that might come from the different possible 
actions, or the different sensations accompanying them, and 
much more than all the possible scenes that the dream might 
present, it is these elements relating to penetration as a “strate¬ 
gic” game of expenditure and benefit that are taken up by 
Artemidorus and used to develop his analysis. 

These elements may well appear, from our vantage point, 
meager, schematic, sexually “colorless”; but it should be 
noted that they saturate the analysis from the start with so¬ 
cially marked elements. Artemidorus’ analysis brings in per- 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


31 


sonages that have been lifted fresh from a social scene, all of 
whose characteristics they still display; and it distributes them 
around an essential act that is located at one and the same time 
on the plane of physical conjunctions, on that of social rela¬ 
tions of superiority and inferiority, and on that of economic 
activities of expenditure and profit. 

2. How—on the basis of these elements, taken up in this 
fashion and made pertinent for the analysis—will Arte- 
midorus establish the “value” of the sexual dream? And what 
is meant by this is not only the type of event that is forecast 
allegorically, but above all—the crucial aspect for practical 
analysis—its “quality,” that is, its auspicious or inauspicious 
character for the dreamer. Recall that one of the fundamental 
principles of the method is that the predictive quality of a 
dream (the favorable or unfavorable character of the event 
foretold) depends on the value of the foretelling image (the 
good or bad character of the act represented in a dream). Now, 
by following the analysis through a series of examples, we 
have been able to see that a sexual act with a “positive value” 
from Artemidorus’ point of view is not always and not exactly 
a sexual act that is permitted by law, honored by opinion, and 
accepted by custom. There are major coincidences, of course: 
to dream that one has intercourse with one’s own spouse or 
mistress is good. But there are divergences, and important 
ones: the favorable value of a dream of incest with one’s 
mother is the most striking example of these. We need then 
to ask: What is this other way of qualifying sexual acts? What 
are these other criteria that enable one to say that the acts are 
“good” in a dream and for the dreamer, whereas they would 
be culpable in reality? It seems in fact that what constitutes 
the “value” of a dreamed-of sexual act is the relationship that 
is established between the sexual role and the social role of the 
dreamer. More precisely, we can say that Artemidorus finds 
“favorable” and propitious a dream in which the dreamer 
pursues his sexual activity with his partner according to a 
schema that conforms to what his relationship with the same 



32 


The Care of the Self 


partner should be in social, not sexual, life. It is this adjust¬ 
ment to the “waking” social relation that qualifies the oneiric 
sexual relation. 

In order to be “good,” the sexual act that one dreams needs 
to obey a general rule of “isomorphism.” And, speaking 
schematically still, one may add that this rule takes two forms: 
“analogy of position” and “economic adequation.” According 
to the first of these principles, a sexual act will be good to the 
extent that the subject who dreams occupies in his sexual 
activity with his partner a position that matches the one he 
occupies in real life with this same partner (or a partner of the 
same type). Thus, to be “active” with one’s slave (whatever 
the sex of the latter), or to be active with a prostitute (male 
or female), or to be active with a boy who is young and poor, 
is good; but it will be “good” to be passive with an individual 
older than oneself, richer than oneself, and so on. It is by 
virtue of this rule of isomorphism that the dream of incest with 
one’s mother is laden with so many positive values. In such 
dreams the subject is indeed seen in a position of activity with 
respect to a mother who gave birth to and nurtured him, and 
whom he ought to cultivate, honor, serve, maintain, and en¬ 
rich in return, like a piece of land, a native country, a city. But 
for the sexual act in a dream to have a positive value, it must 
also obey a principle of “economic adequation.” The “cost” 
and the “benefit” this activity entails must be properly regu¬ 
lated: in quantity (much expense for little pleasure is not good) 
and in direction as well (not to spend uselessly on those in¬ 
dividuals, male or female, who are not in a position to repay, 
offer compensation, or be useful in return). It is this principle 
that makes it good to dream of sexual intercourse with slaves: 
one profits from one’s possessions; that which one has pur¬ 
chased for the benefit of labor yields the benefit of pleasure 
besides. It is also what gives multiple significations to dreams 
in which a father has intercourse with his daughter. Depend¬ 
ing on whether she is married or not, whether the father 
himself is a widower or not, whether the son-in-law is richer 
or poorer than the father-in-law, the dream will signify either 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures

an expenditure for the dowry, or help coming from the daugh¬ 
ter, or an obligation to provide for her after her divorce. 

We can summarize all this by saying that the guiding thread 
of Artemidorus’ interpretation, insofar as it is concerned with 
the predictive value of sexual dreams, implies the breaking 
down and ordering of such dreams into elements (personages 
or acts) that are, by nature, social elements; and that it indi¬ 
cates a certain way of qualifying sexual acts in terms of the 
manner in which the dreaming subject maintains, as the sub¬ 
ject of the dreamed-of act, his position as a social subject. In 
the dream scene, the sexual actor (who is always the dreamer 
and is almost always an adult male) must, if his dream is to 
be good, maintain his role as a social actor (even if the act 
happens to be reprehensible in reality). Let us not forget that 
all the sexual dreams that Artemidorus analyzes are consid¬ 
ered by him to belong to the category of oneiros: hence they 
tell “what will be”; and it so happens in this case that what 
“will be,” and what is “told” in the dream, is the position of 
the dreamer as a subject of activity—active or passive, domi¬ 
nant or dominated, winner or loser, “on top” or “on the 
bottom,” profit-taker or spender, deriving benefits or ex¬ 
periencing losses, finding himself in an advantageous position 
or suffering damages. The sexual dream uses the little drama 
of penetration and passivity, pleasure and expenditure, to tell 
the subject’s mode of being, as destiny has arranged it. 

By way of confirmation, one might refer to a passage from 
The Interpretation of Dreams which shows unmistakably the 
connection between that which constitutes the individual as 
an active subject in the sexual relation and that which situates 
him in the field of social activities. I am thinking of the text, 
in another section of the book, that is devoted to the meaning 
of the different parts of the body in dreams. The male organ 
—the one called anagkaion (the “necessary” part, whose 
needs compel us and by whose force others are compelled)— 
is expressive of a whole cluster of relations and activities that 
determine the individual’s standing in the city and in the 
world. Among these are the individual’s wealth, speech, sta- 



34 


The Care of the Self 


tus, political life, freedom, and even his name. “The penis 
corresponds to one’s parents, on the one hand, because it is 
itself the cause of children. It signifies a wife or mistress, since 
it is made for sexual intercourse. It indicates brothers and all 
blood relatives, since the interrelationship of the entire house 
depends upon the penis. It is a symbol of strength and physical 
vigor, because it is itself the cause of these qualities. That is 
why some people call the penis ‘one’s manhood.’ It corre¬ 
sponds to speech and education because the penis is very 
fertile . . . the penis is also a sign of wealth and possessions 
because it alternately expands and contracts and because it is 
able to produce and to eliminate. ... It indicates poverty, 
servitude, and bonds, because it is also called ‘constraining’ 
and is a symbol of necessity. It also indicates the respect that 
is inspired by high rank: for it is called ‘reverence’ and respect. 
... If the penis is doubled, it signifies that everything will be 
doubled, with the exception of a wife or a mistress; these will 
be lost. For it is impossible to use two penises at the same time. 
I know of a slave who dreamt that he had three penises. He 
was set free and, in place of one name, he had three, since he 
received in addition the two names of the master who had 
freed him. But this happened only once. One must not base 
one’s interpretation on rare instances but rather on the more 
normal cases.” 7 

The penis thus appears at the intersection of all these games 
of mastery: self-mastery, since its demands are likely to en¬ 
slave us if we allow ourselves to be coerced by it; superiority 
over sexual partners, since it is by means of the penis that the 
penetration is carried out; status and privileges, since it sig¬ 
nifies the whole field of kinship and social activity. 

The landscape evoked in the chapters in Artemidorus that 
deal with sexual dreams was a familiar one in antiquity. It is 
easy to rediscover there aspects of manners and customs that 
could be confirmed by many other—earlier or contemporane¬ 
ous—testimonies. One is in a world very strongly marked by 
the central position of the male personage and by the impor- 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures 


35 


tance accorded to the masculine role in sexual relationships. 
It is a world in which marriage is valued highly enough to be 
regarded as the best possible framework for sexual pleasures. 
In this world the married man can also have his mistress, avail 
himself of his servants (boys or girls), and frequent prostitutes. 
In this world, finally, sexual relations between men appear to 
be taken for granted—that is, provided that certain differences 
of age and status are respected. 

We may also note the presence of several elements of a code. 
But it must be admitted that they are both few in number and 
rather nebulous—a few major prohibitions that are manifested 
in the form of intense repulsions: fellatio, sexual relations 
between women, and, above all, the usurping of the male role 
by a woman; a very restrictive definition of incest, conceived 
of essentially as intercourse between parents and children; and 
a reference to a standard, natural form of sexual act. But there 
is nothing in Artemidorus’ text that refers to a permanent and 
complete grid of classifications among permitted and prohib¬ 
ited acts; nothing that draws a clear and definitive line of 
division between what is natural and what is “contrary to 
nature.” Moreover, it seems that these code elements are not 
—at least not in dreams having a predictive function—what 
plays the most important and decisive role in determining the 
“quality” of a sexual act. 

On the other hand, one does perceive, in the very way the 
interpretation proceeds, a different way of thinking about sex¬ 
ual acts and different principles for evaluating them: not with 
a view to the act and its regular or irregular form, but with 
a view to the actor, his way of being, his particular situation, 
his relation to others, and the position he occupies with re¬ 
spect to them. The main question appears to bear much less 
on the acts’ conformity with a natural structure or with a 
positive regulation, than on what might be called the subject’s 
“style of activity” and on the relation he establishes between 
sexual activity and the other aspects of his familial, social, and 
economic existence. The movement of analysis and the proce¬ 
dures of valuation do not go from the act to a domain such 



36 


The Care of the Self 


as sexuality or the flesh, a domain whose divine, civil, or 
natural laws would delineate the permitted forms; they go 
from the subject as a sexual actor to the other areas of life in 
which he pursues his activity. And it is in the relationship 
between these different forms of activity that the principles of 
evaluation of a sexual behavior are essentially, but not exclu¬ 
sively, situated. 

Here one easily recognizes the principal characteristics of 
the ethical experience of the aphrodisia in the form in which 
it had appeared in the texts of the classical age. And, precisely 
insofar as it does not formulate an ethic, but uses for dream 
interpretation a way of perceiving and judging sexual pleasure 
that is contemporaneous with it, Artemidorus’ book testifies 
to the endurance and solidity of that form of experience. 

If we turn, however, to texts whose object is to reflect on 
the sexual practices themselves and to give advice on behavior 
and precepts for living, with reference to them, we can note 
a certain number of modifications in comparison with the 
doctrines of austerity formulated in the philosophy of the 
fourth century. Breaks, radical changes, emergence of a new 
form of experience of pleasure? No, this was clearly not the 
case. And yet there are noticeable inflections: a closer atten¬ 
tion, an increased anxiety concerning sexual conduct, a 
greater importance accorded to marriage and its demands, 
and less value given to the love of boys: in short, a more 
rigorous style. But in these themes that develop, become ac¬ 
centuated, and gather strength, one can discern a different 
type of modification: it concerns the way in which ethical 
thought defines the relation of the subject to his sexual ac¬ 
tivity. 



PART TWO 

The Cultivation 
of the Self 




A mistrust of the pleasures, an emphasis on the conse¬ 
quences of their abuse for the body and the soul, a valorization 
of marriage and marital obligations, a disaffection with regard 
to the spiritual meanings imputed to the love of boys: a whole 
attitude of severity was manifested in the thinking of philoso¬ 
phers and physicians in the course of the first two centuries. 
It is visible in the texts of Soranus and Rufus of Ephesus, in 
Musonius or Seneca, in Plutarch as well as in Epictetus or 
Marcus Aurelius. Moreover, it is a fact that the Christian 
authors borrowed extensively—with and without acknowl¬ 
edgment—from this body of ethical thought. And most his¬ 
torians today recognize the existence, strength, and 
intensification of these themes of sexual austerity in a society 
known by its contemporaries, and, more often than not, re¬ 
proached, for its immorality and dissolute ways. Let us leave 
aside the question of knowing whether this blame was jus¬ 
tified. Considering only those texts that talk about the “ques¬ 
tion of pleasure,” and considering the place they give to it, it 
seems in fact that it had become more insistent. More pre¬ 
cisely, there was greater apprehension concerning the sexual 
pleasures, more attention given to the relation that one might 
have with them. In a word, there was a more intense prob- 
lematization of the aphrodisia, a problematization whose par¬ 
ticular forms and motifs we must try to reconstruct. 

One can appeal to various explanations in order to account 

39 



40 


The Care of the Self 


for this new accentuation. One can relate it to certain efforts 
on the part of political power to raise moral standards in a 
more or less authoritarian way. These efforts were especially 
forceful and explicit under the principate of Augustus; and in 
that instance it is true that legislative measures protecting 
marriage, favoring the family, regulating concubinage, and 
condemning adultery were accompanied by a movement of 
ideas—perhaps not entirely artificial—that opposed the cur¬ 
rent laxity while preaching a return to the rigor of the old 
customs. We cannot be satisfied with this reference, however; 
it would doubtless be incorrect to see in these measures and 
these ideas the beginning of a centuries-long evolution that 
would lead to a regime in which sexual freedom would be 
more strictly limited by institutions and laws, whether civil or 
religious. These political strivings were in fact too sporadic; 
they had objectives that were too limited; and they had too few 
general and lasting effects to account for the tendency toward 
austerity so often evinced in moral reflection over the entire 
course of the first two centuries. Furthermore, it is remarkable 
that, with rare exceptions,* this desire for rigor expressed by 
the moralists did not take the form of a demand for interven¬ 
tion on the part of public authority. One would not find in the 
writings of the philosophers any proposal for a general and 
coercive legislation of sexual behaviors. They urge individuals 
to be more austere if they wish to lead a life different from that 
of “the throngs”; they do not try to determine which measures 
or punishments might constrain everyone in a uniform man¬ 
ner. Moreover, if we are authorized to speak of an increased 
austerity, this is not because more rigorous prohibitions were 
recommended: after all, the medical regimens of the first and 
second centuries are, generally speaking, not much more re¬ 
strictive than that of Diodes; the conjugal fidelity exalted by 
the Stoics is not more rigorous than that of Nicocles, who 
boasted of not having sexual relations with any woman other 

♦For example, Dio Chrysostom envisages certain measures that would have to be 
taken in order to make virtue prevail, but this is in the context of the problems posed 
by poverty . 1

41 


than his own wife; and Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, is 
on the whole more indulgent with regard to boys than is the 
strict legislator of the Laws. Rather, what stands out in the 
texts of the first centuries—more than new interdictions con¬ 
cerning sexual acts—is the insistence on the attention that 
should be brought to bear on oneself; it is the modality, scope, 
constancy, and exactitude of the required vigilance; it is the 
anxiety concerning all the disturbances of the body and the 
mind, which must be prevented by means of an austere regi¬ 
men; it is the importance attributed to self-respect, not just 
insofar as one’s status is concerned, but as concerns one’s 
rational nature—a self-respect that is exercised by depriving 
oneself of pleasure or by confining one’s indulgence to mar¬ 
riage or procreation. In short, and as a first approximation, 
this added emphasis on sexual austerity in moral reflection 
takes the form, not of a tightening of the code that defined 
prohibited acts, but of an intensification of the relation to 
oneself by which one constituted oneself as the subject of one’s 
acts. 2 And the motivations of this more severe ethics cannot 
be examined without taking such a form into account. 

One may think at this point of a phenomenon that is often 
alluded to: the growth, in the Hellenistic and Roman world, 
of an “individualism” that is said to have accorded more and 
more importance to the “private” aspects of existence, to the 
values of personal conduct, and to the interest that people 
focused on themselves. Thus, it was not a strengthening of 
public authority that accounted for the development of that 
rigorous ethics, but rather a weakening of the political and 
social framework within which the lives of individuals used to 
unfold. Being less firmly attached to the cities, more isolated 
from one another, and more reliant on themselves, they 
sought in philosophy rules of conduct that were more per¬ 
sonal. Not everything is false in a schema of this sort. But we 
may wonder about the reality of that individualistic upsurge 
and the social and political process that would have detached 
individuals from their traditional affiliations. Civic and politi¬ 
cal activity may have, to some degree, changed its form; it 



42 


The Care of the Self 


nonetheless remained an important part of life for the upper 
classes. Broadly speaking, the ancient societies remained soci¬ 
eties of promiscuity, where existence was led “in public.” 
They were also societies in which everyone was situated within 
strong systems of local relationships, family ties, economic 
dependences, and relations of patronage and friendship. Fur¬ 
ther, it should be noted that the doctrines that were most 
attached to austerity of conduct—and the Stoics can be placed 
at the head of the list—were also those which insisted the most 
on the need to fulfill one’s obligations to mankind, to one’s 
fellow-citizens, and to one’s family, and which were quickest 
to denounce an attitude of laxity and self-satisfaction in prac¬ 
tices of social withdrawal. 

But a more general question needs to be asked concerning 
this “individualism” that is so frequently invoked, in different 
epochs, to explain very diverse phenomena. Quite often with 
such categories, entirely different realities are lumped to¬ 
gether. Three things in fact need to be distinguished here: (1) 
the individualistic attitude, characterized by the absolute 
value attributed to the individual in his singularity and by the 
degree of independence conceded to him vis-a-vis the group to 
which he belongs and the institutions to which he is answer- 
able; (2) the positive valuation of private life, that is, the 
importance granted to family relationships, to the forms of 
domestic activity, and to the domain of patrimonial interests; 
(3) the intensity of the relations to self, that is, of the forms 
in which one is called upon to take oneself as an object of 
knowledge and a field of action, so as to transform, correct, 
and purify oneself, and find salvation. These attitudes can be 
interconnected, no doubt. Thus it can happen that individual¬ 
ism entails an intensification of the values of private life, or 
that the importance accorded to the relations to self is as¬ 
sociated with an exaltation of individual singularity. But these 
connections are neither constant nor necessary. One could 
find societies or social groups—military aristocracies are a 
probable example of these—in which the individual is invited 
to assert his self-worth by means of actions that set him apart 



The Cultivation of the Self 


43 


and enable him to win out over the others, without his having 
to attribute any great importance to his private life or to the 
relations of himself to himself. There are also societies in 
which private life is highly valued, in which it is carefully 
protected and organized, in which it forms the center of refer¬ 
ence for behaviors and one of the principles of their valuation 
—this appears to be true of the bourgeois classes in the West¬ 
ern countries of the nineteenth century. But, for this very 
reason, individualism in such societies is weak and the rela¬ 
tions of oneself to oneself are largely undeveloped. Finally, 
there are societies or groups in which the relation to self is 
intensified and developed without this resulting, as if by neces¬ 
sity, in a strengthening of the values of individualism or of 
private life. The Christian ascetic movement of the first centu¬ 
ries presented itself as an extremely strong accentuation of the 
relations of oneself to oneself, but in the form of a disqualifica¬ 
tion of the values of private life; and when it took the form of 
cenobitism, it manifested an explicit rejection of any individu¬ 
alism that might be inherent in the practice of reclusion. 

The demands of sexual austerity expressed in imperial times 
do not seem to have been the manifestation of a growing 
individualism. Their context is characterized instead by a phe¬ 
nomenon that has a rather long historical range, but reached 
its peak at that particular moment. I am referring to the 
development of what might be called a “cultivation of the 
self,” wherein the relations of oneself to oneself were inten¬ 
sified and valorized. 

This “cultivation of the self” 3 can be briefly characterized 
by the fact that in this case the art of existence—the techne tou 
biou in its different forms—is dominated by the principle that 
says one must “take care of oneself.” It is this principle of the 
care of the self that establishes its necessity, presides over its 
development, and organizes its practice. But one has to be 
precise here; the idea that one ought to attend to oneself, care 
for oneself (heautou epimeleisthai), was actually a very ancient 
theme in Greek culture. It appeared very early as a widespread 



44 


The Care of the Self 


imperative. At the end of his conquests, Xenophon’s idealized 
Cyrus still does not consider his existence to be complete. It 
remains for him—and this he values above all else—to attend 
to himself: “We cannot possibly find any fault with the gods 
that all we wished for has not been fulfilled,” he says while 
reflecting on his past victories. “However, if great success is 
to have such consequences that a man is not able to have some 
leisure for himself nor time to enjoy himself with his friends, 
I am ready to bid farewell to that sort of happiness.” 4 A 
Lacedaemonian aphorism, reported by Plutarch, 5 stated that 
the reason for which cultivation of the land was entrusted to 
the helots was that the citizens of Sparta, for their part, 
wanted “to take care of themselves”: no doubt it was physical 
and military training that was meant by the phrase. But it is 
used in a completely different sense in the Alcibiades, where 
it constitutes a basic theme of the dialogue. Socrates shows the 
ambitious young man that it is quite presumptuous of him to 
want to take charge of the city, manage its affairs, and enter 
into competition with the kings of Sparta or the rulers of 
Persia, if he has not first learned that which it is necessary to 
know in order to govern: he must first attend to himself—and 
right away, while he is young, for “at the age of fifty, it would 
be too late.” 6 And in the Apology it is clearly as a master of 
the care of the self that Socrates presents himself to his judges. 
The god has sent him to remind men that they need to concern 
themselves not with their riches, not with their honor, but 
with themselves and with their souls. 7 

Now, it was this theme of the care of oneself, consecrated 
by Socrates, that later philosophy took up again and ulti¬ 
mately placed at the center of that “art of existence” which 
philosophy claimed to be. It was this theme which, breaking 
out of its original setting and working loose from its first 
philosophical meanings, gradually acquired the dimensions 
and forms of a veritable “cultivation of the self.” What is 
meant by these remarks is that the principle of care of oneself 
became rather general in scope. The precept according to 
which one must give attention to oneself was in any case an 



The Cultivation of the Self

imperative that circulated among a number of different doc¬ 
trines. It also took the form of an attitude, a mode of behavior; 
it became instilled in ways of living; it evolved into procedures, 
practices, and formulas that people reflected on, developed, 
perfected, and taught. It thus came to constitute a social 
practice, giving rise to relationships between individuals, to 
exchanges and communications, and at times even to institu¬ 
tions. And it gave rise, finally, to a certain mode of knowledge 
and to the elaboration of a science. 

In the slow development of the art of living under the theme 
of the care of oneself, the first two centuries of the imperial 
epoch can be seen as the summit of a curve: a kind of golden 
age in the cultivation of the self—it being understood, of 
course, that this phenomenon concerned only the social 
groups, very limited in number, that were bearers of culture 
and for whose members a techne tou biou could have a mean¬ 
ing and a reality. 

1. The epimeleia heautou, the cur a sui, is an injunction 
that one rediscovers in many philosophical doctrines. One 
encounters it in the Platonists: Albinus advises that one com¬ 
mence the study of philosophy by reading the Alcibiades 
“with a view to turning and returning to oneself,” and for the 
purpose of learning “that which one should make into the 
object of his care.” 8 Apuleius, at the end of the God of Socrates, 
expresses his wonder at seeing the carelessness of his contem¬ 
poraries with regard to themselves: “All men should desire to 
live most happily, and should know that they cannot so live 
in any other way than by cultivating the soul, and yet leave 
the soul uncultivated [animum suum non colunt ]. If, however, 
anyone wishes to see acutely, it is requisite that he should pay 
attention to his eyes, through which he sees; if you desire to 
run with celerity, attention must be paid to the feet, by which 
you run. ... In a similar manner, in all the other members, 
attention to each must be paid according to one’s preferences. 
And, as all men may easily see that this is true, I cannot 
sufficiently . . . wonder, in such a way as the thing deserves 



46 


The Care of the Self 


wonder, why they do not also cultivate their soul by reason 
[cur non etiam animum suum ratione excolant ].” 9 

As for the Epicureans, the Letter to Menoeceus began by 
stating the principle that philosophy should be considered as 
a permanent exercise of the care of oneself: “Let no young 
man delay the study of philosophy, and let no young man 
become weary of it; for it is never too early or too late to care 
for the well-being of the soul .” 10 It is this Epicurean theme of 
the need to take care of oneself that Seneca takes up in one of 
his letters: “Just as fair weather, purified into the purest bril¬ 
liancy, does not admit of a still greater degree of clearness; so, 
when a man takes care of his body and of his soul [ hominis 
corpus animumque curantis ], weaving the texture of his good 
from both, his condition is perfect, and he has found the 
consummation of his prayers, if there is no commotion in his 
soul or pain in his body .” 11 

Taking care of one’s soul was a precept that Zeno had given 
his disciples from the beginning, and one Musonius was to 
repeat, in the first century, in a sentence quoted by Plutarch: 
“He who wishes to come through life safe and sound must 
continue throughout his life to take care of himself .” 12 The 
fullness assumed, in Seneca, by the theme of application of 
oneself to oneself is well known: it is to this activity, according 
to him, that a man must devote himself, to the exclusion of 
other occupations. He will thus be able to make himself vacant 
for himself (sibi vacare). 13 But this “vacation” takes the form 
of a varied activity which demands that one lose no time and 
spare no effort in order to “develop oneself,” “transform one¬ 
self,” “return to oneself.” Se formare, sibi vindicare, se facere, 
se ad studia revocare, sibi applicare, suum fieri, in se recedere, 
ad se recurrere, secum morari u —Seneca commands a whole 
vocabulary for designating the different forms that ought to be 
taken by the care of the self and the haste with which one seeks 
to reunite with oneself (ad se properare). 15 Marcus Aurelius 
also feels the same haste to look after himself: neither reading 
nor writing must keep him any longer from the direct atten¬ 
tion he must give to his own being: “No more vague wander-

ings. You are not likely to read your memoranda, your histo¬ 
ries of Greece and Rome, or the extracts from books which 
you put aside for your old age. Hasten then to the end, discard 
vain hopes, and if you care for yourself at all, rescue yourself 
[sautoi boethei ei ti soi melei sautou] while you still may .” 16 

It is in Epictetus no doubt that one finds the highest philo¬ 
sophical development of this theme. Man is defined in the 
Discourses as the being who was destined to care for himself. 
This is where the basic difference between him and other 
creatures resides. The animals find “ready prepared” that 
which they need in order to live, for nature has so arranged 
things that animals are at our disposal without their having to 
look after themselves, and without our having to look after 
them . 17 Man, on the other hand, must attend to himself: not, 
however, as a consequence of some defect that would put him 
in a situation of need and make him in this respect inferior to 
the animals, but because the god [Zeus] deemed it right that 
he be able to make free use of himself; and it was for this 
purpose that he endowed him with reason. The latter is not 
to be understood as a substitute for natural faculties that 
might be lacking; on the contrary it is the faculty that enables 
one to use, at the right time and in the right way, the other 
faculties. In fact, it is this absolutely singular faculty that is 
capable of making use of itself, for it is capable of “contem¬ 
plating both itself and everything else .” 18 By crowning with 
this reasoning faculty all that is already given to us by nature, 
Zeus gave us the possibility and the duty to take care of 
ourselves. It is insofar as he is free and reasonable that man 
is the natural being that has been committed to the care of 
himself. The god did not fashion us out of marble, like Phidias 
his Athena, who forever extends the hand on which Victory 
came to rest immobile with wings outspread. Zeus “not only 
made you, but entrusted and committed you to yourself 
alone .” 19 The care of the self, for Epictetus, is a privilege-duty, 
a gift-obligation that ensures our freedom while forcing us to 
take ourselves as the object of all our diligence . 20 

But the fact that the philosophers advise that one give heed 



48 


The Care of the Self 


to oneself does not mean that this zeal is reserved for those 
who choose to live a life similar to theirs, or that such an 
attitude is required only during the time one spends with 
them. It is a valuable principle for everyone, all the time and 
throughout life. Apuleius points out that one can, without 
shame or dishonor, ignore the rules that make it possible to 
paint and to play the zither, but to know how “to perfect one’s 
own soul with the help of reason” is a rule “equally necessary 
for all men.” The case of Pliny can serve as a concrete example 
in this regard: aloof from all strict doctrinal adherences, lead¬ 
ing a regular career replete with honors, absorbed by his ac¬ 
tivities as a lawyer, he is not on the point of breaking his ties 
to society—far from it. And yet, throughout his life he does 
not cease to speak of the care he intends to devote to himself 
as perhaps the most important matter with which he could be 
concerned. When, as a very young man still, he is sent to Syria 
to do military service, his first thought is to visit with Euphra¬ 
tes, not just to hear his lectures, but little by little to get to 
know him, “win his affection,” and benefit from the admoni¬ 
tions of a master who knows how to go after faults without 
attacking individuals . 21 And later, in Rome, when he has occa¬ 
sion to take a period of rest in his villa at Laurentum, it is in 
order to be able to attend to himself, “reading and writing and 
finding time to take the exercise which keeps my mind fit,” 
and “sharing my thoughts with no one but my own writ¬ 
ings .” 22 

Hence there is no right age for attending to oneself. “It is 
never too early nor too late to care for the well-being of the 
soul,” to quote Epicurus again. “The man who says that the 
season for this study has not yet come or is already past is like 
the man who says it is too early or too late for happiness. 
Therefore, both the young and the old should study philoso¬ 
phy, the former so that as he grows old he may still retain the 
happiness of youth in his pleasant memories of the past, the 
latter so that although he is old he may at the same time be 
young by virtue of his fearlessness of the future .” 23 “Spend 
your whole life learning how to live” was an aphorism— 



The Cultivation of the Self 


49 


Seneca cites it—which asked people to transform their exis¬ 
tence into a kind of permanent exercise. And while it is good 
to begin early, it is important never to let up. 24 Those to whom 
Seneca or Plutarch offer their counsel are in fact no longer the 
eager or timid adolescents whom the Socrates of Plato or 
Xenophon urged to attend to themselves. They are men. Sere- 
nus, to whom the moral essay De tranquilitate is addressed (in 
addition to the De constantia and perhaps the De otio ) is a 
young relative under Seneca’s protection, but nothing like a 
boy pursuing his studies. At the time of the writing of De 
tranquilitate, he is a provincial who has just arrived in Rome, 
and who is still trying to decide on a career and a way of life; 
but he already has behind him a certain philosophical itiner¬ 
ary. His perplexity relates essentially to the way in which he 
might bring it to a conclusion. As for Lucilius, apparently he 
was only a few years younger than Seneca. He is procurator 
in Sicily when, starting in 62, they exchange the intimate 
correspondence in which Seneca reveals to him the principles 
and practices of his wisdom, tells him of his own weaknesses 
and his still unfinished battles, and occasionally even asks for 
his help. Nor is he embarrassed to tell him that when more 
than sixty years old, he himself went to hear the lectures of 
Metronax. 25 The correspondents to whom Plutarch addresses 
his treatises—which are not just general considerations on 
virtues and faults, on the happiness of the soul and the misfor¬ 
tunes of life, but advice on conduct, often in reference to very 
specific circumstances—are men as well. 

This extreme eagerness of adults to look after their souls, 
the zeal with which, like schoolboys grown old, they sought 
out philosophers so that they might be shown the way to 
happiness, irritated Lucian, and many others with him. He 
makes fun of Hermotimus, who is seen muttering lessons in 
the street, lessons he must not forget. Hermotimus is no longer 
a young man, however: it has been twenty years already since 
he decided no longer to mingle his life with that of unfortunate 
humans, and he estimates that it will take him another twenty 
years to reach the state of bliss. Now (he mentions this himself 



50 


The Care of the Self 


a little further on), he began to philosophize at the age of forty. 
So it is the last forty years of his life that he will have devoted 
to caring for himself, under the direction of a master. And his 
interlocutor Lycinus, for his own amusement, pretends to 
discover that for him, too, the time has come to study philoso¬ 
phy, seeing that he has just turned forty: “Act as my crutch,” 
he says to Hermotimus, and “lead me by the hand.” 26 As 
Ilsetraut Hadot says in reference to Seneca, all this activity of 
spiritual direction is in the category of adult education—of 
Erwachsenerziehung . 27 

2. It is important to understand that this application to 
oneself does not require simply a general attitude, an un¬ 
focused attention. The term epimeleia designates not just a 
preoccupation but a whole set of occupations; it is epimeleia 
that is employed in speaking of the activities of the master of 
a household, the tasks of the ruler who looks after his subjects, 
the care that must be given to a sick or wounded patient, or 
the honors that must be paid to the gods or to the dead. 28 With 
regard to oneself as well, epimeleia implies a labor. 

It takes time. And it is one of the big problems of this 
cultivation of the self to determine the portion of one’s day or 
one’s life that should be devoted to it. People resort to many 
different formulas. One can set aside a few moments, in the 
evening or in the morning, for introspection, for examining 
what needs to be done, for memorizing certain useful princi¬ 
ples, for reflecting on the day that has gone by. The morning 
and evening examination of the Pythagoreans is encountered 
again, doubtless with a different content, in the Stoics. Seneca, 
Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius refer to those moments that 
ought to be devoted to turning one’s thoughts to oneself. 29 One 
may also from time to time interrupt one’s ordinary activities 
and go into one of those retreats that Musonius, among so 
many others, strongly recommended. 30 They enable one to 
commune with oneself, to recollect one’s bygone days, to place 
the whole of one’s past life before one’s eyes, to get to know 
oneself, through reading, through the precepts and examples 



The Cultivation of the Self 


51 


that will provide inspiration, and, by contemplating a life 
reduced to its essentials, to rediscover the basic principles of 
a rational conduct. It is possible too, in the middle or at the 
end of one’s career, to unburden oneself of these activities and, 
taking advantage of these declining years when desires are 
calmed, give oneself up entirely—like Seneca in his philosoph¬ 
ical work or Spurrina in the tranquillity of a pleasant exis¬ 
tence 31 —to the possession of oneself. 

This time is not empty; it is filled with exercises, practical 
tasks, various activities. Taking care of oneself is not a rest 
cure. There is the care of the body to consider, health regi¬ 
mens, physical exercises without overexertion, the carefully 
measured satisfaction of needs. There are the meditations, the 
readings, the notes that one takes on books or on the conversa¬ 
tions one has heard, notes that one reads again later, the 
recollection of truths that one knows already but that need to 
be more fully adapted to one’s own life. Marcus Aurelius thus 
gives an example of “a retreat within oneself”: it is a sustained 
effort in which general principles are reactivated and argu¬ 
ments are adduced that persuade one not to let oneself become 
angry at others, at providence, or at things. 32 There are also 
the talks that one has with a confidant, with friends, with a 
guide or director. Add to this the correspondence in which one 
reveals the state of one’s soul, solicits advice, gives advice to 
anyone who needs it—which for that matter constitutes a 
beneficial exercise for the giver, who is called the preceptor, 
because he thereby reactualizes it for himself. 33 Around the 
care of the self, there developed an entire activity of speaking 
and writing in which the work of oneself on oneself and com¬ 
munication with others were linked together. 

Here we touch on one of the most important aspects of this 
activity devoted to oneself: it constituted, not an exercise in 
solitude, but a true social practice. And it did so in several 
ways. It often took form within more or less institutionalized 
structures. The neo-Pythagorean communities are an example 
of this, or those Epicurean groups about whose practices we 
have some information by way of Philodemus: a recognized 



52 


The Care of the Self 


hierarchy gave the most advanced members the task of tutor¬ 
ing the others (either individually or in a more collective 
fashion). But there were also common exercises that allowed 
one, in the attention he gave to himself, to receive the help of 
others: this was the task defined as to di' allelon sozesthai . 34 
Epictetus taught in a setting that was more like that of a 
school. He had several categories of students: some were there 
for only a short stay; others would remain longer in order to 
prepare for the life of an ordinary citizen or even for important 
activities; and finally a few others, who intended to become 
professional philosophers themselves, were there to be trained 
in the rules and practices of spiritual direction. 35 One also 
found—particularly in Rome, in aristocratic circles—the 
practice of the private consultant who served in a family or a 
group as a life counselor, a political adviser, a potential inter¬ 
mediary in a negotiation: “Some wealthy Romans found it 
useful to keep a philosopher, and men of distinction did not 
find the position humiliating. They expected to be able to give 
moral advice and comfort to their patrons and their families, 
while their patrons could draw strength from their ap¬ 
proval.” 36 Thus Demetrius was the spiritual guide of Thrasea 
Paetus, who had him participate in the staging of his suicide, 
so that he might in this final moment help him give his life its 
finest and most accomplished form. Furthermore, these differ¬ 
ent functions of professor, guide, adviser, and personal confi¬ 
dant were not always distinct—far from it: in the practice of 
the cultivation of the self, the roles were often interchangeable, 
and they could be played in turn by the same person. 
Musonius Rufus had been the political adviser of Rubellius 
Plautus; in the exile that followed the latter’s death, he drew 
visitors and loyal supporters around him and held a kind of 
school. Under Vespasian, he returned to Rome, where he gave 
public lectures and was part of Titus’ entourage. 

But all this attention to the self did not depend solely on the 
existence of schools, lectures, and professionals of spiritual 
direction for its social base; it found a ready support in the 
whole bundle of customary relations of kinship, friendship, 



The Cultivation of the Self 


53 


and obligation. When, in the practice of the care of the self, 
one appealed to another person in whom one recognized an 
aptitude for guidance and counseling, one was exercising a 
right. And it was a duty that one was performing when one 
lavished one’s assistance on another, or when one gratefully 
received the lessons the other might give. Galen’s text on 
curing the passions is significant from this point of view: he 
advises anyone who wishes to take proper care of himself to 
seek the aid of another; he does not, however, recommend a 
technician known for his competence and learning, but simply 
a man of good reputation, whose uncompromising frankness 
one can have the opportunity of experiencing. 37 But it is some¬ 
times the case, too, that the interplay of the care of the self and 
the help of the other blends into preexisting relations, giving 
them a new coloration and a greater warmth. The care of the 
self—or the attention one devotes to the care that others 
should take of themselves—appears then as an intensification 
of social relations. Seneca addresses a letter of consolation to 
his mother, during the period when he is in exile, in order to 
help her support his present misfortune, and perhaps greater 
misfortunes in the future. The Serenus to whom he addresses 
the long moral essay on tranquillity of mind is a young provin¬ 
cial relative whom he has under his protection. His correspon¬ 
dence with Lucilius deepens a preexisting relationship 
between the two men, who are not separated by a very great 
difference in age, and tends little by little to transform this 
spiritual guidance into a shared experience, from which each 
derives a benefit for himself. In the thirty-fourth letter, Seneca, 
who is able to say to Lucilius: “I claim you for myself; you are 
my handiwork,” immediately adds: “I am cheering on one 
who is in the race and so in turn cheers me on.” And, already 
in the next letter, he alludes to the reward of perfect friendship 
in which each one will be for the other that constant help 
which will be the subject of letter 109: “Skilled wrestlers are 
kept up to the mark by practice; a musician is stirred to action 
by one of equal proficiency. The wise man also needs to have 
his virtues kept in action; and as he prompts himself to do 



54 


The Care of the Self 


things, so he is prompted by another wise man.” 38 The care of 
the self appears therefore as intrinsically linked to a “soul 
service,” which includes the possibility of a round of ex¬ 
changes with the other and a system of reciprocal obligations. 

3. In keeping with a tradition that goes back a very long 
way in Greek culture, the care of the self is in close correlation 
with medical thought and practice. This ancient correlation 
became increasingly strong, so much so that Plutarch is able 
to say, at the beginning of Advice about Keeping Well, that 
philosophy and medicine are concerned with “a single field” 
(mia chora ). 39 They do in fact draw on a shared set of notions, 
whose central element is the concept of “pathos.” It applies 
to passion as well as to physical illness, to the distress of the 
body and to the involuntary movement of the soul; and in both 
cases alike, it refers to a state of passivity, which for the body 
takes the form of a disorder that upsets the balance of its 
humors or its qualities and which for the soul takes the form 
of a movement capable of carrying it away in spite of itself. 
On the basis of this shared concept, it was possible to con¬ 
struct a grid of analysis that was valid for the ailments of the 
body and the soul. For example, there was the schema pro¬ 
posed by the Stoics, which determines the degrees of develop¬ 
ment and the chronicity of diseases. The first distinction made 
in this schema is the predisposition to disease, the proclivitas 
that exposes one to the possible illnesses. Next there is the 
affection, the disorder, which in Greek is called pathos and in 
Latin affectus; then the illness (nosema, morbus) that is estab¬ 
lished and declared when the disorder has taken hold of the 
body and the soul. More serious, more lasting, is the aegrotatio 
or arrhostema that constitutes a state of sickness and debility. 
Finally, there is the inveterate disease (kakia, aegrotatio in- 
veterata, vitium malum) for which no cure is possible. The 
Stoics also presented schemas that mark the different stages or 
different possible forms of the cure. Thus Seneca distinguishes 
between sick persons who are cured of all or part of their vices 
and those who are rid of their ills but not yet rid of their 



The Cultivation of the Self 


55 


affections; and there are those who have recovered their health 
but are still frail because their predispositions have not been 
corrected. 40 These notions and schemas are intended to serve 
as a common guide for the medicine of the body and the 
therapeutics of the soul. They make it possible not only to 
apply the same type of theoretical analysis to physical troubles 
and moral disorders alike, but also to use the same kind of 
approach in attending to them, treating them, and, if possible, 
curing them. 

A whole series of medical metaphors is regularly employed 
to designate the operations necessary for the care of the soul: 
put the scalpel to the wound; open an abscess; amputate; 
evacuate the superfluities; give medications; prescribe bitter, 
soothing, or bracing potions. 41 The improvement, the perfect¬ 
ing of the soul that one seeks in philosophy, the paideia the 
latter is supposed to ensure, increasingly assumes a medical 
coloration. Educating oneself and taking care of oneself are 
interconnected activities. Epictetus lays stress on this point: he 
does not want his school to be considered as just a place of 
education where one can acquire knowledge useful for a career 
or a reputation, before returning home to derive advantage 
from it. The school should be thought of as a “dispensary for 
the soul”: “The philosopher’s school is a physician’s consult¬ 
ing-room [iatreion]. You must leave it in pain, not in plea¬ 
sure.” 42 He insists that his disciples be mindful of their 
condition, regarding it as a pathological state; that they not 
consider themselves first and above all as students who have 
come to gain knowledge from the man who possesses it; that 
they present themselves as patients, as though one had a dis¬ 
located shoulder, the other an abscess, the third a fistula, and 
the next one headaches. He takes them to task for coming to 
him not in order to be treated (therapeuthesomenoi) but in 
order to have their judgments amended and corrected (epan- 
orthosontes). “You wish to learn syllogisms? You must first 
attend to your ulcers, and stay your flux, and arrive at peace 
in your mind.” 43 

In return, a physician like Galen considers it within his 



56 


The Care of the Self 


competence not only to cure the great aberrations of the mind 
(love madness was traditionally within the purview of medi¬ 
cine), but to treat the passions (“an irrational power within us 
which refuses to obey reason”) and the errors (which “arise 
from a false opinion”). Moreover, “both are commonly called 
errors in a generic sense.” 44 Thus he undertakes to cure a 
traveling companion who was too easily disposed to lose his 
temper. Or again, he grants the request of a young man he 
knew who had come one day to ask him for medical advice: 
the young man had in fact imagined himself to be immune to 
the agitation of the passions, however minor they might be; 
but he had been obliged to recognize that he was more trou¬ 
bled by matters of no importance than was his teacher Galen 
by momentous ones, so he came to him for help. 45 

The increased medical involvement in the cultivation of the 
self appears to have been expressed through a particular and 
intense form of attention to the body. This attention is very 
different from that manifested by the positive valuation of 
physical vigor during an epoch when gymnastics and athletic 
and military training were an integral part of the education of 
a free man. Moreover, it has something paradoxical about it 
since it is inscribed, at least in part, within an ethics that posits 
that death, disease, or even physical suffering do not constitute 
true ills and that it is better to take pains over one’s soul than 
to devote one’s care to the maintenance of the body. 46 But in 
fact the focus of attention in these practices of the self is the 
point where the ills of the body and those of the soul can 
communicate with one another and exchange their distresses: 
where the bad habits of the soul can entail physical miseries, 
while the excesses of the body manifest and maintain the 
failings of the soul. The apprehension is concentrated above 
all on the crossover point of the agitations and troubles, taking 
account of the fact that one had best correct the soul if one 
does not want the body to get the better of it, and rectify the 
body if one wants it to remain completely in control of itself. 
It is to this point of contact, the weak point of the individual, 
that the attention one gives to the physical ills, discomforts, 



The Cultivation of the Self 


57 


and complaints is directed. The body the adult has to care for, 
when he is concerned about himself, is no longer the young 
body that needed shaping by gymnastics; it is a fragile, threat¬ 
ened body, undermined by petty miseries—a body that in turn 
threatens the soul, less by its too-vigorous requirements than 
by its own weaknesses. The letters of Seneca offer many exam¬ 
ples of this attention focused on health, on regimen, on the 
malaises and all the troubles that can circulate between the 
body and the soul. 47 The correspondence between Fronto and 
Marcus Aurelius—to say nothing of the Sacred Tales of 
Aelius Aristides, which give altogether different dimensions to 
the narrative of illness and an entirely different value to its 
experience—shows very well the place occupied by concern 
for the body in these practices of the self, but it also shows the 
style of this preoccupation: fear of excess, economy of regi¬ 
men, being on the alert for disturbances, detailed attention 
given to dysfunction, the taking into account of all the factors 
(season, climate, diet, mode of living) that can disturb the 
body and, through it, the soul. 48 

But there is something more important perhaps: on the 
basis of this rapprochement (practical and theoretical) be¬ 
tween medicine and ethics, there is the inducement to ac¬ 
knowledge oneself as being ill or threatened by illness. The 
practice of the self implies that one should form the image of 
oneself not simply as an imperfect, ignorant individual who 
requires correction, training, and instruction, but as one who 
suffers from certain ills and who needs to have them treated, 
either by oneself or by someone who has the necessary compe¬ 
tence. Everyone must discover that he is in a state of need, that 
he needs to receive medication and assistance. “This, then, is 
where the philosophic life begins,” says Epictetus, “in a man’s 
perception of the state of his ruling faculty [aisthesis tou idiou 
hegemonikou pos echei ]: for when once you realize that it is 
in a feeble state, you will not choose to employ it anymore for 
great matters. But, as it is, some men, finding themselves 
unable to swallow a mouthful, buy themselves a treatise, and 
set about eating it whole, and in consequence they vomit or 



58 


The Care of the Self 


have indigestion. Hence colics and fluxes and fevers. They 
ought first to have considered whether they have the fac¬ 
ulty.” 49 And the establishment of the relation to oneself as a 
sick individual is all the more necessary because the diseases 
of the soul—unlike those of the body—do not announce them¬ 
selves by the suffering that one perceives; not only can they go 
undetected for a long time, but they blind those whom they 
afflict. Plutarch remarks that the disorders of the body can 
generally be detected by the pulse, bile, temperature, and 
pains; and further, that the worst physical illnesses are those 
in which—as in lethargy, epilepsy, or apoplexy—the individ¬ 
ual is not aware of his state. The insidious thing about the 
diseases of the soul is that they pass unnoticed, or even that 
one can mistake them for virtues (anger for courage, amorous 
passion for friendship, envy for emulation, cowardice for pru¬ 
dence). Now, what physicians desire is “that a man should not 
be ill; and, if he is ill, that he should not be unaware that he 
is ill.” 50 

4. In this practice, which is at once personal and social, 
self-knowledge occupies a considerable place, of course. The 
Delphic principle is often recalled; but it would not be suffi¬ 
cient to see this merely as the influence of the Socratic theme. 
In reality, a whole art of self-knowledge developed, with 
precise recipes, specific forms of examination, and codified 
exercises. 

a. We can thus begin by isolating—very schematically and 
subject to a more thorough and systematic study—what might 
be called the “testing procedures.” These have the dual role 
of moving one forward in the acquisition of a virtue and of 
marking the point one has reached. Hence their progressive 
character, emphasized by Plutarch and Epictetus alike. But it 
is important to note that the purpose of these tests is not to 
practice renunciation for its own sake; it is to enable one to 
do without unnecessary things by establishing a supremacy 
over oneself that does not depend on their presence or absence. 
The tests to which one subjects oneself are not successive 



The Cultivation of the Self 


59 


stages of privation. They are a way of measuring and confirm¬ 
ing the independence one is capable of with regard to every¬ 
thing that is not indispensable and essential. They bring one 
back, momentarily, to the basic needs, revealing in this man¬ 
ner the actual basis of all that is superfluous and the possibility 
of doing without it. In Socrates' Daemon, Plutarch reports on 
a test of this kind, the value of which is affirmed by the 
character in the dialogue who represents the themes of neo- 
Pythagoreanism. One began by whetting the appetite through 
the practice of some sport; next one placed oneself in front of 
tables laden with the most succulent dishes; then, having 
gazed on these, one left them to the servants and made do with 
the kind of food that slaves ate. 51 

Exercises in abstinence were common to the Epicureans 
and the Stoics, but this training did not have the same mean¬ 
ing for both groups. In the tradition of Epicurus, it was a 
matter of showing how, in this satisfaction of the most ele¬ 
mentary needs, one could find a fuller, purer, more stable 
pleasure than in the delight one might take in all that is 
superfluous; and the test served to mark the threshold where 
privation could start to make one suffer. On certain days, 
Epicurus, whose diet was extremely abstemious already, 
would take only a reduced ration in order to see how much 
his pleasure would be diminished. 52 For the Stoics, it was 
primarily a matter of preparing oneself for possible priva¬ 
tions by discovering how easy it was, finally, to dispense 
with everything to which habit, opinion, education, attention 
to reputation, and the taste for ostentation have attached us. 
With these reductive tests, they wished to show that we can 
always have at our disposal those things that are strictly nec¬ 
essary, and that one should guard against the least apprehen¬ 
sion at the thought of possible privations: “In days of peace 
the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with 
no enemy in sight, and wearies himself with gratuitous toil, 
in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you 
would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train 
him before it comes.” 53 And Seneca alludes to a practice 



60 


The Care of the Self 


which he also speaks of in another letter: brief training peri¬ 
ods of “fancied poverty” to be done every month and in the 
course of which, by voluntarily placing oneself “within the 
confines of destitution” for three or four days, one experi¬ 
ences a bed of straw, coarse clothing, and bread of the lowest 
quality: “not a game, but a test” (non lusus, sed experimen- 
tum ). 54 One does not deprive oneself for a moment in order 
to sharpen one’s taste for future refinements but to convince 
oneself that the worst misfortune will not deprive one of the 
things one absolutely needs, and that one will always be able 
to tolerate what one is capable of enduring at times. 55 One 
makes oneself familiar with the minimum. This is what 
Seneca wishes to do according to a letter written a short 
time before the Saturnalia of the year 62. Rome is “in a 
sweat” and “licentiousness is officially sanctioned.” Seneca 
asks himself if one ought to take part in the festivities or not; 
it would be proof of one’s self-control if one broke with the 
general attitude and refrained. But one would be acting with 
a still greater moral force if one did not withdraw oneself; 
the best thing would be “to do what the crowd does, but in 
a different way.” And this “different way” is the way that 
one learns ahead of time by means of voluntary exercises, 
periods of abstinence, and poverty treatments. These exer¬ 
cises make it possible to celebrate the festival like everyone 
else but without ever falling into luxuria. Thanks to them, 
one can keep a detached mind in the midst of abundance: 
“We shall be rich with all the more comfort, if we once learn 
how far poverty is from being a burden.” 56 * 
b. In conjunction with these practical tests, it was consid¬ 
ered important to subject oneself to self-examination. This 
custom formed part of Pythagorean teaching, 58 but it had 
become quite widespread. It seems that the morning examina¬ 
tion served mainly as an occasion to consider the tasks and 
obligations of the day, so as to be sufficiently prepared for it. 
The evening examination for its part was devoted much more 

‘Compare: “Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living 
simply is voluntary poverty.’” 7 



The Cultivation of the Self 


61 


specifically to reviewing the day that had gone by. The most 
detailed description of this exercise, which was regularly pre¬ 
scribed by numerous authors, is given by Seneca in De ira . 59 
Seneca traces the practice of it to Sextius, that Roman Stoic 
whose teaching he knew by way of Papirius Fabianus and 
Sotion. He presents Sextius’ practice as being centered mainly 
on the evaluation of one’s progress at the end of the day. When 
he had retired for the night, Sextius would question his soul: 
“What bad habit have you cured today? What fault have 
you resisted? In what respect are you better?” Seneca, too, 
undertakes an examination of this kind every evening. Dark¬ 
ness—“when the light has been removed from sight”—and 
quiet—“when my wife has become silent”—are its external 
conditions. And he is mindful of the need to prepare for a 
blissful sleep: “Can anything be more excellent than this prac¬ 
tice of thoroughly sifting the whole day? And how delightful 
the sleep that follows this self-examination—how tranquil [ 
tranquillus ], how deep [ altus] and untroubled [liber], when 
the soul has either praised or admonished itself.” At first 
glance, the examination to which Seneca subjects himself ap¬ 
pears to constitute a sort of small-scale judicial drama, which 
is clearly evoked by such phrases as “appear before the judge,” 
“give report of my own character,” “plead my cause.” These 
elements seem to indicate the division of the subject into a 
judging authority and an accused individual. But the process 
as a whole also calls to mind a kind of administrative review, 
where it is a matter of evaluating a performed activity in order 
to reactivate its principles and ensure their correct application 
in the future. As much as the role of a judge, it is the activity 
of an inspector that Seneca evokes, or that of a master of a 
household checking his accounts. 

The words employed are significant. Seneca means to “scru¬ 
tinize” the entire day that has just unfolded (the verb ex- 
ecutere, “to shake out,” “to knock so as to make the dust fall,” 
is used to denote the scrutiny by which one locates the errors 
in an account); he intends to “inspect” it, to “remeasure” the 
acts that were committed, the words that were spoken (re- 



62 


The Care of the Self 


metiri, as one might do after a piece of work is finished, to see 
if it is up to the standards set for it). The subject’s relation to 
himself in this examination is not established so much in the 
form of a judicial relationship in which the accused faces the 
judge; it is more like an act of inspection in which the inspec¬ 
tor aims to evaluate a piece of work, an accomplished task. 
The word speculator (one needs to be a speculator sui) desig¬ 
nates this role exactly. Further, the examination practiced in 
this manner does not focus, as if in imitation of the judicial 
procedure, on “infractions”; and it does not lead to a verdict 
of guilty or to decisions of self-castigation. Seneca, in the 
example he gives here, singles out such actions as arguing too 
intensely with ignorant people, whom one cannot convince in 
any case, or vexing, through reproaches, a friend whom one 
would have liked to help improve. Seneca is dissatisfied with 
these ways of behaving insofar as, in order to achieve the goals 
that one must in fact set for oneself, the means employed were 
not the right ones: it is good to want to correct one’s friends, 
if need be, but reproof is too extreme and gives offense instead 
of helping; it is good to convince those who don’t know, but 
it is necessary first to choose such people as are capable of 
being taught. The purpose of the examination is not therefore 
to discover one’s own guilt, down to its most trifling forms and 
its most tenuous roots. If one “conceals nothing from oneself,” 
if one “omits nothing,” it is in order to commit to memory, 
so as to have them present in one’s mind, legitimate ends, but 
also rules of conduct that enable one to achieve these ends 
through the choice of appropriate means. The fault is not 
reactivated by the examination in order to determine a culpa¬ 
bility or stimulate a feeling of remorse, but in order to 
strengthen, on the basis of the recapitulated and reconsidered 
verification of a failure, the rational equipment that ensures a 
wise behavior. 

c. Added to the foregoing is the necessity of a labor of 
thought with itself as object. This work will have to be more 
than a test for measuring what one is capable of, and some¬ 
thing other than the assessment of a fault in relation to rules 



The Cultivation of the Self 


63 


of conduct; it should have the form of a steady screening of 
representations: examining them, monitoring them, sorting 
them out. More than an exercise done at regular intervals, it 
is a constant attitude that one must take toward oneself. To 
characterize this attitude, Epictetus employs metaphors that 
will have a long career in Christian spirituality, but they will 
take on quite different values in it. He asks that one adopt, 
vis-a-vis oneself, the role and posture of a “night watchman” 
who checks the entries at the gate of cities or houses; 60 or 
further, he suggests that one exercise on oneself the functions 
of a “tester of coinage,” an “assayer,” one of those money¬ 
changers who won’t accept any coin without having made 
sure of its worth: “You all see in the matter of coinage ... how 
we have even invented an art, and how many means the tester 
employs to test the coinage—sight, touch, smell, finally hear¬ 
ing: he throws the denarius down and then listens to the sound 
and is not satisfied with the sound it makes on a single test, 
but, as a result of his constant attention to the matter, he 
catches the tune, like a musician.” Unfortunately, Epictetus 
continues, these precautions that we willingly take when it 
is a matter of money, we neglect to take when it is a question 
of our soul. Now the task of philosophy—its principal and 
primary ergon —will be precisely to exercise this control 
(dokimazein ). 61 

In order to formulate what is both a general principle and 
an attitudinal schema, Epictetus refers to Socrates and to the 
aphorism stated in the Apology: “An unexamined life [ anex- 
etastos bios] is not worth living.” 62 In reality, the examination 
Socrates was talking about was the one to which he intended 
to subject both himself and others apropos of ignorance, 
knowledge, and the non-knowledge of this ignorance. The 
examination Epictetus talks about is completely different: it is 
an examination that deals with representations, that aims to 
“test” them, to “distinguish” (diakrinein) one from another 
and thus to prevent one from accepting the “first arrival.” 
“We ought not to accept a mental representation unsubjected 
to examination, but should say, ‘Wait, allow me to see who 



64 


The Care of the Self 


you are and whence you came’ (just as the night-watch say, 
‘Show me your tokens’). ‘Do you have your token from na¬ 
ture, the one which every representation which is to be ac¬ 
cepted must have?’ ” 63 However, it should be made clear that 
the control point will not be located in the origin or in the very 
object of the representation, but in the approval that one 
should or should not give to it. When a representation enters 
the mind, the work of discrimination, of diakrisis, will consist 
in applying to it the famous Stoic canon that marks the divi¬ 
sion between that which does not depend on us and that which 
does. In the former case, the representations will not be ac¬ 
cepted since they are beyond our understanding; they will be 
rejected as not being appropriate objects of “desire” or “aver¬ 
sion,” of “attraction” or “repulsion.” This inspection is a test 
of power and a guarantee of freedom: a way of always making 
sure that one will not become attached to that which does not 
come under our control. To keep constant watch over one’s 
representations, or to verify their marks the way one authenti¬ 
cates a currency, is not to inquire (as will be done later in 
Christianity) concerning the deep origin of the idea that pre¬ 
sents itself; it is not to try and decipher a meaning hidden 
beneath the visible representation; it is to assess the relation¬ 
ship between oneself and that which is represented, so as to 
accept in the relation to the self only that which can depend 
on the subject’s free and rational choice. 

5. The common goal of these practices of the self, allowing 
for the differences they present, can be characterized by the 
entirely general principle of conversion to self—of epistrophe 
eis heauton. * The expression has a Platonic cast, but it gener¬ 
ally covers meanings that are considerably different. It is to be 
understood first of all as a change of activity: not that one must 
cease all other forms of occupation and devote oneself entirely 
and exclusively to oneself; but in the activities that one ought 
to engage in, one had best keep in mind that the chief objective 

*The expressions epistrophe eis heauton and epistrephein eis heauton appear in Epic- 
tetus. 6 * 



The Cultivation of the Self 


65 


one should set for oneself is to be sought within oneself, in the 
relation of oneself to oneself. This conversion implies a shift 
of one’s attention: the latter must not be dissipated in an idle 
curiosity, either that of everyday agitations and of absorption 
in the lives of others (Plutarch devoted a whole treatise to this 
polypragmosyne), or that which seeks to discover the secrets 
of nature furthest removed from human existence and from 
the things that matter for it. (Demetrius, quoted by Seneca, 
held that nature, keeping only useless secrets, had placed 
within reach and in sight of human beings the things it was 
necessary for them to know.) But the conversio ad se is also 
a path by which, escaping all the dependences and enslave¬ 
ments, one ultimately rejoins oneself, like a harbor sheltered 
from the tempests or a citadel protected by its ramparts: “The 
soul stands on unassailable grounds, if it has abandoned exter¬ 
nal things; it is independent in its own fortress; and every 
weapon that is hurled falls short of the mark. Fortune has not 
the long reach with which we credit her; she can seize none 
except him that clings to her. Let us then recoil from her as 
far as we are able.” 65 

This relation to self that constitutes the end of the conver¬ 
sion and the final goal of all the practices of the self still 
belongs to an ethics of control. Yet, in order to characterize 
it, moralists are not content with invoking the agonistic form 
of a victory over forces difficult to subdue and of a dominion 
over them that can be established beyond question. This rela¬ 
tion is often conceived in terms of the juridical model of 
possession: one “belongs to himself,” one is “his own master” 
{suum fieri, suum esse are expressions that recur often in 
Seneca); 66 one is answerable only to oneself, one is sui juris; 
one exercises over oneself an authority that nothing limits or 
threatens; one holds the potestas sui. 61 But apart from this 
rather political and judicial form, the relation to self is also 
defined as a concrete relationship enabling one to delight in 
oneself, as in a thing one both possesses and has before one’s 
eyes. If to convert to oneself is to turn away from the preoccu¬ 
pations of the external world, from the concerns of ambition, 



66 


The Care of the Self 


from fear of the future, then one can turn back to one’s own 
past, recall it to mind, have it unfold as one pleases before 
one’s own eyes, and have a relationship with it that nothing 
can disturb: “This is the part of our time that is sacred and 
set apart, put beyond the reach of all human mishaps, and 
removed from the dominion of fortune, the part which is 
disquieted by no want, by no fear, by no attack of disease; this 
can neither be troubled nor snatched away—it is an everlast¬ 
ing and unanxious possession.” 48 And the experience of self 
that forms itself in this possession is not simply that of a force 
overcome, or a rule exercised over a power that is on the point 
of rebelling; it is the experience of a pleasure that one takes 
in oneself. The individual who has finally succeeded in gaining 
access to himself is, for himself, an object of pleasure. Not only 
is one satisfied with what one is and accepting of one’s limits, 
but one “pleases oneself.” 69 This pleasure, for which Seneca 
usually employs the word gaudium or laetitia, is a state that 
is neither accompanied nor followed by any form of distur¬ 
bance in the body or the mind. It is defined by the fact of not 
being caused by anything that is independent of ourselves and 
therefore escapes our control. It arises out of ourselves and 
within ourselves. 70 It is characterized as well by the fact that 
it knows neither degree nor change, but is given as a “woven 
fabric,” and once given no external event can rend it. 71 This 
sort of pleasure can thus be contrasted point by point with 
what is meant by the term voluptas. The latter denotes a 
pleasure whose origin is to be placed outside us and in objects 
whose presence we cannot be sure of: a pleasure, therefore, 
which is precarious in itself, undermined by the fear of loss, 
and to which we are drawn by the force of a desire that may 
or may not find satisfaction. In place of this kind of violent, 
uncertain, and conditional pleasure, access to self is capable 
of providing a form of pleasure that comes, in serenity and 
without fail, of the experience of oneself. “Disce gaudere, learn 
how to feel joy,” says Seneca to Lucilius: “I do not wish you 
ever to be deprived of gladness. I would have it born in your 
house; and it is born there, if only it is inside of you ... for 



The Cultivation of the Self 


67 


it will never fail you when once you have found its source 
. . . look toward the true good, and rejoice only in that which 
comes from your own store [de tuo ]. But what do I mean by 
‘your own store’? I mean your very self and the best part of 
you.” 72 

It was against the background of this cultivation of the self, 
of its themes and practices, that reflection on the ethics of 
pleasure developed in the first centuries of our era. It is in that 
direction that one must look in order to understand the trans¬ 
formations that may have affected that ethics. What may be 
regarded, at first sight, as a more pronounced severity, an 
increased austerity, stricter requirements, should not in fact be 
interpreted as a tightening of interdictions. The domain of 
behaviors that might be forbidden did not expand to any 
appreciable extent, and there was no attempt to organize sys¬ 
tems of prohibition that would be more authoritarian and 
efficacious. The change had much more to do with the manner 
in which the individual needed to form himself as an ethical 
subject. The development of the cultivation of the self pro¬ 
duced its effect not in the strengthening of that which can 
thwart desire, but in certain modifications relating to the 
formative elements of ethical subjectivity. A break with the 
traditional ethics of self-mastery? Clearly not, but rather a 
shift, a change of orientation, a difference in emphasis. 

Sexual pleasure as an ethical substance continues to be gov¬ 
erned by relations of force—the force against which one must 
struggle and over which the subject is expected to establish his 
domination. But in this game of violence, excess, rebellion, 
and combat, the accent is placed more and more readily on the 
weakness of the individual, on his frailty, on his need to flee, 
to escape, to protect and shelter himself. Sexual ethics re¬ 
quires, still and always, that the individual conform to a cer¬ 
tain art of living which defines the aesthetic and ethical criteria 
of existence. But this art refers more and more to universal 
principles of nature or reason, which everyone must observe 
in the same way, whatever their social status. As for the 



68 


The Care of the Self 


definition of the work that must be carried out on oneself, it 
too undergoes, in the cultivation of the self, a certain modifica¬ 
tion: through the exercises of abstinence and control that 
constitute the required askesis, the place allotted to self- 
knowledge becomes more important. The task of testing one¬ 
self, examining oneself, monitoring oneself in a series of 
clearly defined exercises, makes the question of truth—the 
truth concerning what one is, what one does, and what one is 
capable of doing—central to the formation of the ethical sub¬ 
ject. Lastly, the end result of this elaboration is still and always 
defined by the rule of the individual over himself. But this rule 
broadens into an experience in which the relation to self takes 
the form not only of a domination but also of an enjoyment 
without desire and without disturbance. 

One is still far from an experience of sexual pleasure where 
the latter will be associated with evil, where behavior will have 
to submit to the universal form of law, and where the deci¬ 
phering of desire will be a necessary condition for acceding to 
a purified existence. Yet one can already see how the question 
of evil begins to work upon the ancient theme of force, how 
the question of law begins to modify the theme of art and 
techne, and how the question of truth and the principle of 
self-knowledge evolve within the ascetic practices. But we 
need first to try to discover in what context and for what 
reasons the cultivation of the self developed in this way, pre¬ 
cisely in the form that we have just considered. 



PART THREE 

Self and Others 




The work of historians suggests several reasons for this 
development of the cultivation of the self and for the concur¬ 
rent modulation in the ethics of pleasure. Two factors seem 
especially important: changes in marital practice and modifi¬ 
cations in the rules of the political game. In this brief section, 
I shall simply review some aspects of these two themes, bor¬ 
rowing from previous historical research, and outline a tenta¬ 
tive general hypothesis. Is it not the case that the new 
importance of marriage and the couple, together with a certain 
redistribution in political roles, gave rise, in what was essen¬ 
tially a male ethics, to a new problematization of the relation 
to the self? These developments may very well have occa¬ 
sioned, not a withdrawal into the self, but a new way of 
conceiving oneself in one’s relation to one’s wife, to others, to 
events, and to civic and political activities—and a different 
way of considering oneself as the subject of one’s pleasures. 
Hence the cultivation of the self would not be the necessary 
“consequence” of these social modifications; it would not be 
their expression in the sphere of ideology; rather, it would 
constitute an original response to them, in the form of a new 
stylistics of existence. 


71 



I 


The Marital Role 


It is difficult to determine, for the different regions and the 
different social strata, the actual extent of marital practice in 
Hellenistic or Roman civilization. Historians have been able, 
however, to identify—where the documentation makes this 
possible—certain transformations affecting either the insti¬ 
tutional forms, the organization of conjugal relationships, 
or the meaning and moral value that could be given to the 
latter. 

The institutional perspective first of all. As a private act, a 
matter for the family to decide, coming under its authority, 
under the rules it followed and recognized as its own, marriage 
did not call for intervention by public powers, either in Greece 
or in Rome. In Greece, it was a practice “designed to ensure 
the continued existence of the oikos. ” Of its two basic and vital 
acts, the first marked the transfer to the husband of the tute¬ 
lage exercised up to that moment by the father, and the second 
marked the actual handing over of the bride to her marriage 
partner . 1 It thus constituted “a private transaction, a piece of 
business concluded between two heads of family, the one ac¬ 
tual, the girl’s father, the other virtual, the husband-to-be.” 
This private affair was “unconnected with the political and 
social organization .” 2 The same was true of Roman marriage. 
J. A. Crook and Paul Veyne point out that it was originally 
only a de facto condition “dependent on the intention of the 

72 



Self and Others 


73 


parties,” “marked by a ceremony,” and “producing legal 
effects,” but without being “a juridical act.” 3 

In the Hellenistic world, marriage gradually made a place 
for itself within the public sphere. It thus overstepped the 
bounds of the family, with the paradoxical result that the 
authority of the latter found itself “publicly” sanctioned but 
also relatively limited. In Claude Vatin’s view, this evolution 
was aided by recourse to religious ceremonies, which served 
as a kind of intermediary between the private and the public 
institution. Summing up this transformation, whose results 
can be observed in the second and first centuries b.c., he 
writes: “It is clear that marriage has now gone beyond the 
limits of the familial institutions, and Alexandrian religious 
marriage, which is perhaps a vestige of the ancient religious 
marriage, is also a civic institution. It is always the entire city 
that sanctions marriage, whether this is through an official or 
a priest.” And comparing the data for the city of Alexandria 
with the data for rural society, he adds: “One sees in the 
chord and in the capital a rapid evolution, with variants, from 
a private into a public institution.” 4 

In Rome, one notes an evolution that is of the same general 
type, although it takes different paths and although marriage 
continues, until quite late, to be essentially “a private cere¬ 
mony, a celebration.” 5 A set of legislative measures marks 
little by little the hold of public authority on the marriage 
institution. The famous law de adulteriis is one of the manife¬ 
stations of this phenomenon. A manifestation all the more 
interesting because in condemning for adultery the married 
woman who has sexual intercourse with another man and the 
man who has intercourse with a married woman (and not the 
married man who has relations with an unmarried woman), 
this law offers nothing new in the way of legal definition of 
acts. It reproduces precisely the traditional schemas of ethical 
valuation, merely transferring to public power a sanction 
previously under familial authority. 

This gradual “publicizing” of marriage accompanies many 
other transformations, of which it is at once the effect, the 



74 


The Care of the Self 


relay, and the instrument. It appears, to the extent that the 
documents allow us to form a judgment, that the practice of 
marriage, or regular concubinage, became general or at least 
widespread in the dominant strata of the population. In its 
ancient form, marriage held no interest, had no reason for 
being, except insofar as, although a private act, it had legal 
effects or at least effects relative to status: handing down a 
name, instituting heirs, organizing a system of alliances, join¬ 
ing fortunes. This meant something only to those who were 
capable of developing strategies in such domains. As Paul 
Veyne says: “In pagan society, everyone did not marry, far 
from it. . . . Marriage, when one did marry, corresponded to 
a private objective: to transmit the estate to one’s descendants, 
rather than to other members of the family or to the sons of 
friends; and it corresponded to a politics of castes: to perpetu¬ 
ate the caste of citizens.” 6 As John Boswell puts it, this was 
a kind of marriage which “for the upper classes was largely 
dynastic, political, and economic.” 7 As for the lower classes, 
as little informed as we are concerning their marital practice, 
we may suppose with S. B. Pomeroy that two contradictory 
factors were able to play a part, both of which were connected 
with the economic functions of marriage: the wife and chil¬ 
dren could form a useful source of labor for a free man who 
was poor. On the other hand, “there is an economic level below 
which a man may not hope to support a wife and family.” 8 

The economico-political imperatives that governed mar¬ 
riage (making it necessary in some cases, and in others, use¬ 
less) must have lost some of their importance when, in the 
privileged classes, status and fortune came to depend on prox¬ 
imity to the prince, on a civil or military “career,” on success 
in “business,” more than simply on the alliance between fam¬ 
ily groups. Less encumbered with various strategies, marriage 
became “freer”: free in the choice of a wife; free, too, in the 
decision to marry and in the personal reasons for doing so. It 
could be, too, that in the underprivileged classes, marriage 
became—beyond the economic motives that could make it 
attractive—a form of tie that owed its value to the fact that 



Self and Others 


75 


it established and maintained strong personal relationships, 
implying the sharing of life, mutual aid, and moral support. 
In any case, the study of tomb inscriptions has been able to 
show the relative frequency and stability of marriages in mi¬ 
lieus that were not those of the aristocracy, 9 and we have 
statements attesting to the marriage of slaves. 10 Whatever re¬ 
sponse is given to the question of the extent of marital practice, 
it seems that the latter became more accessible; the thresholds 
that made it “interesting” were lowered. 

Hence marriage appeared more and more as a voluntary 
union between two partners whose inequality diminished to a 
certain extent but did not cease to exist. It does seem that in 
the Hellenistic world, and taking many local differences into 
account, the wife’s status gained in independence compared 
with what it was in the classical period—and above all com¬ 
pared with the Athenian situation. This relative modification 
was due first of all to the fact that the position of the citizen- 
husband lost some of its political importance. It was also due 
to a strengthening of the role of the wife—of her economic role 
and her juridical independence. According to some historians, 
the documents show that the intervention of the wife’s father 
became less and less decisive in marriage. “It was common for 
a father to give a daughter in marriage in his role of formal 
guardian, but some contracts were made simply between a 
woman and a man agreeing to share a common life. The right 
of the married daughter to self-determination against paternal 
authority began to be asserted. According to Athenian, Roman 
and Egyptian law, the authority of the father over a married 
daughter was curtailed by judicial rulings stating that the 
wishes of the woman were the determining factor. If she 
wished to remain married, she could do so.” 11 Marriage was 
concluded more and more clearly as a voluntary agreement 
entered into by the partners, who pledged themselves person¬ 
ally. The ekdosis by which the young woman was ceremoni¬ 
ously handed over to the husband by the father or guardian 
“tended to disappear,” and the contract that traditionally 
accompanied it, which was basically financial in character, 



76 


The Care of the Self 


ended up existing only in the case of written marriages, where 
it was supplemented by clauses relating to the persons. Not 
only did women receive their dowry, which they disposed of 
more and more freely within marriage, with certain contracts 
providing for restitution to them in case of divorce, but they 
also collected their share of inheritance. 

As for the obligations marriage contracts imposed on hus¬ 
bands, Claude Vatin’s study shows a significant evolution for 
Hellenistic Egypt. In documents dating from the end of the 
fourth century b.c. or from the third, the wife’s pledges im¬ 
plied obedience to the husband; prohibition from leaving the 
house, day or night, without the husband’s permission; exclu¬ 
sion of any sexual relations with another man; and the obliga¬ 
tion not to ruin the household and not to dishonor her 
husband. The latter in turn must support his wife, must not 
establish a concubine in the house, must not mistreat his wife, 
and must not have children from relationships he might main¬ 
tain on the outside. Later, the contracts studied specify much 
stricter obligations on the part of the husband. The obligation 
to provide for the needs of his wife is stipulated; but it is also 
expressly forbidden for him to have a mistress or sweetheart, 
and to own another house (in which he might maintain a 
concubine). As Vatin notes, in this type of contract “it is the 
sexual liberty of the husband that is in question; the woman 
will now be just as exclusive as the man.” Developed in this 
way, marriage contracts bring the husband and the wife into 
a system of duties or obligations that are not equal, certainly, 
but are shared. And this sharing occurs not in the name of the 
respect due to the family, which each of the two marriage 
partners represents, as it were, in the state of marriage, but on 
behalf of the couple, its stability and its internal regulation. 12 

Such explicitly affirmed obligations demanded and revealed 
forms of conjugal life that were much more closely defined 
than in the past. The prescriptions could not have been formu¬ 
lated in the contracts if they did not already correspond to a 
new attitude; and at the same time they must have carried 
such weight for each of the marriage partners that they im-

pressed on their life, much more clearly than in the past, the 
reality of the couple. The institutionalization of marriage 
based on mutual consent, says Vatin, “engendered the idea 
that there existed a conjugal community and that this reality, 
constituted by the couple, had a value greater than that of its 
component parts .” 13 Paul Veyne has called attention to a 
somewhat analogous evolution in Roman society: “Under the 
Republic, both spouses had a specific role to play and beyond 
the satisfactory performance of this role affective relations 
between husband and wife were whatever they happened to 
be. . . . Under the Empire . . . the very functioning of the 
marriage was supposed to depend on mutual understanding 
and the law of the heart. In this way a new idea came into 
being: the couple composed of the master and mistress of the 
house .” 14 

So there were many paradoxes in the evolution of this mari¬ 
tal practice. It looked to public authority for its guarantees; 
and it became an increasingly important concern in private 
life. It threw off the economic and social purposes that had 
invested it with value; and at the same time it became a general 
practice. It became more and more restrictive for spouses, and 
gave rise at the same time to attitudes that were more and 
more favorable—as if the more it demanded, the more attrac¬ 
tive it became. It appears that marriage became more general 
as a practice, more public as an institution, more private as a 
mode of existence—a stronger force for binding conjugal part¬ 
ners and hence a more effective one for isolating the couple in 
a field of other social relations. 

Obviously it is difficult to measure accurately the scope of 
this phenomenon. The available documentation covers only a 
few privileged geographic areas, and it throws light only on 
certain strata of the population. It would be speculation to 
make it into a universal and massive movement, even though, 
notwithstanding their lacunary and scattered character, the 
indications are rather convergent. In any case, if we are to give 
credence to the other texts from the first centuries of our era, 
marriage appears to have become—for men, that is, since we 



78 


The Care of the Self 


have only their testimony—a focus of experiences that were 
more important, more intense, but also more difficult and 
more problematic. And by marriage what is meant is not just 
the institution that is useful to the family or the city, or the 
domestic activity that is carried out in the context and accord¬ 
ing to the rules of a good household, but also the “state” of 
marriage as a form of living, a shared existence, a personal 
bond, and a respective position of the partners in this relation¬ 
ship. It is not, as we have seen, that matrimonial life according 
to the old schema excluded closeness and feeling between 
spouses. But it does seem that in the ideal set forth by Xeno¬ 
phon these feelings were tied directly (which did not rule out 
serious commitment or intensity) to the exercise of the hus¬ 
band’s status and to the authority granted to him. Rather 
paternal toward his young wife, Ischomachus patiently taught 
her what she had to do; and to the degree that she performed 
well in the role that went with her duties as mistress of the 
household, he had a respect and an affection for her that 
would not diminish to the end of their days. In the literature 
of the imperial epoch, one finds testimonies to a far more 
complex experience of marriage; and the search for an ethics 
of “conjugal honor” is clearly manifested in the reflection on 
the role of the husband, on the nature and form of the bond 
that attached him to his wife, on the interplay between a 
superiority at once natural and statutory and an affection that 
could extend to the point of need and dependence. 

It might be useful, then, to look at the image that Pliny, in 
certain of his letters, gives of himself as a “conjugal individ¬ 
ual,” and compare it with the portrait of that other good 
husband, Ischomachus. Thus, in the famous letter he ad¬ 
dresses to his wife bemoaning her absence, what is shown is 
not simply, as in other letters, a man who calls his admiring 
and docile spouse to witness his literary labors and his suc¬ 
cesses as a tribune; it is a man who feels an intense attachment 
to his wife and a physical desire so strong that he cannot keep 
from looking for her night and day even though she is no 
longer there: “You cannot believe how much I miss you. I love 



Self and Others 


79 


you so much, and we are not used to separations. So I stay 
awake most of the night thinking of you, and by day I find my 
feet carrying me (a true word, carrying) to your room at the 
times I usually visited you; then finding it empty I depart, as 
sick and sorrowful as a lover locked out. The only time I am 
free of this misery is when I am in court and wearing myself 
out with my friends’ lawsuits. You can judge then what a life 
I am leading, when I find my rest in work and distraction in 
troubles and anxiety .” 15 The formulas of this letter merit our 
attention. The specific character of a personal, intense, and 
affective conjugal relationship, which does not depend on sta¬ 
tus, marital authority, or household responsibility, is clearly 
evident. Love is carefully differentiated from the habitual 
sharing of existence, even if both rightfully contribute to mak¬ 
ing the presence of the wife precious and her absence painful. 
Moreover, Pliny avails himself of several of the traditionally 
acknowledged signs of amorous passion: the images that 
haunt the night, the involuntary comings and goings, the 
search for the lost object. Now, these behaviors that belong to 
the classic and negative image of passion are presented in a 
positive light; or rather, the husband’s suffering, the passion¬ 
ate movement in which he is taken up, the fact that he is ruled 
by his desire and his sorrow are offered as positive tokens of 
conjugal affection. Finally, between matrimonial life and pub¬ 
lic activity, Pliny suggests, not a common principle unifying 
the government of the household and authority over others, 
but a complex process of substitution and compensation: fail¬ 
ing to find at home the happiness that his wife provided him, 
he immerses himself in public affairs. But the hurt he feels 
must be extreme for him to find comfort for his private sor¬ 
rows in the worries of this external life. 

In many other texts as well, one sees the relation between 
husband and wife detach itself from matrimonial functions, 
from the status-determined authority of the husband and the 
reasonable government of the household, and take on the 
character of a singular relation having its own force, its own 
difficulties, obligations, benefits, and pleasures. One could cite 



80 


The Care of the Self 


other letters of Pliny and point to other indications of this in 
Lucian or Tacitus. One could also refer to the conjugal love 
poetry that is exemplified in Statius. There the state of mar¬ 
riage appears as the merging of two destinies in an undying 
passion wherein the husband recognizes his emotional bond¬ 
age: “For it is you—you, whom Venus of her grace united to 
me in the springtime of my days, and in old age keeps mine; 
you, who while I yet roved in youth nor knew nothing of love 
did transfix my heart. You it is whose rein in willing submis¬ 
sion [libens et docilis] I obeyed, and yet press the bit once put 
within my mouth, without ever thought of change. . . . This 
land bore me for you [creavit me tibi ], and bound me to you 
in partnership forever .” 16 

Of course it is not in texts like these that one should look 
for a representation of what matrimonial life may have really 
been like in the period of the Empire. The sincerity they 
display does not have the value of evidence. They are texts that 
go out of their way to proclaim an ideal of conjugality. They 
should be taken not as the reflection of a situation, but as the 
formulation of an exigency, and it is precisely on this account 
that they form part of reality. They show that marriage was 
interrogated as a mode of life whose value was not exclusively, 
nor perhaps even essentially, linked to the functioning of the 
oikos, but rather to a mode of relation between two partners. 
They also show that, in this linkage, the man had to regulate 
his conduct, not simply by virtue of status, privileges, and 
domestic functions, but also by virtue of a “relational role” 
with regard to his wife. Finally, they show not only that this 
role was a governmental function of training, education, and 
guidance, but that it was involved in a complex interplay of 
affective reciprocity and reciprocal dependence. Now, while it 
is true that moral reflection on proper conduct in marriage 
had long sought its principles in an analysis of the “house¬ 
hold” and its intrinsic necessities, one sees how a new type of 
problem emerged, where it was a matter of defining the way 
in which the husband would be able to form himself as an 
ethical subject within the relation of conjugality.

The Political 
Game 


The decline of city-states as autonomous entities starting in 
the third century B.c. is a well-known fact. It is often seen as 
evidence of a general withdrawal from political life in a place 
where civic activities had constituted for citizens a true voca¬ 
tion. It is given as the reason for the decadence of the tradi¬ 
tionally dominant classes. And its consequences are sought in 
a movement of retreat into the self by which the representa¬ 
tives of these privileged groups would have transformed this 
real loss of authority into a voluntary retirement, attributing 
in this way more and more value to personal existence and 
private life. “The collapse of the city-state was inescapable. On 
the whole, people felt themselves in the grip of world powers 
which they could not control or even affect. . . . Chance ruled. 
. . . The philosophies of the Hellenistic Age, for all their 
nobility, were essentially philosophies of escape, and the prin¬ 
cipal means of escape lay in the cultivation of autarky .” 1 

While the city-states—where they existed—did lose, from 
the third century on, a portion of their autonomy, it would 
clearly be questionable to reduce the structural transforma¬ 
tions that took place in the political domain, during the Helle¬ 
nistic and Roman epochs, essentially to that phenomenon. It 
would also be inadequate to search there for the main explana¬ 
tory principle behind the changes that occurred in moral re¬ 
flection and in the practice of the self. In actual fact—and on 
this point one must refer to the work of historians who have 

81 



82 


The Care of the Self 


gone a long way toward dismantling the great nostalgic figure 
of the city-state that the nineteenth century took pains to 
construct—the organization of the Hellenistic monarchies, 
then that of the Roman Empire, cannot be analyzed simply in 
the negative terms of a decline of civic life and a confiscation 
of power by state authorities operating from further and fur¬ 
ther away. It needs to be emphasized, on the contrary, that 
local political activity was not stifled by the establishment and 
strengthening of those great overarching structures. City life, 
with its institutional rules, its interests at stake, its struggles, 
did not disappear as a result of the widening of the context in 
which it was inscribed, nor as a consequence of the develop¬ 
ment of a monarchical type of power. Apprehension before a 
universe become too vast and having lost its constituent com¬ 
munities could well be a feeling that has been imputed retro¬ 
spectively to the people of the Greco-Roman world. The 
Greeks of the Hellenistic period did not have to flee from “the 
cityless world of the great empires” for the very good reason 
that “Hellenism was a world of cities.” Furthermore, criticiz¬ 
ing the idea that philosophy constituted, after the collapse of 
the system of cities, “a shelter from the storm,” F. H. Sand- 
bach observes that, in the first place, “the city-state had never 
given security,” and second, “it remained the standard pri¬ 
mary form of social organization even after military power 
had passed into the hands of the great monarchies .” 2 

Rather than imagining a reduction or cessation of political 
activities through the effects of a centralized imperialism, one 
should think in terms of the organization of a complex space. 
Much vaster, much more discontinuous, much less closed 
than must have been the case for the small city-states, it was 
also more flexible, more differentiated, less rigidly hierarch¬ 
ized than would be the authoritarian and bureaucratic Empire 
that people would attempt to organize after the great crisis of 
the third century. It was a space in which the centers of power 
were multiple; in which the activities, the tensions, the con¬ 
flicts were numerous; in which they developed in several di¬ 
mensions; and in which the equilibria were obtained through 



Self and Others 


83 


a variety of transactions. It is a fact, at any rate, that the 
Hellenistic monarchies sought much less to suppress, curb, or 
even completely reorganize the local powers than to lean on 
them and use them as intermediaries and relays for the levy 
of regular tributes, for the collection of extraordinary taxes, 
and for supplying what was necessary to the armies . 3 It is a 
fact as well that by and large Roman imperialism tended to 
prefer solutions of this kind to the exercise of a direct adminis¬ 
tration. The policy of municipalization was a rather constant 
line, whose effect was to stimulate the political life of the cities 
within the larger framework of the Empire . 4 While the speech 
Dio Cassius places in the mouth of Maecenas presents ana¬ 
chronisms with respect to the policy that had been recom¬ 
mended to Augustus and actually pursued by him, it 
nevertheless represents certain of the major tendencies of the 
imperial government in the course of the first two centuries: 
look for “assistants and allies,” persuade “those subjects 
under your rule that you are not treating them as slaves” but 
that you are making sure that they share advantages and 
authority, that “they live as it were in a single city .” 5 

Can one still speak, then, of a decline of the traditional 
aristocracies, of their political dispossession, of a consequent 
withdrawal into the self? There were economic and political 
factors of transformation, to be sure: the elimination of oppo¬ 
nents and confiscations of property played their part. There 
were also stabilizing factors: the importance of wealth in land 
and in holdings of estates , 6 or the fact that in societies of this 
kind, fortunes, influence, prestige, authority, and power were 
always interconnected. But the most important and determin¬ 
ing phenomenon for the new emphases of moral reflection did 
not relate to the disappearance of the traditionally dominant 
classes, but to the changes that could be observed in the condi¬ 
tions of the exercise of power. These changes concerned re¬ 
cruitment first of all, since it was a matter of addressing the 
needs of an administration that was both complex and exten¬ 
sive. Maecenas is supposed to have said as much to Augustus: 
the number of senators and knights must be increased to the 



84 


The Care of the Self 


extent necessary to govern at the right time and in the right 
way . 7 And we know that in fact these groups grew appreciably 
larger in the course of the first centuries a.d., even if they 
never constituted more than a tiny minority of the total popu¬ 
lation . 8 Changes also affected the role they were led to play 
and the position they occupied in the political game: with 
respect to the emperor, to his entourage, to his councilors, to 
his direct representatives; within the hierarchy, where compe¬ 
tition played a major part but in a different fashion from that 
found in agonistic societies; in the form of revocable offices 
which depended, often quite directly, on the pleasure of the 
prince; and nearly always in an intermediary position between 
a higher power whose orders must be conveyed or carried out, 
and individuals or groups whose obedience must be obtained. 
What the Roman administration needed was a “managerial 
aristocracy,” as R. Syme says, a service aristocracy, which 
would furnish the different kinds of agents necessary to “ad¬ 
minister the world”: “officers in the army, financial procura¬ 
tors, and senatorial governors of provinces .” 9 

And if one wishes to understand the interest that was di¬ 
rected in these elites to personal ethics, to the morality of 
everyday conduct, private life, and pleasure, it is not all that 
pertinent to speak of decadence, frustration, and sullen re¬ 
treat. Instead, one should see in this interest the search for a 
new way of conceiving the relationship that one ought to have 
with one’s status, one’s functions, one’s activities, and one’s 
obligations. Whereas formerly ethics implied a close connec¬ 
tion between power over oneself and power over others, and 
therefore had to refer to an aesthetics of life that accorded with 
one’s status, the new rules of the political game made it more 
difficult to define the relations between what one was, what 
one could do, and what one was expected to accomplish. The 
formation of oneself as the ethical subject of one’s own actions 
became more problematic. 

R. MacMullen has underscored two essential features of 
Roman society: the public character of existence and the very 
pronounced “verticality” of differences in a world where the 



Self and Others 


85 


gulf separating the very small number of wealthy people and 
the very large mass of poor people did not cease to widen . 10 
One understands the importance attributed, at the intersection 
of these two traits, to status differences, to their hierarchy, to 
their visible signs, to their careful and ostentatious staging . 11 
We may suppose that starting from the moment when new 
conditions of political life modified the relations between sta¬ 
tus, functions, powers, and duties, two opposite phenomena 
occurred. One discovers them in fact—and in their very oppo¬ 
sition—as early as the beginning of the imperial epoch. On the 
one hand, there is an accentuation of everything that allows 
the individual to define his identity in accordance with his 
status and with the elements that manifest it in the most visible 
way. One seeks to make oneself as adequate as possible to 
one’s own status by means of a set of signs and marks pertain¬ 
ing to physical bearing, clothing and accommodations, ges¬ 
tures of generosity and munificence, spending behavior, and so 
on. With regard to these behaviors by which one affirms one¬ 
self in the superiority one manifests over others, MacMullen 
has shown how common they were in the Roman aristocracy 
and the degree of exaggeration to which they could be carried. 
But at the opposite extreme one finds the attitude that con¬ 
sists, on the contrary, in defining what one is purely in relation 
to oneself. It is then a matter of forming and recognizing 
oneself as the subject of one’s own actions, not through a 
system of signs denoting power over others, but through a 
relation that depends as little as possible on status and its 
external forms, for this relation is fulfilled in the sovereignty 
that one exercises over oneself. To the new forms of the politi¬ 
cal game, and to the difficulties of conceiving oneself as an 
acting subject placed between birth and functions, tasks and 
rights, prerogatives and subordinations, one was able to re¬ 
spond by intensifying all the recognizable marks of status or 
by seeking an adequate relationship with oneself. 

These two attitudes were often perceived and described in 
strict opposition to one another. Seneca offers an example of 
this: “What we have to seek for then, is that which does not 



86 


The Care of the Self 


each day pass more and more under the control of some power 
which cannot be withstood. And what is this? It is the soul— 
but the soul that is upright, good, and great. What else should 
you call such a soul than a god dwelling as a guest in a human 
body? A soul like this may descend into a Roman knight just 
as well as into a freedman’s son or a slave. For what is a 
Roman knight or a freedman’s son or a slave? They are mere 
titles, born of ambition or of wrong. One may leap to heaven 
from a slum. Rise then .” 12 It is this way of being, too, which 
Epictetus endorses in opposing it to that of an imagined or real 
interlocutor: “You make it your concern how to live in a 
palace, how slaves and freedmen are to serve you, how you are 
to wear conspicuous raiment, how you are to have a multitude 
of huntsmen, minstrels, players. Do I lay claim to any of 
these? But you, for your part, have you concerned yourself 
with judgments? Have you concerned yourself with your own 
rational self ?” 13 

The importance assumed by the theme of the return to 
oneself or of the attention that must be given to oneself, in 
Hellenistic and Roman thought, is often interpreted as the 
alternative that was offered to civic activity and political re¬ 
sponsibilities. It is true that in certain philosophical currents 
one finds the recommendation to turn aside from public 
affairs, from the troubles and passions to which they give rise. 
But it is not in this choice between participation and absten¬ 
tion that the principal line of division lies; and it is not in 
opposition to the active life that the cultivation of the self 
places its own values and practices. It is much more concerned 
to define the principle of a relation to self that will make it 
possible to set the forms and conditions in which political 
action, participation in the offices of power, the exercise of a 
function, will be possible or not possible, acceptable or neces¬ 
sary. The important political transformations that took place 
in the Hellenistic and Roman world may have induced certain 
withdrawal behaviors. But, above all, they brought about, in 
a much more general and essential way, a problematization of 
political activity. It can be characterized briefly as follows. 



Self and Others 


87 


1. A relatmzation. In the new political game, the exercise 
of power is relativized in two ways. First, even if by one’s birth 
one is marked out for public offices, one no longer identifies 
sufficiently with one’s status to consider it a foregone conclu¬ 
sion that one will accept such responsibilities; or in any case, 
if many reasons, and the best of reasons, incline one toward 
public and political life, it is good to enter it precisely for those 
reasons and as a consequence of a personal act of choice. The 
treatise Plutarch addresses to the young Menemachus is char¬ 
acteristic in this regard. He condemns the attitude that would 
make politics into an occasional activity, but he refuses to 
treat it as the necessary and natural consequence of a status. 
One must not, he says, regard political activity as a sort of 
pastime (schole) in which one would engage because one has 
nothing else to do and because circumstances are favorable, 
only to abandon it when difficulties arise. 14 Politics is “a life” 
and a “practice” (bios kai praxis). 15 But one cannot devote 
oneself to it except by a free and deliberate choice. (Here 
Plutarch employs the technical expression of the Stoics: 
proairesis. ) And this choice must be based on judgment and 
reason (krisis kai logos): 16 only in this way can one deal firmly 
with the problems that may be posed. The exercise of political 
activity is indeed a “life,” implying a personal and lasting 
commitment. But the foundation, the link between oneself and 
political activity, that which establishes the individual as a 
political actor, is not—or not merely—his status; it is, in the 
general context defined by his birth and his standing, a per¬ 
sonal act. 

But one can also speak of relativization in another sense. 
Short of being the prince himself, one exercises power within 
a network in which one occupies a key position. In a certain 
way, one is always the ruler and the ruled. Aristotle, in the 
Politics, also evoked this game, but in the form of an alterna¬ 
tion or rotation: one is now the ruler, now the ruled. 17 On the 
other hand, in the fact that a man is one and the other at the 
same time, through an interplay of directions sent and re¬ 
ceived, of checks, of appeals of decisions taken, Aristides sees 



88 


The Care of the Self 


the very principle of good government. 18 Seneca, in the preface 
of Book IV of the Natural Questions, speaks of this “interme¬ 
diary” situation of the high Roman official. He reminds 
Lucilius that the power he has to exercise in Sicily is not a 
supreme authority, an imperium, but the delegated power of 
a procuratio, the limits of which must not be exceeded—which 
is, in his view, the condition for being able to take pleasure 
(delectare) in the exercise of such an office and to profit from 
the leisure time it might leave. 19 Plutarch presents the con¬ 
verse, as it were, of this situation. It is not enough that the 
young aristocrat to whom he addresses his advice is in the first 
rank among his own people: he must also relate to the “rulers” 
—hegemones —that is, to the Romans. Plutarch criticizes 
those who, in order better to establish their power in their own 
city, show servility in their dealings with the representatives 
of the imperial administration. He counsels Menemachus to 
carry out the necessary duties with respect to them and to 
form such friendships with them as are useful, but never to 
humiliate his native land or be anxious to ask for authoriza¬ 
tion apropos of everything. 20 Anyone who exercises power has 
to place himself in a field of complex relations where he occu¬ 
pies a transition point. * His status may have placed him there; 
it is not this status, however, that determines the rules to 
follow and the limits to observe. 

2. Political activity and moral agent. It was one of the most 
constant themes of Greek political thought that a city could 
be happy and well governed only if its leaders were virtuous; 
and inversely, that a good constitution and wise laws were 
decisive factors for the right conduct of magistrates and citi¬ 
zens. The ruler’s virtue, in an entire line of political thought 
in the imperial epoch, is still regarded as necessary, but for 
somewhat different reasons. It is not as an expression or effect 
of the general harmony that this virtue is indispensable; but 
because, in the difficult art of ruling, amid so many obstacles, 

♦See also the passage in which Plutarch says that one must be able to entrust certain 
specific tasks to subordinates . 21 



Self and Others 


89 


the ruler will still have to be guided by his personal reason. 
It is in knowing how properly to conduct himself that he will 
be able to lead others properly. A man, says Dio of Prusa, who 
observes the law and equity, who is more courageous than 
common soldiers, who works more diligently than those who 
are under coercion, who refrains from any sort of sensual 
excess (obviously, it is a question of virtues that anyone might 
possess, but that need to be carried to a higher degree when 
one aims to govern)—such a man, who is not just good for 
himself but for others as well, has a daimon . 22 The rationality 
of the government of others is the same as the rationality of 
the government of oneself. This is what Plutarch explains in 
To an Uneducated Ruler: one will not be able to rule if one 
is not oneself ruled. Now, who then is to govern the ruler? The 
law, of course; it must not, however, be understood as the 
written law, but rather as reason, the logos, which lives in the 
soul of the ruler and must never abandon him. 23 

In a political space where the political structure of the city 
and the laws with which it is endowed have unquestionably 
lost some of their importance, although they have not ceased 
to exist for all that, and where the decisive elements reside 
more and more in men, in their decisions, in the manner in 
which they bring their authority to bear, in the wisdom they 
manifest in the interplay of equilibria and transactions, it 
appears that the art of governing oneself becomes a crucial 
political factor. We are aware of the importance assumed by 
the problem of the emperors’ virtue, of their private life, and 
of their ability to control their passions, which is seen as the 
guarantee that they will themselves be able to set a limit on 
the exercise of their political power. But this principle applies 
to anyone who governs: he must attend to himself, guide his 
own soul, establish his own ethos. 

It is in Marcus Aurelius that one finds the clearest formula¬ 
tion of an experience of political power that, on the one hand, 
takes the form of an occupation separate from status and, on 
the other, requires the careful practice of personal virtues. 
From the emperor Antoninus, in the briefest of the two por- 



90 


The Care of the Self 


traits he draws of him, Marcus Aurelius recalls that he re¬ 
ceived three lessons: first, not to identify with the political role 
that one plays (“see to it that you do not become Caesarized, 
or dyed with that coloring”); second, to practice the virtues 
in their most general forms (“treasure simplicity, goodness, 
purity, dignity, lack of affectation, justice, piety, kindliness, 
graciousness, and strength for your appropriate duties”); 
third, to hold to the precepts of philosophy such as that of 
revering the gods, protecting men, and being mindful of how 
short life is. 24 And when, at the beginning of the Meditations, 
Marcus Aurelius draws a more detailed portrait of Antoninus, 
which stands as a model for his own life, he shows how these 
same principles regulated his way of exercising power. By 
avoiding useless outbursts, satisfactions of vanity, transports 
of anger and violent displays, by eschewing everything in the 
way of vindictiveness and suspicion, by keeping flatterers 
away and giving access only to wise and frank counselors, 
Antoninus showed how he rejected the “Caesarean” mode of 
being. Through his practice of self-restraint (whether it was a 
matter of food, clothes, sleep, or boys), through the moderate 
use he made of the comforts of life, through the absence of 
agitation and the equanimity of his soul, and through the 
cultivation of friendships without inconstancy or passion, he 
trained himself in the art of sufficing to himself without losing 
his serenity. And it was in these conditions that the exercise 
of imperial responsibilities could appear as the practice of a 
serious occupation, and one that demanded a good deal of 
effort: examining matters closely, never leaving a dossier in¬ 
complete, not incurring useless expenses, carefully planning 
one’s projects and seeing them through. A whole elaboration 
of the self by oneself was necessary for these tasks, which 
would be accomplished all the better because one did not 
identify in an ostentatious way with the trappings of power. 

Epictetus, for his part, had set forth the principles that 
ought to guide an official—of relatively high rank—in the 
performance of his tasks. On the one hand, he must fulfill his 



Self and Others 


91 


obligations without regard to his personal life or interests: 
“You have been given a post in an imperial city, and not in 
some mean place; not for a short time, either, but you are a 
senator for life. Do you not know that a man in such a post 
has to give only a little attention to the affairs of his own 
household, but for most of his time has to be away, in com¬ 
mand, or under command, or serving some official, or in the 
field, or on the judge’s bench?” 25 But even though the magis¬ 
trate must leave aside his personal life and that which attaches 
him to it, it is his personal virtues as a reasonable man that 
will need to serve him as a guide and regulative principle in 
governing others. “Beating an ass,” explains Epictetus to an 
inspector of cities, “is not governing men. Govern us as ratio¬ 
nal beings by pointing out to us what is profitable, and we will 
follow you; point out what is unprofitable, and we will turn 
away from it. Bring us to admire and emulate you. . . . ‘Do 
this; do not do this; otherwise I will throw you in prison.’ Say 
that and you cease to be a government as over rational beings. 
No, rather say, ‘As Zeus has ordained, do this; if you do not 
do so, you will be punished, you will suffer injury. What kind 
of injury? No injury but that of not doing what you ought.’ ” 26 
It is the modality of a rational being and not the qualification 
of a status that establishes and ought to determine, in their 
concrete form, relations between the governors and the gov¬ 
erned. 

Such a modeling of political work—whether it concerned 
the emperor or a man who exercised an ordinary responsibility 
—shows clearly how these forms of activity became detached 
from status and appeared as a function to fill; but—and this 
is not the least important consideration—that function was 
not defined in terms of laws belonging to an art of governing 
others, as if it were a question of a “profession” with its 
particular skills and techniques. It was to be exercised on the 
basis of the individual’s “retreat within himself”; that is, it 
depended on the relationship he established with himself 
in the ethical work of the self on the self. Plutarch says this

The Care of the Self 


to the prince who is not yet educated: as soon as he takes 
power, the man who governs must “set his soul straight” and 
properly establish his own ethos . 27 

3. Political activity and personal destiny. The precarious¬ 
ness of good fortune—too much success provokes the jealousy 
of the gods, or the people are fond of withdrawing favors they 
once granted—was clearly a traditional theme of meditation. 
In reflection on political activity, during the first centuries of 
the Empire, this precariousness inherent in the exercise of 
power is associated with two other themes. First, it is per¬ 
ceived as being linked to the dependence that one experiences 
in relation to others. It is not so much the particular cycle of 
good and bad fortune that explains this fragility, but the fact 
that one is placed under what Seneca calls the potentia aliena 
or the vis potentioris. 28 In the complex network of power, one 
is never alone facing one’s enemies. One is exposed on all sides 
to influences, intrigues, conspiracies, losses of favor. To be 
secure, one will have to be careful not to “give offence. It is 
sometimes the people that we ought to fear; or sometimes a 
body of influential oligarchs in the Senate . . . and sometimes 
individuals equipped with power by the people and against the 
people. It is burdensome to keep the friendship of all such 
persons; it is enough not to make enemies of them.” Between 
the prince, the Senate, and the populace giving and taking 
away their favors according to circumstances, the exercise of 
power depends on an unstable conjuncture: “You have held 
the highest offices; but have you held any as great, as unlooked 
for, as comprehensive as those of Sejanus? Yet on the day on 
which the Senate played the escort, the people tore him to 
pieces! Of the man who had heaped upon him all that gods and 
men were able to bestow, nothing was left for the executioner 
to drag to the river!” 29 

For these reversals and for the anxiety that they cause, one 
must prepare oneself by setting a prior limit on the ambitions 
that one entertains: “Nothing can free us from these mental 
waverings so effectively as always to establish some limit to 



Self and Others 


93 


advancement and not leave to Fortune the decision of when 
it shall end, but halt of our own accord.” 30 And if the occasion 
presents itself, it is good to withdraw from these activities 
when they become disturbing and prevent one from attending 
to oneself. If misfortune suddenly strikes, if one falls from 
favor and is exiled, one ought to tell oneself—this is the advice 
Plutarch addresses no doubt to the same Menemachus whom 
he had encouraged, several years before, to enter politics “by 
free choice”*—that one is finally free from obedience to gover¬ 
nors, from liturgies that are too costly, from services to render, 
from ambassadorial missions to accomplish, and from taxes to 
pay. 31 And to Lucilius, who is not under any threat, however, 
Seneca gives the advice to disengage himself from his duties, 
gradually and at the right time, just as Epicurus counseled, so 
as to be able to place himself at his own disposal. 32 

The basic attitude that one must have toward political activ¬ 
ity was related to the general principle that whatever one is, 
it is not owing to the rank one holds, to the responsibility one 
exercises, to the position in which one finds oneself—above or 
beneath other people. What one is, and what one needs to 
devote one’s attention to as to an ultimate purpose, is the 
expression of a principle that is singular in its manifestation 
within each person, but universal by the form it assumes in 
everyone, and collective by the community bond it establishes 
between individuals. Such is, at least for the Stoics, human 
reason as a divine principle present in all of us. Now, this god, 
“a guest in a mortal body,” can be found in the form or a 
Roman knight as well as in the body of a freedman or a slave. 
From the viewpoint of the relation to the self, the social and 
political identifications do not function as authentic marks of 
a mode of being; they are extrinsic, artificial, and unfounded 
signs. How could one be a Roman knight, a freedman, a slave? 
These were names that one used, born of pride and injustice. 33 
“Each man acquires his character for himself, but accident 
assigns his duties.” 34 It was according to this law, therefore, 

*The treatise on exile is thought to be addressed to the same personage as the 
Praecepta gerendae reipubticae.

The Care of the Self 


that one would have to assume responsibilities, and that one 
would need to rid oneself of them. 

Clearly, then, it would not be adequate to say that political 
activities, in moral reflection, were conceived primarily in the 
form of a simple alternative: to participate or to abstain. It is 
true that the question was framed in such terms rather often. 
But this alternative itself derived from a more general prob- 
lematization. The latter concerned the manner in which one 
ought to form oneself as an ethical subject in the entire sphere 
of social, political, and civic activities. It concerned how one 
determined which of these activities were obligatory or op¬ 
tional, natural or conventional, permanent or provisional, un¬ 
conditional or recommended only under certain conditions. It 
also concerned the rules that must be applied when one en¬ 
gaged in them, and the way in which one ought to govern 
oneself in order to take one’s place among others, assert one’s 
legitimate share of authority, and in general situate oneself in 
the complex and shifting interplay of relations of command 
and subordination. The question of the choice between retreat 
and activity was indeed posed in a recurrent fashion. But the 
terms in which it was posed and the solution so often given 
to it show very well that it was not purely and simply a matter 
of translating a general waning of political activity into an 
ethics of withdrawal. It was a matter of elaborating an ethics 
that enabled one to constitute oneself as an ethical subject with 
respect to these social, civic, and political activities, in the 
different forms they might take and at whatever distance one 
remained from them. 

In view of these changes in matrimonial practice and in the 
political game, one can see how the conditions under which 
the traditional ethics of self-mastery asserted itself were trans¬ 
formed. Self-mastery had implied a close connection between 
the superiority one exercised over oneself, the authority one 
exercised in the context of the household, and the power one 
exercised in the field of an agonistic society. It was the practice 
of superiority over oneself that guaranteed the moderate and 



Self and Others 95 

reasonable use that one could and ought to make of the two 
other superiorities. 

Henceforth one was in a world where these relations could 
no longer operate in the same way: the relation of superiority 
exercised in the household and over the wife had to be as¬ 
sociated with certain forms of reciprocity and equality. As for 
the agonistic game by which one sought to manifest and en¬ 
sure one’s superiority over others, it had to be integrated into 
a far more extensive and complex field of power relations. 
Consequently, the principle of superiority over the self as the 
ethical core, the general form of “heautocratism,” needed to 
be restructured. Not that it disappeared; but it had to make 
room for a certain balance between inequality and reciprocity 
in married life. In social, civic, and political life, it had to bring 
a certain dissociation into play between power over the self 
and power over others. The importance given to the problem 
of “oneself,” the development of the cultivation of the self in 
the course of the Hellenistic period, and the apogee it ex¬ 
perienced at the beginning of the Empire manifested this effort 
of reelaboration of an ethics of self-mastery. The reflection on 
the use of pleasure that was so directly linked to the close 
correlation between the three types of authority (over oneself, 
over the household, and over others) was modified in the very 
course of this elaboration. A growth of public constraints and 
prohibitions? An individualistic withdrawal accompanying 
the valorization of private life? We need instead to think in 
terms of a crisis of the subject, or rather a crisis of subjectiva- 
tion—that is, in terms of a difficulty in the manner in which 
the individual could form himself as the ethical subject of his 
actions, and efforts to find in devotion to self that which could 
enable him to submit to rules and give a purpose to his exis¬ 
tence. 



PART FOUR 

The Body 




It has often been remarked how intense and prevalent was 
the taste for things medical in the period of the Flavians and 
the Antonines. Medicine was widely recognized as a practice 
that was of interest to the public . 1 It was also recognized as 
a high form of culture, on the same level as rhetoric and 
philosophy. G. W. Bowersock observes that the medical 
model accompanied the development of the Second Sophistic 
and that a number of important rhetors had received medical 
training or manifested interests in that field. 2 * It had long been 
established that philosophy was closely related to medicine, 
even though the demarcation of boundaries posed doctrinal 
problems and gave rise to territorial rivalries. In the first lines 
of Advice about Keeping Well, Plutarch echoes these debates: 
the physician is wrong, he says, when he claims to be able to 
do without philosophy, and one would be quite mistaken to 
reproach philosophers with crossing their own boundaries 
when they concern themselves with health and its regimen. 
One must consider, Plutarch concludes, that medicine is in no 
way inferior to the liberal arts (eleutherai technai) in elegance, 
distinction, and the satisfaction it yields. To those who study 
it, it gives access to a knowledge of great importance since it 
concerns health and the preservation of life . 4 

Thus, medicine was not conceived simply as a technique of 

*Celsus, in his treatise De Medicina, explains the birth of medicine by the develop¬ 
ment of the litterarum disciplina . 1 


99

The Care of the Self 


intervention, relying, in cases of illness, on remedies and oper¬ 
ations. It was also supposed to define, in the form of a corpus 
of knowledge and rules, a way of living, a reflective mode of 
relation to oneself, to one’s body, to food, to wakefulness and 
sleep, to the various activities, and to the environment. Medi¬ 
cine was expected to propose, in the form of regimen, a volun¬ 
tary and rational structure of conduct. One of the points of 
discussion related to the degree and form of dependence that 
this medically informed life ought to manifest with regard to 
the authority of physicians. The way in which the latter some¬ 
times took control of their clients’ existence in order to man¬ 
age it in the least detail was an object of criticism, for the same 
reasons as was the spiritual direction practiced by philoso¬ 
phers. And Celsus, as convinced as he was of the high value 
of regimen medicine, was against subjecting oneself to a physi¬ 
cian if one was in good health.* The literature of regimen was 
meant to ensure this self-reliance. It was in order to avoid 
too-frequent consultations—because they were not always 
possible and they were often not desirable—that it was neces¬ 
sary to equip oneself with a medical knowledge that one could 
always use. Such is the advice that Athenaeus gives: acquire 
when young sufficient knowledge to be able, throughout one’s 
life and in ordinary circumstances, to be one’s own health 
counselor. “It is advisable, or rather, necessary, for everyone 
to learn, among the subjects that are taught, not only the other 
sciences but also medicine, and to hear the precepts of this art, 
so that we may often be our own accomplished counselors in 
matters useful to health; for there is almost no moment of the 
night or the day when we have no need of medicine. Thus, 
whether we are walking or sitting, whether we are oiling our 
body or taking a bath, whether we are eating, drinking—in a 
word, whatever we may do, during the whole course of life and 

•Celsus, in the preface of his treatise De Medicina, distinguishes one kind of medicine 
by regimen (victu), another by medicaments (medicamentis). and a third by opera¬ 
tions (manu). Those who teach the first, “by far the most famous authorities, endeav¬ 
oring to go more deeply into things, claim for themselves a knowledge of nature.” 
This did not mean that a man in good health needed to subject himself to the 
physicians’ authority . 5 



The Body 


101 


in the midst of life’s diverse occupations, we have need of 
advice for an employment of this life that is worthwhile and 
free of inconvenience. Now, it is tiresome and impossible al¬ 
ways to consult a physician concerning all these details .” 6 One 
easily recognizes in this passage one of the basic principles of 
the practice of the self: be equipped with, have ready to hand, 
a “helpful discourse,” which one has learned very early, re¬ 
hearses often, and reflects on regularly. The medical logos was 
one such discourse, dictating at every moment the correct 
regimen of life. 

A reasonable discourse could not unfold without a “health 
practice ”—hygieinepragmateia or techne —which constituted 
the permanent framework of everyday life, as it were, making 
it possible to know at every moment what was to be done and 
how to do it. It implied a medical perception of the world, so 
to speak, or at least a medical perception of the space and 
circumstances in which one lived. The elements of the milieu 
were perceived as having positive or negative effects on health. 
Between the individual and his environs, one imagined a 
whole web of interferences such that a certain disposition, a 
certain event, a certain change in things would induce morbid 
effects in the body. Conversely, a certain weak constitution of 
the body would be favorably or unfavorably affected by such 
and such a circumstance. Hence there was a constant and 
detailed problematization of the environment, a differential 
valuation of this environment with regard to the body, and a 
positing of the body as a fragile entity in relation to its sur¬ 
roundings. One can cite as an example the analysis submitted 
by Antyllus of the different medical “variables” of a house, its 
architecture, its orientation, and its interior design. Each ele¬ 
ment is assigned a dietetic or therapeutic value; a house is a 
series of compartments that will be harmful or beneficial as 
regards possible illnesses. Rooms on the ground floor are good 
for acute illnesses, hemoptyses, and headaches; upper-floor 
rooms are favorable in cases of pituitary illnesses; rooms with 
a southerly exposure are good except for patients who need 



102 


The Care of the Self 


cooling; westerly facing rooms are bad, in the morning be¬ 
cause they are gloomy, in the evening because they provoke 
headaches; whitewashed walls are too dazzling, painted walls 
cause nightmares in those who are delirious due to fever; stone 
walls are too cold, brick walls are better . 7 

The different periods of time—days, seasons, ages—are 
also, in the same perspective, bearers of varying medical val¬ 
ues. A careful regimen must be able to determine precisely the 
relations between the calendar and the care that needs to be 
given to oneself. This is the advice that Athenaeus offers for 
confronting the winter season: in the city as well as in the 
house, one should wear thick clothing, “one should breathe 
while keeping a part of one’s garment in front of the mouth.” 
As for food, one should choose food that “can heat the parts 
of the body and dissolve the liquids that have been congealed 
by the cold. Drinks should consist of hydromel, honeyed wine, 
and white wine, old and sweet-smelling; in general, they 
should be substances capable of drawing out all the excess 
moisture; but one should reduce the quantity of drink. The dry 
foods should be easy to prepare, thoroughly worked, well- 
cooked, pure, and should be mixed with fennel and ammi. For 
pot vegetables, one should eat cabbage, asparagus, leeks, 
boiled tender onions and boiled horseradish; as concerns fish, 
rockfish are good, for they are easily assimilated by the body. 
In the meat category, one should eat poultry and, among the 
other kinds, young goat and young pork. As concerns sauces, 
those that are prepared with pepper, mustard, winter cress, 
garum, and vinegar. One should take up moderately strenuous 
exercise, practice holding one’s breath, and undergo rather 
vigorous rubdowns, especially those that one applies to oneself 
by the fireside. It is also good to resort to hot baths, whether 
these be taken in the bathing pool or in a small bathtub, etc .” 8 
And the summer regimen is no less meticulous. 

This preoccupation with the environment, with places and 
times, called for a constant attention to oneself, to the state 
one was in and to the acts that one performed. Addressing that 
category of people considered to be especially fragile, the city- 



The Body 


103 


dwellers, and above all, those who devote themselves to study 
(litterarum cupidi), Celsus prescribes a keen vigilance: if one 
has digested well, one should rise early; if one has digested 
poorly, one should continue to rest, and in case one is obliged 
to get up all the same, one should go back to sleep; and if no 
digestion has taken place, one should remain completely inac¬ 
tive, and “neither work nor take exercise nor attend to busi¬ 
ness.” One will know if one is in good health “if his morning 
urine is whitish, later reddish; the former indicates that diges¬ 
tion is going on, the latter that digestion is complete.” When 
one is kept busy all day by one’s affairs, one should neverthe¬ 
less set aside a little time for the curatio corporis. The exercises 
that should be practiced are “reading aloud, drill, handball, 
running, walking; but this is not by any means most useful on 
the level, since walking up and down hill varies the movement 
of the body, unless indeed the body is thoroughly weak; but 
it is better to walk in the open air than under cover; better, 
when the head allows it, in the sun than in the shade; better 
under the shade of a wall or of trees than under a roof; better 
a straight than a winding walk. . . . The proper sequel to 
exercise is: at times an anointing, whether in the sun or before 
a brazier; at times a bath, which should be in a chamber as 
lofty, well lighted and spacious as possible .” 9 

In a general way, all these themes of dietetics had remained 
remarkably continuous since the classical period. It is clear 
that the general principles stayed the same; at most, they were 
developed, given more detail, and refined. They suggested a 
tighter structuring of life, and they solicited a more constantly 
vigilant attention to the body. The evocations of their every¬ 
day life that one can find in the letters of Seneca or in the 
correspondence between Marcus Aurelius and Fronto testify 
to this mode of attention to the self and to one’s body. An 
intensification, much more than a radical change; an increase 
of apprehension and not a disparagement of the body; a 
change of scale in the elements to which one needed to direct 
one’s attention and not a different way of perceiving oneself 
as a physical individual. 



104 


The Care of the Self 


It was in this overall context, so strongly marked by con¬ 
cern for the body, health, environment, and circumstances, 
that medicine framed the question of sexual pleasures: the 
question of their nature and their mechanism, that of their 
positive and negative value for the organism, that of the regi¬ 
men to which they ought to be subjected . 10 



I 


Galen 


1. Galen’s analyses concerning the aphrodisia are situated 
within the ancient thematic of the relations between death, 
immortality, and reproduction. For him, as for a whole philo¬ 
sophical tradition, the necessity of the division of the sexes, the 
intensity of their mutual attraction, and the possibility of gen¬ 
eration are rooted in the lack of eternity. This is the general 
explanation given by the treatise On the Usefulness of the Parts 
of the Body. 1 Nature, doing her work, encountered an obsta¬ 
cle, a sort of intrinsic incompatibility in her task. Her plan, 
what she strove (espoudase) to do, was to construct an immor¬ 
tal work. But the substance she had to work with did not 
permit this; she could not make arteries, nerves, bones, and 
flesh using an “incorruptible” material. Galen discerns at the 
very core of the demiurgic work—the demiourgema —an in¬ 
ternal limit and a kind of “failure” due to an unavoidable 
inadequacy between the immortality that was planned and the 
corruptibility of the material used. The logos that builds the 
natural order is in a situation rather similar to that of the 
founder of a city: the latter may very well bring men together 
to form a community; however, the city will disappear, will 
fall into oblivion, if one does not discover how to make it 
endure beyond the death of its first citizens. A means is neces¬ 
sary to surmount this fundamental difficulty. Galen’s vocabu¬ 
lary is both insistent and significant. It is a question of finding 
an aid, of contriving a means (boetheia), of discovering an art 

105 



106 


The Care of the Self 


(techne), of using an enticement (delear), to ensure the salva¬ 
tion and protection of the species. In short, something inge¬ 
nious (sophisma) is needed. 2 To bring her work to its logical 
conclusion, the demiurge, in creating living beings and giving 
them a means to reproduce, had to perfect a ruse: a ruse of 
the logos that presides over the world, in order to overcome 
the unavoidable corruptibility of the material of which this 
very world is made. 

This ruse brings three elements into play. First, the organs 
that are given to all animals and are used for fertilization. 
Next, a capacity for pleasure that is extraordinary and “very 
keen.” Lastly, in the soul, the longing (epithumia) to make use 
of these organs—a marvelous, inexpressible (arrheton) desire. 
The “sophism” of sex does not therefore reside simply in a 
subtle anatomical arrangement and in carefully planned 
mechanisms; it also consists in their association with a plea¬ 
sure and a desire, the singular force of which is “even beyond 
words.” To overcome the incompatibility between her plan 
and the limitations of her materials, Nature had to place the 
principle of a force, an extraordinary dynamis, in the body 
and soul of the living creature. 

Hence the wisdom of the demiurgic principle, which, know¬ 
ing very well the substance of her work and consequently its 
limits, invented this mechanism of excitement—this “sting” of 
desire. (Here Galen repeats the traditional image, by which 
one spoke metaphorically of the uncontrolled vehemence of 
desire. 3 ) So that, experiencing this sting, even those animals 
that are incapable of understanding the purpose of Nature in 
her wisdom—because they are young, foolish (aphrona), or 
without reason (aloga) —do in fact accomplish it. 4 By their 
intensity the aphrodisia serve a rationality which those who 
engage in them do not even need to know. 

2. The physiology of sexual acts in Galen is still marked 
by some fundamental traits found in the earlier traditions. 

In the first place, there is the isomorphism of these acts in 
the man and the woman. For Galen, it rests on the principle 



The Body 


107 


of an identity of the anatomical apparatus in the two sexes: 
“Consider first whichever parts you please, turn outward the 
woman’s, turn inward, so to speak, and fold double the man’s, 
and you will find them the same in both in every respect.” 5 He 
assumes the emission of sperm by the woman as well as by the 
man, the difference being that the production of this humor 
is less perfect in the woman and less complete—which ex¬ 
plains its minor role in the formation of the embryo. 

One also finds in Galen the traditional model of the 
paroxysmal process of excretion that traverses the body, 
shakes it, and exhausts it. But the analysis he gives of this 
phenomenon deserves nonetheless to be examined. It has the 
double effect of linking, very closely, the mechanisms of the 
sexual act with the organism as a whole, while making it a 
process in which the individual’s health, and possibly his very 
life, is at risk. At the same time that it inserts the act into a 
dense and unbroken physiological web, it invests it with a high 
potential for danger. 

This is brought out very clearly in what we might call a 
“physiologization” of desire and pleasure. Chapter Nine of 
Book XIV of On the Usefulness of the Parts poses the question: 
“Why is a very great pleasure coupled with the exercise of the 
generative parts?” From the outset Galen rejects the idea that 
the vehemence of desire and the intensity of pleasure could 
simply have been associated with the sexual act by the will of 
the creating gods as a means of inciting men to its perform¬ 
ance. Galen does not deny that the demiurgic power so ar¬ 
ranged things that there would be that intensity which sweeps 
us along. He means that it was not added in the soul as a 
supplement, but that it was most certainly planned as an 
integral consequence of the mechanisms of the body. Desire 
and pleasure are direct effects of anatomical dispositions and 
physical processes. The final cause—which is the continuation 
of the generations—is pursued through a material cause and 
an organic arrangement: “For animals acquired this desire 
and pleasure not simply because the gods that formed us 
wished a vehement desire for love to be born in us or a vehe- 



108 


The Care of the Self 


ment pleasure to be coupled with it, but because a suitable 
material and instruments had been prepared for this pur¬ 
pose.” 6 Desire is not just a movement of the soul, nor is 
pleasure a reward added in as something extra. They are the 
effects of a pressure and a sudden evacuation. Galen sees 
several pleasure factors in this mechanism. First, there is the 
accumulation of a humor of such a nature that it provokes 
intense sensations in those parts where it collects. “It is the 
sort of thing that happens when serous humors are heated, as 
they frequently are, especially when acrid humors collect 
under the skin of the animal and then itch and make it scratch 
and enjoy the scratching.” 7 One must also take into account 
the heat that is particularly strong in the lower part, and 
singularly so on the right side because of the nearness of the 
liver and the large number of vessels that come from it. This 
dissymmetry with regard to heat explains the fact that boys 
are formed most frequently in the right uterus and girls in the 
left. 8 It also explains why the parts on the right side are more 
apt to be the locus of intense pleasure. In any case, Nature 
gave the organs of this area a special sensitivity, much greater 
than that of the skin, despite their having the same functions. 
Lastly, the much thinner humor coming from the glandular 
bodies Galen calls parastata constitutes an additional material 
factor of pleasure. This humor, by permeating the parts in¬ 
volved in the sexual act, makes them more elastic and height¬ 
ens the pleasure they experience. There is, then, a whole 
anatomical disposition and a whole physiological design that 
inscribe in the body and its specific mechanisms pleasure with 
its excessive vigor (hyperoche tes hedones), which cannot be 
resisted: it is amechanos . 9 

But even though the formation of pleasure is firmly an¬ 
chored and precisely localized in this way, it is no less true 
that, by virtue of the elements it brings into play and the 
consequences it entails, the sexual act involves the entire body. 
Galen does not hold, as does the Hippocratic author of De 
generation, that the sperm is formed by agitation occurring 
in the bloodstream; nor does he believe, as does Aristotle, that 



The Body 


109 


it constitutes the final state of digestion. In his view, it com¬ 
bines two elements: first, the product of a certain “coction” of 
the blood that is effected in the coils of the spermatic channels 
(it is this slow elaboration that gradually gives it its color and 
consistency); and second, the presence of the pneuma: it is the 
pneuma that swells the sexual organs, it is the pneuma that 
seeks to exit violently from the body and escapes in the sperm 
at the moment of ejaculation. Now, this pneuma is formed in 
the complex labyrinth of the brain. The sexual act, when it 
takes place and thus withdraws sperm and pneuma, acts on 
the general mechanism of the body, where all the elements are 
linked “as in a chorus.” And, “when, as a result of venereal 
excesses, all the sperm has been evacuated, the testicles draw 
from the veins above them all the seminal fluid which they 
contain. Now, this liquid is found there only in small quanti¬ 
ties, mixed with the blood in the form of dew.” These veins, 
“violently deprived of this fluid by the testicles, which have a 
more energetic action than they, in turn draw the liquid away 
from the veins situated above them, these draw it from the 
next ones, and the latter from those that are adjacent to them. 
This movement of attraction does not stop before the transfer 
has been propagated in all parts of the body.” And if this 
expenditure continues, the body is not simply deprived of its 
seminal fluid: “all the parts of the animal find themselves 
robbed of their vital breath.” 10 

3. We can thus understand the cluster of relations that are 
established in Galen’s thought between the sexual act and the 
phenomena of epilepsy and convulsions: relations of affinity, 
analogy, and causality. 

The sexual act belongs, by reason of its mechanism, to the 
large family of convulsions, the theory of which is given in the 
treatise On the Affected Parts . 11 In that work Galen analyzes 
the process of convulsion as being of the same nature as any 
other involuntary movement; the difference lies in the fact that 
the traction exerted by the nerve on the muscle does not 
originate in the will but in a certain condition of dryness 



110 


The Care of the Self 


(which draws the nerve tight, like a leather cord left in the sun) 
or repletion (which by swelling the nerves shortens them and 
pulls excessively on the muscles). It is to this last type of 
mechanism that the spasm peculiar to the sexual act is as¬ 
similated. 

In this large family of convulsions, Galen identifies a partic¬ 
ular analogy between epilepsy and the sexual act. For him, 
epilepsy is caused by a congestion of the brain, which finds 
itself completely filled by a thick humor: whence the obstruc¬ 
tion of the channels that leave the ventricles where the 
pneuma resides. The latter is therefore imprisoned by this 
accumulation and it tries to escape, just as it strains to get out 
when it has collected with the sperm in the testicles. It is this 
attempt that is the source of the agitation of the nerves and 
muscles that one can witness, with varying proportions, in 
epileptic seizures or in the performance of the aphrodisia. 

Finally, there is, between the aphrodisia and convulsive 
attacks, a relation of causality that can be established in either 
direction. The epileptic convulsion can lead to a spasm in the 
sexual organs: “From severe attacks of epilepsy,” says Galen 
in the treatise On the Usefulness of the Parts, “and from the 
disease called gonorrhea you may learn how great a power the 
spasm, so to speak, of the parts that accompanies the sexual 
act has to expel what they contain. For in violent attacks of 
epilepsy semen is expelled because the whole body and with 
it the generative parts are strongly convulsed.” 12 Conversely, 
indulgence in the sexual pleasures at the wrong time can in¬ 
duce illnesses of the convulsive type by causing a gradual 
drying and an ever greater tension of the nerves. 

In the great edifice of Galenic theory, the aphrodisia appear 
to be situated on three successive planes. First, they are firmly 
anchored in the order of demiurgic providence: they were 
conceived and positioned at that precise point where the crea¬ 
tor’s wisdom came to the rescue of her power, in order to 
transcend the limits she encountered in death. Second, they 
are placed within an interplay of complex and constant corre- 



The Body 


111 


lations with the body, both by the precise anatomical location 
of their processes and by the effects they produce in the overall 
economy of the pneuma, which ensures the unity of the body. 
Lastly, they are situated in a vast field of affinity with a group 
of diseases, within which they maintain relations of analogy 
and a relationship of cause to effect. A clearly visible thread 
extends, in Galen’s analyses, from a cosmology of reproduc¬ 
tion to a pathology of spasmodic excretions. And from the 
natural foundation of the aphrodisia, it leads to an analysis of 
the perilous mechanisms that constitute their intrinsic nature 
and associate them with dread diseases. 



2 


Are They Good? 
Are They Bad? 


This ambiguity in medical thought concerning the sexual 
pleasures is not peculiar to Galen, although it is more discern¬ 
ible in him than elsewhere. It characterizes the essential part 
of what remains of the medical texts of the first and second 
centuries. In reality it is an ambivalence rather than an ambi¬ 
guity, for what is involved is the interweaving of two antitheti¬ 
cal valuations. 

First, on the positive side, there is the valorization of semen, 
of sperm—that precious substance which Nature, when she 
designed the human body, took so many precautions in form¬ 
ing. It gathers up all that is powerful in life and transmits it, 
thereby enabling us to cheat death. It is in the male that it 
reaches its greatest strength and its highest perfection. And it 
is this substance that gives him his superiority. It contributes 
“to health, strength, courage, and generation.” 1 The male is 
preeminent because he is the spermatic animal par excellence. 

There is also a valorization of the act for which, in both 
sexes, the organs were so carefully arranged. Sexual union is 
a fact of nature; it cannot be considered bad. Rufus of Ephesus 
expresses a general opinion when he says that sexual inter¬ 
course is a natural act, and that consequently it cannot be 
harmful in itself. 2 

But in a sense it is only the possibility and the principle of 
the act that are validated in this way. For as soon as the act 
takes place, it is, in its unfolding, regarded as intrinsically 

112 



The Body 


113 


dangerous. Dangerous because it is a wasting of that precious 
substance whose accumulation nevertheless incites one to 
commit it—it allows all the life force that the semen has 
concentrated to escape. Dangerous, too, because its very un¬ 
folding makes it akin to a disease. Aretaeus had a meaningful 
phrase for this: the sexual act, he said, “bears the symbola ” of 
epilepsy. 3 Caelius Aurelianus compared, term by term, the 
unfolding of the sexual act and the development of an epileptic 
seizure, finding exactly the same phases in both: “various parts 
are subjected to spasms, and at the same time there occur 
panting, sweating, rolling of the eyes and flushing of the face, 
and finally a feeling of malaise along with pallor, weakness, or 
dejection.” 4 Such is the paradox of the sexual pleasures: the 
high function Nature assigned them, the value of the sub¬ 
stance they have to transmit and therefore lose—this is the 
very thing that relates them to sickness. The physicians of the 
first and second centuries were not the first nor the only ones 
to formulate this ambivalence. But around it, they described 
an entire pathology, more developed, more complex, and 
more systematic than that attested in the past. 

1. The pathology of sexual activity itself is constructed 
around two elements by which the dangers of the sexual act 
are usually characterized: an involuntary violence of tension 
and an indefinite, exhausting expenditure. 

On the one hand, there is the disease that is marked by a 
constant excitation, which restrains the act while indefinitely 
prolonging the mechanism of stimulation. In the male version 
of this kind of affliction—designated as satyriasis or priapism 
—all the mechanisms that prepare the sexual act and ejacula¬ 
tion (tensions, agitations, heatings) are brought together and 
maintained in a continuous fashion, whether or not there is an 
evacuation of sperm: a sexual erethism that is never resolved. 
The patient is in a state of constant convulsion, traversed by 
extreme attacks, which closely resemble epilepsy. Aretaeus’ 
description can serve as a testimony of the way in which 
people perceived this strange disease where the sexual act is 



114 


The Care of the Self 


as though left to itself in a timeless and boundless movement; 
its convulsive, epileptic nature is revealed there in the raw 
state, as it were: “It is a disease in which the patient has 
erection of the genital organ. ... It is an unrestrainable im¬ 
pulse to connection; but neither are they at all relieved by 
those embraces, nor is the tentigo soothed by many and re¬ 
peated acts of sexual intercourse. Spasms of all the nerves, and 
tension of all the tendons, groins, and perineum, inflammation 
and pain of the genital parts.” This constant state is punc¬ 
tuated by attacks. The patients then lose “all restraint of 
tongue as regards obscenity, and likewise all restraint in re¬ 
gard to the open performance of the act...; they vomit much 
phlegm. Afterwards, froth settles on their lips, as is the case 
with goats in the season of rutting, and the smell likewise is 
similar.” Their minds lapse into madness, and they do not 
come to their ordinary senses again until the paroxysm has 
ended. 5 Galen, in his treatise On the Affected Parts, gives a 
much more sober description of satyriasis: “Priapism is an 
increase in the length and circumference of the male genitalia 
without sexual desire and without the acquired increase in 
heat which some people experience in the recumbent position. 
Other physicians describe it in the following manner, which 
is a shorter definition: a persisting increase of the external 
genitals or a persisting swelling.” 6 The cause of this disease is 
to be understood, according to Galen, from the mechanisms 
of erection, which means that it will be found in “the dilated 
orifices of the arteries” or in “the formation of the pneuma in 
the nerve.” Actually, Galen allows for both causes and their 
convergence in the genesis of symptoms. But he is most often 
inclined to blame the dilation of arteries, which is, according 
to him, a phenomenon that occurs much more frequently than 
that involving the pneuma “in the cavernous nerve.” This 
kind of disease is found in those who “have too much sperm” 
and who, contrary to their usual habits, “abstain from inter¬ 
course” (unless they find a means of “dissipating in numerous 
occupations the surplus quantity of their blood”), or in those 
who, while practicing self-control, imagine sexual pleasures 



The Body 


115 


after seeing certain spectacles or as a result of recurring 
memories. 

Satyriasis in women is sometimes mentioned. Soranus en¬ 
counters the same type of symptoms in such cases; they take 
the form of an “intense itching of the genitals.” Women 
afflicted with this ailment are moved by “an irresistible desire 
for sexual intercourse,” which “throws aside all sense of 
shame.” 7 But it is doubtless hysteria that best represents the 
excessive tension of the sexual organs. In any case, that is how 
Galen describes an affliction in which he declines to see a 
movement of the uterus. The changes that have made some 
people think that the desiccated organ draws up toward the 
diaphragm in search of the moisture it lacks are due, accord¬ 
ing to him, either to retention of the menstrual flow or to 
retention of sperm. The obstruction of the vessels may cause 
them to become enlarged and hence shortened. A traction is 
thus brought to bear on the uterus. But it is not this process 
in itself which provokes the set of other symptoms; these all 
stem from the retention of humors that occurs, either when 
menstruation is suspended or when the woman interrupts her 
sexual relations: whence the hysteria that one can observe in 
widowed women, “particularly those who previously men¬ 
struated regularly, had been pregnant, and were eager for 
intercourse, but were now deprived of all this.” 8 

The other pole of the pathology is constituted by unlimited 
expenditure. This is what the Greeks call gonorrhea and the 
Latins seminis effusio. Galen defines it thus: “an involuntary 
discharge of sperm,” or “to be more definite, a continuous 
discharge of semen without erection of the penis.” Whereas 
satyriasis attacks the penis, gonorrhea affects the spermatic 
vessels, paralyzing their “retentive faculty.” 9 Aretaeus de¬ 
scribes it at length in On the Causes and Signs of Chronic 
Diseases as the exhaustion of the vital principles, its three 
effects being a general loss of strength, premature aging, and 
a feminization of the body. “Young persons, when they suffer 
from this affection, necessarily become old in constitution, 
torpid, dull, spiritless, enfeebled, shriveled, inactive, pale whit- 



116 


The Care of the Self 


ish, effeminate, loathe their food, and become frigid; they have 
heaviness of the members, torpidity of the legs, are powerless, 
and incapable of all exertion. In many cases, this disease is the 
way to paralysis; for how could the nervous power not suffer 
when nature has become frigid in regard to the generation of 
life? For it is the semen, when possessed of vitality, which 
makes us men, hot, well-braced in limbs, hairy, well-voiced, 
spirited, strong to think and to act, as the characteristics of 
men prove. For when the semen is not possessed of its vitality, 
persons become shriveled, have a sharp tone of voice, lose 
their hair and their beard, and become effeminate.” 10 With 
gonorrhea it is virility, the life principle, that is lost via the 
genitals. Hence the traits that are traditionally associated with 
it. It is a shameful disease—no doubt because it is often in¬ 
duced by a quantitative excess of sexual activity. But it is also 
shameful in itself because of the appearance of emasculation 
it produces. It is a disease that leads inevitably to death. Celsus 
says that in a short time it causes the patient to die of con¬ 
sumption. 11 Finally, it is a disease that is perilous not just for 
the individual but, according to Aretaeus, for his offspring as 
well. 12 

2. Beyond the particular sphere of their pathology, sexual 
acts are placed, by the medicine of the first two centuries, at 
the junction of a complex pathology. On the one hand, sexual 
acts are susceptible of being affected, in their unfolding and 
their satisfactory conclusion, by an abundance of diverse fac¬ 
tors: there is the temperament of the individuals; there is the 
climate, the time of day; there is the food that one has in¬ 
gested, its quality and amount. The acts are so fragile that the 
least deviation, the least malaise, risks perturbing them. As 
Galen says, to experience the sexual pleasures, one ought to 
be in an exactly medial state, at the zero point, as it were, of 
all the possible organic variations: “beware of repletion and 
deficiency,” avoid “fatigue, indigestion, and anything, more¬ 
over, which might be suspect in consideration of a person’s 
health.” 13 



The Body 


117 


But if the aphrodisia constitute such a fragile and precari¬ 
ous activity, they in return exert a substantial and quite exten¬ 
sive influence on the entire organism. The list of ailments, 
malaises, and diseases that can be engendered by the sexual 
pleasures if one commits a deviation, with respect either to 
time or measure, is virtually open. “It is not difficult,” says 
Galen, “to recognize that sexual relations are fatiguing for the 
chest, the lungs, the head and the nerves.” 14 Rufus submits a 
table in which are juxtaposed, as effects of an abuse of sexual 
relations, digestive disorders, a weakening of sight and hear¬ 
ing, a general weakness of the sense organs, and memory loss; 
convulsive trembling, pains of the joints, a stabbing pain in the 
side; aphtha in the mouth, toothaches, inflammation of the 
throat, spitting of blood, and kidney and bladder diseases. 15 It 
is concerning hysteria that Galen meets the objection of those 
who cannot believe that symptoms so numerous, so extensive, 
and so violent can be due to the retention or alteration of such 
a small amount of humor, which remains in the body as a 
result of the suspension of sexual relations. To which Galen 
replies by comparing the noxious powers of corrupted sperm 
to those of the virulent poisons that one observes in nature: 
“We can see that the entire body is affected by the bite of the 
venemous spider, although only an insignificant amount of 
venom enters through a very small opening.” The effect pro¬ 
duced by the scorpion is more surprising still, for the most 
violent symptoms declare themselves immediately; and yet, “a 
truly minimal amount or absolutely nothing is injected by the 
attacking stinger, the point of which seems to be without 
perforation.” The torpedo-fish is another example of this fact 
that “a minute quantity of some substance elicits a most pain¬ 
ful effect simply by contact.” And Galen concludes: “When, 
however, an affection involving our body originates inside and 
resembles the effect of the administration of a dangerous poi¬ 
son, then it is not astonishing that an abnormally composed 
semen or an equally abnormal menstrual discharge produces 
serious symptoms by stagnation or putrefaction in persons 
susceptible to such diseases.” 16 The organs, the humors, and 



118 


The Care of the Self 


sexual acts constitute both a surface that is receptive and 
especially sensitive to anything capable of disturbing the orga¬ 
nism, and a very active focus for inducing a long series of 
polymorphous symptoms throughout the body. 

3. Sexual activity is a source of therapeutic effects as well 
as pathological consequences. Its ambivalence makes it capa¬ 
ble of healing in certain cases. In others, on the contrary, it 
is likely to lead to illnesses. But it is not always easy to de¬ 
termine which of the two effects it will have: a question 
of individual temperament; a question, too, of particular cir¬ 
cumstances and of the transitory state of the body. In general, 
theorists subscribe to the Hippocratic teaching that “sexual 
intercourse is excellent against diseases due to the phlegm.” 
And Rufus comments: “Many individuals who are emaciated 
as a result of an illness are restored by means of this practice. 
Some of them thereby regain an easy respiration, which had 
been obstructed, others recover the appetite for food which 
they had lost, still others achieve the cessation of contrary 
nocturnal emissions.” 17 He also credits the evacuation of 
sperm with positive effects on the soul when the latter is 
troubled and needs, like the body, to be purged of that which 
encumbers it: intercourse dissipates fixed ideas and pacifies 
violent fits of anger. This is why there does not exist a more 
eminently useful remedy against melancholy and misan¬ 
thropy. Galen also attributes to sexual relations a number of 
curative effects, on the soul as well as the body: “this act 
predisposes the soul to tranquillity. Indeed it restores the 
melancholy and furious man to a more sensible state, and in 
an amorous individual it dampens the too immoderate ardor, 
even when this man has intercourse with a different woman. 
Further, animals that are ferocious when they have given birth 
become calm after copulation.” As to their effectiveness for 
the body, Galen sees a proof of their action in the fact that, 
once sexual practice has begun, boys become “hairy, large, 
manly,” whereas before they were “smooth-skinned, small, 
and feminine.” 18 



The Body 


119 


But Galen also remarks on the opposite effects that sexual 
relations may have according to the condition in which the 
subject finds himself: “intercourse reduces to extreme weak¬ 
ness those whose strength is inconsiderable while those whose 
strength is intact and who are sick through the effect of the 
phlegm will not be struck down by intercourse.” For a mo¬ 
ment “it makes weak people warm again, but afterwards it 
chills them considerably”; or further, whereas some, “already 
in their early youth, become instantly enfeebled by inter¬ 
course. Others, if they do not have regular sexual relations, 
feel heavy in the head, become nauseated and feverish, have 
a poor appetite and bad digestion.” 19 And Galen even men¬ 
tions the case of certain temperaments for which the evacua¬ 
tion of sperm provokes illnesses or malaises despite the fact 
that its retention is harmful: “Certain people have an abun¬ 
dant, warm sperm which incessantly arouses the need for 
excretion; however, after its expulsion, people who are in this 
state experience a languor at the stomach orifice, exhaustion, 
weakness, and dryness in the whole body. They become thin, 
their eyes grow hollow and if, because they have suffered these 
effects after intercourse, they abstain from sexual relations, 
they feel discomfort in the head and at the stomach orifice 
along with nausea, and they do not derive any significant 
advantage from their self-control.” 20 

Around these positive or negative effects, several debates 
developed concerning certain precise questions. For example, 
the question of nocturnal emissions. Rufus reports the opinion 
of those for whom these losses of semen during sleep are “less 
distressing.” But for his part, he opposes this conception, 
being of the opinion that “emissions relax the body even more, 
when it is already relaxed in sleep.” 21 And Galen does not see 
that anything is gained by those who, abstaining from inter¬ 
course because of its harmful effects, experience nocturnal 
emissions as a result. 22 More important no doubt was the 
debate concerning children’s convulsions and their cessation 
at the age of puberty. It had often been held that, because of 
the affinity between ejaculation and spasm, young boys 



120 


The Care of the Self 


stricken with convulsions could be cured by the first sexual 
practice. This is the thesis of Rufus, who believes that epilepsy 
and headaches come to an end when a boy reaches puberty. 23 
As a therapy against these spasms, some physicians recom¬ 
mended making the age of the first sexual relations earlier for 
those children. Aretaeus criticizes this method, because it 
violates the designs of Nature, who appointed the proper 
times, and because it produces or prolongs the disease it aims 
to cure: physicians who give such advice “are ignorant of the 
spontaneous law of Nature by which all cures are accom¬ 
plished. For along with every age she produces that which is 
proper for it in due season. At a given time there is the matu¬ 
rity of semen, of the beard, of hoary hairs. For on the one hand 
what physician could alter Nature’s original change in regard 
to the semen, and, on the other, the appointed time for each? 
But they also offend against the nature of the disease; for being 
previously injured by the unseasonableness of the act, they are 
not possessed of seasonable powers at the proper commence¬ 
ment of the age for coition.” 24 If in fact the convulsions disap¬ 
pear at puberty, this is due not to the enjoyment of sexual 
pleasures, but to a general modification in the balance and role 
of the humors. 

4. But the most important consideration is doubtless the 
tendency to attribute positive effects to sexual abstention. It is 
true, as we have seen, that the physicians call attention to the 
disorders that can result from the practice of self-restraint. 
But they generally observe them in subjects who were accus¬ 
tomed to frequent sexual relations and in whom the cessation 
amounts to a sudden change of regimen. This is the case 
reported by Galen in the treatise On the Affected Parts, involv¬ 
ing a man who, breaking with all this previous habits, had 
given up sexual activity. 25 They are also observed in subjects 
whose sperm is affected by qualities that make its evacuation 
necessary. Galen has seen men who, through the effect of this 
deprivation, became “dull and inactive,” and others who, “for 



The Body 


121 


no evident reason, had a sad and hopeless expression on their 
faces like melancholics.” These observations allow him to 
state that “the retention of sperm does considerable harm to 
young and strong individuals, in whom the sperm is naturally 
abundant and formed of humors that are not entirely faultless, 
who lead a somewhat lazy life, who had quite frequently 
indulged in sexual intercourse before, and who suddenly prac¬ 
tice continence.” 26 That abstention from all sexual relations is 
harmful to the organism is therefore not regarded as a general 
fact that might be observed in anyone, no matter who they 
might be, but rather as the consequence of certain particular 
facts pertaining either to the state of the organism or to a 
habitual mode of living. In itself, and without any other factor 
entering in, abstinence that retains the spermatic substance 
cannot reasonably be considered harmful. 

As concerns men, the high vital value granted to the sper¬ 
matic humor had long enabled people to attribute positive 
effects to the kind of rigorous self-restraint practiced by ath¬ 
letes. The example is still regularly cited. It was precisely in 
order to follow this model that a patient of Galen’s had de¬ 
cided to refrain from all sexual activity, without considering 
that up to then he had led a very different life and that the 
effects of this abstention could not therefore be comparable. 
Aretaeus, describing the beneficial effects of semen, that “vivi¬ 
fying humor”—it makes one manly, courageous, full of fire, 
robust; it gives a deep tone to the voice and makes one capable 
of vigorous action—asserts that a self-con trolled man “who 
retains his semen” thereby becomes “bold, daring, and strong 
as wild beasts.” He recalls the example of athletes or animals 
that are all the more vigorous because they keep their semen; 
thus, “such as are naturally superior in strength, by inconti¬ 
nence [akrasia ] become inferior to their inferiors; while those 
by nature much their inferiors by continence [enkrateia] be¬ 
come superior to their superiors [ kreittones ].” 27 

On the other hand, the values of abstinence were much less 
likely to be granted for women, given the fact that they were 



122 


The Care of the Self 


considered to be socially and physiologically destined for mar¬ 
riage and procreation. Yet Soranus, in his Gynecology, cites 
the arguments of a debate, which seems to have been impor¬ 
tant in his day, on the advantages and disadvantages of virgin¬ 
ity. Those who criticize it call attention to the diseases that are 
due to humors that do not flow out and desires that are not 
extinguished by abstinence. The advocates of virginity point 
out, to the contrary, that women thereby avert the dangers of 
childbearing, are unacquainted with desire since they do not 
know pleasure, and keep within themselves the force that 
semen possesses. Soranus, for his part, concedes that virginity 
can have disadvantages. But he observes them for the most 
part in women who live “shut inside the temples” and are 
deprived of “the necessary exercises.” He contends that as a 
rule permanent virginity is healthy for both sexes. 28 Hence 
sexual union would not in his view have any natural justifica¬ 
tion in the health of individuals; only the obligation to main¬ 
tain the human race makes its practice necessary. It is “the 
general principle of nature” that requires it, more than per¬ 
sonal regimen. 

Sexual abstinence was not regarded as a duty, certainly, nor 
was the sexual act represented as an evil. But we see how, in 
the development of these themes that were already explicitly 
formulated by the medical and philosophical thought of the 
fourth century, a certain inflection occurred: an insistence on 
the ambiguity of the effects of sexual activity, an extension of 
the correlations attributed to it throughout the organism, an 
accentuation of its peculiar fragility and its pathogenic power, 
and a valorization of abstinent behaviors, for both sexes. In 
times past the dangers of sexual activity were perceived in 
connection with involuntary violence and careless expendi¬ 
ture. They are now described more as the effect of a general 
fragility of the human body and its functioning. 

We can understand, given these conditions, the importance 
that the regimen of the aphrodisia was apt to assume in the 
management of one’s personal life. On this point, Rufus makes 
a noteworthy statement, which links together, quite explicitly, 



The Body 


123 


the danger of sexual practice and the fundamental principle of 
the care of the self: “Those who indulge in sexual relations and 
especially those who indulge without much caution need to 
take care of themselves in a much more rigorous fashion than 
others, so that, by putting their body in the best possible 
condition, they might experience less the harmful effects of 
these relations” (he ek ton aphrodision blabe ). 29 



3 


The Regimen of 
Pleasures 


Sexual acts must therefore be placed under an extremely 
careful regimen. But this regimen is very different from a 
prescriptive system that would try to define a “natural,” legiti¬ 
mate, and acceptable form of practice. It is remarkable that 
almost nothing is said in these regimens about the type of 
sexual acts that one may engage in or about those which 
Nature disfavors. Rufus, for example, mentions relations with 
boys in passing. He also alludes to the positions the partners 
can take, but he translates the dangers of these positions di¬ 
rectly into quantitative terms: they would demand a greater 
expenditure of strength than the others. 1 * Remarkable, too, is 
the fact that these regimens are more “concessive” than “nor¬ 
mative.” Rufus sets forth his regimen after having evoked the 
pathogenic effects of sexual activity—if it is exaggerated and 
practiced unduly—and after submitting that these acts “are 
not harmful absolutely, in every respect, provided that one 
considers the opportuneness of the act, the limit that is to be 
put on it, and the hygienic constitution of the person who 
performs it .” 2 And Galen says, also with a view to limitations, 
that he would not want that “people were completely prohib¬ 
ited from practicing sexual intercourse.” 3 ! These are circum¬ 
stantial regimens, which demand that one take great care to 

*Rufus also notes that the standing position is tiring. 

tNote, however, in Celsus, a moderate judgment: “Coition is neither to be desired 
overmuch, nor overmuch to be feared .” 4 


124

determine the conditions that will least affect the whole com¬ 
bination of balances. Four variables are singled out: the auspi¬ 
cious occasion for procreation, the age of the subject, the time 
frame (the season or the hour of the day), and individual 
temperament. 

1. The regimen of the aphrodisia and procreation. An en¬ 
tirely traditional theme said that noble offspring— euteknia — 
could not be engendered unless one took a certain number of 
precautions. The disorders of conception would be reflected in 
one’s progeny. Not only because the descendants would re¬ 
semble their parents, but because they would bear the charac¬ 
teristics of the act that brought them into existence. We recall 
the recommendations of Aristotle and Plato on this point. 5 
That the sexual act, in its procreative finality, requires a good 
deal of care and a meticulous preparation is a principle that 
one finds again in the medical regimens of the imperial epoch. 
These regimens prescribe a long-term preparation first of all. 
This involves a general conditioning of the body and the soul 
designed to produce or maintain in the individual the qualities 
with which the semen will need to be imbued and by which 
the embryo will need to be marked. One must form oneself as 
the prior image of the child one wishes to have. A passage 
from Athenaeus, cited by Oribasius, is very explicit on this 
point: those who intend to beget children must have body and 
soul in the best possible condition. In other words, the soul 
must be tranquil and completely free of pain, of worries ac¬ 
companied by fatigue, and of any other affliction; and the body 
must be healthy and not spoiled in any way. 6 An immediate 
preparation is necessary as well: a period of restraint during 
which the sperm accumulates and gathers strength, while 
the urge acquires the necessary intensity (too-frequent sexual 
relations prevent the sperm from reaching the degree of elab¬ 
oration at which it becomes fully potent). A rather strict 
alimentary diet is recommended: no food that is too hot or too 
moist, just “a light meal which will give the impetus towards 
coitus, and which should not be overloaded with too many 



126

ingredients”; no indigestion, no drunkenness; in short, a gen¬ 
eral purification of the body that will ensure the quietude 
necessary to the sexual function. It is in this way that “the 
farmer sows only after having first cleansed the soil and 
removed any foreign material.” 7 Soranus, who gives this ad¬ 
vice, puts no trust in those who prescribe, for a good concep¬ 
tion, waiting until the period of the full moon; the essential 
thing is to choose “a time in which the body is neither in want 
nor overburdened, but in a satisfactory state in every respect” 
—both for physiological reasons (the harmful humors that 
rise up in the body may prevent the seed from adhering to the 
fundus of the uterus) and for ethical reasons (the embryo will 
be imbued with the condition of the procreators). 

There is, of course, a time more favorable than others in the 
woman’s cycle. According to a metaphor that is already quite 
ancient and that will still do long service in Christianity, 
“every season is not propitious for sewing seed upon the land 
for the purpose of bringing forth fruit, so in humans too not 
every time is suitable for conception of the seed discharged in 
intercourse.” 8 Soranus places this favorable time immediately 
after menstruation. His argumentation rests on the metaphor 
—which is not personal to him, moreover—of the appetite. 9 
The uterus is avid; it consumes, it loads itself with nutriment, 
sometimes with blood (the normal case), sometimes with seed 
(and fertilization occurs). To be procreative, the sexual act 
must take place at a favorable time in this alimentary rhythm. 
Not before menstruation, for “just as the stomach when over¬ 
burdened with some kind of material and turned to nausea is 
disposed to vomit what oppresses it and is averse to receiving 
food, so according to the same principle, the uterus, being 
congested at the time of menstruation, is well adapted for the 
evacuation of the blood which has flowed into it, but is unfitted 
for the reception and retention of the seed.” Not during men¬ 
strual evacuation, which constitutes a kind of natural vomit¬ 
ing, when the semen runs the risk of being swept out as well. 
Nor when the flow has completely stopped: the uterus, desic¬ 
cated and chilled, is then no longer in a condition to receive 



The Body 


127 


the seed. The favorable time is when “the flow is ceasing,” so 
that the uterus is still moist with blood and permeated with 
warmth, “and hence turgescent with a craving to receive the 
sperm.” 10 This craving, which reappears in the body after 
purgation, is manifested in the woman by a desire that dis¬ 
poses her to sexual intercourse. 11 

But there is more still. For conception to occur in suitable 
conditions and for the offspring to have every possible quality, 
the sexual act itself must be performed with the observance of 
certain precautions. Soranus says nothing precise on this sub¬ 
ject. He simply indicates the necessity of a prudent and calm 
behavior, one that avoids all the disturbances, all the intoxica¬ 
tions that might be reflected in the embryo, since the latter 
would be a kind of mirror and witness of these excesses: 
“Thus, in order that the offspring may not be rendered mis¬ 
shapen, women must be sober during coitus because in drunk¬ 
enness the soul becomes the victim of strange phantasies; this 
furthermore, because the offspring bears some resemblance to 
the mother as well, not only in body but in soul. Therefore it 
is good that the offspring be made to resemble the soul when 
it is stable and not deranged by drunkenness.” 12 Finally, dur¬ 
ing pregnancy sexual relations must be extremely limited: 
completely discontinued in the first period, because inter¬ 
course “causes movement in the whole body in general and 
especially in the various parts about the uterus which need 
rest. For just as the stomach when quiet retains the food, but 
when shaken often ejects through vomiting what it has re¬ 
ceived, so also the uterus when not shaken holds fast the seed; 
when agitated, however, discharges it.” 13 Yet some physicians, 
such as Galen, consider it advisable to resume intercourse and 
practice it during pregnancy: “It is not good for pregnant 
women either to abstain from coitus or to return to it continu¬ 
ally: for in women who are abstinent childbirth becomes more 
difficult, whereas in those who constantly indulge in coitus the 
infant will be weak; there may even be a miscarriage.” 14 

Hence there is a whole government of the aphrodisia, whose 
principle and whose justification are in this preparation of 



128 


The Care of the Self 


offspring. It is not that there is an obligation to practice sexual 
intercourse only in order to have children: if the conditions of 
probable conception are carefully laid down, this is not for the 
purpose of setting the limits of the legitimate act by means of 
them, but is meant to serve as useful advice for anyone who 
cares about their offspring. And if the latter are an important 
concern, this is in the form of a duty that the parents can 
assume with respect to them. It is also an obligation vis-a-vis 
themselves since it is advantageous for them to have offspring 
endowed with the best qualities. These obligations that sur¬ 
round procreation define a whole set of possible errors, which 
are at the same time faults. And they are so numerous, they 
bring in so many different factors, that few procreations would 
be successful were it not for Nature’s ability to compensate for 
these failings and to prevent disasters. At least this is how 
Galen justifies both the necessity of taking a large number of 
precautions and the fact that in spite of everything many 
births come off well: “How frequently in the fathers that beget 
and the mothers that bear us it must be not error that is rare 
but right-doing. For drunkards consort with drunkards, and 
men do not know their own whereabouts from repletion with 
women in the same state. Hence in this way the very beginning 
of our procreation is faulty; and then come the unspeakable 
errors of the pregnant woman, her indifference to proper exer¬ 
cise, her gluttony, passions, drunkenness, bathing, and un¬ 
timely indulgence in love [akarion aphrodision ]. Nevertheless, 
to such outrages Nature opposes many acts and performs 
them successfully.” Peasants are careful when they sow their 
fields; but, Galen notes, taking up the Socratic themes of the 
care of the self, humans who “take little heed of themselves” 
in their own lives are no longer concerned about their progeny 
either. 15 

2. The age of the subject. The practice of the aphrodisia 
must neither be continued too long nor begun too early. Sexual 
intercourse when one is old is dangerous: it exhausts a body 
no longer capable of reconstituting the elements that were 



The Body 


129 


withdrawn from it. 16 But it is also harmful when one is too 
young. It arrests growth and disturbs the development of the 
signs of puberty—which are the result of the body’s develop¬ 
ment of the seminal elements. “Nothing hinders the progress 
of the soul and the body as does a premature and excessive 
practice of sexual intercourse.” 17 And Galen: “Many young 
people are attacked by incurable diseases due to sexual rela¬ 
tions because they insisted on violating the time prescribed by 
Nature.” 18 What is this “prescribed time”? Is it the appearance 
or confirmation of the signs of puberty? All the physicians are 
in agreement that puberty for boys is situated at about the age 
of fourteen. But all are in agreement as well that access to the 
aphrodisia should not be had so early. One finds scarcely any 
exact indication concerning the age at which one may begin 
sexual intercourse. In any case several years should pass dur¬ 
ing which the body is forming the seminal liquids without it 
being advisable to evacuate them. Whence the necessity of a 
specific regimen designed to ensure the self-control of adoles¬ 
cents. The physicians prescribe, in keeping with tradition, a 
life of intense physical exercise. Thus Athenaeus: “Since the 
production of sperm begins at that age [fourteen] and since 
young people have very strong cravings which incite them to 
sexual intercourse, physical exercises should be very numer¬ 
ous, so that tiring the body and the soul very quickly, they 
may repress their desires from the beginning.” 19 

The problem for girls is a little different. The practice of 
early marriage doubtless caused people to concede that the 
first sexual relations and childbearing could occur as soon as 
menstruation was regularly established. 20 This is the opinion 
of Soranus, who advises reliance on organic criteria in setting 
the age for marriage and not on the desires of the girls them¬ 
selves. Depending on education, these desires can awaken 
before the body is ready; “since the female conceives seed into 
the substance of a living being,” there is a danger when the 
body of the woman has not reached the maturity necessary to 
this function; so it is good that she remain a virgin until 
menstruation has been established spontaneously. 21 Other 



130 


The Care of the Self 


physicians envisage a much later date. Thus Rufus of Ephesus 
considers that a pregnancy before the age of eighteen risks 
being unfavorable to mother and child alike. He recalls that 
this is the age recommended long ago by Hesiod; and he points 
out that this age—quite late in the eyes of some—did not have, 
in a former time, the drawbacks that it may have subsequently 
assumed. In those days, women led a life just as active as men; 
it is overeating and idleness that cause problems in unmarried 
girls, making it desirable for them to have sexual relations, 
which may facilitate the menstrual flow. The solution Rufus 
suggests, then, is a relatively late marriage (at about eighteen), 
but a marriage prepared for by a whole regimen that ought to 
accompany the life of the young girl even before puberty. 
During childhood let girls be mixed with boys; then when the 
age comes for separating them from boys, place them under 
a very careful regimen: no meat, no overly rich dishes, no or 
very little wine, long walks, exercises. It must be kept in mind 
that idleness “is for them the most harmful thing of all,” and 
that it is “advantageous to have the exercises be a means of 
putting warmth into movement and of reheating the habit of 
the body, but in such a manner that they remain women and 
do not take on a masculine character.” Participation in cho¬ 
ruses in which one sings and dances seems to be Rufus’ idea 
of the best form of exercise: “Choruses were not invented just 
for honoring the deity, but also in view of health.” 22 

3. The “'favorable time. ” The kairos of the sexual act is the 
topic of many discussions. As concerns the larger time frame, 
the traditional calendar is taken more or less for granted: 
winter and spring are the best seasons; autumn is accepted by 
some, rejected by others; in a general way, it is thought that 
one should abstain, as much as possible, during the summer. 23 
On the other hand, determining the right hour of the day 
requires that a variety of factors be taken into account. In 
addition to the religious considerations that Plutarch men¬ 
tions in one of his table-talks, 24 the question of the right time 



The Body 


131 


is linked to that of exercise, eating, and digestion. It is best not 
to let sexual intercourse be preceded by exercises that are too 
strenuous, which divert to other parts of the body the re¬ 
sources it needs. Inversely, baths and rubdowns are recom¬ 
mended after lovemaking. It is not good to practice the 
aphrodisia before meals, when one is hungry, because under 
these conditions the act is not tiring but it loses some of its 
force. 25 But, on the other hand, one must avoid copious meals 
and excessive quantities of drink. The time of digestion is 
always harmful: “That is why coitus in the middle of the night 
is deceptive, because then the food is not yet elaborated; the 
same is true of coitus that one has early in the morning, 
because there still may be ill-digested food in the stomach and 
because all the superfluities have not yet been evacuated 
through the urine and the feces.” 26 So that, all things consid¬ 
ered, it is after a moderate meal and before sleep—or possibly 
before the afternoon nap—that the time will be most favorable 
for sexual intercourse. According to Rufus, Nature herself 
indicated her preference for this time by giving the body its 
strongest excitation then. Furthermore, if one wishes to have 
children, it is appropriate that the man “engage in sexual 
intercourse after having eaten and drunk to satisfaction, 
whereas the woman ought to follow a less invigorating diet”; 
indeed, it is necessary that “the one give and the other re¬ 
ceive.” 27 Galen is of the same opinion: he recommends that 
time when one is going to sleep, after having enjoyed “a solid 
meal but one that does not cause discomfort.” In this way the 
food is sufficient to nourish and strengthen the body, and sleep 
allows one to repair the fatigue; further, this is the best mo¬ 
ment for conceiving children “because the woman retains the 
sperm better while sleeping”; finally, this is in fact the hour 
for which Nature herself indicates her preference by giving 
rise then to desire. 28 * 

*It may be added that for Celsus, night is preferable "but care should be taken that 
by day it not be immediately followed by a meal, and at night not immediately 
followed by work and wakefulness. - ’”

The Care of the Self 


4. Individual temperaments. Rufus posits as a general 
principle that the natures most suited for coition are those 
which are “more or less hot and moist”; in return, sexual 
activity is rather unfavorable for constitutions that are cold 
and dry. Thus, in order to maintain or restore the warm 
moisture needed in the aphrodisia, it is good to adopt an entire 
complex and continuous regimen of suitable exercise and 
proper nourishment. Around sexual activity, and in order to 
preserve the balance it risks upsetting, one must keep to a 
whole mode of living. It is helpful to drink pale red wine, to 
eat oven bread made from bran (its moisture is useful for 
preparation and regulation); to consume, in the meat category, 
young goat, lamb, hen, grouse, partridge, goose, duck; in the 
seafood category, octopus and mollusks—together with tur¬ 
nips, broad beans, green beans, chick peas (for their heat), and 
grapes (for their moisture). As for the activities to which one 
should resort, they include excursions, on foot or horseback, 
and running, but neither too fast nor too slow; but no violent 
exercises, no gesticulation as in javelin throwing (which di¬ 
verts the nutritive material to other parts of the body), no 
excessively hot baths, no heating and cooling off; no strenuous 
work. One should also avoid anything that would contribute 
to tiring the body—anger, joy that is too great, and pain. 30

The Work of the 
Soul 


The regimen recommended for the sexual pleasures seems 
to be centered entirely on the body. Its condition, its balances, 
its ailments, the general or transitory dispositions in which it 
finds itself, function as the principal variables that ought to 
determine behavior. It is as if the body dictated to the body. 
And yet the soul has its part to play as well, and the physicians 
bring it into the scheme of things. For it is the soul that 
constantly risks carrying the body beyond its own mechanics 
and its elementary needs; it is the soul that prompts one to 
choose the times that are not suitable, to act in questionable 
circumstances, to contravene natural dispositions. If humans 
need a regimen that takes into account, with such meticulous¬ 
ness, all the elements of physiology, this is because they always 
tend to be led astray by their imaginings, their passions, and 
their loves. Even the proper age for beginning sexual inter¬ 
course gets confused in girls and boys alike; education and 
habits can cause desire to appear at the wrong time. 1 

The reasonable soul thus has a dual role to play: it needs to 
assign a regimen for the body that is actually determined by 
the latter’s nature, its tensions, the condition and circum¬ 
stances in which it finds itself. But it will be able to assign this 
regimen correctly only provided it has done a good deal of 
work on itself: eliminated the errors, reduced the imaginings, 
mastered the desires, that cause it to misconstrue the sober law 
of the body. Athenaeus—on whom the Stoic influence is con- 

133 



134 


The Care of the Self 


siderable—defines very clearly this labor of the soul on itself 
as a requisite condition of the good physical regimen. “What 
adults need is a complete regimen of the soul and the body 
. . . to try and calm its impulses [hormai], and to achieve a 
condition in which our desires [prothumiai] do not exceed our 
own particular powers.” 2 This regimen does not require that 
one institute a struggle of the soul against the body, nor even 
that one establish means by which the soul might defend itself 
from the body. Rather, it is a matter of the soul’s correcting 
itself in order to be able to guide the body according to a law 
which is that of the body itself. 

This work is described by the physicians in reference to 
three elements by which the subject risks being carried beyond 
the actual necessities of the organism: the movement of desire, 
the presence of images, the attachment to pleasure. 

a. In the medical regimen it is not a question of eliminat¬ 
ing desire. Nature herself placed it in all the animal species as 
a spur for exciting both sexes and for attracting them to one 
another. Nothing would be more unnatural, therefore, noth¬ 
ing more harmful than to seek to have the aphrodisia escape 
the natural force of desire; one must never—out of a spirit of 
debauchery or in order to circumvent the lost vigor of age— 
try to force nature. One must not have sexual relations aneu 
epithumein, without feeling desire: such is the advice of Rufus 
in the treatise On Satyriasis. But this desire is twofold: it 
appears in the body and it appears in the soul. The problem 
of regimen consists in bringing about an exact correlation of 
the two manifestations. One must take care that, in the body 
and in the soul, its movements are coordinated and adjusted 
as precisely as possible. Rufus makes a noteworthy pro¬ 
nouncement in this regard: “It is best that the man indulge in 
sexual intercourse when he is pressed at the same time by the 
soul’s desire and the body’s need.” 3 

It sometimes happens that this natural correlation is jeop¬ 
ardized through the action of the body itself. The body loses 
control of itself, as it were. Nothing in the soul corresponds 



The Body 


135 


to its excitation. It gives way to a kind of pure convulsion. The 
sexual act then becomes altogether “paroxysmal,” as Rufus 
says. 4 It is to this purely physical excitation that Rufus seems 
to allude when he speaks of the hormai that accompany the 
warning signs of mania or epilepsy. 5 The same phenomenon 
occurs, but in a different form, in satyriasis or gonorrhea: the 
sexual organs become inflamed by themselves, in the first of 
these diseases; and in the other, “without an act, without a 
nocturnal image, a profusion of semen is discharged in abun¬ 
dance”; the patient, transported by the crazed mechanics of 
his body, becomes exhausted and “dies of consumption after 
a certain time.” 6 

But the soul, conversely, can escape the forms and limits of 
the desire manifested in the body. The term Rufus and Galen 
use to designate this excess is significant: it is the word doxa. 
The soul, instead of attending only to the wants and needs of 
the body, allows itself to be enticed by representations that are 
peculiar to it and have no counterpart in the organism: repre¬ 
sentations that are vain and empty (kenai). Just as the body 
must not let itself be carried away without the correlative of 
a desire in the soul, the latter must not go beyond what the 
body demands and what its needs dictate. But in the first case, 
what is involved is an illness, which remedies may be able to 
cure; in the second, what is involved above all is an ethical 
regimen, which ought to be applied to oneself. Rufus proposes 
a formula for this: “subdue the soul and make it obey the 
body.” 7 

A paradoxical proposition, if one thinks of the eminently 
traditional theme of the soul that must not be seduced by the 
entreaties of the body. But it has to be grasped in its precise 
theoretical and medical context, which was inspired perhaps 
by Stoicism. The voluntary submission of the soul to the body 
should be understood as obedience to a rationality that has 
presided over the natural order and has designed, for its own 
purposes, the mechanics of the body. It is from this natural 
reason that the doxai risk leading the soul astray by creating 
extraneous desires; it is to this reason that the reasonable 



136 


The Care of the Self 


medical regimen, based on the true knowledge of living crea¬ 
tures, must be attuned. In this context the animal example, 
which so often served to disqualify the appetites of man, can 
on the contrary constitute a model for conduct. This is be¬ 
cause in their sexual regimen animals follow the dictates of the 
body, but never anything more or anything else. What directs 
them, explains Rufus, and hence what ought also to guide 
humans, are not the doxai, but the “preludes of a nature that 
needs evacuation.” For Galen, similarly, animals are not led 
to seek sexual union by the “belief”— doxa —that “pleasure is 
a good thing”; they are prompted to desire sexual relations 
“for the sake of the discharge, since the retention of semen is 
a burden to them.” For them, there is no difference between 
that which brings them to sexual intercourse and that which 
“makes them regard the elimination of stool and urine as a 
natural act.” 8 

The medical regimen proposes, then, a sort of animalization 
of the epithumia; that is, a subordination, as strict as possible, 
of the soul’s desire to the body’s needs; an ethics of desire that 
is modeled on a natural philosophy of excretions; and the 
tendency toward an ideal point where the soul, purified of all 
its vain representations, no longer gives its attention to any¬ 
thing but the austere economy of organic functions. 

b. Hence the physicians’ general distrust of “images” 
(phantasiai). The theme recurs again and again in the treat¬ 
ments they recommend. Thus, on the subject of satyriasis, 
Rufus suggests a cure that has two aspects; the first concerns 
diet, from which all warming foods should be excluded; the 
second concerns the stimulations of the soul: “One should 
avoid conversations, thoughts, erotic cravings, and above all 
one should protect oneself from that which the eyes see, know¬ 
ing very well that all these things, even in dreams, . . . incite 
to copulation if one has abstained from intercourse after hav¬ 
ing eaten rich food in abundance.” 9 Galen, in the same spirit, 
recommends a doubly cathartic cure to one of his friends who 
has given up sexual activity but finds that he is in a state of 



The Body 


137 


constant excitation. Galen advises him first to relieve himself 
physically by excreting the accumulated semen; then—once 
the body is purified—to let nothing enter the mind that might 
deposit images there: “to refrain completely from spectacles, 
not to tell stories or recall memories which could stimulate his 
sexual desire.” 10 

These dangerous images, which also give rise in the soul to 
“empty” desires, having no correlation with the needs of the 
body, are of several types. There are of course the dream 
images, which the physicians seem especially concerned about 
when these images are accompanied by emissions—whence 
the often repeated advice not to sleep on one’s back, not to 
drink too much or eat before sleeping, and to keep the mind 
at rest when one is going to go to bed. In any case Rufus of 
Ephesus makes this an important item in the regimen of those 
suffering from satyriasis: “Sleep on your side rather than on 
your back.” 11 * Among the images to be avoided are those 
which can be seen at the theater; those which are suggested 
by reading, singing, music, and dancing, and which insinuate 
themselves into the mind without there being anything that 
corresponds to them in the needs of the body. Galen thus 
claims to have observed symptoms of satyriasis in subjects 
“who fail to get rid of an excess of blood, particularly when 
they do not refrain from erotic ideas. Likewise do persons 
suffer who are chaste by nature and accustomed to self-control 
over a long time but who indulge in imaginings in order to 
stimulate themselves by such spectacles and memories. The 
condition of the genital organs of these patients is quite con¬ 
trary to that of others who never indulge in erotic ideas.” 13 

But visual perceptions must also be included under this 
term phantasia, in keeping with a philosophical usage. There 
is a danger not just in imagining or remembering the aphro- 
disia, but also in perceiving them. It is a very old theme of 
traditional modesty that the aphrodisia ought to take place at 
night and in darkness rather than in broad daylight. But this 

•One very often encounters the idea that to sleep on one’s back heats up the sexual 
parts and causes nocturnal emissions . 11 



138 


The Care of the Self 


same precept is also emphasized as an element of regimen: by 
not seeing, one is protected from the images that might be 
engraved in the soul, remain there, and return in an untimely 
manner. Plutarch alludes to this problem in connection with 
the kairos, the right time for sexual acts. Among the reasons 
for shunning the light there is, for him, the concern to avoid 
“the images of pleasure” that constantly “renew” our desire; 
“but night blots out the insatiate and wildest of the deeds of 
love-making and thus diverts and calms one’s own constitu¬ 
tion, which visual stimuli do not shipwreck on the shores of 
lust.” 14 

We may recall here that the question of “images” was much 
discussed in the literature of love. The gaze was thought to be 
the surest vehicle of passion; it was the path by which passion 
entered the heart and the means by which passion was main¬ 
tained. Propertius finds that the play of Venus loses its charm 
in darkness: “why make love in the dark . . . naked Endymion 
won the love of Phoebus’ sister and held in his arms the 
goddess naked.” 15 By the same token, the gaze, light, and 
image were considered dangerous. Dangerous as far as strict 
morals were concerned: the same Propertius believes that im¬ 
modesty spread when images were introduced into people’s 
houses. 16 Dangerous as well for love itself, which could be 
wounded by the unloveliness of the images. Ovid recommends 
prudence to anyone who wishes to preserve their love: “Don’t 
let the light pour in, with all the windows wide open—it is 
more fitting to keep much of your body concealed.” 17 And for 
the same reason, the cruel image can be an excellent means of 
protecting oneself against passion or even a means of ridding 
oneself of it. When one wishes to free oneself of a love there 
is nothing so effective, says Ovid in The Remedies for Love, as 
to let the light in when it is time for sex: the body’s defects, 
together with the stains and the mess, will be imprinted on the 
mind, giving rise to disgust. It is also good, when one is trying 
to get free of one’s mistress, to surprise her early in the morn¬ 
ing amid the disorder of the dressing table. 18 There is a whole 
technique of the image, which can be organized for and 



The Body 


139 


against love. Moreover, the struggle against internal or exter¬ 
nal images will be one of the most constant aspects of sexual 
ethics from the end of antiquity onward. 

c. There remains the pleasure inscribed by Nature in the 
process of the aphrodisia. Can one eliminate it, or arrange not 
to feel it? This is out of the question, seeing that pleasure is 
tied directly to the movements of the body and the mech¬ 
anisms of retention and erection. However, Galen believes 
that one can prevent this pleasure from becoming an element 
of excess in the economy of the aphrodisia. The approach he 
recommends is clearly Stoic: it is a matter of considering 
pleasure as nothing more than the accompaniment of the act; 
it must never be taken as a reason to accomplish the act. “That 
pleasure is a good thing” is, as we have seen, for Galen, a doxa 
that animals do not have (which ensures that their behavior 
will have a natural limit). On the other hand, those humans 
who have such an opinion run the risk of pursuing the aphro¬ 
disia for the pleasure they provide; consequently, they are 
liable to become attached to them and always to want to 
repeat them. 

For a reasonable regimen, the task therefore is to elide 
pleasure as a sought-after object: to indulge in the aphrodisia 
independently of the attraction of pleasure and as if it did not 
exist. The only goal that reason should set itself is the one 
indicated by the state of the body, according to its own purga¬ 
tive requirements. “It is evident that chaste persons [tous so- 
phronas] do not indulge in sexual intercourse for pleasure, but 
with the intention to relieve this urge, as if this were not 
associated with pleasure.” This is precisely the lesson that 
Galen derives from the famous gesture of Diogenes: without 
even waiting for the prostitute whom he had asked to come, 
the philosopher rid himself of the humor that inconvenienced 
him. In doing this, he wished, according to Galen, to dis¬ 
charge his sperm “without seeking the pleasure that accompa¬ 
nies that emission.”’ 5 



140 


The Care of the Self 


We may note in passing the very modest place that mastur¬ 
bation and the solitary pleasures occupied in these medical 
regimens—as was generally the case in all the moral reflec¬ 
tions of the Greeks and the Romans concerning sexual activ¬ 
ity. When masturbation appears, which is rather rare, it is in 
a positive form: an act of natural elimination, which has the 
value both of a philosophical lesson and a necessary remedy. 
One thinks of Dio of Prusa reporting how Diogenes jokingly 
praised the act he performed in public: an act that, done in 
time, would have made the Trojan War unnecessary; an act 
Nature herself recommends to us through the example of the 
fish; a reasonable act, for it depends on us alone, just as we 
have no need of anyone to scratch our leg for us; an act, finally, 
for which we are indebted to the gods, for it was they who 
showed us how—Hermes in particular, who taught the trick 
to Pan, hopelessly in love with the inaccessible Echo. And the 
shepherds seem to have learned it subsequently from Pan. 20 It 
is an act of Nature herself, one that, without recourse to 
passions and artifices and in complete independence, corre¬ 
sponds strictly to need. In Western literature—beginning with 
Christian monasticism—masturbation remains associated 
with the chimera of the imagination and its dangers. It is the 
very form of unnatural pleasure that humans invented in order 
to exceed the limits assigned to them. In a medical ethics 
anxious, like that of the first centuries of our era, to gear sexual 
activity to the basic needs of the body, the act of solitary 
purgation constitutes the barest form of the uselessness of 
desire, images, and pleasure. 

1. However meticulous and complex these regimens of 
activity may be, we must not exaggerate their relative impor¬ 
tance. The place they are allocated is limited in comparison 
with the other regimens—particularly in comparison with the 
dietary regimen. When, in the fifth century, Oribasius comes 
to edit his great collection of medical texts, he will devote four 
entire books to the qualities, disadvantages, dangers, and vir¬ 
tues of the different possible foods and to the conditions in 



The Body 


141 


which one should and should not consume them. He will give 
only two paragraphs to sexual regimen, citing a text by Rufus, 
another by Galen. One may think that this limitation reflects, 
more than anything else, an attitude characteristic of Oriba- 
sius and his epoch. But it is a trait manifested by all Greek and 
Roman medicine to accord much more space to the dietetics 
of alimentation than to that of sex. For this medicine, the 
thing that matters is eating and drinking. A whole develop¬ 
ment—evident in Christian monasticism—will be necessary 
before the preoccupation with sex will begin to match the 
preoccupation with food. But alimentary abstentions and fasts 
will long remain fundamental. And it will be an important 
moment for the history of ethics in European societies when 
apprehension about sex and its regimen will significantly out¬ 
weigh the rigor of alimentary prescriptions. In the Roman 
epoch, at all events, the regimen of sexual pleasures holds a 
relatively limited place next to the great alimentary regimen, 
just as, moreover, these pleasures themselves are associated in 
moral thought and social ritual with the delights of eating and 
drinking. The banquet, an occasion shared by gluttony, 
drunkenness, and love, is a direct testimony of this associa¬ 
tion; the latter is attested indirectly by the inverse ritual of the 
philosophical symposium, where the food is always measured, 
the drunkenness is still capable of truth, and the love is an 
object of reasonable discourses. 

2. In these medical regimens, one sees a certain “patholog- 
ization” of the sexual act take shape. But there must be no 
misunderstanding on this point: the development in question 
is in no way similar to the one that occurred much later in 
Western societies, when sexual behavior was perceived as a 
bearer of unhealthy deviations. In the latter case, it was to be 
organized as a domain that would have its normal forms and 
its morbid forms, its specific pathology, its nosography and 
etiology—to say nothing of its therapeutics. Greco-Roman 
medicine operates differently. It inscribes the sexual act within 
a field where it constantly risks being affected and disturbed 



142 


The Care of the Self 


by alterations in the organism—and where, conversely, it al¬ 
ways risks inducing diseases of various kinds, proximate and 
distant. 

We may speak of pathologization in two senses. First, be¬ 
cause the disturbing effects are attributed not only to the great 
excesses in the practice of sex but also to the very nature of 
the process—to the expenditures, tremors, perturbations, that 
it provokes in the organism; but, above all, because these 
medical analyses tend to overturn the representations of the 
sexual act as an activity, as an energy whose violence is the 
only thing to be feared. They describe it rather as a process 
in which the individual is passively overcome by the mech¬ 
anisms of the body and the movements of the soul, so that he 
must reestablish his mastery by means of a precise adjustment 
to the needs of nature alone. It is important to understand that 
this medicine of the chresis aphrodision did not aim to delimit 
the “pathological” forms of sexual behavior: rather, it uncov¬ 
ered, at the root of sexual acts, an element of passivity that was 
also a source of illness, according to the double meaning of the 
word pathos. The sexual act is not an evil; it manifests a 
permanent focus of possible ills. 

3. A medical science of this sort requires an extreme vigi¬ 
lance toward sexual activity. But this attention does not lead 
to a decipherment of that activity in its origin and unfolding; 
it is not a matter of the subject’s knowing precisely how things 
are with his own desire, with the movements that lead him to 
the sexual act, with the choices he makes, with the forms of 
acts he commits or the modes of pleasure he experiences. The 
attention he must give is that which keeps him mindful of the 
rules to which he must refer his sexual activity. He is not 
expected to rediscover the obscure processes of desire working 
within him; he needs to recognize the numerous complex 
conditions that must be jointly present if one is to perform the 
acts of pleasure in an appropriate manner, without danger or 
harm. He must address a discourse of “truth” to himself. But 
this discourse does not have the function of telling the subject 



The Body 


143 


the truth about himself; it should teach him, given what sexual 
acts are by nature, how to resort to them in a way that con¬ 
forms as closely, as strictly as possible to that nature. Georges 
Canguilhem said that “the cause of the cure” for Aristotle 
“was the form of health in one’s medical activity”; that it was 
not the physician but rather “health that cured the patient”; 
and that, broadly speaking, “the responsibility for a technical 
production did not belong to the artisan but to the art ... ; 
the Art, which is to say, the nondeliberative finality of a 
natural logos.” 21 Similarly, one might say that the regimen of 
the aphrodisia, the regimen of their distribution, as proposed 
by medicine, needed to be nothing more nor less than the form 
of their nature present to thought, their truth dwelling in 
conduct as its constant prescription. 


4. Between these dietetic recommendations and the pre¬ 
cepts that are to be found later, in Christian ethics and medical 
thought, the analogies are numerous: the principle of a strict 
economy aiming at scarcity; a dread of individual misfortunes 
or collective ills that can be caused by disorderly sexual behav¬ 
ior; the need for a rigorous mastery of desires, for a struggle 
against images and a disallowance of pleasure as the goal of 
sexual intercourse. These analogies are not distant resem¬ 
blances. Several continuities can be identified. Certain of them 
are indirect, relayed through philosophical doctrines: the rule 
according to which pleasure must not be a goal was doubtless 
conveyed into Christianity more by philosophers than by 
physicians. But there are also direct continuities. The treatise 
by Basil of Ancyra on virginity—its author is thought to have 
been a physician—refers to considerations that are clearly 
medical. Saint Augustine makes use of Soranus in his polemic 
against Julian of Eclana. One must not forget, either, the 
explicit references to Roman and Greek medicine that were 
made in the eighteenth century and the first half of the nine¬ 
teenth, during the time of a major new development in the 
pathology of sex. 



144 


The Care of the Self 


By focusing only on these common traits, one may get the 
impression that the sexual ethics attributed to Christianity or 
even to the modern West was already in place, at least with 
respect to its basic principles, at the time when Greco-Roman 
culture reached its culmination. But this would be to disregard 
fundamental differences concerning the type of relation to the 
self and hence the forms of integration of these precepts in the 
subject’s experience of himself. 22 



PART FIVE 

The Wife 




The great classical texts that dealt with the question of 
marriage—Xenophon’s Oeconomicus, Plato’s Republic and 
Laws, Aristotle’s Politics and Nicomachean Ethics, the Aris¬ 
totelian Economics —inscribed their reflection on marital rela¬ 
tions within a broad context: the city, with the laws or customs 
necessary to its survival and its prosperity; the household, 
with the organization that made possible its maintenance or 
enrichment. From this subordination of marriage to civic or 
familial utilities one should not infer that marriage itself was 
considered an unimportant tie that had no value other than 
that of producing descendants for the benefit of families and 
states. We have seen how demanding were the precepts that 
Xenophon, Isocrates, Plato, or Aristotle imposed on spouses 
so that they might conduct themselves properly in marriage; 
the privilege to which the wife was entitled, the justice owed 
to her, the care taken to set an example for her, to train her: 
all this would suggest a mode of relations that went far beyond 
generative functions alone. But marriage required a particular 
style of conduct, especially insofar as the married man was the 
head of the family, an honorable citizen, or a man who aspired 
to exercise over others an authority that was both political and 
moral; and in this art of being married it was the requisite 
self-mastery that was expected to give its particular form to 
the behavior of the reasonable, moderate, and just man. 

The ethics of matrimonial behavior appears in a rather 

147 



148 


The Care of the Self 


different light in a series of texts that spread out from the first 
two centuries b.c. to the second century of our era, over the 
length of that period in which one notes a certain change in 
the practice of marriage. We thus have the Peri gamou by 
Antipater, the Latin translation of a Greek text that was for 
a long time held to be the last part of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle, the different passages Musonius devotes to mar¬ 
riage, the Marriage Precepts by Plutarch and his Dialogue on 
Love, the treatise on marriage by Hierocles, without counting 
the indications that one can find in Seneca, Epictetus, and 
certain Pythagorean texts. 1 

Must it be said that marriage became a more insistent and 
more often debated question than in the past? Should one 
suppose that the choice of the matrimonial life and the way 
one was expected to conduct oneself in it occasioned in this 
period more apprehension and that they were more carefully 
problematized? It is doubtless not possible to give an answer 
in quantitative terms. It does seem, however, that the art of 
leading the married life was considered and defined in several 
important texts in a relatively new way. The first change 
appears to consist in the fact that the art of matrimonial 
existence, while continuing to be concerned with the house¬ 
hold, its management, the birth and procreation of children, 
places an increasing value on a particular element in the midst 
of this ensemble: the personal relationship between husband 
and wife, the tie that joins them, their behavior toward each 
other. And this relationship, rather than borrowing its impor¬ 
tance from the other exigencies of the life of a master of a 
household, seems to be regarded as a primary and fundamen¬ 
tal element around which all the others are organized, from 
which they derive, and to which they owe their strength. In 
sum, the art of conducting oneself in marriage would appear 
to be defined less by a technique of government and more by 
a stylistics of the individual bond. 

/ The second change resides in the fact that the principle of 
moderate conduct in a married man is placed more in the 
duties of reciprocity than in mastery over others; or rather, in 



The Wife 


149 


the fact that the dominion of oneself over oneself is increas¬ 
ingly manifested in the practice of obligations with regard to 
others and above all in showing a certain respect for one’s 
wife. The intensification of the concern for the self goes hand 
in hand with a valorization of the other. The new way in which 
the question of sexual “fidelity” is sometimes formulated at¬ 
tests to this change. Finally, and this is the most important 
point in the present context, this art of marriage—in the 
form of a symmetrical relationship—accords a comparatively 
greater place to the problems of sexual relations between 
spouses. These problems are still treated in a rather discreet 
and allusive manner, but the fact remains that one finds, in 
authors like Plutarch, a concern with defining a certain way 
for marriage partners to act, to conduct themselves in pleasure 
relations. Here the interest in procreation is combined with 
other significations and values, which have to do with love, 
affection, understanding, and mutual sympathy. 

Once again, I am not claiming that such behaviors or senti¬ 
ments were unknown in the classical period and that they 
appeared subsequently: to establish changes of that order 
would demand an entirely different documentation and very 
different analyses as well. But it does appear—if we are to 
believe the texts we possess—that these attitudes, these ways 
of behaving, of acting and feeling, became themes of prob- 
lematization, objects of philosophical discussion, and elements 
of a deliberative art of self-conduct. 2 A stylistics of living as 
a couple emerges from the traditional precepts of matrimonial 
management: it can be observed rather clearly in an art of 
conjugal relationship, in a doctrine of sexual monopoly, and 
in an aesthetics of shared pleasures. 



I 


The Marriage Tie 


In several of these reflections on marriage, and particularly 
in the Stoic texts of the first two centuries, one discerns the 
elaboration of a certain model of relationship between spouses. 
Not that there is any notion of imposing new institutional 
forms on marriage, or any suggestion of fitting it into a differ¬ 
ent legal framework. But, without calling the traditional struc¬ 
tures into question, there is an attempt to define a mode of 
coexistence between husband and wife, a modality of relations 
between them, and a way of living together that are rather 
different from what was proposed in the classical texts. 
Schematizing a good deal, perhaps, and employing a some¬ 
what anachronistic vocabulary, we may say that marriage is 
no longer conceived simply as a “matrimonial form” fixing the 
complementarity of roles in the management of the house¬ 
hold, but also and above all as a “marriage tie” and a personal 
relationship between the man and the woman. This art of 
married living defines a relation that is dual in its form, uni¬ 
versal in its value, and specific in its intensity and its strength. 

1. A dual relation. If there is one thing that is in conform¬ 
ity with nature (kata physin) it is marrying, says Musonius 
Rufus.’ And in order to explain that nothing could be more 
essential than the discourse he is undertaking on the subject 
of marriage, Hierocles declares that it is Nature who causes 
our species to prefer that form of community. 2 

150 



The Wife 


151 


These principles merely restated a lesson that was entirely 
traditional. The naturalness of marriage, though it was dis¬ 
puted by certain philosophical schools, and by the Cynics in 
particular, had been broadly founded on a series of reasons: 
the indispensable joining of male and female for procreation; 
the necessity of prolonging this conjunction, of transforming 
it into a stable union in order to ensure the education of 
offspring; the combination of assistance, comforts, and plea¬ 
sures that married life can provide, with its services and its 
obligations; and lastly, the forming of the family as the basic 
unit of the city. As for the first of these functions, the union 
of man and woman was sanctioned by a principle common to 
all animals. In regard to the others, this union manifested the 
forms of an existence that was generally considered to be 
properly human and reasonable. 

This classical theme of marriage as something natural by 
virtue of its twofold contribution to procreation and commu¬ 
nity life was taken up by the Stoics of the imperial epoch, but 
they transformed it in a significant way. 

Musonius first of all. One notes in his formulations a certain 
shift of emphasis from the “procreative” aim to the “commu¬ 
nal” finality. A passage from the treatise On the Purpose of 
Marriage is revealing in this connection. 3 It begins with the 
duality of the goals of marriage: descendants to beget, a life 
to share. But Musonius immediately adds that while procrea¬ 
tion may very well be an important thing, it could not in itself 
justify marriage. Recalling an objection made often by the 
Cynics, he points out that if it were only a matter of begetting 
offspring, humans could very well behave like the animals: 
join together and immediately separate. If they do not do so, 
it is because the essential thing for them is community: a 
companionship in which they exchange mutual care, in which 
they compete in attentiveness and kindness for one another, 
and in which the two partners can be compared to two beasts 
in a yoke, which make no progress if each one looks off to its 
side. It would be incorrect to say that Musonius gives prefer¬ 
ence to relations of help and comfort over the objective goal 



152 


The Care of the Self 


of descendants. But these goals have to fit into a single form, 
which is that of a common life; the mutual solicitude that is 
shown by the partners and the progeny they rear together are 
two aspects of this essential form. 

Musonius indicates in another passage how this form of 
unity has been inscribed by Nature in each individual. The 
treatise Is Marriage a Handicap for the Pursuit of Philosophy? 
evokes the original division brought about in the human spe¬ 
cies between men and women. 4 Musonius reflects on the fact 
that after having separated the two sexes, the Creator wished 
to bring them back together. Now, Musonius notes, he 
brought them together again by implanting in each of them a 
“strong desire,” a desire that was both for “association” and 
for “union”— homilia and koindnia. Of the two terms, the 
first seems in fact to refer to sexual intercourse, the second to 
community life. What should be understood, then, is that 
there is a certain fundamental and original desire in human 
beings, and that this desire is directed toward physical inti¬ 
macy as well as toward the sharing of existence. A thesis that 
has this double consequence: that the extreme intensity of 
desire is not characterized simply by the movement that leads 
to the conjoining of the sexes, but also by the movement that 
conduces to the sharing of lives; conversely, that the relation¬ 
ship between the sexes belongs to the same rational scheme as 
the relations that bind two individuals to one another through 
interest, affection, and community of souls. It is the same 
natural inclination that leads, with an equal intensity and a 
rationality of the same type, to the coupling of existences and 
to the joining of bodies. 

For Musonius, then, what founds marriage is not that it is 
situated at the point of intersection of two heterogeneous 
predilections, one of which is physical, the other rational and 
social. It is rooted in a single, primitive tendency that aims 
directly toward it as an essential goal and hence, through it, 
toward its two intrinsic effects: the formation of a common 
progeny and companionship in life. One understands how 
Musonius can say that nothing is more desirable (prosphilo- 



The Wife 


153 


steron) than marriage. The naturalness of the latter is not due 
merely to the consequences that one can derive from its prac¬ 
tice; its naturalness is already declared by the existence of 
an original predilection, which establishes it as a desirable 
objective. 

Hierocles, in a rather similar way, founds marriage on the 
“binary” nature of man. For him, humans are “conjugal” 
animals (syndyastikoi ). 5 The notion was already present in the 
Naturalists: they distinguished between animals that herd to¬ 
gether (synagelastikoi) and those that live in pairs (syndyas¬ 
tikoi). Moreover, Plato had referred to this distinction in a 
passage of the Laws. He recommended to humans the example 
of those animals that are chaste so long as they are living in 
a band but pair off and become “conjugal” when the mating 
season arrives. Aristotle had likewise spoken of the “syndas- 
tic” character of human beings, in order to define the relations 
of the master with the slave as well as relations between 
spouses. 6 

Hierocles uses the notion for different ends. He applies it 
exclusively to the conjugal relation, of which, in his view, it 
is the founding principle and natural basis. Humans are binary 
by nature; they are made to live in pairs, in a relation that at 
the same time gives them descendants and enables them to live 
their lives with a partner. For Hierocles and Musonius alike, 
Nature is not content to make allowance for marriage; she 
incites individuals to marry through a primordial inclination; 
she urges each of them to do so, including the philosopher 
himself. Nature and reason coincide in the movement that 
conduces to marriage. But it should further be noted that 
Hierocles does not oppose, as if it were a matter of two incom¬ 
patible possibilities, the syndastic character of human beings, 
which causes them to live in pairs, and their “synagelastic” 
character, which causes them to live in groups. Humans are 
made to live in twos and also to live in a multiplicity. Mankind 
is at once conjugal and social; the dual relation and the plural 
relation are linked together. Hierocles explains that a city is 
made up of households that constitute its basic units, but in 



154 


The Care of the Self 


each one it is the couple that constitutes both its founding 
principle and its finished form, so that a household is not 
complete unless it is organized around a couple. One thus 
finds this conjugal duality over the entire course of human 
existence and in all of its aspects: in the original constitution 
that Nature has given it; in the obligations that man is under 
insofar as he is a creature endowed with reason; in the form 
of social life that ties him to the human community of which 
he is a part. As an animal, as a reasonable creature, and as an 
individual whose reason connects him to the human race, man 
is, in every respect, a conjugal being. 

2. A universal relation. For a long time, the question of 
knowing whether or not one should marry had been, in philo¬ 
sophical reflection on ways of living, a subject of discussion. 
The advantages and disadvantages of marriage; the usefulness 
of having a lawful wife and, through her, of providing oneself 
with honorable descendants; the cares and troubles, on the 
other hand, when one had to support one’s wife, look after 
one’s children, supply their needs, and at times face their 
illness or their death—these were the inexhaustible themes of 
a debate that was sometimes serious, sometimes ironic, and 
always repetitious. The echoes of it will be heard very late in 
antiquity. Epictetus and Clement of Alexandria, Pseudo- 
Lucian, the author of Affairs of the Heart, or Libanius in the 
treatise Ei gameteon (Whether One Should Marry), will draw 
from this stock of arguments, which scarcely changed over the 
centuries. The Epicureans and the Cynics were theoretically 
opposed to marriage. It seems that the Stoics were, on the 
contrary, favorable toward it from the start. 7 In any case, the 
thesis that one ought to marry seems to have become very 
common in Stoicism and entirely characteristic of its individ¬ 
ual and social ethics. But what makes the Stoic position im¬ 
portant for the history of ethics is the fact that it was not 
formulated as a simple preference for marriage by reason of 
the latter’s advantages and in spite of its disadvantages; mar¬ 
rying, for Musonius, Epictetus, or Hierocles, is something one 



The Wife 


155 


does, not because it is “better,” but because it is a duty. The 
marital tie derives from a universal rule. This general principle 
is supported by two types of reflection. For the Stoics, the 
obligation to marry is first of all the direct consequence of the 
principle that marriage was ordained by Nature and that 
human beings are led to it by an impulse which, being at once 
natural and rational, is the same in everyone. But it is also 
implied as an element in a set of tasks and duties that must 
not be evaded by any human being who acknowledges himself 
to be a member of a community and a part of the human race. 
Marriage is one of those duties by which private existence 
acquires a value for all. 

Epictetus’ discussion with an Epicurean shows clearly this 
recognition of marriage as a universal duty for every human 
being who wishes to live in harmony with nature, and as a 
function for the individual who aims to lead a life that is useful 
to those around him and to humanity in general. The Epicu¬ 
rean whom Epictetus refutes in Discourse Seven of Book III 
is a leading citizen; he exercises responsibilities; he is an “in¬ 
spector of cities.” But, out of faithfulness to his philosophical 
principles, he rejects marriage. To which Epictetus retorts 
with three arguments. The first refers to immediate utility and 
to the impossibility of universalizing the renunciation of mar¬ 
riage: if everyone refuses to get married, “what is to happen 
then? Where will our citizens come from? Who will educate 
them? Who will be governor of the ephebes? Who will manage 
the gymnasia? Yes, and what will be their education?” The 
second argument refers to the social obligations that no man 
must shirk and of which marriage forms a part, alongside the 
duties that pertain to political life, religion, and the family: 
“citizenship, marriage, procreation of children, worship of 
God, care of parents.” The final argument concerns the natu¬ 
ralness of a behavior that reason prescribes: “We must subor¬ 
dinate pleasure to these principles, to minister to them as a 
servant, to evoke our interests, and to keep us in the way of 
our natural activities.” 8 

We see then that the principle of having to marry has be- 



156 


The Care of the Self 


come detached from the comparative interplay between the 
advantages and drawbacks of marriage. It is expressed as the 
need for everyone to make a choice of a life that assumes the 
form of a universal, in that it conforms to nature and is useful 
to all. Marriage joins man to himself insofar as he is a natural 
being and a member of the human race. Epictetus says as 
much to his Epicurean interlocutor, in taking leave of him: by 
not doing what Zeus prescribes, “you will suffer penalty and 
harm. What kind of harm? No harm but that of failing to do 
your duty; you will destroy the trustworthy, self-respecting, 
well-behaved man in you. Look not for any greater harm than 
this!” 9 

And yet, it was the same with marriage as with all the other 
practices that the Stoics classed among the proegoumena, the 
things that are preferable. There may be circumstances in 
which it is not obligatory. This is what Hierocles says: “Mar¬ 
rying is preferable [proegoumenon ]; hence it is an imperative 
for us provided that no circumstance opposes it.” 10 It is pre¬ 
cisely in this relationship between the obligation to marry and 
the conjuncture of circumstances that the difference between 
the Stoics and the Epicureans was most pronounced. For the 
Epicureans, no one was obliged to marry, unless there existed 
a circumstance that could make this form of union desirable. 
For the Stoics, only particular circumstances could lift an 
obligation that in theory one could not escape. 

Among these circumstances, there was one that was long an 
object of discussion: the choice of the philosophical lif e. That 
the marriage of philosophers had been, since the classical age, 
a theme of debate can be explained by several factors: the 
heterogeneity of this type of life compared with other forms 
of existence; the incompatibility between the goal of philoso¬ 
phy (the care of one’s own soul, the mastery of one’s passion, 
the search for peace of mind) and what was traditionally 
described as the agitation and troubles of married life. In 
short, it seemed difficult to reconcile the style characteristic of 
the philosophical life with the demands of a marriage defined, 
above all, by its responsibilities. Two important texts show, 



The Wife 


157 


however, an entirely different way not only of resolving the 
difficulty but of posing the very elements of the problem. 

Musonius is the author of the oldest. In his text he takes up 
the question of the practical incompatibility between the mar¬ 
ried life and the philosophical life, turning it into the affirma¬ 
tion of an essential connection between the two. 11 Anyone who 
would be a philosopher, he says, should marry. He should do 
so because the primary function of philosophy is to enable one 
to live in accord with nature and to fulfill all the obligations 
that follow from nature. He will take as his “teacher and 
guide” that which is fitting for a human being who conforms 
to nature. But, further, he is under a greater obligation to 
marry than anyone else, for the philosopher’s role is not sim¬ 
ply to live according to reason; he must be for everyone else 
an example of that reasonable life as well as a master who 
shows the way to it. The philosopher cannot be inferior to 
those he must advise and lead. If he were to refuse marriage, 
he would be showing himself inferior to all those who, obeying 
reason and following nature, practice, out of concern for 
themselves and for others, matrimonial life. The latter, far 
from being incompatible with philosophy, constitutes for it a 
double obligation. In relation to oneself, it is the duty of giving 
one’s existence a universally valuable form, and in relation to 
others, it is the necessity of offering them a model of living. 

One might be tempted to oppose to this analysis the one that 
Epictetus submits when he draws the ideal portrait of the 
Cynic, of the man who makes a profession of philosophizing, 
who must be the common pedagogue, the herald of truth, 
Zeus’ messenger to humans, who goes on stage to challenge 
men and to reproach them for the way they live. Such a man 
rightly “has nothing, is naked, without home or hearth; he 
lives in squalor, without a slave, without a city.” Nor does he 
have “a wife or children,” but “only earth and sky and one 
poor cloak.” 12 Moreover, Epictetus presents a familiar picture 
of marriage and its disadvantages. In its banal verve, it con¬ 
forms to what had been said for a very long time concerning 
the “annoyances of housekeeping,” which disturb the soul and 



158 


The Care of the Self 


interfere with reflection. Married, a man is bound by “private 
duties.” He has to heat the water for the cooking pot, accom¬ 
pany the children to school, render service to his father-in- 
law, provide his wife with wool, oil, a bed, and a cup. 13 At first 
glance, this looks like nothing more than the long list of 
obligations that burden the sage and prevent him from attend¬ 
ing to himself. But the reason for which the ideal Cynic 
should, according to Epictetus, forgo marriage is not the de¬ 
sire to reserve his attentions for himself and no one else. On 
the contrary, it is because he has the mission of caring for 
humans, of looking after them, of being their “benefactor.” It 
is because, like a doctor, he must “make his rounds” and “feel 
men’s pulses.” 14 Kept occupied by the responsibilities of a 
household (and perhaps especially by the household Epictetus 
describes), he would not have the leisure to go about a task 
that takes in the whole of humanity. His renunciation of all 
these private ties is but the consequence of the ties he estab¬ 
lishes, qua philosopher, with the human race. He has no 
family because his family is mankind; he has no children 
because, in a sense, he has fathered all men and all women. It 
is important to understand, therefore, that the responsibility 
for the universal family is what prevents the Cynic from devot¬ 
ing himself to a particular household. 

But Epictetus does not stop there. He fixes a limit to this 
incompatibility. It is limited by the present situation, by what 
he calls the current “catastasis” of the world. If in fact we 
lived in a city of wise men, there would be no further need of 
these men who are sent by the gods and who, unburdening 
themselves of everything, rise up to awaken others to truth. 
Everyone would be a philosopher. The Cynic and his rude 
profession would be unnecessary. Furthermore, marriage, in 
this state of things, would not present the same kind of difficul¬ 
ties as it does today, in the present form of humanity. Each 
philosopher would be able to find in his wife, in his father-in- 
law, in his children, people like him and brought up in the 
same manner as he. 15 The conjugal relation would bring the

sage face to face with an alter ego. Hence it must be borne in 
mind that the militant philosopher’s refusal of marriage does 
not bespeak an essential condemnation. It answers only to a 
circumstantial necessity. The philosopher’s celibacy could just 
as well be abandoned if all humans were in a condition to lead 
an existence conforming to their essential nature. 

3. A singular relation. The philosophers of the imperial 
epoch obviously did not invent the affective dimension of the 
conjugal relationship, just as they did not efface the useful 
purposes it might serve in individual, familial, or civic life. But 
to that relationship and to the way in which it established a 
bond between husband and wife, they proposed to give a form 
and particular qualities. 

Aristotle ascribed considerable importance and strength to 
the relationship between spouses. But when he analyzed the 
ties that attach humans to one another, it was blood relations 
that he seemed to favor. According to him, no tie was more 
intense than the attachment of parents to their children, in 
whom they could recognize a part of themselves. 16 The hierar¬ 
chy Musonius posits in the treatise Is Marriage a Handicap for 
the Pursuit of Philosophy? is different. Of all the communities 
that can be established among humans, Musonius designates 
marriage as the highest, the most important, and the most 
venerable (presbytate). It is greater in strength than that which 
can join a friend to a friend, a brother to a brother, a son to 
his parents. It even surpasses—this is the decisive point—the 
bond that attaches parents to their offspring. No father, no 
mother, writes Musonius, will feel greater friendship for their 
child than for their marriage partner, and he cites the example 
of Admetus: Who was willing to die for him? Not his old 
parents, but his wife, Alcestis, in spite of her youth. 17 

Conceived in this way, as a closer and more fundamental 
relationship than any other, the marriage tie serves to define 
a whole mode of existence. Married life had been character¬ 
ized by an allocation of tasks and behaviors that were comple- 



160 


The Care of the Self 


mentary in form. The man was expected to do those things 
which the wife could not do, and she, for her part, did the 
work that was not within the competence of the husband. It 
was the fact of having the same goal (the prosperity of the 
household) that gave a unity to these activities and to modes 
of life that were different by definition. This adjustment of 
specific roles did not disappear from the set of precepts for 
living that could be given to married people. Hierocles refers, 
in his Economics, to rules that are identical to those found in 
Xenophon. 18 But behind this distribution of behaviors relating 
to the house, the possessions, and the estate, one sees a shared 
life and a common existence being affirmed as an exigency. 
The art of marriage is not simply a rational way for the 
spouses to act, each on his or her own account, in view of a 
purpose both partners recognize and in which they are united. 
It is a way of living together and of being as one person. 
Marriage calls for a certain style of conduct in which each of 
the two partners leads his or her life with the other, and in 
which, together, they form a common existence. 

This style of existence is characterized first of all by a cer¬ 
tain art of being together. For his business affairs, the husband 
must be away from home, while the wife must remain at home. 
But good spouses will want to rejoin one another and remain 
separated as little as possible. Closeness, the other’s presence, 
living side by side, are presented not simply as duties, but as 
an aspiration characteristic of the relationship that should join 
husband and wife. They may each have their roles; there is no 
question of their doing without each other. Musonius under¬ 
scores the need felt by spouses in a good marriage to be 
together. He even makes the difficulty of being apart the crite¬ 
rion of their singular friendship. No absence, he says, is as 
difficult to endure as, for the wife, that of the husband and, for 
the husband, that of the wife. No presence has such a power 
to lighten grief, to increase joy, to remedy misfortune. 19 The 
presence of the spouse is at the heart of married life. One 
thinks of Pliny describing to his absent wife the nights and 



The Wife 


161 


days he spends looking for her in vain, and recalling her face 
in order to evoke a quasi-presence in his mind. 20 

An art of being together, and an art of dialogue as well. To 
be sure, the Oeconomicus of Xenophon described a certain 
model of exchange between the two spouses. The husband was 
supposed above all to guide, to give advice, to instruct, and, 
when required, to direct her in her activity as mistress of the 
house. For her part, the wife needed to ask questions about 
those things she did not know and to give an account of what 
she had been able to accomplish. The later texts suggest an¬ 
other kind of dialogue, with different ends. Each of the two 
spouses, according to Hierocles, should report to the other 
concerning what they have done. The wife will tell the hus¬ 
band what is going on at home, but she will also need to ask 
him about what is happening on the outside. 21 Pliny likes 
Calpurnia to keep informed of his public activity, to encourage 
him, and to rejoice in his successes—a custom that had long 
been traditional in aristocratic Roman families. But he associ¬ 
ates it directly with his work; and in return, the taste his wife 
has for belles-lettres is inspired by the tenderness she feels for 
her husband. She must be the witness and judge of his literary 
endeavors. She reads his works, listens to his speeches, and 
receives with pleasure the compliments she may hear. Pliny 
trusts that in this way mutual affection, concordia, will endure 
and grow stronger day by day. 22 

Whence the idea that married life must also be the art of 
collaborating to form a new unity. One recalls how Xenophon 
had distinguished the different qualities with which nature 
had endowed the man and the woman so that they might carry 
out their respective responsibilities in the household, or how 
Aristotle bestowed on men the possibility of developing, to the 
point of perfection, virtues which in women would always 
remain inferior, justifying their subordination. The Stoics, on 
the other hand, granted both sexes, if not identical aptitudes, 
at least an equal capability for virtue. The good marriage, 
according to Musonius, depends on homonoia. What is meant 



162 


The Care of the Self 


by this word is not just likemindedness between the partners; 
rather, it denotes an identity in their way of being reasonable, 
in their moral attitude, and in their virtue. The couple is 
expected to form a veritable ethical unity in marital life. This 
unity is compared by Musonius to the fitting of two pieces of 
wood in a frame: they must both be straight in order to consti¬ 
tute a solid whole. 23 But in order to characterize the substan¬ 
tial unity the couple must form, writers occasionally resort to 
another metaphor, stronger than that of pieces fitted together: 
di'holdn krasis, complete fusion, according to a notion bor¬ 
rowed from Stoic physics. 

The treatise by Antipater had already appealed to this 
model in order to contrast conjugal affection with the other 
forms of friendship. 24 He described the latter as combinations 
in which the elements remain independent of each other, like 
the seeds that one mixes and that can be separated again. The 
term mixis denotes this type of blending by juxtaposition. By 
contrast, marriage should be in the nature of a total fusion, 
like that observed between water and wine, which form by 
their mixture a new liquid. This same notion of matrimonial 
“crasis” is reencountered in Plutarch, in the thirty-fourth of 
the Marriage Precepts. It is used to distinguish between three 
types of marriage and to rank them in relation to one another. 
There are marriages that are contracted solely for the plea¬ 
sures of the bed. They belong in the category of those mixtures 
that juxtapose separate elements, each of which retains its 
individuality. There are marriages that are concluded for rea¬ 
sons of self-interest. They are like those combinations in which 
the elements form a new, solid unity, but can always be dis¬ 
sociated from one another: e.g., the unity constituted by the 
parts of a frame. As for total fusion—the “crasis” that ensures 
the formation of a new unity that nothing can undo—only 
marriages in which the spouses are bound together by love can 
achieve it. 25 * 

By themselves these few texts cannot represent the actual

intertwining of strands.” 



The Wife 


163 


practice of marriage in the first centuries of our era, or even 
sum up the theoretical debates to which it may have given rise. 
They have to be taken in their partiality, for what they present 
that was characteristic of certain doctrines and no doubt pecu¬ 
liar to a few limited milieus. But they reveal, albeit in frag¬ 
ments, the outlines of a “strong model” of conjugal existence. 
In this model, the relationship to the other that appears as the 
most fundamental of all is neither the blood relationship nor 
that of friendship; it is the relationship between a man and a 
woman when it is organized in the institutional form of mar¬ 
riage and in the common life that is superimposed on the 
latter. The familial system and the friendship network have 
doubtless retained a large part of their social importance. 
However, in the art of existence they lose some of their value 
in comparison with the tie that attaches two persons of differ¬ 
ent sexes. A natural privilege, at once ontological and ethical, 
is granted to this dual, heterosexual relationship at the ex¬ 
pense of all others. 

In light of the above, one understands what was no doubt 
one of the most characteristic features of this art of being 
married—that attention to oneself and devotion to conjugal 
life could be closely associated. If relationship with a woman 
who is “the wife,” “the spouse,” is essential to existence, if 
human beings are conjugal individuals whose nature is 
fulfilled in the practice of shared life, then there could not be 
an essential and primary incompatibility between the relation¬ 
ship one establishes with oneself and the rapport one forms 
with the other. The art of conjugality is an integral part of the 
cultivation of the self. 

But the individual who is concerned about himself does not 
simply have to marry; he must give his married life a deliber¬ 
ate form and a particular style. This style, with the moderation 
it requires, is not defined by self-mastery alone and by the 
principle that one must govern oneself in order to be able to 
rule others. It is also defined by the elaboration of a certain 
form of reciprocity. In the conjugal bond that so strongly 
marks the existence of each person, the spouse, as privileged 



164 


The Care of the Self 


partner, must be treated as a being identical to oneself and as 
an element with whom one forms a substantial unity. Such is 
the paradox of this thematics of marriage in the cultivation of 
the self, as it was developed by an entire philosophy. The 
woman as spouse is valorized within it as the other par excel¬ 
lence. But the husband must also recognize her as forming a 
unity with himself. Compared with the traditional forms of 
matrimonial relations, the change was considerable.

The Question of 
Monopoly 


One might expect that the treatises on matrimonial life 
would assign an important role to the regimen of sexual rela¬ 
tions that must be established between husband and wife. In 
actual fact, the place reserved for them is relatively limited. It 
is as if the objectivation of the conjugal relation had preceded, 
and by far, the objectivation of the sexual relations that devel¬ 
oped within it. As if all the effort and attention that needed 
to be devoted to living together continued to leave the question 
of conjugal sex in the shadows. 

A discretion that was traditional, no doubt. Plato, at the 
point where he is nevertheless about to legislate on these mat¬ 
ters—determining the precautions to take in order to produce 
healthy children, prescribing the physical and moral state of 
future parents, even instituting female inspectors who will 
need to look into the lives of young married couples—under¬ 
scores the difficulty people probably would have in accept¬ 
ing legislation concerned with such things. 1 Opposing this 
Greek discretion, there will be the meticulous attentiveness of 
the Christian pastoral ministry, starting in the Middle Ages. 
One will then attempt to regulate everything—positions, fre¬ 
quency, gestures, each partner’s state of mind, knowledge by 
the one of the intentions of the other, signs of desire on one 
side, tokens of acceptance on the other, and so on. For its part, 
Hellenistic and Roman moral philosophy says little on this 
subject. 


165 



166 


The Care of the Self 


Yet several important principles bearing on the relations 
between the use of pleasure and married life are formulated in 
certain of these texts. 

We have seen that traditionally the connection between the 
sexual act and marriage was established on the basis and in 
terms of the need to have descendants. This procreative aim 
figured among the reasons for marrying. It was what made 
sexual relations within marriage necessary. Its absence, more¬ 
over, was what could dissolve the conjugal union. It was in 
order to take account of the best possible conditions for pro¬ 
creation that certain recommendations were made to married 
people regarding the proper way to perform the conjugal act 
(the time one should choose, the regimen that ought to pre¬ 
cede the act). It was also in order to avoid the disadvantages 
of illegitimate offspring that extramarital liaisons were dis¬ 
couraged (for women, certainly, but also for men). Let us say 
schematically that in the classical texts the synthesis of the 
marriage tie and sexual relations was granted mainly for 
reasons pertaining to procreation. For men at least, it was 
neither the very nature of sexual acts nor the essence of mar¬ 
riage itself that implied that there should be pleasure only in 
conjugality. Apart from the question of illegitimate births, and 
allowing for the ethical requirement of self-mastery, there was 
no reason to expect a man, even a married man, to reserve all 
his sexual pleasures for his wife, and for her alone. 

Now in the ethics of strict marriage that we see being for¬ 
mulated in the first centuries of our era, it is easy to ascertain 
something that might be called a “conjugalization” of sexual 
relations—a conjugalization at once direct and reciprocal. Di¬ 
rect: it is the nature of sexual intercourse that must prevent 
one from resorting to it outside marriage. Reciprocal, for it is 
the nature of marriage and of the bond formed between 
spouses that must rule out the sexual pleasures one might find 
elsewhere. The state of marriage and sexual activity must 
therefore coincide, and for good reasons, rather than for the 
sole aim of a legitimate progeny. This coincidence—or rather 
the movement that tends to make them coincide, not without 



The Wife 


167 


a certain number of possible gaps and margins—is manifested 
in the elaboration of two principles. First, given its nature, 
sexual pleasure cannot be allowed outside marriage, which 
implies practically that it should not even be tolerated in an 
unmarried individual. Second, the marriage bond is such that 
the wife risks being hurt not just by the loss of her status but 
by the fact that her husband might take his pleasure with 
someone other than her. 

1. It is doubtless rare to see formulated the principle that 
all sexual relations are culpable if they do not take place in a 
relationship of marriage that makes them legitimate. Provided 
that he exhibits personal moderation and respect for customs, 
laws, and the rights of others, an unmarried man may very 
well enjoy his pleasure as he sees fit. It would be very difficult, 
even within this austere ethics, to oblige him to abstain com¬ 
pletely so long as he has not contracted a marriage. It was 
owing to a great personal virtue that the son of Marcia, by 
Seneca’s account, rejected the advances of the women who 
desired him, even going so far as to blush at the thought of 
pleasing them, as if this were a fault (quasi peccasset ). 2 We 
may also remark that Dio of Prusa shows himself to be very 
severe with regard to prostitution and the way it is organized: 
first, because he sees it as a form of “loveless love,” and a kind 
of union that is foreign to Aphrodite; second, because its 
victims are nonconsenting human beings. Though he hopes 
that a truly well-governed city will abolish these institutions, 
he does not expect such an inveterate evil to be eliminated at 
once. 3 Marcus Aurelius expresses pride in his own sobriety in 
matters of sexual pleasure: he has “preserved [his] adoles¬ 
cence,” he “did not become a man before the proper time,” 
he “even took a little longer.” Now these statements show 
very clearly that the point of virtue is not in the fact that he 
has reserved his pleasures only for marriage, but that he has 
managed to master himself well enough to wait, longer than 
men usually do, for the right time to taste the pleasures of sex. 4 
Epictetus also evokes the ideal of sexual intercourse not taking 



168 


The Care of the Self 


place prior to the marriage tie, but he makes it the object of 
a piece of advice that one gives. This advice is to be followed 
if one can, but there is no reason to make an arrogant precept 
of this sort of chastity: “Before marriage guard yourself with 
all your ability from illicit intercourse with women; yet be not 
uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this, nor boast 
frequently that you yourself do otherwise.” 5 Epictetus does 
not justify the extreme reserve that he demands in the sexual 
relationship by the form of marriage, by the rights and duties 
it establishes and which must be rendered to the wife; he 
explains it by saying that one owes it to oneself since one is 
a fragment of God, that one must honor this principle which 
dwells for a time in the body, and that one must respect it over 
the entire course of one’s everyday existence. Mindfulness of 
one’s own nature, rather than consciousness of one’s ties with 
others, should serve as the permanent basis of austerity: “Will 
you not remember, when you eat, who you are that eat, and 
whom you are feeding, and the same in your relations with 
women? When you take part in society, or training, or conver¬ 
sation, do you not know that it is God you are nourishing and 
training? ... Yet when God himself is present within you and 
sees and hears all things, you are not ashamed of thinking and 
acting thus: so slow to understand your nature, and estranged 
from God!” 6 

On the other hand, it seems that Musonius Rufus under¬ 
takes a thorough conjugalization of sexual activity since he 
condemns all sexual intercourse that does not take place 
within marriage and with a view to the latter’s particular 
objectives. The passage of the treatise on the aphrodisia that 
is preserved in Stobaeus opens with a customary criticism of 
the life of debauchery: a life that, being incapable of exercising 
the necessary mastery over itself, gets caught up in the pursuit 
of rare and affected pleasures and “shameful intimacies.” 
Now, to this banal condemnation, Musonius adds as a positive 
prescription a definition of what must be considered as aphro¬ 
disia dikaia, legitimate pleasures: these, he says, are pleasures 



The Wife 


169 


that the partners enjoy together in marriage and for the pur¬ 
pose of begetting children (ta en gamdi kai epi genesei paidon 
synteloumena). And Musonius then states precisely the two 
hypotheses that can emerge: either extramarital relations are 
sought in adultery (moicheia), and nothing could be more 
unlawful (paranomotatai); or one obtains them without any 
adultery. Yet from the moment they are “without that which 
makes them lawful,” they are themselves shameful and have 
their origin in self-indulgence. 7 Conjugality is for sexual activ¬ 
ity the condition of its legitimate exercise. 

Between the ancient theme that the overly intense pursuit 
of pleasure goes against the necessary self-mastery and the 
principle that there can be legitimate pleasure only in the 
context of the matrimonial institution, there is an important 
threshold that Musonius crosses. He draws the consequence 
this necessarily implies, even if it may have seemed paradoxi¬ 
cal to many of his contemporaries. Moreover, he himself pre¬ 
sents the inference in connection with a possible objection: 
Should one regard as culpable, sexual relations that would 
occur between two free persons not bound by the ties of mar¬ 
riage? “The man who has relations with a courtesan or a 
woman who has no husband wrongs no one for he does not 
destroy anyone’s hope of children.” Even in these circum¬ 
stances, one commits an offense—just as a man can commit 
an offense and an injustice without doing wrong to anyone 
around him: he defiles himself, and “like swine, rejoices in his 
own vileness.” 8 One must also count among the implications 
of this conception of the essential relationship between mar¬ 
riage and sexual activity the objection raised by Musonius to 
contraceptive practices. These practices, he says, in a text 
devoted to the question of whether all children must be raised, 
transgress the laws of cities that take care to maintain their 
population. They are harmful to individuals as well since it is 
useful to have descendants. They also violate the universal 
order that was willed by the gods: “How could we not be 
sinning against our ancestral gods and against Zeus, protector 



170 


The Care of the Self 


of the family, when we do such things? For just as he who 
mistreats a guest sins against Zeus, the protector of the rights 
of hospitality, and he who acts unrighteously to a friend, 
against Zeus, the god of friendship, even so whoever acts 
unrighteously toward his family line sins against his ancestral 
gods and against Zeus, protector of the family.” 9 

Here one might be tempted to see the anticipation of the 
Christian idea that sexual pleasure is in itself a defilement, 
which only the lawful form of marriage, with the possibility 
of procreation, could render acceptable. It is a fact that this 
passage from Musonius was utilized by Clement of Alexandria 
in the second book of the Pedagogue . 10 However, although 
Musonius—like most of the ancient moral philosophers, with 
the exception of the Cynics—does consider the public practice 
of this type of relation to be reprehensible, it would undoubt¬ 
edly be a falsification of his doctrine to attribute to him the 
idea that sexual pleasure is an evil, and that marriage was 
instituted in order to redeem and regulate the necessary expe¬ 
rience of it within a strict framework. If Musonius regards as 
shameful any sexual intercourse outside marriage, it is not 
that the latter has been superimposed on the former so as to 
rid it of its intrinsically wrongful character. It is that, for the 
reasonable and social human being, the very nature of the 
sexual act demands that it be inscribed within the matrimonial 
relation, where it may produce a legitimate progeny. The 
sexual act, the conjugal tie, offspring, the family, the city, and 
beyond it, the human community—all this constitutes a series 
whose elements are connected and in which man’s existence 
achieves its rational form. To withdraw pleasure from this 
form, to detach pleasure from the conjugal relation in order 
to propose other ends for it, is in fact to debase the essential 
composition of the human being. The defilement is not in the 
sexual act itself, but in the “debauchery” that would dissociate 
it from marriage, where it has its natural form and its rational 
purpose. From this perspective, marriage constitutes for 
human beings the only legitimate context for sexual union and 
the experience of the aphrodisia. 



The Wife

2. Given this essential association of sexual relations and 
sexual pleasure with lawful conjugality, one can understand 
the new problematization of adultery and the incipient re¬ 
quirement of double sexual fidelity. 

We know that adultery was juridically condemned and 
morally reproved on account of the injustice done by a man 
to the one whose wife he led astray. What constituted adul¬ 
tery, therefore, in an extramarital sexual relation was the fact 
that the woman was married and that fact alone: the marital 
status of the man was not relevant. The deceit and injury were 
a matter between the two men—the one who had possessed 
himself of the woman and the one who had the legitimate 
rights to her. 11 This definition of adultery, solely in terms of 
the derogation of the husband’s rights, was common enough 
to be found even in an ethics as exacting as that of Epictetus. 12 
In the middle of a lecture on the theme “man is born for 
mutual trust” (pistis), there enters a man of letters (philologos) 
who had been discovered committing adultery and who de¬ 
fends himself by appealing to the doctrine of Archedemus on 
women as common property. The remonstrances that Epic¬ 
tetus addresses to him relate to two points. By the practice of 
adultery the man has transgressed “the principle of trust for 
which we were born.” But Epictetus does not localize this 
“trust” in the matrimonial institution. What is more, he does 
not even cite the marriage bond as one of its essential forms. 
He characterizes it by the ties that join a man to his neighbor¬ 
hood, his friends, his city. And what constitutes in his eyes 
adultery as a transgression is the rent it effects in this fabric 
of relations between men, where each is called upon not only 
to respect others but to recognize himself. “If we put away this 
trust, for which we are born, and plot against our neighbor’s 
wife, what are we doing? Are we not pulling down and de¬ 
stroying? Whom? The man of trust, of honor, of piety. Is this 
all? Are we not overthrowing neighborly feeling, friendship, 
the city itself?” 13 It is to himself and to other men, as human 
beings, that adultery is injurious. 

Yet, contrary to and alongside of this traditional characteri- 



172 


The Care of the Self 


zation of adultery, one finds, in certain reflections on married 
life, exigencies that are much more rigorous, in the double 
sense that they tend to bring more and more into play a 
principle of symmetry between the man and the woman, and 
that they justify this principle by referring to the respect owed 
to the personal bond between the two spouses. Concerning 
those “salutary truths,” which one knows at a distance but 
which, not having been sufficiently dwelled upon, are not 
really capable of governing conduct, Seneca evokes the obliga¬ 
tions of friendship together with those of a strictly symmetri¬ 
cal conjugal fidelity: “You know that friendship should be 
scrupulously honored, and yet you do not hold it in honor. 
You know that a man does wrong in requiring chastity of his 
wife while he himself is intriguing with the wives of other men; 
you know that, as your wife should have no dealings with a 
lover, neither should you yourself with a mistress.” 14 

It is in Musonius that one finds the most detailed statement 
of the principle of a symmetrical conjugality. 15 The argument 
is set forth in the long passage of the treatise On the Aphrodisia 
where it is demonstrated that only marriage can constitute the 
naturally legitimate tie for sexual relations. Musonius focuses 
on what might be called “the problem of the servant.” The 
slave was so taken for granted as a household sexual object 
that it might seem impossible to forbid a married man to use 
her; yet this is precisely what Musonius would prohibit, even, 
he notes, if the slave is not married (which implies that a 
married slave couple in a house was entitled to a certain 
respect). And to justify this prohibition, Musonius posits a 
principle of symmetry, or rather a relatively complex interplay 
between a symmetry with respect to rights and a superiority 
concerning obligations. In the first place, how could one ac¬ 
cept that the husband might have relations with a maid¬ 
servant, whereas one does not recognize the right of a wife to 
have relations with her manservant? The right that is disputed 
on the one hand cannot be granted on the other. And while 
Musonius finds it both natural and lawful for the husband, as 
head of the family, to have more rights than the wife, in the 



The Wife 


173 


domain of sexual relations and pleasures he demands an exact 
symmetry. But, second, this symmetry of rights is completed 
by the need to accentuate, in the sphere of self-mastery, the 
superiority of the husband. If in fact one allowed the husband 
to do with the servant girl that which one expects a wife not 
to do with a slave, one would be supposing that the wife were 
more able than the husband to master herself and govern her 
desires. The one who in the house should be led would then 
be stronger than the one who leads her. For the husband to 
be the one who actually prevails, he must forgo doing that 
which is forbidden a wife. In this Stoic art of marriage, for 
which Musonius proposes such a strict model, a form of 
fidelity is required. It obligates the man and the woman alike. 
It does not merely prohibit anything that might compromise 
the rights of other men. Nor is it content just to protect the 
wife against the threats that could compromise her privileged 
status as mistress of the house and as a mother. It interprets 
the marriage relationship as a system that establishes an exact 
balance of obligations in the practice of pleasure. 

This integral conjugalization of sexual practice that one 
finds in Musonius and the principle of a strict monopoly of the 
aphrodisia reserved for marriage are no doubt exceptional. A 
point has been reached where the art of married life seems to 
be organized around the formal principle of double prohibi¬ 
tion. But in the authors who are careful not to formulate such 
rigid rules, one also notes the emergence of a requirement of 
fidelity calling for slightly different modes of conduct and 
ways of acting. These authors do not assert an explicit prohibi¬ 
tion, but rather a concern with preserving the conjugal bond 
with all that it may entail in the way of individual relationship, 
attachment, affection, and personal respect between the mar¬ 
riage partners. This fidelity is defined less by a law than by a 
style of relating to the wife, by a way of being and of behaving 
with respect to her. The renunciation, as complete as possible, 
of extramarital relations must stem, on the part of the hus¬ 
band, from a pursuit of refinement in marital relations. It must 
be the result of conduct that is both skillful and affectionate,

The Care of the Self 


while a certain subtlety is expected of the wife in the de facto 
tolerance that she is fully obliged to concede and that she 
would be unwise not to show. 

The rather belated Latin text that was long considered to 
be a translation of the Economics attributed to Aristotle thus 
places a traditional perspective on the dignity of the wife side 
by side with advice to be prudent and accommodating. On the 
one hand, the author instructs the husband to take proper care 
of a wife who will become the mother of the children he hopes 
for. He also enjoins him not to deprive the woman he has 
married of the honor she is due. 16 But he also demands that 
the two spouses prevent one another from doing anything base 
and dishonest. He counsels the husband to “approach his wife 
in an honorable way, full of self-restraint and awe” (cum 
honestate, et cum multa modestia et timore). He hopes that the 
husband will be “neither indifferent nor harsh” (nec negligens 
nec sever us): “Between a courtesan and her lover, such tem¬ 
pers are allowed their course.” With his wife, on the contrary, 
the good husband should be attentive but also restrained, and 
the wife will respond with modesty and tact, and by showing 
affection and fear “in equal parts.” 17 And while he stresses the 
value of this fidelity, the author makes it clear to the wife that 
she will need to have a relatively accommodating attitude 
toward her husband’s faults: “and let her forget any wrong her 
husband may have done her through distress of mind” (si quid 
vir animae passione ad ipsam peccaverit); “let her refrain from 
all complaint nor charge him with the wrong, but rather attri¬ 
bute everything of this kind to sickness or ignorance or acci¬ 
dental errors.” In this way the husband in return will be ready 
to show her his gratitude after his cure. 

In a similar fashion, the Marriage Precepts affirm the princi¬ 
ple of a reciprocal fidelity. They do not, however, formulate 
it as a rigorously and formally symmetrical requirement. 
While the text assumes, without even having to recall the fact, 
that the wife owes her husband fidelity, it implies that al¬ 
though the pursuit of other pleasures may be for the husband 
a rather frequent offense, it is also a rather minor one. At all 



The Wife 


175 


events, it is within the marriage relationship, according to the 
affective relations obtaining between the two spouses, and not 
according to rights and prerogatives, that the question must 
be resolved. Plutarch expects the husband not to have sexual 
relations with other women, not just because to do so would 
pose a threat to the prestige of the lawful wife, but because it 
would inflict a wound—a natural wound that causes suffering. 
He calls to mind the behavior of cats, which are excited to 
frenzy by the odor of perfume. In the same way, women are 
infuriated when the husband has intercourse with other 
women. It is therefore unjust (adikon) to make them suffer 
such a violent vexation for a pleasure that is “trivial.” And he 
advises the husband to follow, with his wife, the example of 
the beekeeper, who does not go near his bees if he has had 
intercourse with a woman . 18 Conversely, Plutarch counsels 
wives to show a certain tolerance; not only would it be better 
for them to shut their eyes—a little like the wives of Persian 
kings who take part in banquets with their husbands but re¬ 
turn to their apartments when, with the onset of drunkenness, 
the musicians and courtesans are summoned. But they ought 
to tell themselves that if their husbands are going to seek 
pleasure with a hetaera or a maidservant, this is out of respect 
for them, and because he would not want them to share his 
debauchery, his licentiousness, and his excess . 19 Thus mar¬ 
riage, as a bond of affection and a relation of respect, much 
more than as a statutory structure, draws all sexual activities 
to it and condemns all those that might take place outside it. 
And while it tends to demand a symmetrical fidelity of the two 
partners, it also constitutes a locus of conciliation, where the 
husband’s attachment to the wife and the wife’s prudence 
vis-a-vis the husband will manage to correspond. The external 
pleasures of the husband will no longer be the recognized 
consequence of his statutory superiority, but the consequence 
of a certain weakness, which he is all the more obliged to limit 
seeing that the wife tolerates it through a concession that, 
while possibly saving her honor, also proves her affection.

The Pleasures of 
Marriage 


This definition of marriage as a relationship that is as exclu¬ 
sive as possible regarding the practice of the aphrodisia raises 
(or could raise) a number of questions pertaining to the inte¬ 
gration, the role, the form, and the finality of acts of pleasure 
in the interplay of affective or statutory relations between 
husband and wife. 

In actual fact, one has to admit that even in the forms of 
reflection in which marriage occupies an important place, the 
economy of pleasures in the conjugal relationship is treated 
with a great deal of reserve. Marriage, in this rigorous ethics 
advocated by some, demands a monopoly of pleasure. But as 
to which pleasures will be allowed within marriage and which 
others excluded, little is said. 

However, two general principles are often evoked. First, it 
is made clear that the conjugal relation must not be foreign to 
Eros, to that love which some philosophers wished to reserve 
for boys; but neither must it ignore or exclude Aphrodite. 
Musonius, in the text where he shows that marriage, far from 
being a hindrance, is an obligation for the philosopher, affirms 
the greatness and value of the marital state. He invokes the 
three great deities who watch over it: Hera, whom “we address 
as the patroness of wedlock”; Aphrodite, since people have 
called “Aphrodision ergon the joining of wife and husband”; 
and Eros (to what indeed could the name be better applied 
“than to the lawful union of man and wife”?). Together, these 

176 



The Wife 


177 


three powers have the function of “bringing together man and 
woman for the procreation of children.” 1 It is in the same 
manner that Plutarch will affirm the role of Aphrodite and 
Eros in that which properly constitutes the conjugal relation¬ 
ship. 2 

In correlation with this presence of amorous passion and 
physical pleasures in marriage, another principle, opposite to 
the first one but also quite general, is brought into play; 
namely, that one must not treat one’s wife as a mistress and 
one should behave as a husband rather than as a lover. 3 It is 
only logical that the old principle of conjugal decency will 
become all the more important as marriage tends to constitute 
the only licit context for the pleasures of sex. Aphrodite and 
Eros must be present in marriage and nowhere else. Moreover, 
the conjugal relationship needs to be different from the rela¬ 
tionship of lovers. One encounters the principle in several 
forms. In the form of a (doubtless quite traditional) counsel 
of prudence: by introducing one’s wife to overly intense pleas¬ 
ures one risks giving her lessons she will put to bad use and 
which one will regret having taught her. 4 Or in the form of 
advice given to both spouses: let them find a middle way 
between an excessive austerity and a conduct too close to that 
of profligates, and let the husband always remind himself that 
“I cannot have the society of the same woman as wife and 
paramour” (hos gamete kai hos hetaira ). 5 Or, further, in the 
form of a general thesis: behaving too ardently with one’s wife 
amounts to treating her as an adulteress. 6 The theme is impor¬ 
tant, for it will be reencountered in the Christian tradition, 
where it will appear very early (Clement of Alexandria refers 
to it in the Stromateis ), and where it will persist for a very long 
time (Saint Francis of Sales works out its implications in the 
Introduction to the Devout Life ). 7 It is no doubt necessary, if 
we are to understand its meaning for the Stoics who formulate 
it, to bear in mind that the natural and rational principle of 
marriage ordains that it combine two existences, that it pro¬ 
duce descendants, that it be useful to the city and beneficial 
to the entire human race. To make the enjoyment of pleasur- 



178 


The Care of the Self 


able sensations the most important thing in marriage would 
be to violate the law, reverse the order of ends, and transgress 
the principle that should join a man and a woman into a 
couple. 

More concretely, though, one faces the problem of deter¬ 
mining what status and what forms the practice of pleasure 
ought to assume in marital relations, and on what principles 
the precepts of its internal limitation can be based. Given that 
marriage demands a conjugal tie that must be at the same time 
a highly valued personal relationship and the exclusive locus 
of relations of pleasure, relations a man was heretofore rather 
freely permitted on the fringes of his marriage, how is this 
matrimonial structure to play its role as a principle of regula¬ 
tion? What austerity will be exacted in this marriage, if it must 
be at once the strongest of individual ties and the only place 
for lawful pleasures? The formulations are, more often than 
not, rather vague, a little like those one finds in the Latin text 
that is supposed to be Book III of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle. The author asks the husband to approach his wife 
“in an honorable way” (cum honestate), “full of self-restraint 
and awe” (cum multa modestia et timore). He recommends 
that “in his conversation with her, he should use the words of 
a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are them¬ 
selves lawful and honorable.” He advises him to treat his 
spouse with “respect and modesty” (verecundia et pudore). % 

In a more precise way, intraconjugal austerity will be jus¬ 
tified by the two great natural and rational finalities that will 
be ascribed to marriage. The first, of course, is procreation. 
One must not—Seneca stresses this, but we have also seen that 
there were physicians who called attention to it—make plea¬ 
sure the goal of an act that Nature has designed for procrea¬ 
tion. If the desires of love were given to men, this was not in 
order that they might enjoy sensual pleasure, but that they 
might propagate their kind (non voluptatis causa, sed propa- 
gandi generis). 9 From this general principle, Musonius draws 
the conclusion that sexual relations can rightfully take place 
only if they have propagation as their goal. As for those rela- 



The Wife 


179 


tions which only seek pleasure as an end, they are “unjust and 
unlawful, even in marriage.” 10 This rule, which one also finds 
in the neo-Pythagoreans, seems to have served to justify cer¬ 
tain traditional prohibitions forbidding sexual intercourse 
during menstruation (which, according to physicians, might 
carry away the semen) and during the time of pregnancy (not 
only because it would be unproductive, but above all because 
it might endanger the life of the embryo). But, apart from 
these general recommendations, it does not seem that there 
was, despite the identity of principle, the kind of interrogation 
that will be encountered in Christian teaching concerning the 
lawfulness of sexual relations in case of recognized sterility or 
after the age of menopause, and concerning the intentions that 
both partners may have before or even during the act. The 
exclusion of pleasure as an end does seem, in the most rigorous 
of the moral philosophers, to have been an exigency. But this 
exigency was more a statement of principle than a schema 
enabling a regulation of behaviors and a precise codification 
of their permitted or forbidden forms. 

The second great finality of marriage—making a life to¬ 
gether, a life entirely shared—constitutes the other principle 
that calls for austerity in conjugal relations. Like the procrea¬ 
tive finality, this principle does not trace a clear dividing line 
between what is permitted and what is forbidden. But certain 
authors—and foremost among them Plutarch—have it play, 
in the linking of pleasure relations to the conjugal relationship, 
a more subtle and complex role. Thus, on the one hand, the 
obligation to make the wife a companion to whom one opens 
one’s soul requires that one have a respect for her directed not 
just to her rank and status, but to her personal dignity. The 
regimen of the aphrodisia must therefore take this obligation 
as a principle of internal limitation. On the other hand, if 
married life must have the purpose of forming a perfect com¬ 
munity—a true “fusion of existences”—it is also clear that 
sexual relations and pleasures, if they are shared and enjoyed 
in common, constitute a factor of rapprochement between 
husband and wife. The formation and strengthening of a solid 



180 


The Care of the Self 


bond are, in the practice of the aphrodisia, not only a guaran¬ 
tee, but also an element in favor of the aphrodisia. Hence there 
is a valorization of sexual pleasures (provided they are incor¬ 
porated into the matrimonial relationship and well integrated 
within it), combined with the recommendation of an austerity 
in their practice, which enables them actually to play this 
positive role in the conjugal union. 

This spiraling process of necessary austerity and desirable 
intensity is clearly apparent in the Marriage Precepts; in fact 
it constitutes one of that work’s guiding threads. The text 
reiterates some of the old familiar principles concerning the 
modesty and secrecy that should surround not only the pro- 
creative act but also the simple acts of pleasure such as kissing 
and caressing." It also recalls to mind, transforming a well- 
known saying of Herodotus, that a woman’s modesty should 
not fall along with the gown that she lays aside, 12 nor should 
darkness cover any licentiousness whatever. Recalling the ex¬ 
ample of a woman who tried to get away from Philip by 
pointing out to him that all women are the same once the 
lights are out, Plutarch notes that the wife, on the contrary, 
does not have to be like the others. Hidden by the night, 
without one’s being able to see her body, she must cause what 
is virtuous in her (to sophron autes) to shine forth. Now, what 
is virtuous in her is also what attaches her exclusively to her 
husband and makes her his own; it is “her constancy and her 
affection.” 13 

Around this principle of gracious reserve, a modesty that 
signifies the exclusiveness of an attachment, Plutarch extends 
a number of recommendations that exclude both a supercil¬ 
ious austerity and an unrestrained facility, and this on the part 
of the husband and the wife alike. No doubt, like the young 
Spartan whose example he cites, a good wife must not herself 
make advances to her husband; 14 but neither must she show 
annoyance at his advances. The first attitude would have 
something brash about it that smacks of the courtesan, but 
there would be an unfriendly disdain in the second. 15 Here we 
have, still in a very nebulous way, the outline of those rules 



The Wife 


181 


fixing the forms of the respective initiatives and the signs to 
be exchanged on which the pastoral ministry will later set such 
a high value. Plutarch attaches a good deal of importance to 
the dangers that can compromise, in a married couple’s first 
sexual relations, subsequent mutual understanding and the 
solidity of the bond to be formed. He draws attention to the 
risk of bad experiences that the bride may have. He advises her 
not to dwell on them, for the benefits of marriage may appear 
later: not to behave like those who “submit to the bees’ stings, 
but abandon the honeycomb.” 16 But he also fears that too 
intense a physical pleasure experienced at the outset of mar¬ 
riage may cause the affection to be lost when this pleasure 
disappears. It is better for the love to owe its vitality to the 
spouses’ character and disposition. 17 It is also necessary, 
throughout married life, to bring into play anything that 
might benefit conjugal friendship in sexual relations between 
husband and wife. Specific examples of this function of affec¬ 
tive reactivation—to which one of the interlocutors of the 
Dialogue on Love explicitly refers 18 —are given in the Marriage 
Precepts : avoid quarrels, especially those that might take place 
in the bedroom, because “the disagreements, recriminations, 
and angry passions which the bed generates are not easily 
settled in another place and at another time”; 19 or, further, 
when you are in the habit of occupying the same bed, don’t 
go to a separate bedroom because of an angry disagreement. 
On the contrary, this is the right time to invoke Aphrodite, 
“who is the best physician for such disorders.” 20 

The theme holds a relatively important place in Plutarch 
himself. We will encounter it again in the Dialogue on Love, 
where it will serve as a basic discriminant between the love of 
women, in which pleasure is integrable with a positive role in 
the spiritual relation, and the love of boys, in which physical 
pleasure (assumed to be nonreciprocal) can figure only as a 
favorable factor within the relationship. This theme is also 
evoked in the Dinner of the Seven Wise Men, where it is a 
question of sexual pleasures in connection with the two other 
physical pleasures with which they are often associated: intox- 



182 


The Care of the Self 


ication and music. The interlocutor—Mnesiphilus—observes 
that in every art or craft the work is not in the manipulation 
of tools or materials but in what one aims to make: the ergon 
of the architect does not consist of the mortar he mixes but of 
the temple he constructs; the Muses, when they employ them¬ 
selves with the lyre or the flute, have no other task than “the 
development of characters and the soothing of the emo¬ 
tions .” 21 In the same way, and just as the task of Dionysus is 
not in the fact of drinking intoxicating wine, the task of 
Aphrodite (ergon Aphrodites) is not in the mere relating and 
conjoining of bodies (synousia, meixis); it is in the feeling of 
friendship (philosophrosyne), the longing (pothos), the associa¬ 
tion (homilia), and the intimacy (synetheia) between two peo¬ 
ple. Sexual intercourse, in married life, ought to serve as an 
instrument for the formation and development of symmetrical 
and reciprocal affective relations. “Aphrodite,” says Plutarch, 
“is the artisan who creates concord and friendship [homophro- 
synes kai philias demiourgos] between men and women, for 
through their bodies, under the influence of pleasure, she at 
the same time unites and welds together their souls.” 22 * 

This advice may appear rather crude. Nevertheless, it 
figures among the preliminaries of a long history: that of the 
codification of moral relations between spouses, in the dual 
form of a general recommendation of reserve and a complex 
lesson of affective communication through sexual pleasure. 

A “monopolistic” principle: no sexual relations outside 
marriage. A requirement of “dehedonization”: sexual inter¬ 
course between spouses should not be governed by an econ¬ 
omy of pleasure. A procreative finalization : its goal should be 
the birth of offspring. These are three fundamental traits 
marking the ethics of conjugal existence that certain moralists 

*Babut points out that Antipater, Musonius, and Hierocles “are more interested in 
marriage than love; they seem to want above all to establish that marriage does not 
prevent one from leading the philosophical life; in them one finds no trace of one of 
the important ideas of the Amatorius, namely, that the woman is just as capable as 
the man of inspiring amorous passion .” 21 



The Wife 


183 


developed at the beginning of the imperial epoch, an ethics 
whose elaboration owes a great deal to late Stoicism. But these 
traits are not peculiar to it. We have found similar exigencies 
in the rules enjoined by Plato on the citizens of his Republic. 
We shall find them again in a later period, in what the Church 
demanded of a good Christian married couple. Much more 
than an innovation of Stoic rigor, much more than a project 
specific to the moral philosophy of that epoch, these three 
principles did not cease, for centuries, to characterize the 
role that marriage was expected to play as a focus of sexual 
austerity. 

But the constancy of these three phenomena should not be 
taken as evidence of a pure and simple identity. A certain 
more or less Stoicizing ethics of the imperial epoch did not 
merely carry forward, from the Platonic utopia to Christian¬ 
ity, the code of a “monopolistic” marriage dedicated to pro¬ 
creation and distrustful of pleasure. It contributed a number 
of particular inflections that derived from the forms taken at 
the time by the development of the cultivation of the self. 

It should be noted first that in Plato the obligation to inte¬ 
grate all sexual pleasure into the matrimonial structure had 
for one of its chief justifications the need to supply the city 
with the children it required to survive and maintain its 
strength. In Christianity, on the other hand, the link between 
sexual intercourse and marriage will be justified by the fact 
that the former bears the marks of sin, the Fall, and evil, and 
that only the latter can give it a legitimacy that still may not 
exculpate it entirely. Now, in Musonius, Seneca, Plutarch, or 
Hierocles, although utility has its part to play, although dis¬ 
trust of the transports of pleasure is very strong, the link 
between marriage and the aphrodisia is not really established 
by positing the primacy of the social and political objectives 
of marriage, or by postulating an original evil intrinsic to 
pleasure, but by affirming a natural, rational, and essential 
relationship between them. In order to make allowance for the 
differences of position and doctrinal variants, let us say that 



184 


The Care of the Self 


the sexual monopoly that tends to be claimed for marriage in 
this form of ethics centers less on the “external” utilities of 
marriage or the “internal” negativity of pleasure than on an 
attempt to bring a certain number of relations into coinci¬ 
dence: the union of two sexual partners, the dual tie of hus¬ 
band and wife, and the social role of the family—while 
achieving as perfect a congruence as possible with the relation 
to the self. 

Here we touch on an important difference. The obligation 
to keep the use of pleasure within the bounds of marriage was 
also, for Plato’s guardian, Isocrates’ leader, or Aristotle’s citi¬ 
zen, a way of exercising self-mastery, a mastery made neces¬ 
sary by one’s status or by the authority one had to exercise in 
the city. The principle of a perfect conjugal fidelity will be, in 
the pastoral ministry, an unconditional duty for anyone con¬ 
cerned about his salvation. By contrast, in this ethics inspired 
by Stoicism, it is in order to satisfy the specific requirements 
of the relation to oneself, not to violate one’s natural and 
essential being, and to honor oneself as a reasonable being that 
one must keep one’s practice of sexual pleasure within mar¬ 
riage and in conformity with its objectives. Doubtless this 
principle, which tends to exclude, even for men, sexual inter¬ 
course outside marriage, and to authorize it only for certain 
definite purposes, will be one of the anchor points for a subse¬ 
quent “juridification” of marital relations and sexual prac¬ 
tices. Like that of women, the sexual activity of married men 
will, in theory at least, risk coming within the provisions of the 
law. Even within marriage, a precise code will say what one 
is permitted or forbidden to do, to want, or even to think. But 
this juridification—which will be so pronounced in later times 
—is tied to Christian pastoral practice, to its own peculiar 
structure. Even in the most detailed texts on the life of the 
couple, such as those of Plutarch, what is proposed is not a 
regulation that would draw a division between permitted and 
forbidden acts. It is instead a mode of being, a style of rela¬ 
tions. The ethics of marriage and the advice on conjugal life 
are at the same time universally valid principles and rules for 



The Wife 


185 


those who wish to give their existence an honorable and noble 
form. It is the lawless universality of an aesthetics of existence 
that in any case is practiced only by a few. 

The conjugalization of sexual activities that tends to localize 
legitimacy within marriage alone obviously results in their 
manifest limitation (at least for the husband, since this limita¬ 
tion has long been required of the married woman). Moreover, 
the insistence on a dissociation between the practice of plea¬ 
sure and the hedonic finality will tend toward an internal 
disqualification of this activity itself. But it needs to be un¬ 
derstood as well that these restrictions and this disqualifica¬ 
tion are accompanied by another process: an intensification of 
the value and meaning of sexual relations within marriage. On 
the one hand, in fact, intramarital sexual relations are no 
longer simply the consequence and manifestation of a right. 
They must be placed within a cluster of relations character¬ 
ized by affection, attachment, and reciprocity. And on the 
other hand, while pleasure must be eliminated as a goal, it is, 
at least in certain of the most subtle formulations of this ethics, 
to be used as an element (at once an instrument and a guaran¬ 
tee) in the interplay of affective expressions between spouses. 

And it is precisely on behalf of this intensification of the 
value of the aphrodisia in marital relations, by reason of the 
role it is assigned in the communication between husband and 
wife, that one begins to question, in an increasingly doubtful 
mode, the privileges that used to be granted to the love of boys. 



PART SIX 

Boys 




In the first centuries of our era, compared with the lofty 
formulations of the classical period, reflection on the love of 
boys lost some of its intensity, its seriousness, its vitality, if not 
its topicality. Where it appears, it has a facile, repetitive sound. 
Playing on ancient themes, often those of Platonism, it partici¬ 
pates in the reactivation of classical culture, but in a dull way. 
Even when philosophy tries to restore to the figure of Socrates 
some of its former prestige, the love of boys, with the problems 
it poses, does not constitute an active and vital focus of reflec¬ 
tion (the four speeches of Maximus of Tyre cannot furnish 
an argument to the contrary). 

This does not mean that the practice disappeared or that it 
became the object of a disqualification. All the texts plainly 
show that it was still common and still regarded as a natural 
thing. What seems to have changed is not the taste for boys, 
or the value judgment that was brought to bear on those who 
had this partiality, but the way in which one questioned one¬ 
self about it. An obsolescence not of the thing itself, but of the 
problem; a decline in the interest one took in it; a fading of the 
importance it was granted in philosophical and moral debate. 
There are no doubt many reasons for this “deproblematiza- 
tion.” Certain of them can be traced to the influence of Roman 
culture. It is not that the Romans were more insensitive than 
the Greeks to this sort of pleasure; but the difficult question 
of boys as objects of pleasure was posed, in the context of their 

189 



190 


The Care of the Self 


institutions, with less acuity than in the Greek city. In the first 
place, children of good birth were well “protected” by paren¬ 
tal right and by public laws. Fathers were determined that the 
power they exercised over their sons would be respected; and 
the famous Lex Scantinia, which, as Boswell has shown, did 
not prohibit homosexuality, defended the free adolescent from 
abuse and violence . 1 Second, and doubtless by way of a conse¬ 
quence, love for boys was practiced for the most part with 
young slaves, about whose status there was no reason to 
worry. “In Rome the freeborn ephebe was replaced by the 
slave,” says Paul Veyne . 2 Hellenized though it was, and satu¬ 
rated with philosophy, Rome, whose poets were so fond of 
singing of adolescents, offered few echoes of the great specula¬ 
tion of the Greeks on the love of boys. 

Further, the forms taken by pedagogical practice and its 
modes of institutionalization made it much more difficult to 
valorize the relationship with adolescents in terms of educa¬ 
tional efficacy. When Quintilian speaks of the moment when 
a boy should be entrusted to the rhetoric teacher, he empha¬ 
sizes the need to make sure of the latter’s “morals”: “Pupils 
are transferred to the school of rhetoric when they are practi¬ 
cally grown up, and they continue there when they are young 
men; accordingly, we must at this stage exercise even greater 
care that the stainless character of the teacher may preserve 
their more tender years from harm and that the weight of his 
authority may deter their bolder age from excess.” The 
teacher must therefore “adopt the attitude of a parent toward 
his pupils and consider that he is taking the place of those who 
entrust their children to him .” 3 In a more general way, a 
certain lessening of the importance of personal relations of 
philia, together with the valorization of marriage, no doubt 
had much to do with the fact that the love relation between 
men ceased to be the focus of an intense theoretical and moral 
discussion. 

Three important texts remain nevertheless: Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue on love, the later dialogue attributed to Lucian, and the 
four lectures by Maximus of Tyre on Socratic love. We can 



Boys 


191 


leave aside this last text: not because of its rhetorical and 
artificial character—Pseudo-Lucian’s Affairs of the Heart are 
scarcely less so, and the reactivation of ancient themes in 
academic exercises was a feature characteristic of the epoch. 
But the text by Maximus of Tyre is essentially devoted—this 
is what constitutes its traditionalism—to the distinction and 
comparison, in male relations, between two sorts of love: the 
love that is fine and just and the love that is not . 4 Conforming 
to the Socratic tradition, Maximus of Tyre has this distinction 
coincide with the opposition between true love and the love 
that is only a simulation. Starting from this point, he develops 
a systematic and traditional comparison of the two loves. In 
terms of the qualities that belong to each: the first comprises 
virtue, friendship, modesty, candor, stability; the second com¬ 
prises excess, hatred, immodesty, infidelity. In terms of the 
ways of being that characterize them: the one is Hellenic and 
virile; the other is effeminate and barbaric. And lastly, in terms 
of the behaviors in which they are manifested: with the first, 
the lover takes care of the beloved, accompanies him to the 
gymnasium, goes hunting with him, into battle with him; he 
will be with him in death; and it is not in darkness or solitude 
that he seeks his company; with the second, on the other hand, 
the lover flees the sun, seeks darkness and solitude, and avoids 
being seen with the one he loves . 5 

Plutarch’s and Pseudo-Lucian’s dialogues on love are con¬ 
structed quite differently. Their erotics is also binary and com¬ 
parative: it is still a matter of distinguishing two forms of love 
and of contrasting their value. But this time, instead of operat¬ 
ing within an Eros that is dominated, if not entirely repre¬ 
sented, by masculine love, in order to isolate two morally 
unequal forms of the latter, the comparison starts from two 
forms of relations that are naturally distinct: the relation with 
boys and the relation with women (and more specifically the 
relation that one may have with one’s lawful wife in the con¬ 
text of marriage). It is to these two distinct forms that the 
question of value, beauty, and moral superiority will be di¬ 
rected. This will have various consequences, which will mod- 



192 


The Care of the Self 


ify the question of erotics considerably: love for women and, 
particularly, marriage will belong indisputably to the domain 
of Eros and its problematization. The latter will rest on the 
natural opposition between love for one’s own sex and love for 
the other sex. Finally, the ethical valorization of love will no 
longer be able to be carried out through the elision of physical 
pleasure. 

This is the paradox: it was around the question of pleasure 
that reflection on pederasty developed in Greek antiquity; it 
is around this same question that it will go into decline. Mar¬ 
riage, as an individual tie capable of integrating relations of 
pleasure and of giving them a positive value, will constitute the 
most active focus for defining a stylistics of moral life. The 
love of boys will not become a doomed figure for all that. It 
will find many other ways of expressing itself in poetry and art. 
But it will undergo a kind of philosophical “disinvestment.” 
When it is examined, instead of asking it to reveal one of the 
highest possible forms of love, one will criticize it for a radical 
inadequacy, for its inability to accommodate relations of 
pleasure. The difficulty of accounting for the relations between 
this form of love and the use of the aphrodisia had long been 
the cause of its philosophical valorization. Now the difficulty 
becomes the reason for seeing it as a taste, a practice, a prefer¬ 
ence, which may have their tradition, but which are incapable 
of defining a style of living, an aesthetics of behavior, and a 
whole modality of relation to oneself, to others, and to truth. 

Plutarch’s dialogue and that of Pseudo-Lucian attest both 
to the legitimacy that is still granted to the love of boys and 
to its increasing decline as a vital theme of a stylistics of 
existence.

Plutarch 


Plutarch’s Dialogue on Love opens and closes under the sign 
of marriage. Shortly after their wedding, Plutarch has come 
with his wife on a pilgrimage to Thespiae. They wish to offer 
a sacrifice to the god and to ask him to bless this union, which 
a quarrel between their families has placed under unfavorable 
auspices. On arriving at their host’s, they find themselves in 
the midst of a minor commotion: Should the young Bacchon, 
a coveted ephebe, marry the woman who is pursuing him? 
Debate, turn of events, abduction. The dialogue ends with 
everyone preparing to form a procession for this new married 
couple and to offer a sacrifice to the benevolent god. The 
dialogue unfolds between one marriage and the other.* 

It also unfolds under the sign of Eros, during the time of the 
Erotidia, the holidays that were celebrated at Thespiae every 
four years, “in honor of Eros as well as the Muses.” He is the 
god whom Plutarch was anxious to ask for protection for his 
marriage. He is also the god who will be invoked for the 
contested marriage of Bacchon with Ismenodora, for it seems 
that he “approves and is graciously present at this affair .” 2 
Meanwhile, Plutarch will have had time to sing a long eulogy 
of Eros, of his divinity, of his antiquity, of his power, of his 


*H. Martin remarks that the dialogue does not explicitly differentiate between hetero¬ 
sexual love and marriage. Comparing the Dialogue on Love and the Marriage Pre¬ 
cepts, L. Goessler calls attention to the connection, emphasized by Plutarch, between 
gamos and eros, and to what is new about this in the traditional question of marriage.'

good works, of the force by which he elevates and attracts 
souls. In this way Plutarch will have contributed to the wor¬ 
ship of the god who is being celebrated throughout the festive 
city. Eros and Gamos, the strength of love and the marriage 
bond in their mutual relations: such is the theme of the dia¬ 
logue. The purpose of the religious rites that serve as its back¬ 
ground is clear: that the power of Eros, invoked for the 
protection of the couple, may triumph over the misunder¬ 
standing of families; that he may appease dissensions between 
friends and ensure the happiness of conjugal lives. The theo¬ 
retical aim of the debate is in harmony with this devotional 
practice. It will provide the rational justification for the latter: 
to show that the conjugal relationship, more than any other, 
is capable of accommodating the force of love, and that, 
among humans, love has its privileged place in the couple. 

The pretext for the conversation and the external peripeteia 
that give rise to its successive developments are recounted in 
a solemn and ironic fashion. A “pathetic” situation has arisen, 
which “merely wants a chorus to sympathize and lacks a 
stage, for no other element of drama is wanting .” 3 In reality, 
what has transpired is a little comic episode. Bacchon, the 
desirable adolescent—he is handsome and virtuous—is pur¬ 
sued by an erastes, but also by a widow, who is much older 
than he. She had been commissioned to find a suitable wife for 
him, but she didn’t find anyone better than herself. She tries 
to seduce the boy, chases after him, abducts him, already 
organizes the wedding under the nose of his male lover, who 
is furious, then resigned. The dialogue begins when the plans 
of the formidable widow are already known, but before she has 
carried out her coup de force. The boy is therefore still torn 
between the two suitors. He doesn’t know which path to 
choose. As he has entrusted the decision to his elders, the 
latter will deliberate on the matter. The debate thus takes 
place between the advocates of the love of boys, Protogenes 
and Pisias, and two advocates of the love of women, Anthem- 
ion and Daphnaeus. It unfolds in front of Plutarch, who soon 
abandons the role of witness, takes charge of the discussion, 



Boys

and leads it in the direction of a general theory of love. The 
first champions of the two loves having disappeared by then, 
his interlocutors and adversaries will be Pemptides and espe¬ 
cially Zeuxippus, who have a materialistic conception of mar¬ 
riage and an aggressively critical idea which Plutarch will 
need to answer. 

Here we touch on one of the notable features of the dia¬ 
logue. It starts from the traditional schema—be it in the myth¬ 
ical figures or in the moral casuistry—of the crossroads. There 
are two paths: Which does one choose, that of love for boys 
or that of love for women? Now, in actual fact the debate does 
not exactly raise this problem. Whereas in the Platonic texts 
the noble, masculine Eros is contrasted with the facile, multi¬ 
ple, physical, “pandemian” Eros (which, clearly, is the love 
that can be practiced with boys and with girls outside mar¬ 
riage), in Plutarch the choice is between boys on the one hand 
and marriage on the other, as if it were in the latter that the 
relationship with women is fulfilled. 

Another distinctive element in Plutarch’s dialogue is the 
personage of the woman who is pursuing the boy. All the traits 
that characterize her are significant. She is older than the boy, 
while being still young; she is richer than he; she has a more 
important social status; her past life has already given her 
experience . 4 This kind of situation was not unusual in Greece 
—both because of the scarcity of women and because of the 
strategy of marriages. But people nevertheless felt a certain 
reticence with regard to this kind of union. The younger and 
poorer husband was in a somewhat awkward position with 
respect to his wife, seeing that the preeminence of the husband 
was statutory in marital relations. Moreover, one finds numer¬ 
ous remarks concerning these drawbacks. Plutarch, in the Life 
of Solon, advises the magistrate who discovers a young man 
zealously attending an old woman, “like a cock-partridge in 
her service,” to have him removed to the house of a young 
woman in need of a husband . 5 Nor will Pisias fail to recall 
these habitual fears to the advocates of Bacchon’s marriage . 6 
Without being totally exceptional, this was a paradoxical and 



196 


The Care of the Self 


dangerous union, where the interests of one party and the 
appetites of the other were too salient for it to hold the promise 
of a happy and reasonable existence. What Bacchon sees him¬ 
self being offered—in opposition to pederastic love—is there¬ 
fore not the best but the least good of all possible marriages. 
The value of the discussion that will justify it and of the 
outcome that will see it triumph will be only increased by this 
fact. 

But still another paradoxical trait should be noted. Is- 
menodora, the passionate widow, is a woman full of good 
qualities: she is virtuous, she leads a “life of decorum.” She 
commands the respect of public opinion. There has never been 
“a word of censure” concerning her. Never “did any hint of 
wrongdoing leave a stain on her house .” 7 Yet she has shame¬ 
lessly set out in pursuit of the boy. He had been entrusted to 
her so that she might promote his marriage; but after hearing 
so many good things said about him, after seeing his beauty 
and his qualities with her own eyes, she loves him in turn. 
What is more, she chases after him. Being unable to accom¬ 
pany him to the gymnasium, she watches for him when he 
returns. And with the collusion of some friends, she “kidnaps” 
him. We know that such “kidnappings”—in part “real,” in 
part arranged also—were a frequent element if not in reality 
itself, at least, certainly, in pederastic literature. Many mythi¬ 
cal and historical narratives revolve around one of these epi¬ 
sodes of violence. The Love Stories attributed to Plutarch and 
those Lectures of Maximus of Tyre that are devoted to So- 
cratic love make reference to them . 8 If a person as virtuous as 
Ismenodora gives way to such an assault, this is because she 
has been possessed by “some divine impulse, more powerful 
than human reason.” Now all these traits (the age difference, 
the acknowledged merit, the interest taken in the moral quali¬ 
ties and good reputation of the beloved, the initiative of the 
pursuit, the violence of divine inspiration) are easily recogniz¬ 
able. They are those which characterize the lover of boys in 
the traditional pederastic model. Ismenodora, in Plutarch’s 
description, is exactly in the position of the erastes. So that, 



Boys 


197 


in essence, Bacchon does not really have to choose between 
two fundamentally different forms of love—the love that can 
develop between a gifted young man and an older man who 
is interested in the beauty of his friend, and the love that can 
be established between a husband and a wife with a view to 
managing an estate and rearing children—but between two 
forms of the same love, the only difference being that in one 
case it is love of a man and in the other, love of a woman. 
Plutarch makes it quite clear, in one of his statements in favor 
of the marriage with Ismenodora, that the same type of rela¬ 
tionship is involved. No one, he says, can do without author¬ 
ity, or be perfect by himself; “the ephebe is ruled by the 
gymnasiarch, the young man by the erastes, the adult by the 
law and by the strategus. . . . Since this is so, what is there 
dreadful about a sensible older woman piloting the life of her 
young husband? She will be useful because of her superior 
understanding [toi phronein mallon]\ she will be sweet and 
affectionate [toiphilein] because she loves him .” 9 

One sees two movements running beneath Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue. First, there is the shift resulting from the discussion 
itself; the question of the choice the beloved must make be¬ 
tween his two lovers surreptitiously becomes the question of 
love in its two possible forms—for boys and for girls. And 
second, the shift, made possible by the paradoxical situation 
of the intrigue, which confers on the relationship with a 
woman the same ethical potential as the relationship with a 
man. The objective of the entire debate is clearly visible in the 
little drama that underlies the vicissitudes of the dialogue: 
what is wanted is to form a conception of a single love. This 
conception will not reject the characteristic values of pederas- 
tic love. Instead, it will include them in a broader, more com¬ 
plete form, which ultimately only the relationship with 
women, and more precisely with the wife, will be able to put 
into practice. 

One is tempted to see in this dialogue by Plutarch one of the 
numerous rhetorical contests that staged an encounter, with 
a winner declared at the end, between the love of women and 



198 


The Care of the Self 


the love of boys. Viewed in this way, it can pass for one of 
the most fervent pleas in favor of conjugal affection and the 
pleasures of marriage. It is legitimate to place it alongside the 
Stoic treatises on marriage. It has many themes and formula¬ 
tions in common with them. But we are dealing, in this text, 
with something quite different from an argumentation in favor 
of marriage and against pederasty. We can see in it the first 
shape of an important change in the old erotics. This transfor¬ 
mation can be summed up briefly: whereas scarcely any dis¬ 
continuity, impassable boundary, or important difference of 
values was recognized in the practice of the aphrodisia, in 
return the elaboration of the erotics was clearly dualistic. This 
dualism was, moreover, double and, in itself, rather complex. 
On the one hand, common love (that love in which sensual 
acts are preponderant) was opposed to noble, pure, elevated, 
heavenly love (in which the presence of these same acts are, 
if not disallowed, at least veiled). On the other hand, the 
specificity of the love for boys was stressed, the aspiration, 
form, goals, and effects of which were supposed—at least 
provided one acted in conformity with its true nature—to be 
different from those found in the other loves. Furthermore, 
these two dualisms tended to overlap, since it was held that 
“true” love for boys could only be a pure love, a love free of 
the vulgar pursuit of the aphrodisia (which actuates the desire 
for women or the corrupt appetite for boys). A continuous 
domain of the aphrodisia, and an erotics with a binary struc¬ 
ture: it is this configuration that begins to be reversed here. 
Plutarch’s Dialogue may bear witness to a movement that will 
not actually be completed until much later, when an abso¬ 
lutely unitary conception of love will be constructed, while the 
practice of pleasure will be divided by a strict boundary: the 
one that separates the conjoinings of one sex with the other 
and relations within the same sex. It is roughly this order of 
things which is still ours today, solidified as it is by a unitary 
conception of sexuality, which enables one to delimit strictly 
the dimorphism of relations and the differential structure of 
desire. 



Boys 


199 


In Plutarch’s Dialogue, one sees the effort to constitute a 
unitary erotics, very clearly organized on the model of the 
man-woman, and even husband-wife, relationship. In compar¬ 
ison with this single love (it is supposed to be the same, 
whether it is directed to women or to boys), the pederastic 
attachment will in fact be disqualified, but without a rigid line 
of demarcation being drawn, as it will be later, between 
“homo-” and “heterosexual” acts. The whole burden of the 
text bears on this unification of erotics. The latter is carried 
out through a critical discussion (that of “dualism”), through 
the working out of a unitary theory (that of love), and through 
the bringing into play of a fundamental concept (that of charis, 
grace). 

1. The exposition and criticism of the traditional “dual¬ 
ism” can be quickly summarized. This dualism is of course 
defended by the partisans of the love of boys. Moreover, 
Protogenes and Pisias will very soon leave the stage—as soon 
as one learns of Bacchon’s abduction. They were there long 
enough to celebrate differential erotics one last time. Accord¬ 
ing to this erotics, the love of boys is both different from the 
attraction to women and superior to it, for two reasons: one 
has to do with their respective positions relative to nature, and 
the other concerns the role played, in each of them, by plea¬ 
sure. 

The advocates of the love of boys do refer briefly to the 
frequent argument that contrasts everything that is artificial 
about women (adornments and perfumes for some; razors, 
philters, and makeup for the most shameless) with the natural¬ 
ness of the boys one sees at the palestrae. 10 But their main 
argument against love for women is that it is nothing more 
than a natural inclination. In reality, it is nature, says Proto¬ 
genes, that has placed an appetite (orexis) in us that draws the 
two sexes to each other. Indeed, it was necessary that we be 
induced to procreate, just as we are prompted to feed our¬ 
selves. But it is clear that this same type of appetite is found 
in flies for milk and in bees for honey. It will be found, too, 



200 


The Care of the Self 


in cooks for their fowls and their calves. Protogenes would not 
think to give the name “Love” to all these appetites. 11 The 
naturalness of the attraction to the other sex obviously does 
not condemn the indispensable practice that brings men into 
union with women. But it restricts the value of this practice 
to that of a behavior found everywhere in the animal world, 
a behavior whose reason for being is basic necessity. The 
natural character of relations with women is put forward by 
Protogenes in order to underscore its defectiveness and to 
show how it differs from a love of boys, which scorns such 
necessities and aims much higher. Actually he does not ex¬ 
plain what he understands by this love that is beyond nature. 
It is Plutarch who will take up these Platonic themes, but only 
to integrate them, against the apologists of boys, into a unitary 
conception of love. 

The other difference is marked by the role of pleasure. The 
fondness for women cannot be detached from pleasure. The 
love for boys, on the contrary, does not truly accord with its 
own essence unless it frees itself of pleasure. The argumenta¬ 
tion used by Protogenes and Pisias in support of this principle 
is Stoic, if anything. They observe that intercourse with 
women was indeed designed by nature for the conservation of 
the species. But things were arranged in such a way that 
pleasure is associated with this act. For this reason, the appe¬ 
tite and the impulse (orexis, horme) that induce us to perform 
it are always apt to become violent and unrestrained; in this 
case, they are transformed into desire (epithumia). Thus we 
are led in two ways toward that natural object which a woman 
constitutes: by the appetite, a natural movement, which looks 
to the survival of the generations as its reasonable goal and 
uses pleasure as a means; and by desire, a violent movement, 
with no internal regulation, which has “pleasure and enjoy¬ 
ment as its goal.” 12 It is clear that neither the one nor the other 
can be love in its true form: not the first, because it is common 
to all the animals; not the second, because it exceeds reason¬ 
able limits and attaches the soul to sensual pleasures. 

It is only logical, then, to rule out the very possibility of 



Boys 


201 


Eros in relations between men and women. “True love has 
nothing to do with the women’s quarters,” says Protogenes in 
a turn of phrase that is given two meanings by the adherents 
of boys: first, the nature of desire, which attaches a man to a 
woman “by their sexual parts,” like a dog to his female, ex¬ 
cludes love; second, it would not be proper for a sober-minded 
and chaste woman to feel “love” for her husband and to accept 
“being loved” by him (eran, erastai). 13 Hence there is only one 
true love, the love of boys, because unworthy pleasures are 
absent from it and because it necessarily implies a friendship 
that is indissociable from virtue. If, moreover, the erastes finds 
that his love does not give rise to friendship and virtue in the 
other, then he abjures his attention and his fidelity. 14 

To this traditional line of argument, there will be an ex¬ 
pected reply: Daphnaeus’ denunciation of pederastic hypoc¬ 
risy. As if a tearful Achilles had not evoked the thighs of 
Patroclus, as if Solon, apropos of boys in the flower of their 
youth, had not praised “the sweetness of their thighs and their 
lips,” the fancier of boys likes to pose as a philosopher and a 
sage. But undoubtedly he waits only for an opportunity. At 
night when all is quiet, “sweet is the harvest when the guard 
is away.” One sees the dilemma: either the aphrodisia are 
incompatible with friendship and love, and in this case the 
lovers of boys who enjoy in secret the bodies they desire have 
fallen from the heights of love; or one admits that sensual 
pleasures have a place in friendship and love, and so there is 
no reason to exclude from the latter relationships with women. 
But Daphnaeus does not stop there. He also recalls the other 
great disjunction, which was often cited as an objection to the 
conduct of lovers and to the pleasure they tried to take: if the 
eromenos is virtuous, one cannot obtain this pleasure except 
by subjecting him to violence; and if he consents, one has to 
recognize that one is consorting with an effeminate. 15 Hence 
the primary model of all love is not to be sought in the fond¬ 
ness for boys. The latter should be thought of, rather, as “one 
come late and untimely to the world, illegitimate and ill- 
favored, [who] drives out the legitimate and older love”; un- 



202 


The Care of the Self 


less, as Daphnaeus suggests, the fondness for boys and the 
fondness for women are basically one and the same thing. 16 

But the real working out of the general theory of love is 
done after the departure of the first adversaries and outside 
their presence—as if it were necessary, in order to reach the 
main object of the debate, to take leave of this familiar con¬ 
frontation. Up to this point, remarks Pemptides, the debate 
has focused on personal questions; it needs to be directed 
toward general themes. 

2. The central part of the dialogue consists of a eulogy of 
Love in the traditional manner of praising a god; his truly 
divine nature is thereby established. Here Plutarch opposes 
the Epicurean-inspired argument outlined by Pemptides, ac¬ 
cording to which the gods are nothing more than our passions; 
and he shows that the Love that takes possession of us is the 
effect of a necessarily divine power. This power is compared 
to that of the other gods, an important passage because it 
shows how Eros is a necessary complement of Aphrodite. 
Without him, the work of Aphrodite would be nothing more 
than the pleasure of the senses and could be bought for a 
drachma. Contrary to what people say, he is also stronger and 
more courageous than Ares: it is out of mutual love that 
lovers, in battle, throw themselves on the enemy, fighting 
boldly to their death rather than fleeing in shame. Plutarch 
describes his action on men’s souls, which he renders “gener¬ 
ous, compassionate, and liberal, and which he pervades 
through and through, as in a divine possession.” Finally, the 
eulogy ends with a reference to Egyptian myths and an exposi¬ 
tion of the Platonic theory. 

The remarkable thing about this eulogy is that all the ele¬ 
ments stem from the traditional erotics of pederasty. Most of 
the cases are borrowed from the love of boys or from the 
example of Sappho (Alcestis and Admetus form almost the 
only exception). And in fact it is as the god of boy love that 
Eros appears in the praises addressed to him. Yet these praises 
are sung by Plutarch, who calls himself at the same time “a 



Boys 


203 


chorist of feminine love.” He intends to illustrate the general 
proposition advanced by Daphnaeus: “if we have regard for 
the truth, the liking for boys and the liking for women origi¬ 
nate in one and the same Love.” 17 

This seems to be the essential business of the dialogue. The 
little drama of the “pederastic” kidnapping of Bacchon by 
Ismenodora merely serves as its immediate context and illus¬ 
tration. Everything that the erotics of boys was able to claim 
as properly belonging to that form of love (in opposition to the 
false love for women) will be reutilized here, without anything 
from the great pederastic tradition being overlooked—on the 
contrary. But it will be used as a general form capable of 
subsuming both loves. In particular, it will be applied not only 
to the fondness for women, but to the conjugal relationship 
itself. 

After a speech by Zeuxippus—which the manuscripts have 
not passed down to us and which is supposed to have criticized 
conjugal love, not on behalf of pederasty, but in Epicurean 
terms—Plutarch speaks again in order to establish three es¬ 
sential points. First, he observes that if Love is indeed what 
he is said to be, he will make his presence, his power, and his 
actions felt in relations between the two sexes as well as in 
relations with boys. Let us assume for a moment that the 
Epicurean argument is correct: the images which emanate 
from the loved body, which are conveyed to the eyes of the one 
who loves, which enter into his body, fill it with emotion and 
agitate it to the point where sperm is formed—there is no 
reason why this mechanism should be set in motion by boys 
and not by women. 18 On the other hand, suppose that we 
accept the Platonic argument toward which Plutarch inclines: 
if “through the freshness and grace of a body” one perceives 
the beauty of a soul, and the latter, recalling the heavenly 
spectacle, gives wings to our soul, why would the difference 
between the sexes matter here, where it is only a question of 
“beauty” and “natural excellence”? 19 Plutarch shows that this 
element of virtue, arete, by which the traditional erotics of 
boys marked one of its important differences from the fond- 



204 


The Care of the Self 


ness for women, transcends any difference of sex: “They say 
that beauty is the flower of virtue; yet it would be absurd to 
deny that the female produces that flower or gives it a presen¬ 
tation of a natural bent for virtue ... all these characteristics 
belong to both sexes alike.” 20 

As for the friendship that the pederasts wish to reserve 
exclusively for the love of boys, Plutarch shows that it can also 
characterize the relationship of a man with a woman, or at 
least with his wife (this specification is obviously crucial). It 
is conjugality and it alone that engenders the form of friend¬ 
ship in the relationship between the sexes. Plutarch evokes this 
conjugality briefly here, in a few strokes reminiscent of the 
Marriage Precepts. It involves sharing a common life (Plu¬ 
tarch plays on the words stergein and stegein, “to shelter,” “to 
keep at home”); it calls for mutual kindness (eunoia); it im¬ 
plies perfect community and a oneness of souls in separate 
bodies, a unity so strong that the spouses “no longer wish to 
be separate entities, or believe that that are so” 21 ; lastly, it 
requires reciprocal moderation, a sophrosyne that abjures any 
other liaison. It is concerning this last point that the transposi¬ 
tion of the theory of Eros to the practice of married life is most 
interesting, for it suggests an idea of the high value of marriage 
very different from that found in the Stoics. As a matter of 
fact, against the moderation that “comes from without,” 
which is nothing but obedience to laws and is imposed by 
shame and fear, Plutarch opposes the moderation that is the 
effect of Eros: it is Eros in fact, when he inflames the two 
spouses for one another, who teaches “self-control, decorum, 
and mutual trust.” Into the amorous soul of the husband and 
the wife, he introduces “modesty, silence, calm”; he bestows 
“a reserved manner” on them and makes them “attentive to 
a single being.” It is easy to recognize in this sketch the 
characteristics of the pederastic Eros, the bringer of virtue and 
measure to the souls of lovers, the source, in the more perfect 
beings like Socrates, of that self-restraint which made him 
hold his silence and keep control of his desires in the presence 
of those he loved. Plutarch transposes to the married couple 



Boys 


205 


the traits that had long been reserved for the philia of lovers 
of the same sex. 

However, the elaboration of a general theory of love, 
equally valid for the relationship with women and the relation¬ 
ship with boys, is skewed: Plutarch has not gone, as Anthem- 
ion asked him to do and as he claimed to be doing, from a 
particular love to a more general love. He has borrowed from 
the erotics of boys its fundamental and traditional features in 
order to demonstrate that they can be applied, not to all forms 
of love, but to the conjugal relationship alone. 

3. Such is in fact the ultimate goal of the dialogue: to show 
that this single chain of love, which can find its perfect realiza¬ 
tion in marriage, cannot be accommodated, at least not in its 
complete form, in the relationship with boys. While this rela¬ 
tionship, with its traditional values, has been able to serve as 
a support and model for the general conception of love, it finds 
itself, in the last analysis, invalidated and fallen into disfavor: 
an imperfect love when one compares it with that of husband 
and wife. 

Where does Plutarch have this imperfection reside? So long 
as one had a dualistic erotics that distinguished true love (true 
because it was pure) from false, delusive love (false because it 
was physical), the absence of the aphrodisia was not merely 
possible, it was necessary if this was to be made the love 
relation par excellence. But the elaboration of a general erot¬ 
ics, linking Eros and Aphrodite closely together, changes the 
terms of the problem. The elision of the aphrodisia, ceasing to 
be a precondition, becomes an obstacle. Plutarch says this 
explicitly: if Aphrodite without Eros offers only a momentary 
pleasure that can be purchased for a few drachmas, Eros 
without Aphrodite, when physical pleasure is lacking, is no 
less imperfect. A love without Aphrodite is “like drunkenness 
without wine, brought on by a brew of figs and barley. No fruit 
[akarpon], no fulfillment [ateles] comes of the passion; it is 
cloying and quickly wearied of.’’ 22 

Now, can the love of a boy find a place for the aphrodisia ?

The Care of the Self 


We know the argument.* Either sexual relations will be im¬ 
posed through violence and the individual who undergoes 
them will feel only anger, hatred, and desire for revenge. Or 
they will be consented to by an individual who, because of his 
“softness,” his “femininity,” “enjoys being passive” (hedome- 
nos toi paschein), which is a “shameful,” “unnatural” thing, 
and which reduces him to the lowest condition. 24 Plutarch has 
gone back to the “dilemma of the eromenos"-. compelled, he 
feels hatred, and consenting, he becomes an object of con¬ 
tempt. The traditional adversaries of pederasty let it go at that. 
But Plutarch’s analysis goes further, attempting to define what 
is lacking in the love of boys, what prevents it from being, like 
conjugal love, a harmonious mixture of Eros and Aphrodite, 
in which the bond between souls is associated with physical 
pleasure. Plutarch designates this deficiency with one word: 
the love of boys is acharistos. 

The word charis, which appears several times in the course 
of the dialogue, seems to be one of the keys to Plutarch’s 
reflection. It is introduced with a good deal of solemnity at the 
beginning of the text, before the formulation of the great 
theory of a single love. Daphnaeus is the first to use it, as an 
“overpowering” argument in favor of his thesis: the love of 
women is special, he says, in that through the practice of such 
sexual relations as nature has established, it can lead to friend¬ 
ship (eis philian) by way of charis. 25 And Daphnaeus attaches 
so much importance to this term that he immediately under¬ 
takes to define it and to give it a few great poetic sponsors: 
charis is the consent that a woman willingly grants to a man, 
a consent that can appear only with nubility, according to 
Sappho, and the absence of which can result, according to 
Pindar, in ungraceful births; thus Hephaestus was born from 
Hera “aneu chariton. ” 2A The role that is assigned to this acqui¬ 
escence is clear: to integrate sexual relations, with their two 
naturally defined poles of activity and passivity, into recipro- 

*Here Plutarch repeats the argument put forward by Daphnaeus.” 



Boys

cal relations of kindness and to bring physical pleasure into 
friendship. 

After this preliminary presentation, and once the unitary 
doctrine of love is established, the question of charis becomes 
preponderant at the end of the dialogue. It will serve as a 
discriminant between the love of women and the love of boys, 
only the former being able to engender that complete form in 
which are joined, owing to the gentleness of consent, the plea¬ 
sure of Aphrodite and the virtue of friendship. Now Plutarch 
does not conceive of this junction simply as a tolerance that 
could concede, in the conjugal relationship, a more or less 
utilitarian place (e.g., for procreation) to sexual acts. On the 
contrary, he makes the latter the starting point of the whole 
relation of affection that should animate the relationship. 
Physical pleasure, precisely insofar as the gentleness of con¬ 
sent excludes everything in the way of violence, deceit, or base 
compliance, can be at the very origin of the affectionate reci¬ 
procities that marriage requires: “Physical union with a lawful 
wife is the beginning of friendship, a sharing, as it were, in 
great mysteries.” Sensual pleasure is a small matter (this is 
even a traditional expression among the enemies of physical 
pleasure); but, Plutarch immediately adds, “it is like the seed 
out of which mutual respect [time], kindness [charis], affec¬ 
tion [agapesis], and loyalty [p/vt/s] daily grow between hus¬ 
band and wife.” 27 

To this fundamental role and this germinative function of 
physical pleasure, Plutarch gives a solemn historical sanction. 
He finds it in the legislation by Solon, which prescribed that 
husbands must have intercourse with their wives “not less 
than three times a month.” In the Life of Solon, he also 
referred to this law, pointing out that it applied only to the 
marriage of heiress girls. The reason for it was the need for 
offspring to whom one could leave the estate. But, Plutarch 
added, this was not the only reason: for this regular inter¬ 
course, even when “it does not result in children,” “is a mark 
of esteem and affection which a man should pay to a chaste 



208 


The Care of the Self 


wife; it always removes the many annoyances which develop, 
and prevents their being altogether estranged by their differ¬ 
ences.” 28 To this role of sexual intercourse as an inducement 
to regular intimacy and a guarantee of good understanding, 
Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, lends an even more solemn 
formulation. He makes it a way to put new life into the conju¬ 
gal relationship, similar to the way in which one renews an 
agreement: “As cities renew their mutual agreements from 
time to time, just so he [Solon] must have wished this to be 
a renewal of marriage and with such an act of tenderness to 
wipe out the complaints that accumulate in everyday living.” 29 
Sexual pleasure is therefore at the heart of the matrimonial 
relation as a source and a token of the relationship of love and 
friendship. It founds the relationship, or in any case, reaffirms 
it as a covenant of existence. And if Plutarch acknowledges 
that the sexual relations at the beginning of marriage may be 
“wounding” to the wife, he also explains how this very “bite” 
is necessary for the formation of a vital, solid, and durable 
conjugal unity. He resorts to three metaphors: that of a plant 
that is grafted and must be well incised if it is to form, with 
the graft, a tree that will bear the desired fruit; that of a child 
or young man in whom one must inculcate, not without pain 
for him, the rudiments of a knowledge he will later turn to 
advantage and profit; that, lastly, of one liquid that is poured 
into another—after a period of effervescence and agitation, a 
mixture is produced, resulting in that di' ho Ion krasis to which 
the Marriage Precepts also made reference, 30 and together they 
form a new liquid whose two components can no longer be 
separated. A certain suffering, agitation, and disorder are inev¬ 
itable at the beginning of conjugal relations; but this is the 
necessary condition for a new, stable unity to be formed. 

And Plutarch thus arrives at the basic formulation: “To 
love is a greater boon thah to be loved.” 31 The statement is 
important given that in every love relation, the traditional 
erotics laid strong emphasis on the polarity of the lover and 
the beloved and on the necessary dissymmetry between them. 
Here it is the double activity of loving, by the husband and the 



Boys 


209 


wife, that forms the essential element. And for reasons that are 
easily determined. This double activity of loving is a source of 
reciprocity. It is because each of the two spouses loves the 
other that they consent to receive the tokens of the other’s 
love, that they like to be loved. The activity therefore is a 
source of faithfulness as well, since each of the two can take 
the love they feel for the other as a guide for their conduct and 
a reason for limiting their desires. “Love rescues us from all 
errors that wreck or impair wedlock.” 32 This union owes its 
value and its stability to the schema of a double love in which 
each partner is, from the standpoint of Eros, always an active 
subject. Owing to this reciprocity in the act of loving, sexual 
relations can have their place in the form of mutual affection 
and consent. In terms of this relational model, pederasty can 
only be inadequate in view of the strongly marked difference 
between the erastes and the eromenos, the dilemma of passiv¬ 
ity, and the necessary fragility that is due to the age factor. It 
lacks the double and symmetrical activity of loving, hence it 
lacks the internal regulation and the stability of the couple. It 
is wanting in that “grace” which makes it possible for the 
aphrodisia to be combined with friendship in order to consti¬ 
tute the complete and perfect form of Eros. Pederasty, Plu¬ 
tarch might say, is a love that lacks “grace.” 

In sum, Plutarch’s text testifies to the formation of an erot¬ 
ics that, on certain essential points, differs from the erotics 
Greek civilization had known and developed. It is not entirely 
different, since, as the great central passage devoted to the 
eulogy of Eros shows, the traditional notions continue to play 
an essential role. But this Platonizing erotics is used by Plu¬ 
tarch to produce effects different from those with which it was 
usually associated. For a long time it had served to mark the 
existence of two distinct and antithetical loves (the first one 
common, oriented toward the aphrodisia; the second one ele¬ 
vated, spiritual, oriented toward the care of souls), but also to 
reestablish between them a kind of unity since only the second 
was considered genuine, the other being only its earthly 



210 


The Care of the Self 


shadow and simulacrum. Plutarch brings these same Platonic 
notions into play in an erotics that seeks to form a single Eros 
capable of accounting for the love of women and the love of 
boys, and to integrate the aphrodisia into it. But in the inter¬ 
ests of such a unity, this erotics ultimately excludes the love 
of boys, for it lacks charis. Starting from a dualistic erotics 
traversed.by the question of truth and semblance, and in¬ 
tended essentially to provide a rational foundation for the love 
of boys, but at the cost of an elision of the aphrodisia, one sees, 
in Plutarch, a new stylistics of love being formed. It is monistic 
in that it includes the aphrodisia, but it makes this inclusion 
a criterion allowing it to keep only conjugal love and to ex¬ 
clude relations with boys because of the deficiency that char¬ 
acterizes them. There can no longer be a place for them in this 
great unitary and integrative chain in which love is revitalized 
by the reciprocity of pleasure.

Pseudo-Lucian 


The Affairs of the Heart, attributed to Lucian, is manifestly 
a later text.* It is presented in the quite customary form of in¬ 
terlocking dialogues. Theomnestus, whose loves—for women 
or for boys—reappear more numerous than the heads of 
Hydra, almost before they have ended, complains of Aphro¬ 
dite. From the time when as a child he became an ephebe, the 
wrath of the goddess has been pursuing him. And yet, he is 
not a child of the Sun, nor does he have the boorish contempt 
of Hippolytus. He feels equally inclined toward both kinds of 
love, without managing to decide which of the two is more 
deserving of his attention. He asks Lycinus—who is not 
affected by either of these two passions—to serve as an impar¬ 
tial judge and to tell him which is the better choice. Fortu¬ 
nately, Lycinus has preserved, as if engraved in his memory, 
the dialogue of two men on this very subject. One of them 
loved only boys, considering the female Aphrodite to be only 
“an abyss.” The other was passionately fond of women. So he 
will relate their discussion. But Theomnestus should make no 
mistake—he was able, for his part, to pose the question in jest; 
Charicles and Callicratidas, whose views are about to be 
heard, spoke very seriously indeed. 

Needless to say, this last piece of information is not to be 
taken at face value. The two adversaries are certainly serious, 

*M. D. MacLeod places it at the beginning of the fourth century; F. Buffiere thinks 
it is from the second century . 1

The Care of the Self 


but Pseudo-Lucian is being ironic when he writes the em¬ 
phatic and weighty demonstrations he attributes to them. 
There is an element of pastiche in these pieces of bravura. 
Taken together, they constitute the typical discourse of the 
Advocate of Women and the Devotee of Boys. Traditional 
arguments, obligatory quotations, references to great philo¬ 
sophical ideas, rhetorical flourishes—the author smiles in re¬ 
porting the speeches of these imperturbable disputants. And, 
from this point of view, it should be noted that the pederastic 
discourse is much more ponderous, pretentious, and “ba¬ 
roque” than the one spoken in favor of women, which is 
plainer, more Stoicizing. The final irony—Theomnestus will 
observe that what it all comes down to is just a matter of 
kisses, caresses, and hands that wander beneath tunics—will 
be mainly at the expense of the eulogy of the love of boys. But 
this very irony indicates the seriousness of the problem that 
is raised. And whatever enjoyment Pseudo-Lucian may have 
had in sketching the “theoretical-discursive” portrait of these 
two devotees—their rhetorical profile, in rather heavy strokes 
—one can see in it a contemporary example, displaying the 
most prominent features, of that “contest of loves” which had 
such a long career in Hellenic culture. 

There is something surprising at the beginning of the dia¬ 
logue reported by Lycinus in order to enlighten his friend who 
is undecided between the two loves: this dialogue, which will 
be concluded (not without some ambiguity) in favor of the 
love of boys, is not placed under the sign of Eros, who is 
regarded as the guardian of this form of attachment, but under 
that of Aphrodite. The scene that Lycinus is supposed to recall 
in its smallest details unfolds at Cnidus, near the temple of 
the goddess, where the famous statue sculpted by Praxiteles 
stands. This does not, however, prevent the advocate of boys 
from invoking Eros, as tradition demands, in the course of the 
dialogue: Eros, “the heavenly spirit,” “hierophant of the mys¬ 
teries of Love.” As for the one who speaks for female plea¬ 
sures, it is naturally to Aphrodite that he will appeal for 
support. The fact that the goddess of Cnidus may be said to

preside over this debate where she is made to vie with Eros, 
her traditional partner-adversary, is easily explained. The rea¬ 
son is that the problem of physical pleasure traverses the entire 
dialogue. This is what the perplexity expressed by Theomnes- 
tus, equally susceptible to the charm of girls and the beauty 
of boys, is about; it is a question of the aphrodisia. It is 
physical pleasure that will have the last word and dismiss the 
prudish speeches with a peal of laughter. And it is physical 
pleasure that serves as a pretext for the debate between Chari- 
cles and Callicratidas—in the form of a meaningful anecdote: 
a young man, enamored of the marble by Praxiteles, had let 
himself be locked in the temple at night, and he had sullied 
the statue, but as if it had been a boy. 2 The telling of this story 
—a very traditional one—occasions the debate. Since the sac¬ 
rilegious act was addressed to Aphrodite, was it an homage to 
the goddess who presides over female pleasures? But given the 
form in which it was carried out, was it not a testimonial 
against that particular Aphrodite? An ambiguous act. Should 
this impious homage, this profanatory reverence, be ac¬ 
counted to the love of women, or of boys? 

And the question that runs through the whole dialogue, 
even if it appears forgotten in the most ethereal statements, 
will be this: What place, what form, should be given to sexual 
pleasure in the two loves? The answer to this question will 
serve as a discriminant, offering to the love of boys, in the 
heaven of philosophy, a moment’s victory, which the irony of 
reality will soon compromise. 

The debate has a rigid composition. Each of the two orators 
speaks in turn, and pleads, in a continuous discourse, the 
cause of the love he prefers. A silent witness (Lycinus) will 
judge the contest and determine the winner. Although the 
“boy-favoring” discourse of Callicratidas is longer and more 
ornate than that of Charicles, the two speeches have the same 
structure. The arguments are arranged in the same order and 
in such a way that one corresponds exactly to the other. Both 
discourses comprise two parts. The first replies to the ques¬ 
tion: What of the nature of the love being considered, what of 



214 


The Care of the Self 


its origin and its place in the natural order? The second replies 
to the question: What of the pleasure that one enjoys in this 
love, or in the other? What should its form be, and what value 
might it have? Rather than follow each of the two expositions 
in its continuity, we shall examine these two questions in turn 
in order to see how the partisan of the love of women and the 
advocate of the love of boys reply to them, each in his own 
way. 

1. The “pro-women” discourse of Charicles is based on a 
conception of the world that is doubtless Stoic in tone. 3 * Na¬ 
ture is defined as the power that, by blending the elements, 
brought life to everything by giving it a soul. It was she as well, 
Charicles continues, repeating a familiar lesson in well-known 
words, who provided for the succession of the generations. 5 
Knowing very well that living beings were made “from perish¬ 
able matter,” and since the time allotted to each being was 
brief, she contrived (emechanesato) things in such a way that 
the death of one would be the birth of another. Thus, through 
the process of succession, we can live forever. To accomplish 
this, she also contrived the division of the sexes, one being 
designed to ejaculate semen, the other to receive it. And she 
imbued each with an appetite (pothos) for the other. From the 
intercourse of these two sexes can come the succession of the 
generations, but never from the intercourse between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex. In this way Charicles anchors the 
proper nature of each sex, and the pleasure that befits each, 
firmly in the order of the universe, where death, generation, 
and eternity are interconnected. The “female” must not be¬ 
come unnaturally male, nor “the male be unbecomingly soft.” 
By defying this determination, one not only transgresses the 
proper attributes of the individual, one interferes with the 
concatenation of universal necessity. 

The second criterion of naturalness used in Charicles’ dis¬ 
course is the state of mankind at its beginnings. 6 A closeness 

•In his study on Hierocles, K. Praechter emphasizes the Stoic character of the 
passage. R. Bloch notes the presence of neo-Pythagorean themes in it . 4

to the gods through virtue, a desire to behave heroically, 
marriage at a suitable age, and a noble progeny: these were the 
four traits that characterized that lofty existence and ensured 
its accord with nature. Then came the fall, which was gradual. 
It seems that Charicles distinguishes, as stages in this degener¬ 
ation, the time when, pleasure leading humans to the depths, 
people sought “strange and extraordinary paths to enjoy¬ 
ment” (Should this be taken to mean non procreative forms of 
sexual relations or pleasures alien to marriage?), then the time 
when they came to “transgress the laws of Nature herself,” a 
bold development whose basic form—the only one in any case 
which is mentioned in the text—consists in treating a man like 
a woman. Now, in order for an act so alien to Nature to be 
possible, it was necessary that what enables one to do violence 
and to deceive—tyrannical power and the art of persuasion— 
be brought into relations between men. 

Charicles finds the third mark of naturalness in the animal 
world 7 —“the laws of nature” rule over them without restric¬ 
tion or division: neither lions, nor bulls, nor rams, nor boars, 
nor wolves, nor fish seek out their own sex. For them, “the 
decisions of Providence are unchangeable.” To this chaste 
animality, Pseudo-Lucian’s orator opposes the “perverse bes¬ 
tiality” of men, which makes them lower than other creatures 
whereas they were meant to be superior to the highest of them. 
Several significant terms are employed in Charicles’ speech to 
characterize this “bestiality” on the part of men: passion, but 
also “strange infection,” “blind insensibility” (anaisthesia), 
inability to hit the mark, so that they neglect what should be 
pursued and pursue what should be left alone. In contrast to 
the conduct of the animals, who obey the law and aim for the 
goal that is assigned to them, men who have sex with men 
evince all the signs traditionally ascribed to the passional state: 
uncontrolled violence, a sickly condition, blindness to the real¬ 
ity of things, an incapacity for attaining the goals set for 
human nature. 

In sum, the love of boys is placed in turn on the three axes 
of nature, as the general order of the world, the original state 



216 


The Care of the Self 


of mankind, and a behavior that is reasonably adapted to 
natural ends. It disturbs the orderly progression of things; 
it gives rise to violent and deceitful conduct. Finally, it is 
pernicious from the standpoint of human objectives. Cosmo- 
logically, “politically,” and morally, this type of relation 
transgresses nature. 

In the part of his discourse that replies to these assertions, 
Callicratidas does not so much advance arguments that refute 
his adversary, as put forward a different conception of the 
world, the human race, its history, and the noblest ties that 
can connect men to each other. To the idea of nature as a 
provident “mechanic” who, by means of sex, arranged for 
procreation and the succession of generations so as to give the 
human race an eternity that individuals are denied, he opposes 
the vision of a world formed out of chaos. It was the demiurgic 
Eros who conquered this primeval disorder by creating all 
things that have a soul and all that do not, by instilling the 
principle of harmony in the body of men, and by attaching 
them to one another through “the holy sentiment of friend¬ 
ship.” Charicles saw, in relations between men and woman, an 
artful Nature who established temporal succession in order to 
circumvent death. Callicratidas recognizes, in the love of boys, 
the strength of the bond that, by attaching and combining, 
triumphs over chaos. 8 

From this perspective, the history of the world should not 
be read as an early disregard for the laws of nature and a 
plunge into “the depths of pleasure,” but rather as a gradual 
release from the primary necessities. 9 In the beginning, man 
was pressed by needs. The arts and skills (technai and epis- 
temai) made it possible for him to escape from these pressures 
and to provide for himself in a better fashion. People learned 
to weave garments and build houses. Now, as the weaver’s art 
is to the use of animal skins, and as the builder’s art is to caves 
for shelter, the love of boys is to intercourse with women. The 
latter, in early times, was necessary in order that the race 
might not disappear. The love of boys, on the other hand, 
came into existence very late, not, as Charicles maintained, 



Boys 


217 


because there was a degeneration, but because, on the con¬ 
trary, there was an elevation toward more curiosity and 
knowledge. Indeed, when men, after having learned so many 
useful skills, began to “leave nothing unexplored,” philosophy 
appeared and with it pederasty. Pseudo-Lucian’s orator does 
not really explain this twin birth, but his speech contains 
enough familiar references so that it would have been readily 
understandable to any reader. It rests implicitly on the opposi¬ 
tion between the imparting of life through intercourse with the 
other sex and the imparting of “techniques” and “knowl¬ 
edges” through teaching, learning, and the relationship of 
disciple with master. When, emerging from the particular arts, 
philosophy began to inquire concerning all things, it found, as 
a means of transmitting the wisdom it obtains, the love of boys 
—which is also the love of noble souls, capable of virtue. One 
understands, then, how Callicratidas can reply with laughter 
to the animal lesson presented by his adversary: 10 What ex¬ 
actly is proved by the fact that lions do not love the males of 
their species, and that he-bears are not enamored of he-bears? 
Not that men have corrupted a nature that remains intact 
among the animals, but that animals do not know what it 
means to “philosophize,” and they are ignorant of the beauty 
that friendship can produce. 

The arguments of Callicratidas are evidently no more origi¬ 
nal than those of Charicles. Commonplaces of a vulgarized 
Stoicism, on the one hand, and a mixture of Platonic and 
Epicurean elements on the other?* No doubt. One cannot help 
but recognize, in this comparison of the two loves, an excuse 
for oratorical variations on the texture of traditional argu¬ 
ments. The banality (nicely embellished in places) of Chari¬ 
cles’ and Callicratidas’ explanations shows rather clearly that 
they were meant to function as philosophical escutcheons: the 
enthusiast of boys, on the Platonizing side, under the colors 
of Eros; and the defender of women, on the Stoic side, under 

*K. Praechter singles out the Epicurean aspects of Callicratidas'speech, but R. Bloch 
observes that the cosmogony that opens the discourse is not specifically Epicurean. 
Moreover, there are clear references to Plato (e.g., in paragraph 49)." 



218 


The Care of the Self 


the exacting sign of Nature. Which does not mean, obviously, 
that the Stoics condemned a pederasty that Platonism justified 
while rejecting marriage. We know that, from the viewpoint 
of doctrines, this is not the way things were—or in any case, 
things were far from being so simple. But one cannot fail to 
notice, in the documents we have, the presence of what might 
be called “a privileged association.” We have seen in the 
preceding part that the art of conjugal life was understood 
largely in terms of a Stoic mode of reflection, and in reference 
to a certain conception of nature, of its basic necessities, of the 
place and function ordained by it for all beings, of a general 
scheme of successive procreations, and of a state of original 
perfection from which the human race was estranged owing 
to a perverse decadence. Moreover, it is from a similar concep¬ 
tion that Christianity will amply draw when it decides to 
construct an ethics of the marital relationship. In the same 
way, the love of boys, practiced as a way of life, consolidated 
and reproduced for centuries a rather different theoretical 
landscape: a cosmic and individual force of love, an upward 
movement that enables man to escape from immediate neces¬ 
sities, the acquisition and transmission of knowledge through 
the intense forms and secret ties of friendship. The debate 
between the love of women and the love of boys is more than 
a literary joust. It is not, however, the conflict of two forms 
of sexual desire struggling for supremacy or for their respec¬ 
tive right to expression. It is the confrontation of two forms 
of life, of two ways of stylizing one’s pleasure, and of the two 
philosophical discourses that accompany these choices. 

2. After the theme of “nature,” both of these discourses— 
that of Charicles and that of Callicratidas—develop the ques¬ 
tion of pleasure. A question that, as we have seen, always 
constitutes a difficult point for a pederastic practice that is 
reflected in the form of friendship, affection, and the beneficial 
action of one soul on another. To speak of “pleasure” to the 
lover of boys is already to raise an objection. This is clearly 
how Charicles understands the matter. He begins the debate 



Boys 


219 


on this theme with a traditional denunciation of pederastic 
hypocrisy: You pretend to be disciples of Socrates who are not 
enamored of bodies but of souls. How is it then that you do 
not pursue old men full of wisdom, but rather children, who 
are unable to reason? If it’s a matter of virtue, why love, as 
Plato did, a Phaedrus who betrayed Lysias, or, as Socrates did, 
an impious Alcibiades, an enemy of his country, eager to 
become a tyrant? One would do well, therefore, despite the 
claims of this love of souls, “to descend,” along with Chari- 
cles, to the question of pleasure, and to compare “the practice 
of boys” with the “practice of women.” 

Among the arguments that Charicles employs to differenti¬ 
ate between these two “practices” and the place that pleasure 
occupies in each, the first is that of age and transience. 12 Until 
the threshold of old age, a woman preserves her charms—even 
if she must lend them the support of her long experience. A 
boy, for his part, is agreeable only for a moment. And Chari¬ 
cles contrasts the body of a woman—who, with her ringlets 
of hair, her skin always smooth and “not a hair growing on 
it,” remains an object of desire—with the body of a boy, which 
very soon becomes hairy and muscled. But from this differ¬ 
ence, Charicles does not conclude, as is often done, that one 
can love a boy only for a very short time, and that one is very 
soon led to abandon him. Rather, he evokes the man who goes 
on loving a boy past twenty. What he pursues in this case is 
an “equivocal Aphrodite,” a love in which he plays the passive 
part. The physical modification of boys is here invoked as a 
cause not of the transience of feelings but of an inversion of 
sexual roles. 

A second reason in favor of the “female practice” is reci¬ 
procity. 13 This is doubtless the most interesting part of Chari¬ 
cles’ discourse. He first refers to the princple that man, a 
rational being, is not made to live alone. From this he does not, 
however, deduce the necessity of having a family or of belong¬ 
ing to a city, but the impossibility of “passing one’s time” all 
alone and the need for a “community of affection” (philetairos 
koindnia), which makes good things more pleasant and pain-

ful things more bearable. That the shared life has this role is 
an idea that is regularly found in the Stoic treatises on mar¬ 
riage. Here it is applied to the specific domain of physical 
pleasures. Charicles first evokes the meals and banquets that 
one enjoys with others, because, according to him, shared 
pleasures are made more intense. Then he speaks of the sexual 
pleasures. According to the traditional assertion, the boy who 
is passive, hence more or less violated (hubrismenos), cannot 
experience pleasure; no one “could be so mad” as to state the 
contrary. When he no longer cries and suffers, the other 
becomes a nuisance to him. The lover of a boy takes his 
pleasure and leaves; he gives none in return. With women, 
things are completely different. Charicles first states the fact, 
then the rule. In sexual intercourse with a woman, there is, he 
affirms, “an equal exchange of enjoyment”; and the two part¬ 
ners separate after having given each other an equal amount 
of pleasure. To this fact of nature corresponds a principle of 
conduct: it is good not to seek a selfish enjoyment (philautos 
apolausai), not to try and have all the pleasure oneself, but to 
share it by supplying the other with as much of it as one 
experiences. To be sure, this reciprocity of pleasure is already 
a well-known theme, which amatory or erotic literature has 
used quite often. But it is interesting to see it used here at the 
same time to give a “natural” characterization of intercourse 
with women, to define a rule of behavior in the practice of the 
aphrodisia, and to designate what there might be that is non¬ 
natural, violent, hence unjust and bad, in the intercourse of a 
man with a boy. Reciprocity of pleasure in an exchange where 
one shows concern for the other’s enjoyment, while observing 
as strict an equality as possible of the two partners, inscribes 
within sexual practice an ethics that extends the ethics of 
communal existence. 

To this serious bit of reasoning, Charicles adds two argu¬ 
ments that are less so, although they both relate to the ex¬ 
change of pleasures. One refers to a theme that was common 
in erotic literature: women, for anyone who knows how to use 
them, are capable of offering all the pleasures that boys can

give, but the latter cannot provide the pleasure that is held 
exclusively by the female sex. 14 Women are thus capable of 
giving all the forms of sensual delight, including those most 
pleasing to the lovers of boys. According to the other argu¬ 
ment, if one finds love between men acceptable, one should 
also accept intercourse between women. 15 This polemical sym¬ 
metry invoked here between intermale relations and inter¬ 
female relations is interesting: first, because it denies, as does 
the second part of Charicles’ discourse, the cultural, moral, 
affective, and sexual specificity of the love of boys, bringing 
it back into the general category of relations between male 
individuals; second, because, in order to compromise the 
latter, it uses the traditionally more scandalous love—one is 
“ashamed” even to talk about it—between women; and third, 
because Charicles, reversing this hierarchy, suggests that it is 
even more shameful for a man to be passive like a woman than 
for a woman to take the male role.* 

The part of Callicratidas’ discourse that replies to this criti¬ 
cism is by far the longest. Even more so than in the rest of the 
debate, the characteristic features of a “piece of rhetoric” are 
visible here. Engaging, apropos of sexual pleasure, the most 
problematic element of the love of boys, the pederastic ar- 
gumentarium is fully deployed, with all its resources and its 
most noble references. But they are brought into play in re¬ 
sponse to the question that Charicles has stated very clearly: 
the reciprocity of pleasure. On this point both adversaries 
refer to a simple and coherent conception: for Charicles, and 
the “adherents of female love,” it is the fact of being able to 
occasion the other’s pleasure, to be attentive to it, and to take 
pleasure in it oneself—it is this charis, as Plutarch says,f that 
legitimates pleasure in intercourse between a man and a 
woman, and allows it to be integrated into Eros; it is the 
absence of charis, on the other hand, that marks and dis¬ 
qualifies intercourse with boys. As the tradition of this other 

•Is it not better that a woman should play the role of a man “than that the nobility 
of the male sex should become effeminate and play the part of a woman”? 16 
tCharicles does not himself use this word. 



222 


The Care of the Self 


love prescribes, Callicratidas cites as its keystone not charis 
but arete —virtue. It is virtue that should ensure between part¬ 
ners both an honorable, wisely apportioned pleasure and the 
commonality that is indispensable to the relationship between 
two individuals. Let us say, to be brief, that to the “gracious 
reciprocity” that only pleasure with women is capable of pro¬ 
viding, according to its proponents, its adversaries oppose the 
“virtuous commonality” that is the exclusive privilege of the 
love of boys. Callicratidas’. demonstration consists first of all 
in criticizing, as illusory, that reciprocity of pleasure which 
the love of women claims as its specific trait, and in setting 
against it, as the only relationship capable of truth, the virtu¬ 
ous relationship with boys. Thus, in a single stroke, the privi¬ 
lege of reciprocal pleasure attributed to male-female relations 
will be contested, and the theme that the love of boys is 
unnatural will be turned around. 

In a display of rancor, Callicratidas reels off a series of 
commonplaces against women. 17 One only has to look closely 
to see that women are intrinsically “ugly,” “truly” (alethos) 
so: their bodies are “unshapely” and their faces are as ill- 
favored as those of monkeys. They must take great pains to 
mask this reality: makeup, fancy clothes, coiffures, jewels, 
adornments. For the benefit of spectators they give themselves 
a spurious beauty, which a careful gaze suffices to dissipate. 
And then they have a liking for secret cults, which allow them 
to envelop their debauches in mystery. There is no need to 
recall all the satirical themes that are echoed, rather flatly, by 
this passage. One could find many other examples, with simi¬ 
lar arguments, in the eulogies of pederasty. Thus Achilles 
Tatius, in Leucippe and Clitophon, has one of his characters, 
a lover of boys, say: “False are the ways of a woman, words 
and deeds alike; and although she may seem fair to behold, it 
is all the result of the laborious use of pigments, and her 
beauty is all of myrrh, hair dye and makeup; and if she is 
stripped of all these many devices, she is like the jackdaw that 
was plucked of its feathers in the fable.” 18 

A woman’s world is deceptive because it is a secret world. 



Boys 


223 


The social separation between the group of men and that of 
women, their different ways of life, the careful division be¬ 
tween female activities and male activities—all this probably 
did much to heighten, in the experience of Hellenic men, this 
apprehension of women as mysterious and deceptive objects. 
One could be deceived about a woman’s body, which was 
hidden by adornments and which might be disappointing 
when it was uncovered. One was apt to suspect it of cleverly 
masked imperfections. One was afraid of discovering some 
repellent defect. The female body, with its secrecy and its 
particular characteristics, was charged with ambiguous pow¬ 
ers. Do you wish, says Ovid, to rid yourself of a passion? Look 
a little more closely at the body of your mistress. 19 * One could 
be deceived, too, regarding morals, with that secret life which 
women led, a life enclosed in disturbing mysteries. In the 
argumentation that Pseudo-Lucian attributes to Callicratidas, 
these themes have a precise significance: they enable him to 
question the principle of reciprocity of pleasure in intercourse 
with women. How could there be such a reciprocity if women 
are deceptive, if they have their own pleasure, if, unbeknown 
to men, they indulge in secret debauchery? How could there 
be a valid exchange if the pleasures their appearance lets one 
imagine are nothing but false promises? So that the objection 
usually made to intercourse with boys—that it does not ac¬ 
cord with nature—can just as easily be applied to women, even 
more seriously in their case, since by choosing to mask the 
truth of their nature, they deliberately introduce falsehood. 
The makeup argument may seem to us to carry little force in 
this debate on the two loves. For the ancients, however, it is 
based on two serious considerations: the apprehension that 
derives from the female body, and the philosophical and moral 
principle that a pleasure is legitimate only if the object that 
gives rise to it is genuine. In the pederastic argumentation, 

•Or these verses: “Open the windows wide, all of them, draw back the curtains, / Let 
the light make clear parts that are ugly to see.” After lovemaking, “note down in your 
mind her every blemish of body, / Keep your eyes on her faults, memorize every 
defect.” 20 



224 


The Care of the Self 


pleasure with a woman cannot be reciprocal because it is 
accompanied by too much falseness. 

In contrast, pleasure with boys is placed under the sign of 
truth. 21 The beauty of a young man is real because it is uncon¬ 
trived. As Achilles Tatius has one of his characters say: “The 
beauty of a boy is not fostered by the odor of myrrh perfumes, 
nor yet by cunning and foreign unguents. And the fresh natu¬ 
ral odor of a boy has a sweeter smell than all the anointings 
and perfumery of a woman.” 22 Callicratidas contrasts the de¬ 
ceptive enticements of the female dressing table with a descrip¬ 
tion of the boy who gives no thougnt to any preparations: he 
jumps out of bed at dawn and washes with pure water. He has 
no need of a mirror, he doesn’t use a comb. He throws his 
chlamys on his shoulder and hurries off to school. At the 
palestra he exercises vigorously, works up a sweat, and bathes 
quickly. And once the lessons of wisdom he is given have been 
understood, he quickly falls asleep as a result of the day’s 
beneficial exertions. 

How could one not wish to share one’s whole life with this 
guileless boy? 23 One would like to “pass one’s time sitting 
opposite this dear friend,” enjoying his pleasant conversation, 
and “sharing every activity with him.” A sensible pleasure 
that will last not just for the fleeting time of youth. Since it 
does not take as its object the physical grace that fades away, 
it can endure all through life: old age, sickness, death, the 
tomb even, everything can be experienced in common; “to 
unite my bones with his and not to keep even our dumb ashes 
apart.” It was a traditional theme, certainly, that friendships 
could grow out of youthful love affairs and sustain life, until 
the moment of death, through a lasting manly affection. This 
passage from Pseudo-Lucian appears to be a variation on one 
of the themes developed in Xenophon’s Symposium. The ideas 
are the same, presented in an analogous order and expressed 
in similar words: the pleasure of looking at each other, the 
conversation, the sharing of feelings in success or failure, the 
care given when one of the two falls ill—in this way, affection

can reign between the two friends through to old age. 24 Pseu¬ 
do-Lucian’s text gives particular emphasis to one important 
point concerning this affection that continues after adoles¬ 
cence. It is a matter of forming a bond in which the equality 
is so perfect, or the reversibility so complete, that the role of 
the erastes and that of the eromenos can no longer be distin¬ 
guished. This is how things were, says Callicratidas, between 
Orestes and Pylades, about whom it was traditional to won¬ 
der, as in the case of Achilles and Patroclus, who was the lover 
and who the beloved. Pylades was the lover, it seems. But as 
they grew older, and when the time of trial came—the two 
friends had to decide which one would face death—the be¬ 
loved behaved as the lover. One should see a model in this. It 
is in this way, says Callicratidas, that the zealous and serious 
love one bears for a young boy (the famous spoudaios erds) 
must be transformed. It must become the manly form (an- 
drousthai) with the coming of that age when a youth is at last 
capable of reason. In this masculine affection, the one who had 
been loved “gives love in return,” and to such an extent that 
it becomes difficult to know “which of the two is the erastes 
the affection of the one who loves is returned to him by the 
beloved the way an image is reflected in a mirror. 25 

The return by the beloved of the affection he has received 
had always been a part of pederastic ethics, whether this was 
in the form of help in misfortune, care in old age, companion¬ 
ship in lif e, or unexpected sacrifice. But Pseudo-Lucian’s insis¬ 
tence on the equality of the two lovers and his use of words 
that characterize conjugal reciprocity seem to show a concern 
to adapt male love to the descriptive and prescriptive model 
of marriage. After enumerating everything that is simple, nat¬ 
ural, and free of all artifice in the body of a young man, and 
hence after establishing the “truthfulness” of the pleasure he 
is capable of providing, the author of the text relates the 
spiritual bond, not to pedagogical action, or to the formative 
effect of this attachment, but entirely to the exact reciprocity 
of an equal exchange. In proportion as the description of the 



226 


The Care of the Self 


male and female bodies sets them in contrast, in this speech 
by Callicratidas, the ethics of living as a couple seems to draw 
manly affection closer to the marriage tie. 

But there is still a basic difference. For, while the love of 
boys is defined as the only love in which virtue and pleasure 
can be combined, pleasure is never designated as sexual plea¬ 
sure. There is the charm of that juvenile body, without 
makeup or deception, of that regular, disciplined life, of the 
amical conversation, of the affection that is returned—true. 
But the the text makes it quite clear: in his bed, the boy is 
“without a companion”; he looks at no one when he is on his 
way to school; in the evening, tired from his work, he goes 
right to sleep. And Callicratidas gives some unequivocal ad¬ 
vice to the lovers of such boys: Remain as chaste as Socrates 
when he slept beside Alcibiades. Approach them with temper¬ 
ance (sophronos). Don’t squander a lasting affection for the 
sake of a brief pleasure. And it is this very lesson which will 
be drawn, once the debate is concluded, when, with an ironic 
solemnity, Lycinus awards the prize; it goes to the speech that 
praised the love of boys, insofar as the latter is practiced by 
“philosophers” and insofar as it pledges itself to ties of friend¬ 
ship that are “just and undefiled.” 

The debate between Charicles and Callicratidas thus ends 
with a “victory” of the love of boys. A victory conforming to 
a traditional schema that reserves for philosophers a pederasty 
in which physical pleasure is evaded. A victory, however, that 
gives everyone not only the right but also the duty to marry 
(according to a formula we have encountered in the Stoics: 
pantapasi gameteon). This is in effect a syncretic conclusion, 
which superimposes on the universality of marriage the privi¬ 
lege of a love of boys reserved for those who, being philoso¬ 
phers, are capable of a “perfect virtue.” But one should not 
forget that this debate, whose traditional and rhetorical char¬ 
acter is emphasized in the text itself, is embedded in another 
dialogue: that of Lycinus with Theomnestus, who asks his 
opinion on which of the two loves he should choose, since he 
feels equally drawn to both. So Lycinus has just reported to 



Boys 


227 


Theomnestus the “verdict” he gave to Charicles and Calli- 
cratidas. But Theomnestus immediately waxes ironic about 
the crucial point of the debate and about the deciding factor 
in the victory of pederastic love: the latter won because it was 
linked to philosophy, to virtue, and hence to the elimination 
of physical pleasure. Is one expected to believe that this is 
really the way in which one loves boys? Theomnestus does not 
become indignant, as did Charicles, at the hypocrisy of such 
a discourse. Whereas, in order to link together pleasure and 
virtue, the advocates of boys stressed the absence of any sexual 
act, he reinstates the physical contact that one enjoys, the 
kisses, the caresses, and the gratification, as the real reason for 
the existence of this love. Seriously, he says, they can’t make 
us believe that the whole pleasure of this relationship is in 
looking into each other’s eyes and in being enchanted by 
friendly conversation. Looking is agreeable, certainly, but it is 
only the first stage. After that comes touching, which thrills 
the whole body. Then kissing, which is timid at first but soon 
becomes eager. The hand does not remain idle during this 
time; it glides down under the clothing, squeezes the breasts 
for a moment, descends the length of the firm belly, reaches 
the “flower of puberty,” and finally strikes the target . 26 For 
Theomnestus, and doubtless for the author as well, this de¬ 
scription does not amount to a rejection of an inadmissible 
practice. It is a reminder that it is not possible—without re¬ 
sorting to violence—to keep the aphrodisia outside the do¬ 
main of love and its justifications. Pseudo-Lucian’s irony is not 
a way of denouncing this pleasure which one can take in boys, 
a pleasure he evokes with a smile. It is a fundamental objection 
to the very old line of argument of Greek pederasty, which, 
in order to conceptualize, formulate, and discourse about the 
latter and to supply it with reasons, was obliged to evade the 
manifest presence of physical pleasure. He does not say that 
the love of women is better. But he demonstrates the essential 
weakness of a discourse on love that makes no allowance for 
the aphrodisia and for the relations they engage.

A New Erotics 


During this period in which one notes that reflection on the 
love of boys manifests its sterility, one sees some of the ele¬ 
ments of a new erotics coming to the fore. Its privileged place 
is not in philosophical texts, and it does not borrow its major 
themes from the love of boys. It develops in reference to the 
relationship between a man and a woman, and it finds expres¬ 
sion in romances, of which the chief surviving examples are 
the adventures of Chaereas and Callirhoe, written by Chariton 
of Aphrodisias; those of Leucippe and Clitophon, recounted by 
Achilles Tatius; and the Ethiopica, by Heliodorus. It is true 
that many uncertainties remain in connection with this litera¬ 
ture, relative to the circumstances of its emergence and suc¬ 
cess, the date of the texts, and their possible allegorical and 
spiritual significance. 1 But one can nonetheless call attention 
to the presence, in these long narratives with their countless 
episodes, of some of the themes that will subsequently charac¬ 
terize erotics, both religious and profane: the existence of a 
“heterosexual” relation marked by a male-female polarity, the 
insistence on an abstention that is modeled much more on 
virginal integrity than on the political and virile domination 
of desires; and finally, the fulfillment and reward of this purity 
in a union that has the form and value of a spiritual marriage. 
In this sense, and whatever may have been the influence of 
Platonism on this erotics, it is clearly far removed from an 


228 



Boys 


229 


erotics that referred essentially to the temperate love of boys 
and to its perfection in the lasting form of friendship. 

It is true that the love of boys is not completely absent from 
this romantic literature. Not only does it occupy an important 
place, certainly, in the tales of Petronius or Apuleius, which 
attests to the frequency and quite general acceptance of the 
practice. But it is also present in certain tales of virginity, 
betrothal, and marriage. Thus in Leucippe and Clitophon, two 
characters represent it, and in a completely positive manner: 
Clinias, who tries to dissuade his own male lover from mar¬ 
riage, nevertheless gives the hero of the tale some excellent 
advice for making progress in the love of girls . 2 Menelaus, for 
his part, offers a charming theory of a boy’s kiss—not cunning, 
or soft, or licentious, like that of a woman; a kiss that is the 
product not of art but of nature: a glaze of nectar become lips, 
such is the simple kiss of a boy at the gymnasium . 3 But these 
are only episodic and marginal themes. The love of a boy is 
never the principal object of the narrative. The whole focus of 
attention is centered on the relationship of the boy and the 
girl. This relationship always begins with a revelation that 
strikes them both and makes them love each other with an 
equal intensity. Except in the novel by Chariton of Aphro- 
disias, Chaereas and Callirhoe, this love does not immediately 
result in their union: the novel recounts a long series of adven¬ 
tures, which separate the two young people and prevent both 
marriage and the consummation of pleasure until the last 
moment. * These adventures are, insofar as possible, symmet¬ 
rical. Everything that happens to the one has its counterpart 
in the changes of fortune the other is made to undergo, which 
allows them to show the same courage, the same endurance, 
the same fidelity. This is because the primary significance of 
these adventures and their ability to sustain one’s interest until 
the denouement have to do with the fact that in the midst of 


*In Chaereas and Callirhoe, the separation occurs immediately after marriage; but 
the two spouses preserve their love, their purity, and their faithfulness throughout 
their adventures. 



230 


The Care of the Self 


them the two characters hold strictly to a reciprocal sexual 
fidelity. A fidelity where the protagonists are married, as in the 
case of Chaereas and Callirhoe; a virginity in other tales, 
where the adventures and misfortunes come after the discov¬ 
ery of love and before marriage. Now it must be understood 
that this virginity is not simply an abstention resulting from 
a pledge. It is a choice of lives, which in the Ethiopica even 
appears to be prior to love. Chariclea, carefully schooled by 
her adoptive father in the quest for “the best of lives,” refused 
even to entertain the idea of marriage. The father had com¬ 
plained of this, moreover, after suggesting an honorable candi¬ 
date: “Neither by kind attentions, nor by promises, nor by 
appeals to reason, have I been able to persuade her. Hardest 
blow of all, she has aimed, as they say, my own shafts against 
me, and brandishes over me her accomplishment in the arts 
of speech—the subtleties of which I have imparted to her 
. . . glorifying the virgin state, which, she declares, is next to 
the immortal.” 4 Symmetrically, Theagenes had never had re¬ 
lations with a woman: “He affirmed with many oaths that he 
had never yet had intimacy with a woman. He had spurned 
all women, and marriage itself, and many love affairs that were 
mentioned to him, until the beauty of Chariclea had proved 
to him that he was not by nature obdurate. But up to the 
previous day he had never beheld a woman worthy of being 
loved.” 5 

We see then that virginity is not simply abstention as a 
preliminary to sexual practice. It is a choice, a style of life, a 
lofty form of existence that the hero chooses out of the regard 
that he has for himself. When the most extraordinary occur¬ 
rences separate the two protagonists and expose them to the 
worst dangers, the gravest will of course be that of falling prey 
to the sexual cupidity of others. The greatest test of their own 
worth and their mutual love will be that of resisting at all costs 
and of saving that virginity which is essential to the relation¬ 
ship with themselves and essential to the relationship with 
each other. Thus the novel by Achilles Tatius unfolds as a 
kind of odyssey of double virginity. A virginity exposed, as- 



Boys 


231 


sailed, doubted, slandered, safeguarded—except for an honor¬ 
able, minor lapse that Clitophon allowed himself—and finally 
justified and certified in a sort of divine ordeal, which makes 
it possible to proclaim concerning the girl, “she is still the 
same, up to the present day, as when you sent her away from 
Byzantium; it is to be put down to her credit that she remained 
a virgin when surrounded by a gang of pirates, and overcame 
the worst of them.” And speaking of himself, Clitophon can 
also say, in a symmetrical fashion: “You will find that I have 
imitated your virginity, if there be any virginity in men .” 6 

But if love and sexual abstention thus coincide during the 
entire adventure, one has to understand that it is not simply 
a question of defending oneself against outsiders. This preser¬ 
vation of virginity holds within the love relation as well. The 
lovers save themselves for each other until the time when love 
and virginity find their fulfillment in marriage. So that 
premarital chastity, which brings the two fiances together in 
spirit so long as they are separated and being put to the test 
by others, keeps them self-restrained and makes them abstain 
when they are finally reunited after many twists of fate. Find¬ 
ing themselves alone in a cave, left to themselves, Theagenes 
and Chariclea “took their fill of ardent embraces and kisses. 
In a moment they were oblivious of everything else. For a long 
time they clung to each other as though grown into one per¬ 
son, satiating themselves with a devout, virginal love, com¬ 
muning with one another through the flow of hot tears, and 
commingling only by the chaste means of their kisses. For 
Chariclea, when she found Theagenes making some too im¬ 
pulsive advance of manly ardor, restrained him by recalling 
his oaths, and his attempt was easily checked. It was a light 
matter for him to be temperate, for although mastered by love 
he could be master of his pleasures .” 7 This virginity is not to 
be understood, then, as an attitude that is set against all sexual 
relations, even if they take place within marriage. It is much 
more the test preparatory to that union, the movement that 
leads to it and in which it will find its fulfillment. Love, virgin¬ 
ity, and marriage form a whole: the two lovers have to pre- 



232 


The Care of the Self 


serve their physical integrity, but also their purity of heart, 
until the moment of their union, which is to be understood in 
the physical but also the spiritual sense. 

Thus there begins to develop an erotics different from the 
one that had taken its starting point in the love of boys, even 
though abstention from the sexual pleasures plays an impor¬ 
tant part in both. This new erotics organizes itself around the 
symmetrical and reciprocal relationship of a man and a 
woman, around the high value attributed to virginity, and 
around the complete union in which it finds perfection. 





A whole corpus of moral reflection on sexual activity and 
its pleasures seems to mark, in the first centuries of our era, 
a certain strengthening of austerity themes. Physicians worry 
about the effects of sexual practice, unhesitatingly recommend 
abstention, and declare a preference for virginity over the use 
of pleasure. Philosophers condemn any sexual relation that 
might take place outside marriage and prescribe a strict 
fidelity between spouses, admitting no exceptions. Further¬ 
more, a certain doctrinal disqualification seems to bear on the 
love for boys. 

Does this mean that one must recognize, in the schema thus 
constituted, the lineaments of a future ethics, the ethics that 
one will find in Christianity, when the sexual act itself will be 
considered an evil, when it will no longer be granted legiti¬ 
macy except within the conjugal relationship, and when the 
love of boys will be condemned as unnatural? Must one sup¬ 
pose that certain thinkers, in the Greco-Roman world, already 
had a presentiment of this model of sexual austerity which, in 
Christian societies, will be given a legal framework and an 
institutional support? One would thus find, formulated by a 
few austere philosophers isolated in the midst of a world that 
did not itself appear to be austere, the outline of a new ethics, 
destined, in the following centuries, to take more stringent 
forms and to gain a more general validity. 

The question is important, and it has a long tradition behind 

235 



236 


The Care of the Self 


it. Since the Renaissance, it has laid down, in Catholicism and 
Protestantism alike, relatively similar dividing lines. On the 
one side, a certain ancient ethics closely related to Christianity 
(this is the thesis of the Manuductio ad stoicam philosophiam 
by Justus Lipsius, which Karl Barth radicalized by making 
Epictetus into a true Christian; it is, later, on behalf of the 
Catholics, the thesis of J.-P. Camus and, most notably, of the 
Epictete chretien by Jean-Marie de Bordeaux). On the other 
side, those for whom Stoicism was just another philosophy, 
one that was virtuous, certainly, but indelibly pagan (thus 
Salmasius among the Protestants, and Arnauld or Tillemont 
among the Catholics). The point at issue, however, was not 
just to bring certain of the ancient philosophers within the 
bounds of the Christian faith or to preserve the latter from any 
pagan contamination; the problem was also to determine what 
foundation to give to an ethics whose prescriptive elements 
seemed to be shared, up to a point, by Greco-Roman philoso¬ 
phy and the Christian religion. The debate that developed at 
the end of the nineteenth century is not unconnected with this 
problematic either, even if it sets up an interference with prob¬ 
lems of historical method. Zahn, in his famous address, did 
not try to make a Christian of Epictetus, but to call attention 
to the signs of a knowledge of Christianity and to the traces 
of its influence. 1 Bonhoffer’s work, which replied to Zahn, 
sought to establish the unity of philosophy without there being 
the need to appeal to the disparate elements of an external 
action in order to explain this or that aspect of it. 2 But it was 
also a matter of knowing where to look for the basis of 
the moral imperative and whether it was possible to detach 
Christianity from a certain type of ethics that had long been 
associated with it. Now, in this debate it seems that the partici¬ 
pants granted, in a relatively confused way, three presupposi¬ 
tions: according to the first, the essential component of an 
ethics is to be sought in the code elements it contains; accord¬ 
ing to the second, the philosophical ethics of late antiquity 
resembled Christianity in its severe precepts, which repre¬ 
sented an almost complete break with the previous tradition; 



Conclusion

lastly, according to the third presupposition, it was in terms 
of loftiness and purity that Christian ethics could best be 
compared with the ethics that, in certain philosophers of an¬ 
tiquity, prepared the way for it. 

It is hardly possible, however, to let the matter remain 
there. One has to bear in mind, first, that the principles of 
sexual austerity were not defined for the first time in the 
philosophy of the imperial epoch. We have encountered in 
Greek thought of the fourth century b.c. formulations that 
were not much less demanding. After all, as we have seen, the 
sexual act appears to have been regarded for a very long time 
as dangerous, difficult to master, and costly; a precise calcula¬ 
tion of its acceptable practice and its inclusion in a careful 
regimen had been required for quite some time. Plato, Isoc¬ 
rates, and Aristotle recommended, each in his own way, at 
least some forms of conjugal fidelity. And the love of boys 
could be held in the highest esteem. But the practice of absten¬ 
tion was demanded of it as well, so that it might preserve the 
spiritual value expected of it. Hence a very long time had 
passed during which concern for the body and for health, the 
relation to wives and to marriage, and the relationship with 
boys had been motifs for the elaboration of a severe ethics. 
And in a certain way, the sexual austerity that one encounters 
in the philosophers of the first centuries of our era has its roots 
in this ancient tradition. It is true that one should not ignore 
the carefully maintained continuity and the conscious reacti¬ 
vation evident in this thought of the first centuries, so mani¬ 
festly haunted by classical culture. Hellenistic philosophy and 
ethics experienced what Henri Marrou called “a long sum¬ 
mer.” But the fact remains that several modifications are 
perceptible: they prevent one from considering the moral 
philosophy of Musonius or that of Plutarch simply as the 
accentuation of the lessons of Xenophon, Plato, Isocrates, or 
Aristotle; they also prevent one from considering the recom¬ 
mendations of Soranus or Rufus of Ephesus as variations on 
the principles of Hippocrates or Diodes. 

As concerns dietetics and the problematization of health, 



238 


The Care of the Self 


the change is marked by an increased apprehension, a broader 
and more detailed definition of the correlations between the 
sexual act and the body, a closer attention to the ambivalence 
of its effects and its disturbing consequences. And this is not 
just a greater preoccupation with the body; it is also a different 
way of thinking about sexual activity, and of fearing it because 
of its many connections with disease and with evil. With re¬ 
gard to wives and to the problematization of marriage, the 
modification mainly concerns the valorization of the conjugal 
bond and the dual relation that constitutes it; the husband’s 
right conduct and the moderation he needs to enjoin on him¬ 
self are not justified merely by considerations of status, but by 
the nature of the relationship, its universal form and the mu¬ 
tual obligations that derive from it. Finally, as regards boys, 
the need for abstinence is less and less perceived as a way of 
giving the highest spiritual values to the forms of love, and 
more and more as the sign of an imperfection that is specific 
to sexual activity. 

Now, in these modifications of preexisting themes one can 
see the development of an art of existence dominated by self¬ 
preoccupation. This art of the self no longer focuses so much 
on the excesses that one can indulge in and that need to be 
mastered in order to exercise one’s domination over others. It 
gives increasing emphasis to the frailty of the individual faced 
with the manifold ills that sexual activity can give rise to. It 
also underscores the need to subject that activity to a universal 
form by which one is bound, a form grounded in both nature 
and reason, and valid for all human beings. It likewise empha¬ 
sizes the importance of developing all the practices and all the 
exercises by which one can maintain self-control and even¬ 
tually arrive at a pure enjoyment of oneself. It is not the ac¬ 
centuation of the forms of prohibition that is behind these 
modifications in sexual ethics. It is the development of an art 
of existence that revolves around the question of the self, of 
its dependence and independence, of its universal form and of 
the connection it can and should establish with others, of the 
procedures by which it exerts its control over itself, and of 



Conclusion 


239 


the way in which it can establish a complete supremacy over 
itself. 

And it is in this context that a dual phenomenon, character¬ 
istic of this ethics of pleasure, occurs. On the one hand, a more 
active attention to sexual practice is required, an attention to 
its effects on the organism, to its place and function within 
marriage, to its value and its difficulties in the relationship 
with boys. But at the same time as one dwells on it, and as the 
interest that one brings to bear on it is intensified, it increas¬ 
ingly appears to be dangerous and capable of compromising 
the relation with oneself that one is trying to establish. It 
seems more and more necessary to distrust it, to confine it, 
insofar as possible, to marital relations—even at the cost of 
charging it with more intense meanings within that conjugal 
relationship. Problematization and apprehension go hand in 
hand; inquiry is joined to vigilance. A certain style of sexual 
conduct is thus suggested by this whole movement of moral, 
medical, and philosophical reflection. It is different from the 
style that had been delineated in the fourth century, but it is 
also different from the one that will be found in Christianity. 
Here sexual activity is linked to evil by its form and its effects, 
but in itself and substantially, it is not an evil. It finds its 
natural fulfillment in marriage, but—with certain exceptions 
—marriage is not an express, indispensable condition for it to 
cease being an evil. It has trouble finding its place in the love 
of boys, but the latter is not therefore condemned as being 
contrary to nature. 

Thus, as the arts of living and the care of the self are refined, 
some precepts emerge that seem to be rather similar to those 
that will be formulated in the later moral systems. But one 
should not be misled by the analogy. Those moral systems will 
define other modalities of the relation to self: a characteriza¬ 
tion of the ethical substance based on finitude, the Fall, and 
evil; a mode of subjection in the form of obedience to a general 
law that is at the same time the will of a personal god; a type 
of work on oneself that implies a decipherment of the soul and 
a purificatory hermeneutics of the desires; and a mode of 



240 


The Care of the Self 


ethical fulfillment that tends toward self-renunciation. The 
code elements that concern the economy of pleasures, conju¬ 
gal fidelity, and relations between men may well remain analo¬ 
gous, but they will derive from a profoundly altered ethics and 
from a different way of constituting oneself as the ethical 
subject of one’s sexual behavior.

About the Author 

Michel Foucault was born in Poitiers, France, in 1926. He 
lectured in many universities throughout the world and 
served as director at the Institut Frangais in Hamburg, 
and the Institut de Philosophic at the Faculte des Lettres 
in the University of Clermont-Ferrand. He wrote fre¬ 
quently for French newspapers and reviews, and held a 
chair at France’s most prestigious institution, the College 
de France. 

In addition to his classic study, Madness and Civiliza¬ 
tion, Foucault has written The Order of Things, The Ar¬ 
chaeology of Knowledge, The Birth of the Clinic, Discipline 
and Punish, and The History of Sexuality, of which this 
book is the third volume. 

Michel Foucault died in June 1984.
