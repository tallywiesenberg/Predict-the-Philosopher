At the beginning of the seventeenth century a certain 
frankness was still common, it would seem.Sexual practices 
had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue 
reticence, and things were done without too much conceal¬ 
ment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit.Codes 
regulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were 
quite lax compared to those of the nineteenth century.It was 
a time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open 
transgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermin¬ 
gled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the 
laughter of adults: it was a period when bodies “made a 
display of themselves.” 

But twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the 
monotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie.Sexuality 
was carefully confined; it moved into the home.
