Not only did it not exist, it had no right 
to exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani¬ 
festation—whether in acts or in words.Everyone knew, for 
example, that children had no sex, which was why they were 
forbidden to talk about it, why one closed one’s eyes and 
stopped one’s ears whenever they came to show evidence to 
the contrary, and why a general and studied silence was 
imposed.These are the characteristic features attributed to 
repression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi¬ 
tions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen¬ 
tence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an 
affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis¬ 
sion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing 
to-see, and nothing to know.Such was the hypocrisy of our 
bourgeois societies with its halting logic.It was forced to 
make a few concessions, however.
