But have we not liberated ourselves from those two long 
centuries in which the history of sexuality must be seen first 
of all as the chronicle of an increasing repression?Only to 
a slight extent, we are told.Perhaps some progress was made 
by Freud; but with such circumspection, such medical pru¬ 
dence, a scientific guarantee of innocuousness, and so many 
precautions in order to contain everything, with no fear of 
“overflow,” in that safest and most discrete of spaces, be¬ 
tween the couch and discourse: yet another round of whis¬ 
pering on a bed.And could things have been otherwise?We 
are informed that if repression has indeed been the funda¬ 
mental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since 
the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able 
to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: noth¬ 
ing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, 
an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within real¬ 
ity, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power 
will be required.
