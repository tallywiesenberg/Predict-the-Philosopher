For the least glimmer of truth is conditioned 
by politics.Hence, one cannot hope to obtain the desired 
results simply from a medical practice, nor from a theoretical 
discourse, however rigorously pursued.Thus, one denounces 
Freud’s conformism, the normalizing functions of psychoa¬ 
nalysis, the obvious timidity underlying Reich’s vehemence, 
and all the effects of integration ensured by the “science” of 
sex and the barely equivocal practices of sexology.This discourse on modern sexual repression holds up well, 
owing no doubt to how easy it is to uphold.A solemn histori¬ 
cal and political guarantee protects it.
