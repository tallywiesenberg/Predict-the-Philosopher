And the 
sexual cause—the demand for sexual freedom, but also for 
the knowledge to be gained from sex and the right to speak 
about it—becomes legitimately associated with the honor of 
a political cause: sex too is placed on the agenda for the 
future.A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many 
precautions in order to give the history of sex such an impres¬ 
sive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness: 
as if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such 
a discourse could be formulated or accepted.But there may be another reason that makes it so gratify¬ 
ing for us to define the relationship between sex and power 
in terms of repression: something that one might call the 
speaker’s benefit.If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to 
prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact 
that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliber¬ 
ate transgression.A person who holds forth in such language 
places himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power; 
he upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the com¬ 
ing freedom.
