The notion of repressed sex is not, therefore, only a theo¬ 
retical matter.The affirmation of a sexuality that has never 
been more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the 
hypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled 
with the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal 
the truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, sub¬ 
vert the law that governs it, and change its future.The 
statement of oppression and the form of the sermon refer 
back to one another; they are mutually reinforcing.To say 
that sex is not repressed, or rather that the relationship be¬ 
tween sex and power is not characterized by repression, is to 
risk falling into a sterile paradox.It not only runs counter to 
a well-accepted argument, it goes against the whole economy 
and all the discursive “interests” that underlie this argument.
