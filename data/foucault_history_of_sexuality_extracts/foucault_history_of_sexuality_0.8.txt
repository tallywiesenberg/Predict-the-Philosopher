This is the point at which I would like to situate the series 
of historical analyses that will follow, the present volume 
being at the same time an introduction and a first attempt at 
an overview: it surveys a few historically significant points 
and outlines certain theoretical problems.Briefly, my aim is 
to examine the case of a society which has been loudly casti¬ 
gating itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which 
speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate 
in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it 
exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws 
that have made it function.I would like to explore not only 
these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the 
strategic intention that supports them.The question I would 
like to pose is not, Why are we repressed?but rather, Why 
do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment 
against our most recent past, against our present, and against 



We “Other Victorians ”

ourselves, that we are repressed?
