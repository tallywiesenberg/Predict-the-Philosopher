By what spiral did we come 
to affirm that sex is negated?What led us to show, ostenta¬ 
tiously, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something 
we silence?And we do all this by formulating the matter in 
the most explicit terms, by trying to reveal it in its most 
naked reality, by affirming it in the positivity of its power and 
its effects.It is certainly legitimate to ask why sex was as¬ 
sociated with sin for such a long time—although it would 
remain to be discovered how this association was formed, 
and one would have to be careful not to state in a summary 
and hasty fashion that sex was “condemned”—but we must 
also ask why we burden ourselves today with so much guilt 
for having once made sex a sin.What paths have brought us 
to the point where we are “at fault” with respect to our own 
sex?
