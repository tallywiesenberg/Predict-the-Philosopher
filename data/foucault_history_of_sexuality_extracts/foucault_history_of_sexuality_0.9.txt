And how have we come to be a civilization so peculiar 
as to tell itself that, through an abuse of power which has not 
ended, it has long “sinned” against sex?How does one ac¬ 
count for the displacement which, while claiming to free us 
from the sinful nature of sex, taxes us with a great historical 
wrong which consists precisely in imagining that nature to 
be blameworthy and in drawing disastrous consequences 
from that belief?It will be said that if so many people today affirm this 
repression, the reason is that it is historically evident.And 
if they speak of it so abundantly, as they have for such a long 
time now, this is because repression is so firmly anchored, 
having solid roots and reasons, and weighs so heavily on sex 
that more than one denunciation will be required in order to 
free ourselves from it; the job will be a long one.All the 
longer, no doubt, as it is in the nature of power—particularly 
the kind of power that operates in our society—to be repres¬ 
sive, and to be especially careful in repressing useless 
energies, the intensity of pleasures, and irregular modes of 
behavior.
