Are prohibition, censorship, and denial truly the 
forms through which power is exercised in a general way, if 
not in every society, most certainly in our own?This is a 
historico-theoretical question.A third and final doubt: Did 
the critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come 
to act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had ope¬ 
rated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part 
of the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and 
doubtless misrepresents) by calling it “repression”?Was 
there really a historical rupture between the age of repression 
and the critical analysis of repression?This is a historico- 
political question.
