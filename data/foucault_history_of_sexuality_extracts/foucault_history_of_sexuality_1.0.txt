We “Other Victorians” 




For a long time, the story goes, we supported a Victorian 
regime, and we continue to be dominated by it even today. 
Thus the image of the imperial prude is emblazoned on our 
restrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality. 

At the beginning of the seventeenth century a certain 
frankness was still common, it would seem. Sexual practices 
had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue 
reticence, and things were done without too much conceal¬ 
ment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit. Codes 
regulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were 
quite lax compared to those of the nineteenth century. It was 
a time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open 
transgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermin¬ 
gled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the 
laughter of adults: it was a period when bodies “made a 
display of themselves.” 

But twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the 
monotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie. Sexuality 
was carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal 
family took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious 
function of reproduction. On the subject of sex, silence be¬ 
came the rule. The legitimate and procreative couple laid 
down the law. The couple imposed itself as model, enforced 
the norm, safeguarded the truth, and reserved the right to 
speak while retaining the principle of secrecy. A single locus 
of sexuality was acknowledged in social space as well as at 
the heart of every household, but it was a utilitarian and 
fertile one: the parents’ bedroom. The rest had only to re¬ 
main vague; proper demeanor avoided contact with other 
bodies, and verbal decency sanitized one’s speech. And ster-

ile behavior carried the taint of abnormality; if it insisted on 
making itself too visible, it would be designated accordingly 
and would have to pay the penalty. 

Nothing that was not ordered in terms of generation or 
transfigured by it could expect sanction or protection. Nor 
did it merit a hearing. It would be driven out, denied, and 
reduced to silence. Not only did it not exist, it had no right 
to exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani¬ 
festation—whether in acts or in words. Everyone knew, for 
example, that children had no sex, which was why they were 
forbidden to talk about it, why one closed one’s eyes and 
stopped one’s ears whenever they came to show evidence to 
the contrary, and why a general and studied silence was 
imposed. These are the characteristic features attributed to 
repression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi¬ 
tions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen¬ 
tence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an 
affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis¬ 
sion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing 
to-see, and nothing to know. Such was the hypocrisy of our 
bourgeois societies with its halting logic. It was forced to 
make a few concessions, however. If it was truly necessary 
to make room for illegitimate sexualities, it was reasoned, let 
them take their infernal mischief elsewhere: to a place where 
they could be reintegrated, if not in the circuits of produc¬ 
tion, at least in those of profit. The brothel and the mental 
hospital would be those places of tolerance: the prostitute, 
the client, and the pimp, together with the psychiatrist and 
his hysteric—those “other Victorians,” as Steven Marcus 
would say—seem to have surreptitiously transferred the 
pleasures that are unspoken into the order of things that are 
counted. Words and gestures, quietly authorized, could be 
exchanged there at the going rate. Only in those places would 
untrammeled sex have a right to (safely insularized) forms of 
reality, and only to clandestine, circumscribed, and coded 
types of discourse. Everywhere else, modern puritanism im-
