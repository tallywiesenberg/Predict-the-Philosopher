My purpose in introducing these three 
doubts is not merely to construct counterarguments that are 
symmetrical and contrary to those outlined above; it is not 
a matter of saying that sexuality, far from being repressed in 
capitalist and bourgeois societies, has on the contrary benefit- 
ted from a regime of unchanging liberty; nor is it a matter 
of saying that power in societies such as ours is more tolerant 
than repressive, and that the critique of repression, while it 
may give itself airs of a rupture with the past, actually forms 
part of a much older process and, depending on how one 



We “Other Victorians'’ 11 

chooses to understand this process, will appear either as a 
new episode in the lessening of prohibitions, or as a more 
devious and discreet form of power.The doubts I would like to oppose to the repressive hy¬ 
pothesis are aimed less at showing it to be mistaken than at 
putting it back within a general economy of discourses on sex 
in modern societies since the seventeenth century.Why has 
sexuality been so widely discussed, and what has been said 
about it?What were the effects of power generated by what 
was said?What are the links between these discourses, these 
effects of power, and the pleasures that were invested by 
them?
