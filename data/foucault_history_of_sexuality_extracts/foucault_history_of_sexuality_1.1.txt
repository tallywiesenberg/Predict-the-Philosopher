What knowledge (savoir) was formed as a result of this 
linkage?The object, in short, is to define the regime of power- 
knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human 
sexuality in our part of the world.The central issue, then (at 
least in the first instance), is not to determine whether one 
says yes or no to sex, whether one formulates prohibitions or 
permissions, whether one asserts its importance or denies its 
effects, or whether one refines the words one uses to designate 
it; but to account for the fact that it is spoken about, to 
discover who does the speaking, the positions and viewpoints 
from which they speak, the institutions which prompt people 
to speak about it and which store and distribute the things 
that are said.What is at issue, briefly, is the over-all “discur¬ 
sive fact,” the way in which sex is “put into discourse.” 
Hence, too, my main concern will be to locate the forms of 
power, the channels it takes, and the discourses it permeates 
in order to reach the most tenuous and individual modes of 
behavior, the paths that give it access to the rare or scarcely 
perceivable forms of desire, how it penetrates and controls 
everyday pleasure—all this entailing effects that may be 
those of refusal, blockage, and invalidation, but also incite¬ 
ment and intensification: in short, the “polymorphous tech¬ 
niques of power.” And finally, the essential aim will not be 
to determine whether these discursive productions and these 
effects of power lead one to formulate the truth about sex, or

on the contrary falsehoods designed to conceal that truth, 
but rather to bring out the “will to knowledge” that serves 
as both their support and their instrument.Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not claim that sex 
has not been prohibited or barred or masked or misap¬ 
prehended since the classical age; nor do I even assert that 
it has suffered these things any less from that period on than 
before.
