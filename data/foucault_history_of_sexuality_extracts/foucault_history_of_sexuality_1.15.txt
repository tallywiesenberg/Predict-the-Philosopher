I do not maintain that the prohibition of sex is a ruse; 
but it is a ruse to make prohibition into the basic and con¬ 
stitutive element from which one would be able to write the 
history of what has been said concerning sex starting from 
the modern epoch.All these negative elements—defenses, 
censorships, denials—which the repressive hypothesis 
groups together in one great central mechanism destined to 
say no, are doubtless only component parts that have a local 
and tactical role to play in a transformation into discourse, 
a technology of power, and a will to knowledge that are far 
from being reducible to the former.In short, I would like to disengage my analysis from the 
privileges generally accorded the economy of scarcity and 
the principles of rarefaction, to search instead for instances 
of discursive production (which also administer silences, to 
be sure), of the production of power (which sometimes have 
the function of prohibiting), of the propagation of knowledge 
(which often cause mistaken beliefs or systematic misconcep¬ 
tions to circulate); I would like to write the history of these 
instances and their transformations.A first survey made 
from this viewpoint seems to indicate that since the end of 
the sixteenth century, the “putting into discourse of sex,” far 
from undergoing a process of restriction, on the contrary has 
been subjected to a mechanism of increasing incitement; that 
the techniques of power exercised over sex have not obeyed 
a principle of rigorous selection, but rather one of dissemina¬ 
tion and implantation of polymorphous sexualities; and that 
the will to knowledge has not come to a halt in the face of 
a taboo that must not be lifted, but has persisted in constitut-

ing—despite many mistakes, of course—a science of sexual¬ 
ity.It is these movements that I will now attempt to bring 
into focus in a schematic way, bypassing as it were the repres¬ 
sive hypothesis and the facts of interdiction or exclusion it 
invokes, and starting from certain historical facts that serve 
as guidelines for research.
