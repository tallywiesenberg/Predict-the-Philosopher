The Incitement 
to Discourse 


The seventeenth century, then, was the beginning of an age 
of repression emblematic of what we call the bourgeois soci¬ 
eties, an age which perhaps we still have not completely left 
behind.Calling sex by its name thereafter became more diffi¬ 
cult and more costly.As if in order to gain mastery over it 
in reality, it had first been necessary to subjugate it at the 
level of language, control its free circulation in speech, ex¬ 
punge it from the things that were said, and extinguish the 
words that rendered it too visibly present.And even these 
prohibitions, it seems, were afraid to name it.Without even 
having to pronounce the word, modern prudishness was able 
to ensure that one did not speak of sex, merely through the 
interplay of prohibitions that referred back to one another: 
instances of muteness which, by dint of saying nothing, im¬ 
posed silence.
