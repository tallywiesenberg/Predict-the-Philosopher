screened out some words: there was a policing of statements.A control over enunciations as well: where and when it was 
not possible to talk about such things became much more

speakers, and within which social relationships.Areas were 
thus established, if not of utter silence, at least of tact and 
discretion: between parents and children, for instance, or 
teachers and pupils, or masters and domestic servants.This 
almost certainly constituted a whole restrictive economy, 
one that was incorporated into that politics of language and 
speech—spontaneous on the one hand, concerted on the 
other—which accompanied the social redistributions of the 
classical period.At the level of discourses and their domains, however, 
practically the opposite phenomenon occurred.
