There was a 
steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex—spe¬ 
cific discourses, different from one another both by their 
form and by their object: a discursive ferment that gathered 
momentum from the eighteenth century onward.Here I am 
thinking not so much of the probable increase in “illicit” 
discourses, that is, discourses of infraction that crudely 
named sex by way of insult or mockery of the new code of 
decency; the tightening up of the rules of decorum likely did 
produce, as a countereffect, a valorization and intensification 
of indecent speech.But more important was the multiplica¬ 
tion of discourses concerning sex in the field of exercise of 
power itself: an institutional incitement to speak about it, and 
to do so more and more; a determination on the part of the 
agencies of power to hear it spoken about, and to cause it to 
speak through explicit articulation and endlessly ac¬ 
cumulated detail.Consider the evolution of the Catholic pastoral and the 
sacrament of penance after the Council of Trent.Little by 
little, the nakedness of the questions formulated by the con¬ 
fession manuals of the Middle Ages, and a good number of 
those still in use in the seventeenth century, was veiled.
