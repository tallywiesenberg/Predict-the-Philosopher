The History of Sexuality 


ile behavior carried the taint of abnormality; if it insisted on 
making itself too visible, it would be designated accordingly 
and would have to pay the penalty. 

Nothing that was not ordered in terms of generation or 
transfigured by it could expect sanction or protection. Nor 
did it merit a hearing. It would be driven out, denied, and 
reduced to silence. Not only did it not exist, it had no right 
to exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani¬ 
festation—whether in acts or in words. Everyone knew, for 
example, that children had no sex, which was why they were 
forbidden to talk about it, why one closed one’s eyes and 
stopped one’s ears whenever they came to show evidence to 
the contrary, and why a general and studied silence was 
imposed. These are the characteristic features attributed to 
repression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi¬ 
tions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen¬ 
tence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an 
affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis¬ 
sion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing 
to-see, and nothing to know. Such was the hypocrisy of our 
bourgeois societies with its halting logic. It was forced to 
make a few concessions, however. If it was truly necessary 
to make room for illegitimate sexualities, it was reasoned, let 
them take their infernal mischief elsewhere: to a place where 
they could be reintegrated, if not in the circuits of produc¬ 
tion, at least in those of profit. The brothel and the mental 
hospital would be those places of tolerance: the prostitute, 
the client, and the pimp, together with the psychiatrist and 
his hysteric—those “other Victorians,” as Steven Marcus 
would say—seem to have surreptitiously transferred the 
pleasures that are unspoken into the order of things that are 
counted. Words and gestures, quietly authorized, could be 
exchanged there at the going rate. Only in those places would 
untrammeled sex have a right to (safely insularized) forms of 
reality, and only to clandestine, circumscribed, and coded 
types of discourse. Everywhere else, modern puritanism im-
