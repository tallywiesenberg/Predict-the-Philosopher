Examine, more¬ 
over, all your thoughts, every word you speak, and all your 
actions.Examine even unto your dreams, to know if, once 
awakened, you did not give them your consent.And finally, 
do not think that in so sensitive and perilous a matter as this, 
there is anything trivial or insignificant.” 3 Discourse, there¬ 
fore, had to trace the meeting line of the body and the soul, 
following all its meanderings: beneath the surface of the sins, 
it would lay bare the unbroken nervure of the flesh.Under 
the authority of a language that had been carefully expur¬ 
gated so that it was no longer directly named, sex was taken 
charge of, tracked down as it were, by a discourse that aimed 
to allow it no obscurity, no respite.It was here, perhaps, that the injunction, so peculiar to the 
West, was laid down for the first time, in the form of a 
general constraint.
