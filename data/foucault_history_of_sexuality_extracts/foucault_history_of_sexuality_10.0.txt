ried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive 
practices—of those notorious “deadly secrets” which 
demographers on the eve of the Revolution knew were al¬ 
ready familiar to the inhabitants of the countryside. 

Of course, it had long been asserted that a country had to 
be populated if it hoped to be rich and powerful; but this was 
the first time that a society had affirmed, in a constant way, 
that its future and its fortune were tied not only to the 
number and the uprightness of its citizens, to their marriage 
rules and family organization, but to the manner in which 
each individual made use of his sex. Things went from ritual 
lamenting over the unfruitful debauchery of the rich, bache¬ 
lors, and libertines to a discourse in which the sexual conduct 
of the population was taken both as an object of analysis and 
as a target of intervention; there was a progression from the 
crudely populationist arguments of the mercantilist epoch to 
the much more subtle and calculated attempts at regulation 
that tended to favor or discourage—according to the objec¬ 
tives and exigencies of the moment—an increasing birthrate. 
Through the political economy of population there was 
formed a whole grid of observations regarding sex. There 
emerged the analysis of the modes of sexual conduct, their 
determinations and their effects, at the boundary line of the 
biological and the economic domains. There also appeared 
those systematic campaigns which, going beyond the tradi¬ 
tional means—moral and religious exhortations, fiscal meas¬ 
ures—tried to transform the sexual conduct of couples into 
a concerted economic and political behavior. In time these 
new measures would become anchorage points for the differ¬ 
ent varieties of racism of the nineteenth and twentieth centu¬ 
ries. It was essential that the state know what was happening 
with its citizens’ sex, and the use they made of it, but also 
that each individual be capable of controlling the use he 
made of it. Between the state and the individual, sex became 
an issue, and a public issue no less; a whole web of discourses, 
special knowledges, analyses, and injunctions settled upon it.

The situation was similar in the case of children’s sex. It 
is often said that the classical period consigned it to an 
obscurity from which it scarcely emerged before the Three 
Essays or the beneficent anxieties of Little Hans. It is true 
that a longstanding “freedom” of language between children 
and adults, or pupils and teachers, may have disappeared. 
No seventeenth-century pedagogue would have publicly ad¬ 
vised his disciple, as did Erasmus in his Dialogues, on the 
choice of a good prostitute. And the boisterous laughter that 
had accompanied the precocious sexuality of children for so 
long—and in all social classes, it seems—was gradually 
stifled. But this was not a plain and simple imposition of 
silence. Rather, it was a new regime of discourses. Not any 
less was said about it; on the contrary. But things were said 
in a different way; it was different people who said them, 
from different points of view, and in order to obtain different 
results. Silence itself—the things one declines to say, or is 
forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between 
diff erent speakers—is less the absolute limit of discourse, the 
other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, 
than an element that functions alongside the things said, with 
them and in relation to them within over-all strategies. There 
is no binary division to be made between what one says and 
what one does not say; we must try to determine the different 
ways of not saying such things, how those who can and those 
who cannot speak of them are distributed, which type of 
discourse is authorized, or which form of discretion is re¬ 
quired in either case. There is not one but many silences, and 
they are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and 
permeate discourses. 

Take the secondary schools of the eighteenth century, for 
example. On the whole, one can have the impression that sex 
was hardly spoken of at all in these institutions. But one only 
has to glance over the architectural layout, the rules of disci¬ 
pline, and their whole internal organization: the question of 
sex was a constant preoccupation. The builders considered it
