The Deployment of Sexuality

psychoanalysis, whose technical procedure seemed to place 
the confession of sexuality outside family jurisdiction, redis¬ 
covered the law of alliance, the involved workings of mar¬ 
riage and kinship, and incest at the heart of this sexuality, as 
the principle of its formation and the key to its intelligibility.The guarantee that one would find the parents-children rela¬ 
tionship at the root of everyone’s sexuality made it possible 
—even when everything seemed to point to the reverse proc¬ 
ess—to keep the deployment of sexuality coupled to the 
system of alliance.There was no risk that sexuality would 
appear to be, by nature, alien to the law: it was constituted 
only through the law.Parents, do not be afraid to bring your 
children to analysis: it will teach them that in any case it is 
you whom they love.
