The first phase corresponded to the need to form a “labor 
force” (hence to avoid any useless “expenditure,” any wasted 
energy, so that all forces were reduced to labor capacity 
alone) and to ensure its reproduction (conjugality, the regu¬ 
lated fabrication of children).The second phase corre¬ 
sponded to that epoch of Spatkapitalismus in which the 
exploitation of wage labor does not demand the same violent 
and physical constraints as in the nineteenth century, and 
where the politics of the body does not require the elision of 
sex or its restriction solely to the reproductive function; it 
relies instead on a multiple channeling into the controlled 
circuits of the economy—on what has been called a hyper- 
repressive desublimation.If the politics of sex makes little use of the law of the taboo 
but brings into play an entire technical machinery, if what 
is involved is the production of sexuality rather than the 
repression of sex, then our emphasis has to be placed else¬ 
where; we must shift our analysis away from the problem of 
“labor capacity” and doubtless abandon the diffuse energet¬ 
ics that underlies the theme of a sexuality repressed for eco¬ 
nomic reasons.4 


Periodization 


The history of sexuality supposes two ruptures if one tries 
to center it on mechanisms of repression.The first, occurring 
in the course of the seventeenth century, was characterized 
by the advent of the great prohibitions, the exclusive promo¬ 
tion of adult marital sexuality, the imperatives of decency, 
the obligatory concealment of the body, the reduction to 
silence and mandatory reticences of language.
