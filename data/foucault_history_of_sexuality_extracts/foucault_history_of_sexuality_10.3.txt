The second, a 
twentieth-century phenomenon, was really less a rupture 
than an inflexion of the curve: this was the moment when the 
mechanisms of repression were seen as beginning to loosen 
their grip; one passed from insistent sexual taboos to a rela¬ 
tive tolerance with regard to prenuptial or extramarital rela¬ 
tions; the disqualification of “perverts” diminished, their 
condemnation by the law was in part eliminated; a good 
many of the taboos that weighed on the sexuality of children 
were lifted.We must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices: 
the inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renova¬ 
tions of previous techniques.But there is also the calendar 
of their utilization to consider, the chronology of their diffu¬ 
sion and of the effects (of subjugation and resistance) they 
produced.These multiple datings doubtless will not coincide 
with the great repressive cycle that is ordinarily situated 
between the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries.1.
