a long way.Their point of formation must be sought in the 
penitential practices of medieval Christianity, or rather in 
the dual series constituted by the obligatory, exhaustive, and 
periodic confession imposed on all the faithful by the Lateran 
Council and by the methods of asceticism, spiritual exercise, 
and mysticism that evolved with special intensity from the 
sixteenth century on.First the Reformation, then Tridentine 
Catholicism, mark an important mutation and a schism in 
what might be called the “traditional technology of the 
flesh.” A division whose depth should not be under¬ 
estimated; but this did not rule out a certain parallelism in 
the Catholic and Protestant methods of examination of con¬ 
science and pastoral direction: procedures for analyzing 
“concupiscence” and transforming it into discourse were 
established in both instances.This was a rich, refined tech¬ 
nique which began to take shape in the sixteenth century and 
went through a long series of theoretical elaborations until, 
at the end of the eighteenth century, it became fixed in ex¬ 
pressions capable of symbolizing the mitigated strictness of 
Alfonso de’ Liguori in the one case and Wesleyan pedagogy 
in the other.It was during the same period—the end of the eighteenth 
century—and for reasons that will have to be determined, 
that there emerged a completely new technology of sex; new 
in that for the most part it escaped the ecclesiastical institu¬ 
tion without being truly independent of the thematics of sin.
