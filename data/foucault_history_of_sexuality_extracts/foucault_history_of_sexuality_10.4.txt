Through pedagogy, medicine, and economics, it made sex 
not only a secular concern but a concern of the state as well; 
to be more exact, sex became a matter that required the social 
body as a whole, and virtually all of its individuals, to place 
themselves under surveillance.New too for the fact that it 
expanded along three axes: that of pedagogy, having as its 
objective the specific sexuality of children; that of medicine, 
whose objective was the sexual physiology peculiar to 
women; and last, that of demography, whose objective was 
the spontaneous or concerted regulation of births.Thus the 



The Deployment of Sexuality

“sin of youth,” “nervous disorders,” and “frauds against 
procreation” (as those “deadly secrets” were later to be 
called) designate three privileged areas of this new technol¬ 
ogy.There is no question that in each of these areas, it went 
back to methods that had already been formed by Christian¬ 
ity, but of course not without modifying them: the sexuality 
of children was already problematized in the spiritual 
pedagogy of Christianity (it is interesting to note that Molli- 
ties, the first treatise on sin, was written in the fifteenth 
century by an educator and mystic named Gerson, and that 
the Onania collection compiled by Dekker in the eighteenth 
century repeats word for word examples set forth by the 
Anglican pastoral); the eighteenth-century medicine of 
nerves and vapors took up in turn a field of analysis that had 
already been delimited when the phenomena of possession 
fomented a grave crisis in the all too indiscreet practices of 
conscience direction and spiritual examination (nervous ill¬ 
ness is certainly not the truth of possession, but the medicine 
of hysteria is not unrelated to the earlier direction of “ob¬ 
sessed” women); and the campaigns apropos of the birthrate 
took the place of the control of conjugal relations—in a 
different form and at another level—which the Christian 
penance had so persistently sought to establish through its 
examinations.A visible continuity, therefore, but one that 
did not prevent a major transformation: from that time on, 
the technology of sex was ordered in relation to the medical 
institution, the exigency of normality, and—instead of the 
question of death and everlasting punishment—the problem 
of life and illness.
