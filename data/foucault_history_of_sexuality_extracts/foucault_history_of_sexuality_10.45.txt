The flesh was brought down to the level 
of the organism.This mutation took place at the turn of the nineteenth 
century; it opened the way for many other transformations 
that derived from it.The first of these set apart the medicine 
of sex from the medicine of the body; it isolated a sexual 
“instinct” capable of presenting constitutive anomalies, ac¬ 
quired derivations, infirmities, or pathological processes.118 


The History of Sexuality 


Heinrich Kaan’s Psychopathia Sexualis, published in 1846, 
can be used as an indicator: these were the years that saw the 
correlative appearance of a medicine, an “orthopedics,” 
specific to sex: in a word, the opening up of the great medico- 
psychological domain of the “perversions,” which was 
destined to take over from the old moral categories of de¬ 
bauchery and excess.In the same period, the analysis of 
heredity was placing sex (sexual relations, venereal diseases, 
matrimonial alliances, perversions) in a position of “biologi¬ 
cal responsibility” with regard to the species: not only could 
sex be affected by its own diseases, it could also, if it was not 
controlled, transmit diseases or create others that would 
afflict future generations.
