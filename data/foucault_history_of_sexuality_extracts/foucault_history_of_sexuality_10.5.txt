Thus it appeared to be the source 
of an entire capital for the species to draw from.Whence the 
medical—but also political—project for organizing a state 
management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex 
and its fertility had to be administered.The medicine of 
perversions and the programs of eugenics were the two great 
innovations in the technology of sex of the second half of the 
nineteenth century.Innovations that merged together quite well, for the 
theory of “degenerescence” made it possible for them to 
perpetually refer back to one another; it explained how a 
heredity that was burdened with various maladies (it made 
little difference whether these were organic, functional, or 
psychical) ended by producing a sexual pervert (look into the 
genealogy of an exhibitionist or a homosexual: you will find 
a hemiplegic ancestor, a phthisic parent, or an uncle afflicted 
with senile dementia); but it went on to explain how a sexual 
perversion resulted in the depletion of one’s line of descent 
—rickets in the children, the sterility of future generations.The series composed of perversion-heredity-degenerescence 
formed the solid nucleus of the new technologies of sex.
