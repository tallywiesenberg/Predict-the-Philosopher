The situation was similar in the case of children’s sex. It 
is often said that the classical period consigned it to an 
obscurity from which it scarcely emerged before the Three 
Essays or the beneficent anxieties of Little Hans. It is true 
that a longstanding “freedom” of language between children 
and adults, or pupils and teachers, may have disappeared. 
No seventeenth-century pedagogue would have publicly ad¬ 
vised his disciple, as did Erasmus in his Dialogues, on the 
choice of a good prostitute. And the boisterous laughter that 
had accompanied the precocious sexuality of children for so 
long—and in all social classes, it seems—was gradually 
stifled. But this was not a plain and simple imposition of 
silence. Rather, it was a new regime of discourses. Not any 
less was said about it; on the contrary. But things were said 
in a different way; it was different people who said them, 
from different points of view, and in order to obtain different 
results. Silence itself—the things one declines to say, or is 
forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between 
diff erent speakers—is less the absolute limit of discourse, the 
other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, 
than an element that functions alongside the things said, with 
them and in relation to them within over-all strategies. There 
is no binary division to be made between what one says and 
what one does not say; we must try to determine the different 
ways of not saying such things, how those who can and those 
who cannot speak of them are distributed, which type of 
discourse is authorized, or which form of discretion is re¬ 
quired in either case. There is not one but many silences, and 
they are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and 
permeate discourses. 

Take the secondary schools of the eighteenth century, for 
example. On the whole, one can have the impression that sex 
was hardly spoken of at all in these institutions. But one only 
has to glance over the architectural layout, the rules of disci¬ 
pline, and their whole internal organization: the question of 
sex was a constant preoccupation. The builders considered it
