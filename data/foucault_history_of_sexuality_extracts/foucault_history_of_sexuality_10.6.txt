It is very well to look back 
from our vantage point and remark upon the normalizing 
impulse in Freud; one can go on to denounce the role played 
for many years by the psychoanalytic institution; but the fact 
remains that in the great family of technologies of sex, which 
goes so far back into the history of the Christian West, of all 
those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to 
medicalize sex, it was the one that, up to the decade of the 
forties, rigorously opposed the political and institutional 
effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system.It is clear that the genealogy of all these techniques, with 
their mutations, their shifts, their continuities and ruptures, 
does not coincide with the hypothesis of a great repressive 
phase that was inaugurated in the course of the classical age 
and began to slowly decline in the twentieth.There was 
rather a perpetual inventiveness, a steady growth of methods 
and procedures, with two especially productive moments in 
this proliferating history: around the middle of the sixteenth
