It can be said that this was the moment 
when the deployment of “sexuality,” elaborated in its more 
complex and intense forms, by and for the privileged classes, 
spread through the entire social body.But the forms it took 
were not everywhere the same, and neither were the instru¬ 
ments it employed (the respective roles of medical and judi¬ 
cial authority were not the same in both instances; nor was 
even the way in which medicine and sexuality functioned).These chronological reminders—whether we are con¬ 
cerned with the invention of techniques or the calendar of 
their diffusion—are of some importance.They cast much 
doubt on the idea of a repressive cycle, with a beginning and 
an end and forming a curve with its point of inflexion: it 
appears unlikely that there was an age of sexual restriction.They also make it doubtful that the process was homoge¬ 
neous at all levels of society and in all social classes: there was 
no unitary sexual politics.
