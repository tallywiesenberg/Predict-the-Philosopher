But above all, they make the 
meaning of the process, and its reasons for being, problemati¬ 
cal: it seems that the deployment of sexuality was not estab¬ 
lished as a principle of limitation of the pleasures of others 
by what have traditionally been called the “ruling classes.” 
Rather it appears to me that they first tried it on themselves.Was this a new avatar of that bourgeois asceticism described 
so many times in connection with the Reformation, the new

zation of health and its operational terms: it was a question

not repression of the sex of the classes to be exploited, but 
rather the body, vigor, longevity, progeniture, and descent of 
the classes that “ruled.” This was the purpose for which the 
deployment of sexuality was first established, as a new distri¬ 
bution of pleasures, discourses, truths, and powers; it has to 
be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the 
enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthen¬ 
ing, and an exaltation that were eventually extended to oth¬ 
ers—at the cost of different transformations—as a means of 
social control and political subjugation.With this investment 
of its own sex by a technology of power and knowledge 
which it had itself invented, the bourgeoisie underscored the 
high political price of its body, sensations, and pleasures, its 
well-being and survival.
