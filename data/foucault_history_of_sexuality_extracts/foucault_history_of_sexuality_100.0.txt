general principles but that one was able to determine the 
moment when it was necessary to act and the precise manner 
in which to do so in terms of existing circumstances. And in 
fact it was one of the essential aspects of the virtue of prudence 
that it made one capable of practicing the “politics of timeli¬ 
ness” in the different domains—whether this involved the city 
or the individual, the body or the soul—where it was impor¬ 
tant to seize the kairos. In the use of pleasures, morality was 
also an art of the “right time.” 

That time could be decided according to several scales. 
There was the scale of a person’s entire life. Doctors thought 
that it was not good to begin the practice of pleasures too 
young; they also thought that it could be harmful if one ex¬ 
tended it to an advanced age; it had its season in life. In 
general, the latter was limited to a period characterized not 
only as the span during which procreation was possible, but 
also that in which the offspring would be healthy, well formed, 
and robust.* There was also the scale of the year, with its 
seasons: as we shall see in Part Two, dietary regimens attached 
great importance to the correlation between sexual activity 
and climatic variation, between cold and heat, humidity and 
dryness. It was also recommended to choose the right time of 
day: one of Plutarch’s “table talks” deals with this problem, 
and proposes a solution that appears to have been traditional; 
dietary reasons, but also reasons of decency and religious 
considerations, argued for the evening, for this was the time 
most favorable to the body, the moment when darkness blot¬ 
ted out unseemly images, and when it was possible to insert 
the space of a night between that activity and the next morn¬ 
ing’s religious observances. 17 The choice of moment—of the 
kairos —ought to depend on other activities as well. If Xeno¬ 
phon could point to Cyrus as an example of moderation, this 

♦This period was thought to begin late; for Aristotle, sperm remained sterile up to 
the age of twenty-one. But the age a man had to wait for before he could expect fine 
offspring was later still: “After the age of twenty-one, women are fully ripe for 
child-bearing, but men go on increasing in vigor.”" 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

was not because he had renounced pleasures; it was because 
he knew how to distribute them properly over the course of 
his existence, not permitting them to divert him from his 
occupations, and allowing them only after a prior period of 
work had cleared the way for honorable recreation. 18 

The importance of the “right time” in sexual ethics appears 
rather clearly in a passage of the Memorabilia dealing with 
incest. Socrates states unequivocally that the precept that 
“parents shall not have sexual intercourse with their children 
nor children with their parents” constitutes a universal dic¬ 
tum, laid down by the gods. He sees the proof of this in the 
fact that those who break the rule receive a punishment. Now, 
the punishment consists in this: regardless of the intrinsic 
qualities that the incestuous parents might possess, their off¬ 
spring will come to no good. And why is this? Because the 
parents failed to respect the principle of the “right time,” 
mixing their seed unseasonably, since one of them was neces¬ 
sarily much older than the other: for people to procreate when 
they were no longer “in full vigor” was always “to beget 
badly.” 19 Xenophon and Socrates do not say that incest is 
reprehensible only in the form of an “inopportune” action; but 
it is remarkable that the evil of incest is manifested in the same 
way and with the same consequences as the lack of regard for 
the proper time. 

3. The strategy of status. The art of making use of pleasure 
also had to be adapted to suit the user and his personal status. 
The author of the Erotic Essay (attributed to Demosthenes) 
restates this principle, taking his cue from the Symposium: 
every sensible person knows very well that love relations with 
a boy are not “absolutely either honorable or shameful but for 
the most part vary according to the persons concerned,” so 
that it would be “unreasonable to adopt the same attitude” in 
every case. 20 

It may well be a trait common to all societies that the rules 
of sexual conduct vary according to age, sex, and the condition

of individuals, and that obligations and prohibitions are not 
imposed on everyone in the same manner. But, restricting 
ourselves to the case of Christian morality, this specification 
occurs within the framework of an overall system that defines
