general principles but that one was able to determine the 
moment when it was necessary to act and the precise manner 
in which to do so in terms of existing circumstances. And in 
fact it was one of the essential aspects of the virtue of prudence 
that it made one capable of practicing the “politics of timeli¬ 
ness” in the different domains—whether this involved the city 
or the individual, the body or the soul—where it was impor¬ 
tant to seize the kairos. In the use of pleasures, morality was 
also an art of the “right time.” 

That time could be decided according to several scales. 
There was the scale of a person’s entire life. Doctors thought 
that it was not good to begin the practice of pleasures too 
young; they also thought that it could be harmful if one ex¬ 
tended it to an advanced age; it had its season in life. In 
general, the latter was limited to a period characterized not 
only as the span during which procreation was possible, but 
also that in which the offspring would be healthy, well formed, 
and robust.* There was also the scale of the year, with its 
seasons: as we shall see in Part Two, dietary regimens attached 
great importance to the correlation between sexual activity 
and climatic variation, between cold and heat, humidity and 
dryness. It was also recommended to choose the right time of 
day: one of Plutarch’s “table talks” deals with this problem, 
and proposes a solution that appears to have been traditional; 
dietary reasons, but also reasons of decency and religious 
considerations, argued for the evening, for this was the time 
most favorable to the body, the moment when darkness blot¬ 
ted out unseemly images, and when it was possible to insert 
the space of a night between that activity and the next morn¬ 
ing’s religious observances. 17 The choice of moment—of the 
kairos —ought to depend on other activities as well. If Xeno¬ 
phon could point to Cyrus as an example of moderation, this 

♦This period was thought to begin late; for Aristotle, sperm remained sterile up to 
the age of twenty-one. But the age a man had to wait for before he could expect fine 
offspring was later still: “After the age of twenty-one, women are fully ripe for 
child-bearing, but men go on increasing in vigor.”"
