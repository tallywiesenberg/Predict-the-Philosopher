he knew how to distribute them properly over the course of 
his existence, not permitting them to divert him from his 
occupations, and allowing them only after a prior period of 
work had cleared the way for honorable recreation. 18 

The importance of the “right time” in sexual ethics appears 
rather clearly in a passage of the Memorabilia dealing with 
incest. Socrates states unequivocally that the precept that 
“parents shall not have sexual intercourse with their children 
nor children with their parents” constitutes a universal dic¬ 
tum, laid down by the gods. He sees the proof of this in the 
fact that those who break the rule receive a punishment. Now, 
the punishment consists in this: regardless of the intrinsic 
qualities that the incestuous parents might possess, their off¬ 
spring will come to no good. And why is this? Because the 
parents failed to respect the principle of the “right time,” 
mixing their seed unseasonably, since one of them was neces¬ 
sarily much older than the other: for people to procreate when 
they were no longer “in full vigor” was always “to beget 
badly.” 19 Xenophon and Socrates do not say that incest is 
reprehensible only in the form of an “inopportune” action; but 
it is remarkable that the evil of incest is manifested in the same 
way and with the same consequences as the lack of regard for 
the proper time. 

3. The strategy of status. The art of making use of pleasure 
also had to be adapted to suit the user and his personal status. 
The author of the Erotic Essay (attributed to Demosthenes) 
restates this principle, taking his cue from the Symposium: 
every sensible person knows very well that love relations with 
a boy are not “absolutely either honorable or shameful but for 
the most part vary according to the persons concerned,” so 
that it would be “unreasonable to adopt the same attitude” in 
every case. 20 

It may well be a trait common to all societies that the rules 
of sexual conduct vary according to age, sex, and the condition

of individuals, and that obligations and prohibitions are not 
imposed on everyone in the same manner. But, restricting 
ourselves to the case of Christian morality, this specification 
occurs within the framework of an overall system that defines
