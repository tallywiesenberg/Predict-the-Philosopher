the value of the sexual act in terms of general principles, 
indicates the conditions in which it may be legitimate or not, 
according to whether one is married or not, bound by vows 
or not, etc.; this is an instance of modulated universality. It 
seems, on the other hand, that in the classical ethics, with the 
exception of a few precepts that applied to everyone, standards 
of sexual morality were always tailored to one’s way of life, 
which was itself determined by the status one had inherited 
and the purposes one had chosen. The same Demosthenes of 
the Erotic Essay addresses Epicrates in order to “counsel him 
on the means of rendering his life still more worthy of es¬ 
teem”; he does not want to see the young man make decisions 
that are not based on “the right advice on the conduct of life”; 
and this good advice is not given in order to review the general 
principles of behavior, but to point up the legitimate difference 
that exists among moral criteria: “we do not reproach men of 
humble and insignificant natural gifts even when they commit 
a dishonorable act”; on the other hand, if they are someone 
like Epicrates himself, who has “attained distinction, even a 
bit of negligence in some matter of high honor brings dis¬ 
grace.” 21 It was a generally accepted principle of government 
that the more one was in the public eye, the more authority 
one had or wanted to have over others, and the more one 
sought to make one’s life into a brilliant work whose reputa¬ 
tion would spread far and last long—the more necessary it was 
to adopt and maintain, freely and deliberately, rigorous stan¬ 
dards of sexual conduct. Such was the counsel given by Simo¬ 
nides to Hiero concerning “meat and drink and sleep and 
love”: these were pleasures that all creatures alike seemed to 
enjoy, whereas the love of honor and praise was peculiar to 
humans, and it was that love which enabled one to endure 
dangers and privations. 22 And this was also the manner in

which Agesilaus conducted himself, again according to Xeno¬ 
phon, with regard to the pleasures “that prove too strong for 
many men”; indeed, he thought that “a ruler’s superiority 
over ordinary men should be shown not by weakness but by 
endurance.” 23 

Moderation was quite regularly represented among the 
qualities that belonged—or at least should belong—not just to 
anyone but particularly to those who had rank, status, and 
responsibility in the city. When the Socrates of the Memora¬ 
bilia describes for Critobulus the gentleman whose friendship 
is worth seeking, he places moderation on the list of qualities 
that characterize a man worthy of social esteem—a list that 
includes being ready to render a service to a friend, being 
disposed to return kindnesses received, and being accom¬ 
modating in business matters. 24 In order to show the advan¬ 
tages of moderation to his disciple Aristippus, who “was 
rather intemperate in such matters,” Socrates, still according 
to Xenophon, asks the question: if he had to educate two 
youths, one of whom would go on to lead an ordinary life and 
the other would be destined to command, which of the two 
would he teach to “control his passions” so that they would 
not hinder him from doing what he would have to do? 25 Else¬ 
where in the Memorabilia, Socrates submits that since people 
prefer to have slaves who are not intemperate, all the more 
when it comes to choosing a leader, “should we choose one 
whom we know to be the slave of the belly, or of wine, or lust, 
or sleep?” 26 It is true that Plato would give the entire state the 
virtue of moderation; but he does not mean by this that all 
would be equally self-controlled: sophrosyne would character¬ 
ize the city in which those who ought to be ruled would obey, 
and those who were destined to rule would in fact rule: hence 
there would be a multitude of “appetites and pleasures and 
pains” in children, women, and slaves, as well as in the inferior 
majority; “but those desires that are simple and measured and 
directed by reasoning with intelligence and right belief” would 
be found “in but few people who are the best by nature and

the best educated.” In the moderate state, the passions of the 
unprincipled multitude would be controlled by “the desires 
and the knowledge of the fewer and the better.” 27 

We are a long way from a form of austerity that would tend 
to govern all individuals in the same way, from the proudest 
to the most humble, under a universal law whose application 
alone would be subject to modulation by means of casuistry. 
On the contrary, here everything was a matter of adjustment, 
circumstance, and personal position. The few great common 
laws—of the city, religion, nature—remained present, but it 
was as if they traced a very wide circle in the distance, inside 
of which practical thought had to define what could rightfully
