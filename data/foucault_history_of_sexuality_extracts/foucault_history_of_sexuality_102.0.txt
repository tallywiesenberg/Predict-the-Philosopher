be done. And for this there was no need of anything resem¬ 
bling a text that would have the force of law, but rather, of 
a techne or “practice,” a savoir-faire that by taking general 
principles into account would guide action in its time, accord¬ 
ing to its context, and in view of its ends. Therefore, in this 
form of morality, the individual did not make himself into an 
ethical subject by universalizing the principles that informed 
his action; on the contrary, he did so by means of an attitude 
and a quest that individualized his action, modulated it, and 
perhaps even gave him a special brilliance by virtue of the 
rational and deliberate structure his action manifested.

Enkrateia 


The interiority of Christian morality is often contrasted 
with the exteriority of a pagan morality that would consider 
acts only in their concrete realization, in their visible and 
manifest form, in their degree of conformity with rules, and 
in the light of opinion or with a view to the memory they leave 
behind them. But this traditionally accepted opposition may 
well miss the essential elements of both. What is called Chris¬ 
tian interiority is a particular mode of relationship with 
oneself, comprising precise forms of attention, concern, deci¬ 
pherment, verbalization, confession, self-accusation, strug¬ 
gle against temptation, renunciation, spiritual combat, and so 
on. And what is designated as the “exteriority” of ancient 
morality also implies the principle of an elaboration of self, 
albeit in a very different form. The evolution that occurred— 
quite slowly at that—between paganism and Christianity did 
not consist in a gradual interiorization of rules, acts, and 
transgressions; rather, it carried out a restructuration of the 
forms of self-relationship and a transformation of the practices 
and techniques on which this relationship was based. 

Classical language had a term for designating this form of 
relationship with oneself, this “attitude” which was necessary 
to the ethics of pleasures and which was manifested through 
the proper use one made of them: enkrateia. As a matter of 
fact, for a long time the word remained rather close to 
sophrosyne: one often finds them employed together or alter-

The Use of Pleasure 


natively, with very similar meanings. When Xenophon speaks 
of moderation—which, together with piety, wisdom, courage, 
and justice, was among the five virtues he usually recognized 
—he employs the words sophrosyne and enkrateia inter¬ 
changeably.' Plato refers to this proximity of the two words 
when Socrates, questioned by Callicles concerning what he 
meant by “ruling himself” (auton heauton archein), replies 
that it consists in “being temperate, master of himself [so- 
phrona onta kai enkrate auton heautou ], ruling the pleasures 
and appetites within him [archein ton hedonon kai epithumi- 
o/i].” 2 And when, in the Republic, he considers the four cardi¬ 
nal virtues in turn—wisdom, courage, justice, and moderation 
(sophrosyne) —he defines the latter by enkrateia: “Moderation 
[soph rosy ne\ is a certain orderliness and mastery [kosmos kai 
enkrateia ] over certain pleasures and appetites.” 3 * 

We may note, however, that while the meanings of these 
two words are very close, they stop short of being exact syno¬ 
nyms. Each refers to a somewhat different mode of relation¬ 
ship to self. The virtue of sophrosyne is described rather as a 
very general state that ensures that one will do “what is fitting 
as regards both gods and men” 4 —that is, one will be not only 
moderate but righteous and just, and courageous as well.f In 
contrast, enkrateia is characterized more by an active form of 
self-mastery, which enables one to resist or struggle, and to 
achieve domination in the area of desires and pleasures. Ac¬ 
cording to Helen North, Aristotle was the first to distinguish 
systematically between sophrosyne and enkrateia. 6 The former 
is characterized in the Nicomachean Ethics by the fact that the 
subject deliberately chooses reasonable principles of action, 
that he is capable of following and applying them, that he 
holds to the “right mean” between insensitivity and excess (a 
middle course that is not equidistant between the two, because 

•Aristotle says that some people believe that one who is sophron is enkrates and 
karterikos. 

tCompare: “The correct apportionment is one which honors most the good things 
pertaining to the soul, provided it has moderation.”’
