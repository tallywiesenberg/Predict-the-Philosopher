be done. And for this there was no need of anything resem¬ 
bling a text that would have the force of law, but rather, of 
a techne or “practice,” a savoir-faire that by taking general 
principles into account would guide action in its time, accord¬ 
ing to its context, and in view of its ends. Therefore, in this 
form of morality, the individual did not make himself into an 
ethical subject by universalizing the principles that informed 
his action; on the contrary, he did so by means of an attitude 
and a quest that individualized his action, modulated it, and 
perhaps even gave him a special brilliance by virtue of the 
rational and deliberate structure his action manifested.

Enkrateia 


The interiority of Christian morality is often contrasted 
with the exteriority of a pagan morality that would consider 
acts only in their concrete realization, in their visible and 
manifest form, in their degree of conformity with rules, and 
in the light of opinion or with a view to the memory they leave 
behind them. But this traditionally accepted opposition may 
well miss the essential elements of both. What is called Chris¬ 
tian interiority is a particular mode of relationship with 
oneself, comprising precise forms of attention, concern, deci¬ 
pherment, verbalization, confession, self-accusation, strug¬ 
gle against temptation, renunciation, spiritual combat, and so 
on. And what is designated as the “exteriority” of ancient 
morality also implies the principle of an elaboration of self, 
albeit in a very different form. The evolution that occurred— 
quite slowly at that—between paganism and Christianity did 
not consist in a gradual interiorization of rules, acts, and 
transgressions; rather, it carried out a restructuration of the 
forms of self-relationship and a transformation of the practices 
and techniques on which this relationship was based. 

Classical language had a term for designating this form of 
relationship with oneself, this “attitude” which was necessary 
to the ethics of pleasures and which was manifested through 
the proper use one made of them: enkrateia. As a matter of 
fact, for a long time the word remained rather close to 
sophrosyne: one often finds them employed together or alter-
