The Use of Pleasure 


natively, with very similar meanings. When Xenophon speaks 
of moderation—which, together with piety, wisdom, courage, 
and justice, was among the five virtues he usually recognized 
—he employs the words sophrosyne and enkrateia inter¬ 
changeably.' Plato refers to this proximity of the two words 
when Socrates, questioned by Callicles concerning what he 
meant by “ruling himself” (auton heauton archein), replies 
that it consists in “being temperate, master of himself [so- 
phrona onta kai enkrate auton heautou ], ruling the pleasures 
and appetites within him [archein ton hedonon kai epithumi- 
o/i].” 2 And when, in the Republic, he considers the four cardi¬ 
nal virtues in turn—wisdom, courage, justice, and moderation 
(sophrosyne) —he defines the latter by enkrateia: “Moderation 
[soph rosy ne\ is a certain orderliness and mastery [kosmos kai 
enkrateia ] over certain pleasures and appetites.” 3 * 

We may note, however, that while the meanings of these 
two words are very close, they stop short of being exact syno¬ 
nyms. Each refers to a somewhat different mode of relation¬ 
ship to self. The virtue of sophrosyne is described rather as a 
very general state that ensures that one will do “what is fitting 
as regards both gods and men” 4 —that is, one will be not only 
moderate but righteous and just, and courageous as well.f In 
contrast, enkrateia is characterized more by an active form of 
self-mastery, which enables one to resist or struggle, and to 
achieve domination in the area of desires and pleasures. Ac¬ 
cording to Helen North, Aristotle was the first to distinguish 
systematically between sophrosyne and enkrateia. 6 The former 
is characterized in the Nicomachean Ethics by the fact that the 
subject deliberately chooses reasonable principles of action, 
that he is capable of following and applying them, that he 
holds to the “right mean” between insensitivity and excess (a 
middle course that is not equidistant between the two, because 

•Aristotle says that some people believe that one who is sophron is enkrates and 
karterikos. 

tCompare: “The correct apportionment is one which honors most the good things 
pertaining to the soul, provided it has moderation.”’
