be able to become moderate (sophron) “if he has not fought 
triumphantly against the many pleasures and desires [pollais 
hedonais kai epithumiais dia me mac he me nos] using the help of 
speech, deed, and art [logos, ergon, techne] in games and in 
serious pursuits.” 8 These are almost the same words that Anti¬ 
phon the Sophist employed on his own account: “He is not 
wise [sophron] who has not tried the ugly and the bad; for then 
there is nothing he has conquered [kratein ] and nothing that 
would enable him to assert that he is virtuous [kosmios]." 9 
One could behave ethically only by adopting a combative 
attitude toward the pleasures. As we have seen, the aphrodisia 
were made not only possible but desirable by an interplay of 
forces whose origin and finality were natural, but whose po¬ 
tential, by the fact that they had their own energy, was for 
revolt and excess. These forces could not be used in the moder¬ 
ate way that was fitting unless one was capable of opposing, 
resisting, and subduing them. Of course, if it was necessary to 
confront them, this was because they were inferior appetites 
that humans happen to share—like hunger and thirst—with 
the animals; 10 but this natural inferiority would not of itself be 
a reason for having to combat them, if there was not the 
danger that, winning out over all else, they would extend their 
rule over the whole individual, eventually reducing him to 
slavery. In other words, it was not their intrinsic nature, their 
disqualification on principle, that necessitated this “polemi¬ 
cal” attitude toward oneself, but their possible ascendancy and 
dominion. Ethical conduct in matters of pleasure was contin¬ 
gent on a battle for power. This perception of the hedonai and 
epithumiai as a formidable enemy force, and the correlative 
constitution of oneself as a vigilant adversary who confronts 
them, struggles against them, and tries to subdue them, is 
revealed in a whole series of expressions traditionally em¬ 
ployed to characterize moderation and immoderation: setting 
oneself against the pleasures and desires, not giving in to them, 
resisting their assaults, or on the contrary, letting oneself be 
overcome by them, 11 defeating them or being defeated by

them, 12 being armed or equipped against them. 13 It is also 
revealed in metaphors such as that of the battle that has to be 
fought against armed adversaries, or that of the acropolis-soul 
assaulted by a hostile band and needing a solid garrison for its
