defense, or that of hornets that set upon reasonable and mod¬ 
erate desires, killing them or driving them out unless one 
manages to rid oneself of these attackers. 14 It is expressed, too, 
by such themes as that of the untamed forces of desire that 
invade the soul during its slumber if it has not had the fore¬ 
sight to take the necessary precautions. 15 The relationship to 
desires and pleasures is conceived as a pugnacious one: a man 
must take the position and role of the adversary with respect 
to them, either according to the model of the fighting soldier 
or the model of the wrestler in a match. One should keep in 
mind that the Athenian of the Laws, when he speaks of the 
need to restrain the three basic appetites, invokes the aid of 
“the Muses and the gods of contests [theoi agonioi ].” 16 The 
long tradition of spiritual combat, which was to take so many 
diverse forms, was already clearly delineated in classical 
Greek thought. 

2. This combative relationship with adversaries was also 
an agonistic relationship with oneself. The battle to be fought, 
the victory to be won, the defeat that one risked suffering— 
these were processes and events that took place between one¬ 
self and oneself. The adversaries the individual had to combat 
were not just within him or close by; they were part of him. 
To be sure, we would need to account for the various theoreti¬ 
cal formulations that were proposed concerning this differen¬ 
tiation between the part of oneself that was supposed to fight 
and the part that was supposed to be defeated. Parts of the soul 
that ought to maintain a certain hierarchical relationship 
among themselves? Body and soul understood as two realities 
with different origins? Forces straining toward different goals 
and working against one another like the two horses of a team? 
But in any case, the thing to remember in trying to define the

The Use of Pleasure 


general style of this ascetics is that the adversary that was to 
be fought, however far removed it might be by nature from 
any conception of the soul, reason, or virtue, did not represent 
a different, ontologically alien power. The conceptual link 
between the movement of concupiscence, in its most insidious 
and most secret forms, and the presence of the Other, with its 
ruses and its power of illusion, was to be one of the essential 
traits of the Christian ethics of the flesh. In the ethics of the 
aphrodisia, the inevitability and difficulty of the combat 
derived, on the contrary, from the fact that it unfolded as a 
solo contest: to struggle against “the desires and the pleas¬ 
ures” was to cross swords with oneself. 

In th t Republic, Plato stresses how strange, and at the same 
time somewhat ludicrous and outmoded, is a familiar expres¬ 
sion that he himself had resorted to several times: it is the one 
that consists in saying that a person is “stronger” or “weaker” 
than himself (kreitton, hetton heautou ). 17 Indeed, there is para¬ 
dox in claiming that one is stronger than oneself, since this 
implies that one is also, by the same token, weaker than one¬ 
self. But according to Plato, the expression is supported by the 
fact of a prior distinction between two parts of the soul, a 
better part and a worse, and that with regard to the victory 
or the defeat of oneself over oneself, the speaker places himself 
on the side of the first: “The expression self-control seems to 
want to indicate that in the soul of the man himself there is 
a better part and a worse part; whenever what is by nature the 
better part is in control of the worse, this is expressed by 
saying that the man is self-controlled or master of himself, and 
this is a term of praise. When, on the other hand, the smaller 
and better part, because of poor upbringing or bad company, 
is overpowered by the larger and worse, this is made a re¬ 
proach and called being defeated by oneself, and a man in that 
situation is called uncontrolled.” 18 And it is made clear at the 
beginning of the Laws that this antagonism of oneself toward 
oneself is meant to structure the ethical attitude of the individ¬ 
ual vis-a-vis desires and pleasures: the reason that is given for 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

the need of a ruling authority and a legislative authority in 
every state is that even in peacetime all states are at war with 
one another; in the same way one must assume that if “all are 
enemies of all in public,” then “in private each is an enemy 
of himself”; and of all the victories it is possible to win, “the 
first and best” is the victory “of oneself over oneself,” whereas 
“being defeated by oneself is the most shameful and at the 
same time the worst of all defeats.” 19 

3. Such a “polemical” attitude with respect to oneself 
tended toward a result that was quite naturally expressed as 
victory—a victory much more impressive, says the Laws, than 
those won in wrestling and running contests. 20 This victory
