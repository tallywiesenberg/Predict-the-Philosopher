defense, or that of hornets that set upon reasonable and mod¬ 
erate desires, killing them or driving them out unless one 
manages to rid oneself of these attackers. 14 It is expressed, too, 
by such themes as that of the untamed forces of desire that 
invade the soul during its slumber if it has not had the fore¬ 
sight to take the necessary precautions. 15 The relationship to 
desires and pleasures is conceived as a pugnacious one: a man 
must take the position and role of the adversary with respect 
to them, either according to the model of the fighting soldier 
or the model of the wrestler in a match. One should keep in 
mind that the Athenian of the Laws, when he speaks of the 
need to restrain the three basic appetites, invokes the aid of 
“the Muses and the gods of contests [theoi agonioi ].” 16 The 
long tradition of spiritual combat, which was to take so many 
diverse forms, was already clearly delineated in classical 
Greek thought. 

2. This combative relationship with adversaries was also 
an agonistic relationship with oneself. The battle to be fought, 
the victory to be won, the defeat that one risked suffering— 
these were processes and events that took place between one¬ 
self and oneself. The adversaries the individual had to combat 
were not just within him or close by; they were part of him. 
To be sure, we would need to account for the various theoreti¬ 
cal formulations that were proposed concerning this differen¬ 
tiation between the part of oneself that was supposed to fight 
and the part that was supposed to be defeated. Parts of the soul 
that ought to maintain a certain hierarchical relationship 
among themselves? Body and soul understood as two realities 
with different origins? Forces straining toward different goals 
and working against one another like the two horses of a team? 
But in any case, the thing to remember in trying to define the

general style of this ascetics is that the adversary that was to 
be fought, however far removed it might be by nature from 
any conception of the soul, reason, or virtue, did not represent 
a different, ontologically alien power. The conceptual link 
between the movement of concupiscence, in its most insidious 
and most secret forms, and the presence of the Other, with its 
ruses and its power of illusion, was to be one of the essential 
traits of the Christian ethics of the flesh. In the ethics of the 
aphrodisia, the inevitability and difficulty of the combat
