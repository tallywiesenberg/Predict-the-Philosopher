derived, on the contrary, from the fact that it unfolded as a 
solo contest: to struggle against “the desires and the pleas¬ 
ures” was to cross swords with oneself. 

In th t Republic, Plato stresses how strange, and at the same 
time somewhat ludicrous and outmoded, is a familiar expres¬ 
sion that he himself had resorted to several times: it is the one 
that consists in saying that a person is “stronger” or “weaker” 
than himself (kreitton, hetton heautou ). 17 Indeed, there is para¬ 
dox in claiming that one is stronger than oneself, since this 
implies that one is also, by the same token, weaker than one¬ 
self. But according to Plato, the expression is supported by the 
fact of a prior distinction between two parts of the soul, a 
better part and a worse, and that with regard to the victory 
or the defeat of oneself over oneself, the speaker places himself 
on the side of the first: “The expression self-control seems to 
want to indicate that in the soul of the man himself there is 
a better part and a worse part; whenever what is by nature the 
better part is in control of the worse, this is expressed by 
saying that the man is self-controlled or master of himself, and 
this is a term of praise. When, on the other hand, the smaller 
and better part, because of poor upbringing or bad company, 
is overpowered by the larger and worse, this is made a re¬ 
proach and called being defeated by oneself, and a man in that 
situation is called uncontrolled.” 18 And it is made clear at the 
beginning of the Laws that this antagonism of oneself toward 
oneself is meant to structure the ethical attitude of the individ¬ 
ual vis-a-vis desires and pleasures: the reason that is given for

the need of a ruling authority and a legislative authority in 
every state is that even in peacetime all states are at war with 
one another; in the same way one must assume that if “all are 
enemies of all in public,” then “in private each is an enemy 
of himself”; and of all the victories it is possible to win, “the 
first and best” is the victory “of oneself over oneself,” whereas 
“being defeated by oneself is the most shameful and at the 
same time the worst of all defeats.” 19 

3. Such a “polemical” attitude with respect to oneself 
tended toward a result that was quite naturally expressed as 
victory—a victory much more impressive, says the Laws, than 
those won in wrestling and running contests. 20 This victory
