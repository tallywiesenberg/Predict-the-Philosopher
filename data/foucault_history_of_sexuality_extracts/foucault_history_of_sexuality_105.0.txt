was sometimes characterized by the complete extirpation or 
expulsion of desires. 21 * But much more often, it was defined 
by the setting up of a solid and stable state of rule of the self 
over the self; the intensity of the desires and pleasures did not 
disappear, but the moderate subject controlled it well enough 
so as never to give way to violence. The famous test of Socra¬ 
tes, in which he proves capable of resisting seduction by Al- 
cibiades, does not show him “purified” of all desire for boys: 
it reveals his ability to resist whenever and however he 
chooses. Such a test would meet with disapproval from Chris¬ 
tians because it would testify to the abiding presence—for 
them immoral—of desire. But long before them, Bion the 
Borysthenite made light of it, declaring that if Socrates felt 
desire for Alcibiades, he was foolish to abstain, and if he felt 
none, his conduct was entirely unremarkable. 23 Similarly, in 
Aristotle’s analysis, enkrateia, defined as mastery and victory, 
presupposes the presence of desires, and is all the more valu¬ 
able as it manages to control those that are violent. 24 Soph ro¬ 
sy ne itself, although defined by Aristotle as a state of virtue, did 
not imply the suppression of desires but rather their control: 
Aristotle places it in an intermediary position between a self- 

*In the Nicomachean Ethics, it is a question of “bidding pleasure be gone,” as the 
old people of Troy wanted to do with Helen."

The Use of Pleasure 


indulgence (akolasia) in which one gladly abandons oneself to 
one’s pleasures, and an insensitivity (anaisthesia )—extremely 
rare, it should be added—in which one feels no pleasure; the 
moderate individual is not one who has no desires but one who 
desires “only to a moderate degree, not more than he should, 
nor when he should not.’’ 25 

In the domain of pleasures, virtue was not conceived as a 
state of integrity, but as a relationship of domination, a rela¬ 
tion of mastery. This is shown by the terms that are used— 
whether in Plato, Xenophon, Diogenes, Antiphon, or Aris¬ 
totle—to define moderation: “rule the desires and the pleas¬ 
ures,” “exercise power over them,” “govern them” (kratein, 
archein). There is an aphorism that captures this general con¬ 
ception of pleasure; interestingly, it is attributed to Aristippus, 
who had a rather different theory of pleasure from that of 
Socrates: “It is not abstinence from pleasures that is best, but
