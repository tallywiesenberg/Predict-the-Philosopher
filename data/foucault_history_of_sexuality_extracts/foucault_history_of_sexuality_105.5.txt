mastery over them without ever being worsted” (to kratein kai 
me hettasthai hedonon ariston, ou to me chresthai ). 26 In other 
words, to form oneself as a virtuous and moderate subject in 
the use he makes of pleasures, the individual has to construct 
a relationship with the self that is of the “domination-submis¬ 
sion,” “command-obedience,” “mastery-docility” type (and 
not, as will be the case in Christian spirituality, a relationship 
of the “elucidation-renunciation,” “decipherment-purifica¬ 
tion” type). This is what could be called the “heautocratic” 
structure of the subject in the ethical practice of the pleasures. 

4. The development of this heautocratic form was pat¬ 
terned after several models: for example, in Plato there is the 
model of the team with its driver, and in Aristotle, that of the 
child with the adult (our desiring faculty ought to comply with 
the prescriptions of reason “as the child should live according 
to the direction of his tutor”). 27 But it was related to two great 
schemas in particular. That of domestic life, first of all: just as 
a household could not be in good order unless the rank and 
authority of the master was respected within it, so a man

would be moderate only insofar as he was able to rule his 
desires as if they were his servants. Conversely, immoderation 
could be likened to a household that was mismanaged. At the 
beginning of the Oeconomicus —which deals precisely with the 
role of the master of the house and the art of ruling one’s wife, 
one’s estate, and one’s servants—Xenophon describes the dis¬ 
organized soul. It is at once a counter-example of what a 
well-ordered household should be, and a portrait of those bad 
masters who, incapable of governing themselves, bring ruin to 
their estates; in the soul of the immoderate man, “harsh” 
masters (gluttony, drunkenness, lust, ambition) enslave the 
man who should be governing, and after exploiting him in his 
youth, abandon him to grow old in misery. 28 The model of 
civic life is also called on in order to define the moderate 
attitude. It is a familiar theme in Plato that desires can be 
likened to a low-born populace that will grow agitated and 
rebellious unless it is kept in check; 29 but the strict correlation 
between the individual and the city, which is the mainstay of 
Plato’s thinking in the Republic, enables him to elaborate on 
the “civic” model of moderation and its opposite, page after 
page. There, the ethics of pleasure is of the same order of
