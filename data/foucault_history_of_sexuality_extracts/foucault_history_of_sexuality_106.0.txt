reality as the political structure: “If the individual is like the 
city, the same structure must prevail in him”; and he will be 
self-indulgent when he lacks the power structure, the arc he, 
that would allow him to defeat, to rule over (kratein) the 
inferior powers; then “his soul must be full of servitude and 
lack freedom”; the soul’s “best parts” will be enslaved and “a 
small part, the most wicked and mad, is master.” 30 At the end 
of the next to last book of the Republic, after having set up 
the model of the city, Plato acknowledges that the philosopher 
will have little chance of encountering a state so perfect in this 
world or of serving his function within it; but he goes on to 
say that, nevertheless, the “paradigm” of the city is laid up in 
heaven for him who wants to contemplate it; looking upon it, 
the philosopher will be able to “set up the government of his 
soul” (heauton kratoikizein): “It makes no difference whether

it exists anywhere or will exist. He would take part in the 
public affairs of that city only, not of any other.” 31 Individual 
virtue needed to be structured like a city. 

5 . A struggle of this kind required training. The metaphor 
of the match, of athletic competition and battle, did not serve 
merely to designate the nature of the relationship one had with 
desires and pleasures, with their force that was always liable 
to turn seditious or rebellious; it also related to the preparation 
that enabled one to withstand such a confrontation. As Plato 
says, a man will not be able to oppose or defeat them if he is 
agymnastos. 32 Exercise was no less indispensable in this order 
of things than in the case of other techniques one acquired: 
mathesis alone was not sufficient; it had to be backed up by 
a training, an askesis. This was one of the great Socratic 
lessons; it did not contradict the principle that said one could 
not willfully do wrong, knowing that it was wrong; it gave this 
knowledge a form that was not reducible to the mere aware¬ 
ness of a principle. Speaking in reference to the accusations 
brought against Socrates, Xenophon takes care to distinguish 
his teaching from that of the philosophers—or “self-styled 
lovers of wisdom”—for whom once man has learned what it 
is to be just or moderate (sophron), he can become unjust or 
dissolute. Like Socrates, Xenophon objects to this theory: if 
one does not exercise one’s body, one cannot sustain the func¬ 
tions of the body (ta tou somatos erga); similarly, if one does 
not exercise the soul, one cannot sustain the functions of the 
soul, so that one will not be able to “do what one ought to do 
nor avoid what one ought not to do.” 33 It is for this reason that 
Xenophon thinks that Socrates cannot be held accountable for 
Alcibiades’ misbehavior: the latter was not a victim of the 
teaching he received, but rather, after all his successes with 
men, women, and a whole populace made him a champion, he 
acted like many athletes: once victory was won, he thought he 
could “neglect his training” (amelein tes askeseos ). 34 

Plato returns often to this Socratic principle of askesis. He

represents Socrates showing Alcibiades or Callicles that they 
have no right to involve themselves with the affairs of the city 
or to govern others if they have not first learned what is 
necessary and trained accordingly: “And then, when we have 
practiced it [i askesantes ] together this way, then finally, if you 
think we ought to, we’ll undertake political business.” 35 And 
he associates this requirement of practice with the need to 
attend to oneself. This epimeleia heautou, care of the self, 
which was a precondition that had to be met before one was 
qualified to attend to the affairs of others or lead them, in¬ 
cluded not only the need to know (to know the things one does 
not know, to know that one is ignorant, to know one’s own 
nature), but to attend effectively to the self, and to exercise and 
transform oneself. 36 The doctrine and practice of the Cynics 
also accorded a good deal of importance to askesis; indeed, the 
Cynic life as a whole could be seen as a sort of continuous 
exercise. Diogenes advocated training the body and the soul 
at the same time: each of the two exercises “was worthless 
without the other, good health and strength being no less 
useful than the rest, since what concerns the body concerns 
the soul as well.” The object of this twofold training was both 
to enable the individual to face privations without suffering, 
as they occurred, and to reduce every pleasure to nothing 
more than the elementary satisfaction of needs. Considered as 
a whole, this exercise implied a reduction to nature, a victory 
over self, and a natural economy that would produce a life of 
real satisfactions: “Nothing in life,” Diogenes maintained, 
“has any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice; 
and this is capable of overcoming anything [pan eknikesai ].
