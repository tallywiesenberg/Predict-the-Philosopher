not exercise the soul, one cannot sustain the functions of the 
soul, so that one will not be able to “do what one ought to do 
nor avoid what one ought not to do.” 33 It is for this reason that 
Xenophon thinks that Socrates cannot be held accountable for 
Alcibiades’ misbehavior: the latter was not a victim of the 
teaching he received, but rather, after all his successes with 
men, women, and a whole populace made him a champion, he 
acted like many athletes: once victory was won, he thought he 
could “neglect his training” (amelein tes askeseos ). 34 

Plato returns often to this Socratic principle of askesis. He

represents Socrates showing Alcibiades or Callicles that they 
have no right to involve themselves with the affairs of the city 
or to govern others if they have not first learned what is 
necessary and trained accordingly: “And then, when we have 
practiced it [i askesantes ] together this way, then finally, if you 
think we ought to, we’ll undertake political business.” 35 And 
he associates this requirement of practice with the need to 
attend to oneself. This epimeleia heautou, care of the self, 
which was a precondition that had to be met before one was 
qualified to attend to the affairs of others or lead them, in¬ 
cluded not only the need to know (to know the things one does 
not know, to know that one is ignorant, to know one’s own 
nature), but to attend effectively to the self, and to exercise and 
transform oneself. 36 The doctrine and practice of the Cynics 
also accorded a good deal of importance to askesis; indeed, the 
Cynic life as a whole could be seen as a sort of continuous 
exercise. Diogenes advocated training the body and the soul 
at the same time: each of the two exercises “was worthless 
without the other, good health and strength being no less 
useful than the rest, since what concerns the body concerns 
the soul as well.” The object of this twofold training was both 
to enable the individual to face privations without suffering, 
as they occurred, and to reduce every pleasure to nothing 
more than the elementary satisfaction of needs. Considered as 
a whole, this exercise implied a reduction to nature, a victory 
over self, and a natural economy that would produce a life of 
real satisfactions: “Nothing in life,” Diogenes maintained, 
“has any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice; 
and this is capable of overcoming anything [pan eknikesai ].
