. . . Instead of useless toils men should choose such as nature 
recommends, whereby they might have lived happily. . . . For 
even the despising of pleasure is itself most pleasurable, when 
we are habituated to it; and just as those accustomed to a life 
of pleasure feel disgust when they pass over to the opposite 
experience, so those whose training has been of the opposite 
kind derive more pleasure from despising pleasure than from

The importance of exercise would not be neglected in the 
subsequent philosophical tradition. In fact it was considerably 
amplified: new exercises were added, and procedures, objec¬ 
tives, and possible variants were defined; their effectiveness 
was debated; askesis in its different forms (training, medita¬ 
tion, tests of thinking, examination of conscience, control of 
representations) eventually became a subject matter for teach¬ 
ing and constituted one of the basic instruments used in the 
direction of souls. By contrast, in the texts of the classical 
period one finds relatively few details on the concrete form 
that the ethical askesis could take. Doubtless the Pythagorean 
tradition recognized many exercises: dietary regimens, review¬ 
ing of one’s misdeeds at the end of the day, or meditation 
practices that ought to precede sleep so as to ward off bad 
dreams and encourage the visions that might come from the 
gods. Plato makes a precise reference to these evening spiritual 
preparations in a passage of the Republic in which he evokes 
the danger of desires that are always apt to invade the soul. 38 
But, apart from these Pythagorean practices, one finds few 
instances—whether in Xenophon, Plato, Diogenes, or Aris¬ 
totle—where askesis is specified as an exercise in self-control. 
There are two likely reasons for this: first, exercise was re¬ 
garded as the actual practice of what one needed to train for; 
it was not something distinct from the goal to be reached. 
Through training, one became accustomed to the behavior 
that one would eventually have to manifest.* Thus Xenophon 
praises Spartan education for teaching children to endure hun¬ 
ger by rationing their food, to endure cold by giving them only 
one garment, and to endure suffering by exposing them to 
physical punishments, just as they were taught to practice 
self-control by being made to show the strictest modesty in 

•Compare Plato in the Laws: "Whatever a man intends to become good at, this he 
must practice [meleiean] from childhood; whether he’s playing or being serious, he 
should spend his time with each of the things that pertain to the activity."” 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

demeanor (walking in the streets in silence, with downcast 
eyes and with hands hidden beneath their cloaks). 40 Similarly, 
Plato proposes subjecting young people to tests of courage that 
would expose them to simulated dangers; this would be a 
means of training and improving them, and a means of gaug¬ 
ing their merit at the same time: just as one leads “colts into 
noise and tumult to see if they are fearful, so we must expose 
our young to fears and pleasures to test them, much more 
thoroughly than one tests gold in fire, and see whether a 
guardian is hard to bewitch and behaves well in all circum¬ 
stances as a good guardian of himself and of the cultural 
education he has received.” 41 In the Laws, Plato goes so far 
as to imagine a drug that has not yet been invented: it would 
make everything look frightening to anyone who ingested it, 
and it could be used for trying one’s courage: either in private 
“out of a sense of shame at being seen before he was in what 
he considered good condition,” or in a group and even in 
public “in the company of many fellow drinkers,” to show 
that one was able to overcome “the power of the necessary 
transformation effected by the drink.” 42 In the same way, 
banquets could be planned and accepted as tests of self-con¬ 
trol, so to speak, based on this artificial and ideal model. 
Aristotle expresses this circularity of ethical apprenticeship 
and learnable virtue in a simple phrase: “By abstaining from 
pleasures we become temperate and it is when we have become 
so that we are most able to abstain from them.” 43 

As for the other reason that may explain the absence of a 
specific art for exercising the soul, it has to do with the fact 
that self -mastery and the mastery of others were regarded as 
having the same form; since one was expected to govern one¬ 
self in the same manner as one governed one’s household and 
played one’s role in the city, it followed that the development 
of personal virtues, of enkrateia in particular, was not essen¬ 
tially different from the development that enabled one to rise 
above other citizens to a position of leadership. The same 
apprenticeship ought to make a man both capable of virtue
