and capable of exercising power. Governing oneself, managing 
one’s estate, and participating in the administration of the 
city were three practices of the same type. Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus shows the continuity and isomorphism between 
these three “arts,” as well as the chronological sequence by 
which they were to be practiced in the life of an individual. 
The young Critobulus declares that he is now capable of ruling 
himself, that he will no longer allow himself to be dominated 
by his desires and pleasures (Socrates reminds him that the 
latter are like servants who are best kept under supervision); 
therefore it is time for him to marry and with the help of his 
wife to administer his household; and, as Xenophon points out 
several times, this domestic government—understood as the 
management of a household and the cultivation of a domain, 
the maintenance or development of an estate—constituted, 
when given the right amount of dedication, a remarkable 
physical and moral training for anyone who aimed to fulfill his 
civic obligations, establish his public authority, and assume 
leadership functions. Generally speaking, anything that would 
contribute to the political education of a man as a citizen 
would also contribute to his training in virtue; and conversely, 
the two endeavors went hand in hand. Moral askesis formed 
part of the paideia of the free man who had a role to play in 
the city and in dealings with others; it had no need of separate 
methods; gymnastics and endurance trials, music and the 
learning of vigorous and manly rhythms, practice in hunting 
and warfare, concern with one’s demeanor in public, acquiring 
the aidos that would lead to self-respect through the respect 
one showed for others—all this was a means of educating the 
man who would be of service to his city, and it was also moral 
training for anyone who intended to master himself. Com¬ 
menting on the tests of contrived fear that he recommends, 
Plato speaks of them as a means of identifying those boys who 
are most likely to be “the best men for themselves and for the 
city”; those will be the ones recruited to govern: “The one who 
is thus tested as a child, as a youth, and as an adult, and comes
