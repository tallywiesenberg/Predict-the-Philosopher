out of it untainted [ akeratos] is to be made a ruler as well as 
a guardian.” 44 And in the Laws, when the Athenian wants to 
define what he means by paideia, he characterizes it as what 
trains “from childhood in virtue” and makes one “desire and 
love to become a perfect citizen who knows how to rule and 
be ruled with justice.” 45 

In a word, we can say that the theme of an askesis, as a 
practical training that was indispensable in order for an indi¬ 
vidual to form himself as a moral subject, was important— 
emphasized even—in classical Greek thought, especially in 
the tradition issuing from Socrates. And yet, this “ascetics” 
was not organized or conceived as a corpus of separate prac¬ 
tices that would constitute a kind of specific art of the soul, 
with its techniques, procedures, and prescriptions. It was not 
distinct from the practice of virtue itself; it was the rehearsal 
that anticipated that practice. Further, it made use of the same 
exercises as those that molded the citizen: the master of him¬ 
self and the master of others received the same training. It 
would not be long before this ascetics would begin to have an 
independent status, or at least a partial and relative autonomy. 
In two ways: there was to be a differentiation between the 
exercises that enabled one to govern oneself and the learning 
of what was necessary in order to govern others; there was also 
to be a differentiation between the exercises themselves and 
the virtue, moderation, and temperance for which they were 
meant to serve as training: their procedures (trials, examina¬ 
tions, self-control) tended to form a particular technique that 
was more complex than the mere rehearsal of the moral be¬ 
havior they anticipated. The time would come when the art 
of the self would assume its own shape, distinct from the 
ethical conduct that was its objective. But in classical Greek 
thought, the “ascetics” that enabled one to make oneself into 
an ethical subject was an integral part—down to its very form 
—of the practice of a virtuous life, which was also the life of 
a “free” man in the full, positive and political sense of the 
word.
