1. “Tell me, Euthydemus, do you think that freedom is a 
noble and splendid possession both for individuals and for 
communities?” “Yes, I think it is, in the highest degree.” 
“Then do you think that the man is free who is ruled by bodily 
pleasures and is unable to do what is best because of them?” 
“By no means.” 1 

Sophrosyne was a state that could be approached through 
the exercise of self-mastery and through restraint in the prac¬ 
tice of pleasures; it was characterized as a freedom. If it was 
so important to govern desires and pleasures, if the use one 
made of them constituted such a crucial ethical problem, this 
was not because the Greeks hoped to preserve or regain an 
original innocence; nor was it in general—except of course in 
the Pythagorean tradition—because they wanted to maintain 
a purity;* it was because they wanted to be free and to be able 
to remain so. This could be regarded as further proof, if such 
were needed, that freedom in classical Greek thought was not 
considered simply as the independence of the city as a whole, 
while the citizens themselves would be only constituent ele- 

•Obviously I am not suggesting that the theme of purity was absent from the Greek 
ethics of pleasures in the classical period. It occupied a place of considerable impor¬ 
tance among the Pythagoreans, and it was very important for Plato. However, it does 
seem that on the whole, as regards desires and pleasures, ethical conduct was con¬ 
ceived as a matter of domination. The emergence and development of an ethics of 
purity, with its correlative practices of the self, was a historical phenomenon that was 
to have far-reaching consequences.

ments, devoid of individuality or interiority. The freedom that 
needed establishing and preserving was that of the citizens of 
a collectivity of course, but it was also, for each of them, a 
certain form of relationship of the individual with himself. The 
organization of the city, the nature of its laws, the forms of 
education, and the manner in which the leaders conducted 
themselves obviously were important factors for the behavior 
of citizens; but conversely, the freedom of individuals, under¬ 
stood as the mastery they were capable of exercising over 
themselves, was indispensable to the entire state. Consider this 
passage from Aristotle’s Politics: “A state is good in virtue of 
the goodness of the citizens who have a share in the govern¬ 
ment. In our state all the citizens have a share in the govern¬ 
ment. We have therefore to consider how a man can become 
a good man. True, it is possible for all to be good collectively, 
without each being good individually. But the better thing is 
that each individual citizen should be good. The goodness of 
all is necessarily involved in the goodness of each.” 2 The indi¬ 
vidual’s attitude toward himself, the way in which he ensured 
his own freedom with regard to himself, and the form of 
supremacy he maintained over himself were a contributing 
element to the well-being and good order of the city. 

This individual freedom should not, however, be under¬ 
stood as the independence of a free will. Its polar opposite was 
not a natural determinism, nor was it the will of an all-power¬ 
ful agency: it was an enslavement—the enslavement of the self 
by oneself. To be free in relation to pleasures was to be free 
of their authority; it was not to be their slave. 

Of the dangers carried by the aphrodisia, dishonor was not 
the most serious; the greatest danger was bondage to them. 
Diogenes was in the habit of saying that servants were slaves 
of their masters, and that immoral people were slaves of their 
desires (tousdephaulous tais epithumiais douleuein). 3 Socrates 
cautions Critobulus against this kind of servitude at the begin¬ 
ning of the Oeconomicus, and Euthydemus is similarly cau¬ 
tioned in a dialogue of the Memorabilia that is a hymn to

The Use of Pleasure 


self-control considered as freedom: “To do what is best ap¬ 
pears to you to be freedom, and so you think that to have 
masters who will prevent such activity is bondage.” “I am sure 
of it.” “You feel sure then that the incontinent are bond slaves. 

. . . And what sort of slavery do you believe to be the worst?” 
“Slavery to the worst masters, I think.” “The worst slavery, 
therefore, is the slavery endured by the incontinent. . . .” 
“Socrates, I think you mean that he who is at the mercy of the 
bodily pleasures has no concern whatever with virtue in any 
form.” “Yes, Euthydemus; for how can an incontinent man be 
any better than the dullest beast?” 4
