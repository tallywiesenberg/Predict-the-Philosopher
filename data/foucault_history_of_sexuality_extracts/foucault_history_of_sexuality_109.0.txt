noble and splendid possession both for individuals and for 
communities?” “Yes, I think it is, in the highest degree.” 
“Then do you think that the man is free who is ruled by bodily 
pleasures and is unable to do what is best because of them?” 
“By no means.” 1 

Sophrosyne was a state that could be approached through 
the exercise of self-mastery and through restraint in the prac¬ 
tice of pleasures; it was characterized as a freedom. If it was 
so important to govern desires and pleasures, if the use one 
made of them constituted such a crucial ethical problem, this 
was not because the Greeks hoped to preserve or regain an 
original innocence; nor was it in general—except of course in 
the Pythagorean tradition—because they wanted to maintain 
a purity;* it was because they wanted to be free and to be able 
to remain so. This could be regarded as further proof, if such 
were needed, that freedom in classical Greek thought was not 
considered simply as the independence of the city as a whole, 
while the citizens themselves would be only constituent ele- 

•Obviously I am not suggesting that the theme of purity was absent from the Greek 
ethics of pleasures in the classical period. It occupied a place of considerable impor¬ 
tance among the Pythagoreans, and it was very important for Plato. However, it does 
seem that on the whole, as regards desires and pleasures, ethical conduct was con¬ 
ceived as a matter of domination. The emergence and development of an ethics of 
purity, with its correlative practices of the self, was a historical phenomenon that was 
to have far-reaching consequences.

ments, devoid of individuality or interiority. The freedom that 
needed establishing and preserving was that of the citizens of 
a collectivity of course, but it was also, for each of them, a 
certain form of relationship of the individual with himself. The 
organization of the city, the nature of its laws, the forms of 
education, and the manner in which the leaders conducted 
themselves obviously were important factors for the behavior 
of citizens; but conversely, the freedom of individuals, under¬ 
stood as the mastery they were capable of exercising over 
themselves, was indispensable to the entire state. Consider this
