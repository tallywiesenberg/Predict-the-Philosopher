passage from Aristotle’s Politics: “A state is good in virtue of 
the goodness of the citizens who have a share in the govern¬ 
ment. In our state all the citizens have a share in the govern¬ 
ment. We have therefore to consider how a man can become 
a good man. True, it is possible for all to be good collectively, 
without each being good individually. But the better thing is 
that each individual citizen should be good. The goodness of 
all is necessarily involved in the goodness of each.” 2 The indi¬ 
vidual’s attitude toward himself, the way in which he ensured 
his own freedom with regard to himself, and the form of 
supremacy he maintained over himself were a contributing 
element to the well-being and good order of the city. 

This individual freedom should not, however, be under¬ 
stood as the independence of a free will. Its polar opposite was 
not a natural determinism, nor was it the will of an all-power¬ 
ful agency: it was an enslavement—the enslavement of the self 
by oneself. To be free in relation to pleasures was to be free 
of their authority; it was not to be their slave. 

Of the dangers carried by the aphrodisia, dishonor was not 
the most serious; the greatest danger was bondage to them. 
Diogenes was in the habit of saying that servants were slaves 
of their masters, and that immoral people were slaves of their 
desires (tousdephaulous tais epithumiais douleuein). 3 Socrates 
cautions Critobulus against this kind of servitude at the begin¬ 
ning of the Oeconomicus, and Euthydemus is similarly cau¬ 
tioned in a dialogue of the Memorabilia that is a hymn to

The Use of Pleasure 


self-control considered as freedom: “To do what is best ap¬ 
pears to you to be freedom, and so you think that to have 
masters who will prevent such activity is bondage.” “I am sure 
of it.” “You feel sure then that the incontinent are bond slaves. 

. . . And what sort of slavery do you believe to be the worst?” 
“Slavery to the worst masters, I think.” “The worst slavery, 
therefore, is the slavery endured by the incontinent. . . .” 
“Socrates, I think you mean that he who is at the mercy of the 
bodily pleasures has no concern whatever with virtue in any 
form.” “Yes, Euthydemus; for how can an incontinent man be 
any better than the dullest beast?” 4
