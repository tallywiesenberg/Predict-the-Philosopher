The bourgeoisie made this 
element identical with its body, or at least subordinated the 
latter to the former by attributing to it a mysterious and 
undefined power; it staked its life and its death on sex by 
making it responsible for its future welfare; it placed its hopes 
for the future in sex by imagining it to have ineluctable effects 
on generations to come; it subordinated its soul to sex by 
conceiving of it as what constituted the soul’s most secret and 
determinant part.Let us not picture the bourgeoisie symboli¬ 
cally castrating itself the better to refuse others the right to 
have a sex and make use of it as they please.This class must 
be seen rather as being occupied, from the mid-eighteenth 
century on, with creating its own sexuality and forming a 
specific body based on it, a “class” body with its health, 
hygiene, descent, and race: the autosexualization of its body, 
the incarnation of sex in its body, the endogamy of sex and 
the body.There were doubtless many reasons for this.First of all, 
there was a transposition into different forms of the methods 
employed by the nobility for marking and maintaining its 
caste distinction; for the aristocracy had also asserted the 
special character of its body, but this was in the form of 
blood, that is, in the form of the antiquity of its ancestry and 
of the value of its alliances; the bourgeoisie on the contrary 
looked to its progeny and the health of its organism when it 
laid claim to a specific body.
