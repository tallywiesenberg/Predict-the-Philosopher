the interplay of punishments and responsibilities, never 
ceased to reiterate. The space for classes, the shape of the 
tables, the planning of the recreation lessons, the distribution 
of the dormitories (with or without partitions, with or with¬ 
out curtains), the rules for monitoring bedtime and sleep 
periods—all this referred, in the most prolix manner, to the 
sexuality of children. 12 What one might call the internal 
discourse of the institution—the one it employed to address 
itself, and which circulated among those who made it func¬ 
tion—was largely based on the assumption that this sexuality 
existed, that it was precocious, active, and ever present. But 
this was not all: the sex of the schoolboy became in the course 
of the eighteenth century—and quite apart from that of 
adolescents in general—a public problem. Doctors counseled 
the directors and professors of educational establishments, 
but they also gave their opinions to families; educators de¬ 
signed projects which they submitted to the authorities; 
schoolmasters turned to students, made recommendations to 
them, and drafted for their benefit books of exhortation, full 
of moral and medical examples. Around the schoolboy and 
his sex there prolif erated a whole literature of precepts, opin¬ 
ions, observations, medical advice, clinical cases, outlines for 
reform, and plans for ideal institutions. With Basedow and 
the German “philanthropic” movement, this transformation 
of adolescent sex into discourse grew to considerable dimen¬ 
sions. Salzmann even organized an experimental school

class and study hours, an instructor watching the exterior, so as to prevent students 
who have gone out to relieve themselves from stopping and congregating. 

art. 68: “After the evening prayer, the students will be conducted back to the 
dormitory, where the schoolmasters will put them to bed at once. 

art. 69: “The masters will not retire except after having made certain that every 
student is in bed.

dormitories shall be illuminated during the night.”

which owed its exceptional character to a supervision and 
education of sex so well thought out that youth’s universal 
sin would never need to be practiced there. And with all 
these measures taken, the child was not to be simply the mute 
and unconscious object of attentions prearranged between 
adults only; a certain reasonable, limited, canonical, and 
truthful discourse on sex was prescribed for him—a kind of 
discursive orthopedics. The great festival organized at the 
Philanthropinum in May of 1776 can serve as a vignette in 
this regard. Taking the form of an examination, mixed with 
floral games, the awarding of prizes, and a board of review, 
this was the first solemn communion of adolescent sex and 
reasonable discourse. In order to show the success of the sex 
education given the students, Basedow had invited all the 
dignitaries that Germany could muster (Goethe was one of 
the few to decline the invitation). Before the assembled pub¬ 
lic, one of the professors, a certain Wolke, asked the students 
selected questions concerning the mysteries of sex, birth, and 
procreation. He had them comment on engravings that de¬ 
picted a pregnant woman, a couple, and a cradle. The replies 
were enlightened, offered without shame or embarrassment. 
No unseemly laughter intervened to disturb them—except 
f rom the very ranks of an adult audience more childish than 
the children themselves, and whom Wolke severely repri¬ 
manded. At the end, they all applauded these cherub-faced 
boys who, in front of adults, had skillfully woven the gar¬ 
lands of discourse and sex. 13 

It would be less than exact to say that the pedagogical 
institution has imposed a ponderous silence on the sex of 
children and adolescents. On the contrary, since the eigh¬ 
teenth century it has multiplied the forms of discourse on the 
subject; it has established various points of implantation for 
sex; it has coded contents and qualified speakers. Speaking
