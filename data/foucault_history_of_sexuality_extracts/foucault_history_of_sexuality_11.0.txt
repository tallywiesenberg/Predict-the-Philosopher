the interplay of punishments and responsibilities, never 
ceased to reiterate. The space for classes, the shape of the 
tables, the planning of the recreation lessons, the distribution 
of the dormitories (with or without partitions, with or with¬ 
out curtains), the rules for monitoring bedtime and sleep 
periods—all this referred, in the most prolix manner, to the 
sexuality of children. 12 What one might call the internal 
discourse of the institution—the one it employed to address 
itself, and which circulated among those who made it func¬ 
tion—was largely based on the assumption that this sexuality 
existed, that it was precocious, active, and ever present. But 
this was not all: the sex of the schoolboy became in the course 
of the eighteenth century—and quite apart from that of 
adolescents in general—a public problem. Doctors counseled 
the directors and professors of educational establishments, 
but they also gave their opinions to families; educators de¬ 
signed projects which they submitted to the authorities; 
schoolmasters turned to students, made recommendations to 
them, and drafted for their benefit books of exhortation, full 
of moral and medical examples. Around the schoolboy and 
his sex there prolif erated a whole literature of precepts, opin¬ 
ions, observations, medical advice, clinical cases, outlines for 
reform, and plans for ideal institutions. With Basedow and 
the German “philanthropic” movement, this transformation 
of adolescent sex into discourse grew to considerable dimen¬ 
sions. Salzmann even organized an experimental school

class and study hours, an instructor watching the exterior, so as to prevent students 
who have gone out to relieve themselves from stopping and congregating. 

art. 68: “After the evening prayer, the students will be conducted back to the 
dormitory, where the schoolmasters will put them to bed at once. 

art. 69: “The masters will not retire except after having made certain that every 
student is in bed. 

art. 70: “The beds shall be separated by partitions two meters in height. The 
dormitories shall be illuminated during the night.”
