The emphasis on the body should undoubt¬ 
edly be linked to the process of growth and establishment of 
bourgeois hegemony: not, however, because of the market 
value assumed by labor capacity, but because of what the 
“cultivation” of its own body could represent politically, 
economically, and historically for the present and the future 
of the bourgeoisie.Its dominance was in part dependent on 
that cultivation; but it was not simply a matter of economy 
or ideology, it was a “physical” matter as well.The works, 
published in great numbers at the end of the eighteenth 
century, on body hygiene, the art of longevity, ways of hav¬ 
ing healthy children and of keeping them alive as long as 
possible, and methods for improving the human lineage, bear 
witness to the fact: they thus attest to the correlation of this 
concern with the body and sex to a type of “racism.” But the 
latter was very different from that manifested by the nobility 
and organized for basically conservative ends.It was a dy¬ 
namic racism, a racism of expansion, even if it was still in a 
budding state, awaiting the second half of the nineteenth 
century to bear the fruits that we have tasted.May I be forgiven by those for whom the bourgeoisie 
signifies the elision of the body and the repression of sexual¬ 
ity, for whom class struggle implies the fight to eliminate that 
repression; the “spontaneous philosophy” of the bourgeoisie 
is perhaps not as idealistic or castrating as is commonly 
thought.
