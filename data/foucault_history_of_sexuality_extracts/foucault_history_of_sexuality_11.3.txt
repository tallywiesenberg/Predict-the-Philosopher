This is to misunderstand 
the process whereby on the contrary the bourgeoisie en¬ 
dowed itself, in an arrogant political affirmation, with a gar¬ 
rulous sexuality which the proletariat long refused to accept, 
since it was foisted on them for the purpose of subjugation.If it is true that sexuality is the set of effects produced in 
bodies, behaviors, and social relations by a certain deploy¬ 
ment deriving from a complex political technology, one has 
to admit that this deployment does not operate in symmetri¬ 
cal fashion with respect to the social classes, and conse¬ 
quently, that it does not produce the same effects in them.We must return, therefore, to formulations that have long 
been disparaged; we must say that there is a bourgeois sexu¬ 
ality, and that there are class sexualities.Or rather, that 
sexuality is originally, historically bourgeois, and that, in its 
successive shifts and transpositions, it induces specific class 
effects.A few more words are in order.
