This line was not the 
same as the one which founded sexuality, but rather a bar 
running through that sexuality; this was the taboo that con¬ 
stituted the difference, or at least the manner in which the 
taboo was applied and the rigor with which it was imposed.It was here that the theory of repression—which was gradu¬ 
ally expanded to cover the entire deployment of sexuality, so 
that the latter came to be explained in terms of a generalized 
taboo—had its point of origin.This theory is bound up his¬ 
torically with the spread of the deployment of sexuality.On 
the one hand, the theory would justify its authoritarian and 
constraining influence by postulating that all sexuality must 
be subject to the law; more precisely, that sexuality owes its 
very definition to the action of the law: not only will you 
submit your sexuality to the law, but you will have no sexual¬ 
ity except by subjecting yourself to the law.But on the other 
hand, the theory of repression would compensate for this 
general spread of the deployment of sexuality by its analysis 
of the differential interplay of taboos according to the social 
classes.
