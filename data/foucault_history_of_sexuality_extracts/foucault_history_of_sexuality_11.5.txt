sin would never need to be practiced there. And with all 
these measures taken, the child was not to be simply the mute 
and unconscious object of attentions prearranged between 
adults only; a certain reasonable, limited, canonical, and 
truthful discourse on sex was prescribed for him—a kind of 
discursive orthopedics. The great festival organized at the 
Philanthropinum in May of 1776 can serve as a vignette in 
this regard. Taking the form of an examination, mixed with 
floral games, the awarding of prizes, and a board of review, 
this was the first solemn communion of adolescent sex and 
reasonable discourse. In order to show the success of the sex 
education given the students, Basedow had invited all the 
dignitaries that Germany could muster (Goethe was one of 
the few to decline the invitation). Before the assembled pub¬ 
lic, one of the professors, a certain Wolke, asked the students 
selected questions concerning the mysteries of sex, birth, and 
procreation. He had them comment on engravings that de¬ 
picted a pregnant woman, a couple, and a cradle. The replies 
were enlightened, offered without shame or embarrassment. 
No unseemly laughter intervened to disturb them—except 
f rom the very ranks of an adult audience more childish than 
the children themselves, and whom Wolke severely repri¬ 
manded. At the end, they all applauded these cherub-faced 
boys who, in front of adults, had skillfully woven the gar¬ 
lands of discourse and sex. 13 

It would be less than exact to say that the pedagogical 
institution has imposed a ponderous silence on the sex of 
children and adolescents. On the contrary, since the eigh¬ 
teenth century it has multiplied the forms of discourse on the 
subject; it has established various points of implantation for 
sex; it has coded contents and qualified speakers. Speaking
