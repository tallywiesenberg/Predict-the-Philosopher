The importance of this 
critique and its impact on reality were substantial.But the 
very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it 
always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not 
outside or against it.The fact that so many things were able 
to change in the sexual behavior of Western societies without 
any of the promises or political conditions predicted by 
Reich being realized is sufficient proof that this whole sexual 
“revolution,” this whole “antirepressive” struggle, repre¬ 
sented nothing more, but nothing less—and its importance 
is undeniable—than a tactical shift and reversal in the great 
deployment of sexuality.But it is also apparent why one 
could not expect this critique to be the grid for a history of 
that very deployment.Nor the basis for a movement to dis¬ 
mantle it.
