PART FIVE 

Right of Death 
and Power over Life 




For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of 
sovereign power was the right to decide life and death.In a 
formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria 
potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the 
right to “dispose” of the life of his children and his slaves; 
just as he had given them life, so he could take it away.By 
the time the right of life and death was framed by the classi¬ 
cal theoreticians, it was in a considerably diminished form.It was no longer considered that this power of the sovereign 
over his subjects could be exercised in an absolute and un¬ 
conditional way, but only in cases where the sovereign’s very 
existence was in jeopardy: a sort of right of rejoinder.If he 
were threatened by external enemies who sought to over¬ 
throw him or contest his rights, he could then legitimately 
wage war, and require his subjects to take part in the defense 
of the state; without “directly proposing their death,” he was 
empowered to “expose their life”: in this sense, he wielded 
an “indirect” power over them of life and death.
