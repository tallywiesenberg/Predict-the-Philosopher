2 In any case, in its modern form—relative and 
limited-as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life 
and death is a dissymmetrical one.The sovereign exercised 
his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by 
refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only 
through the death he was capable of requiring.The right 
which was formulated as the “power of life and death” was 
in reality the right to take life or let live.Its symbol, after 
all, was the sword.Perhaps this juridical form must be re¬ 
ferred to a historical type of society in which power was 
exercised mainly as a means of deduction (prelevement), a 
subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of 
the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and 
blood, levied on the subjects.
