Power in this instance was 
essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and 
ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize 
hold of life in order to suppress it.Since the classical age the West has undergone a very 
profound transformation of these mechanisms of power.“Deduction” has tended to be no longer the major form of 
power but merely one element among others, working to 
incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize 
the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak¬ 
ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated 
to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them.There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least 
a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis¬ 
tering power and to define itself accordingly.This death that 
was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as 
simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, 
maintain, or develop its life.
