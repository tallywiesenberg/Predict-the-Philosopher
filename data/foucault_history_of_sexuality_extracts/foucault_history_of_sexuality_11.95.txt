And through a turn that 
closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them 
to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision 
that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in 
fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival.The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: 
the power to expose a whole population to death is the 
underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s con¬ 
tinued existence.The principle underlying the tactics of bat¬ 
tle—that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on 
living—has become the principle that defines the strategy of 
states.But the existence in question is no longer the juridical 
existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence 
of a population.If genocide is indeed the dream of modern 
powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient 
right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at 
the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale 
phenomena of population.
