But this freedom was more than a nonenslavement, more 
than an emancipation that would make the individual inde¬ 
pendent of any exterior or interior constraint; in its full, posi¬ 
tive form, it was a power that one brought to bear on oneself 
in the power that one exercised over others. In fact, the person 
who, owing to his status, was under the authority of others 
was not expected to find the principle of his moderation within 
himself; it would be enough for him to obey the orders and 
instructions he was given. This is what Plato explains in re¬ 
gard to the craftsman: what is degrading in his case is that the 
best part of the soul “is naturally weak and cannot rule the 
animals within but pampers them and can learn nothing but 
ways to flatter them”; now, what should be done so that this 
man might be governed by a reasonable principle, “similar to 
that which rules the best man”? The only solution is to place 
him under the authority of this superior man: “he must be 
enslaved to the best man, who has a divine ruler within him¬ 
self.” 5 On the other hand, the mart who ought to lead others 
was one who had to be completely in command of himself: 
both because, given his position and the power he wielded, it 
would be easy for him to satisfy all his desires, and hence to 
give way to them, but also because disorderly behavior on his 
part would have its effects on everyone and in the collective 
life of the city. In order not to be excessive, not to do violence, 
in order to avoid the trap of tyrannical authority (over others) 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

coupled with a soul tyrannized by desires, the exercise of 
political power required, as its own principle of internal regu¬ 
lation, power over oneself. Moderation, understood as an 
aspect of dominion over the self, was on an equal footing 
with justice, courage, or prudence; that is, it was a virtue 
that qualified a man to exercise his mastery over others. The 
most kingly man was king of himself (basilikos, basileuon 
heautou ). 6 

Hence the importance given in the ethics of pleasures to two 
exemplary moral figures. On the one hand, there was the 
vicious tyrant; he was incapable of mastering his own passions 
and was therefore always prone to abuse his power and to do 
violence (hubrizein) to his subjects. He provoked disturbances 
in his state and caused the citizens to rebel against him. The 
sexual abuses of the despot, when he undertook to dishonor 
the citizens’ children (boys or girls), were often invoked as an 
initial justification for plots aimed at overthrowing tyrannies 
and restoring liberty: this was the case with Pisistratus at 
Athens, Periander in Ambracia, and others mentioned by 
Aristotle in Book V of the Politics . 7 Opposite the tyrant, there 
was the positive image of the leader who was capable of exer¬ 
cising a strict control over himself in the authority he exer¬ 
cised over others. His self-rule moderated his rule over others. 
A case in point is Xenophon’s Cyrus, who was in a better 
position than anyone else to abuse power, but who let it be 
known in his court that he had mastered his emotions: “He 
secured at court great correctness of conduct on the part of 
his subordinates, who gave precedence to their superiors; and 
thus he also secured from them a great degree of respect and 
politeness toward one another.” 8 Similarly, when Isocrates’ 
Nicocles praises the moderation and marital fidelity that he 
himself practices, he refers to the demands of his political 
office: how can a man expect to obtain the obedience of others 
if he is unable to subdue his own desires? 9 It is in terms of 
prudence that Aristotle advises the absolute ruler not to suc¬ 
cumb to any debauchery; he ought to take into consideration

The Use of Pleasure 


the attachment of gentlemen for their honor; for this reason, 
it would be imprudent for him to subject them to the humilia¬ 
tion of corporal punishment; for the same reason, he ought to 
refrain from “outrage of the young.” “When he indulges him¬ 
self with the young, he is doing so not in the license of power 
but because he is generally in love. In all such cases, too, he 
should atone for the dishonors which he appears to inflict by 
the gift of still greater honors.” 10 And we may recall that this 
was the question that was debated by Socrates and Callicles: 
should those who rule others be thought of as “rulers or 
ruled” (archontas e archomenous) as concerns themselves?— 
this self-rule being defined by the fact of being sophron and 
enkrates; that is, “ruling the pleasures and appetites that are 
in himself.” 11 

The day would come when the paradigm most often used 
for illustrating sexual virtue would be that of the woman, or 
girl, who defended herself from the assaults of a man who had 
every advantage over her; the safeguarding of purity and vir¬ 
ginity, and faithfulness to commitments and vows, were to
