But this freedom was more than a nonenslavement, more 
than an emancipation that would make the individual inde¬ 
pendent of any exterior or interior constraint; in its full, posi¬ 
tive form, it was a power that one brought to bear on oneself 
in the power that one exercised over others. In fact, the person 
who, owing to his status, was under the authority of others 
was not expected to find the principle of his moderation within 
himself; it would be enough for him to obey the orders and 
instructions he was given. This is what Plato explains in re¬ 
gard to the craftsman: what is degrading in his case is that the 
best part of the soul “is naturally weak and cannot rule the 
animals within but pampers them and can learn nothing but 
ways to flatter them”; now, what should be done so that this 
man might be governed by a reasonable principle, “similar to 
that which rules the best man”? The only solution is to place 
him under the authority of this superior man: “he must be 
enslaved to the best man, who has a divine ruler within him¬ 
self.” 5 On the other hand, the mart who ought to lead others 
was one who had to be completely in command of himself: 
both because, given his position and the power he wielded, it 
would be easy for him to satisfy all his desires, and hence to 
give way to them, but also because disorderly behavior on his 
part would have its effects on everyone and in the collective 
life of the city. In order not to be excessive, not to do violence, 
in order to avoid the trap of tyrannical authority (over others) 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

coupled with a soul tyrannized by desires, the exercise of 
political power required, as its own principle of internal regu¬ 
lation, power over oneself. Moderation, understood as an 
aspect of dominion over the self, was on an equal footing 
with justice, courage, or prudence; that is, it was a virtue 
that qualified a man to exercise his mastery over others. The 
most kingly man was king of himself (basilikos, basileuon 
heautou ). 6 

Hence the importance given in the ethics of pleasures to two 
exemplary moral figures. On the one hand, there was the 
vicious tyrant; he was incapable of mastering his own passions 
and was therefore always prone to abuse his power and to do 
violence (hubrizein) to his subjects. He provoked disturbances 
in his state and caused the citizens to rebel against him. The 
sexual abuses of the despot, when he undertook to dishonor
