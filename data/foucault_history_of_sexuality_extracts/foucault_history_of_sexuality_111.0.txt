constitute the standard test of virtue. This figure was not 
unknown in antiquity, certainly; but it does seem that, for 
Greek thought, a more representative model of the virtue of 
moderation, one more expressive of the latter’s specific nature, 
was that of the man, the leader, the master who was capable 
of curbing his own appetite even when his power over others 
allowed him to indulge it as he pleased. 

2. What was affirmed through this conception of mastery 
as active freedom was the “virile” character of moderation. 
Just as in the household it was the man who ruled, and in the 
city it was right that only men should exercise power, and not 
slaves, children, or women, so each man was supposed to 
make his manly qualities prevail within himself. Self-mastery 
was a way of being a man with respect to oneself; that is, a way 
of commanding what needed commanding, of coercing what 
was not capable of self-direction, of imposing principles of

reason on what was wanting in reason; in short, it was a way 
of being active in relation to what was by nature passive and 
ought to remain so. In this ethics of men made for men, the 
development of the self as an ethical subject consisted in set¬ 
ting up a structure of virility that related oneself to oneself. It 
was by being a man with respect to oneself that one would be 
able to control and master the manly activity that one directed 
toward others in sexual practice. What one must aim for in the 
agonistic contest with oneself and in the struggle to control the 
desires was the point where the relationship with oneself 
would become isomorphic with the relationship of domi¬ 
nation, hierarchy, and authority that one expected, as a man, 
a free man, to establish over his inferiors; and it was this prior 
condition of “ethical virility” that provided one with the right 
sense of proportion for the exercise of “sexual virility,” ac¬ 
cording to a model of “social virility.” In the use of male 
pleasures, one had to be virile with regard to oneself, just as 
one was masculine in one’s social role. In the full meaning of 
the word, moderation was a man’s virtue. 

This does not mean of course that women were not expected 
to be moderate, that they were not capable of enkrateia, or 
that the virtue of sophrosyne was unknown to them. But where 
women were concerned, this virtue was always referred in
