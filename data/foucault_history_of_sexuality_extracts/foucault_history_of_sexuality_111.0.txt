constitute the standard test of virtue. This figure was not 
unknown in antiquity, certainly; but it does seem that, for 
Greek thought, a more representative model of the virtue of 
moderation, one more expressive of the latter’s specific nature, 
was that of the man, the leader, the master who was capable 
of curbing his own appetite even when his power over others 
allowed him to indulge it as he pleased. 

2. What was affirmed through this conception of mastery 
as active freedom was the “virile” character of moderation. 
Just as in the household it was the man who ruled, and in the 
city it was right that only men should exercise power, and not 
slaves, children, or women, so each man was supposed to 
make his manly qualities prevail within himself. Self-mastery 
was a way of being a man with respect to oneself; that is, a way 
of commanding what needed commanding, of coercing what 
was not capable of self-direction, of imposing principles of

reason on what was wanting in reason; in short, it was a way 
of being active in relation to what was by nature passive and 
ought to remain so. In this ethics of men made for men, the 
development of the self as an ethical subject consisted in set¬ 
ting up a structure of virility that related oneself to oneself. It 
was by being a man with respect to oneself that one would be 
able to control and master the manly activity that one directed 
toward others in sexual practice. What one must aim for in the 
agonistic contest with oneself and in the struggle to control the 
desires was the point where the relationship with oneself 
would become isomorphic with the relationship of domi¬ 
nation, hierarchy, and authority that one expected, as a man, 
a free man, to establish over his inferiors; and it was this prior 
condition of “ethical virility” that provided one with the right 
sense of proportion for the exercise of “sexual virility,” ac¬ 
cording to a model of “social virility.” In the use of male 
pleasures, one had to be virile with regard to oneself, just as 
one was masculine in one’s social role. In the full meaning of 
the word, moderation was a man’s virtue. 

This does not mean of course that women were not expected 
to be moderate, that they were not capable of enkrateia, or 
that the virtue of sophrosyne was unknown to them. But where 
women were concerned, this virtue was always referred in 
some way to virility. An institutional reference, since modera¬ 
tion was imposed on them by their condition of dependence 
in relation to their families, their husbands, and their procrea¬ 
tive function, which ensured the perpetuation of the family 
name, the transmission of wealth, and the survival of the city. 
But there was also a structural reference, since in order for a 
woman to be moderate, she had to establish a relationship of 
superiority and domination over herself that was virile by 
definition. It is significant that Socrates, in Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus, after hearing Ischomachus praise the merits of 
the wife he has himself educated, declares (not without first 
invoking the goddess of austere matrimony): “By Hera, Is¬ 
chomachus, you display your wife’s masculine understanding

[andrike dianoia ].” To which, in order to introduce the lesson 
in fastidious deportment he has given his wife, Ischomachus 
gives a reply that reveals the two essential elements of this 
virtuous virility of women—strength of character and depen¬ 
dence on the man: “There are other instances of her high¬ 
mindedness [megalophron ] that I am willing to relate to you, 
instances of her obeying me quickly in some matter after 
hearing it only once.” 12 

We know that Aristotle explicitly rejected the Socratic ar¬ 
gument for a basic unity of virtue, which implied that this was 
identical in men and women. And yet, he does not describe 
feminine virtues that would be exclusively feminine; those he 
attributes to women are defined with reference to one essential 
virtue, which achieves its full and complete form in men. And 
he sees the reason for this in the fact that the relation between 
men and women is “political”; it is the relation of ruler to 
ruled. For the relation to be in good order, both partners must 
have a share in the same virtues; but each will possess them 
in his own way. The one who rules—i.e., the man—“possesses 
moral goodness in its full and perfect form,” whereas the 
ruled, including women, need only have “moral goodness to 
the extent required of them.” As concerns the man, therefore, 
moderation and courage are a full and complete “ruling” 
virtue; as for the moderation or courage of the woman, they 
are “serving” virtues; in other words, the man stands both as 
a complete and finished model of these virtues and as the 
principle motivating their practice. 13
