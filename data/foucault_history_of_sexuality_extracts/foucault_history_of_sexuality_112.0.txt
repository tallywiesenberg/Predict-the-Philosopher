That moderation is given an essentially masculine structure 
has another consequence, which is symmetrical and opposite 
to the one just discussed: immoderation derives from a passiv¬ 
ity that relates it to femininity. To be immoderate was to be 
in a state of nonresistance with regard to the force of pleasures, 
and in a position of weakness and submission; it meant being 
incapable of that virile stance with respect to oneself that 
enabled one to be stronger than oneself. In this sense, the man 
of pleasures and desires, the man of nonmastery (akrasia) or 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

self-indulgence (akolasia) was a man who could be called 
feminine, but more essentially with respect to himself than 
with respect to others. In the experience of sexuality such as 
ours, where a basic scansion maintains an opposition between 
masculine and feminine, the femininity of men is perceived in 
the actual or virtual transgression of his sexual role. No one 
would be tempted to label as effeminate a man whose love for 
women leads to immoderation on his part; that is, short of 
doing a whole job of decipherment that would uncover the 
“latent homosexuality” that secretly inhabits his unstable and 
promiscuous relation to them. In contrast, for the Greeks it 
was the opposition between activity and passivity that was 
essential, pervading the domain of sexual behaviors and that 
of moral attitudes as well; thus, it was not hard to see how a 
man might prefer males without anyone even suspecting him 
of effeminacy, provided he was active in the sexual relation 
and active in the moral mastering of himself. On the other 
hand, a man who was not sufficiently in control of his pleas¬ 
ures—whatever his choice of object—was regarded as “femi¬ 
nine.” The dividing line between a virile man and an 
effeminate man did not coincide with our opposition between 
hetero- and homosexuality; nor was it confined to the opposi¬ 
tion between active and passive homosexuality. It marked the 
difference in people’s attitudes toward the pleasures; and the 
traditional signs of effeminacy—idleness, indolence, refusal to 
engage in the somewhat rough activities of sports, a fondness 
for perfumes and adornments, softness (malakia )—were not 
necessarily associated with the individual who in the nine¬ 
teenth century would be called an “invert,” but with the one 
who yielded to the pleasures that enticed him: he was under 
the power of his own appetites and those of others. On seeing 
a boy who was too dressed-up, Diogenes would get annoyed, 
but he allowed for the fact that such a feminine appearance 
could just as well betray a taste for women as for men. 14 In the 
eyes of the Greeks, what constituted ethical negativity par 
excellence was clearly not the loving of both sexes, nor was it

the preferring of one’s own sex over the other; it consisted in 
being passive with regard to the pleasures. 

3. This freedom-power combination that characterized 
the mode of being of the moderate man could not be conceived 
without a relation to truth. To rule one’s pleasures and to 
bring them under the authority of the logos formed one and 
the same enterprise: moderation, says Aristotle, desires only 
“what the rational principle [orthos logos ] directs.” 15 We are 
familiar with the long debate that developed concerning the 
role of knowledge in the practice of virtue in general and 
moderation in particular. Xenophon, in the Memorabilia, 
calls attention to Socrates’ argument to the effect that wisdom 
and moderation cannot be separated: to those who raise the 
possibility of one’s knowing what ought to be done and yet 
proceeding to do the contrary, Socrates replies that immoder¬ 
ate individuals are always ignorant as well, for in any case men 
“choose and follow the course which they judge most advanta¬ 
geous.” 16 These principles are discussed at length by Aristotle, 
without his critique ending a debate that would continue in 
and around Stoicism. But whether or not one granted the 
possibility of doing wrong while knowing it to be wrong, and 
whatever the mode of knowledge that one assumed in those 
who acted in defiance of the principles that they knew, there 
was one point that was not contested: one could not practice 
moderation without a certain form of knowledge that was at 
least one of its essential conditions. One could not form oneself 
as an ethical subject in the use of pleasures without forming 
oneself at the same time as a subject of knowledge. 

The relationship to the logos in the practice of pleasures was 
described by Greek philosophy of the fourth century in terms 
of three principal forms. First, there was a structural form: 
moderation implied that the logos be placed in a position of 
supremacy in the human being and that it be able to subdue 
the desires and regulate behavior. Whereas in the immoderate
