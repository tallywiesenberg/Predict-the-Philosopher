a boy who was too dressed-up, Diogenes would get annoyed, 
but he allowed for the fact that such a feminine appearance 
could just as well betray a taste for women as for men. 14 In the 
eyes of the Greeks, what constituted ethical negativity par 
excellence was clearly not the loving of both sexes, nor was it

The Use of Pleasure 


the preferring of one’s own sex over the other; it consisted in 
being passive with regard to the pleasures. 

3. This freedom-power combination that characterized 
the mode of being of the moderate man could not be conceived 
without a relation to truth. To rule one’s pleasures and to 
bring them under the authority of the logos formed one and 
the same enterprise: moderation, says Aristotle, desires only 
“what the rational principle [orthos logos ] directs.” 15 We are 
familiar with the long debate that developed concerning the 
role of knowledge in the practice of virtue in general and 
moderation in particular. Xenophon, in the Memorabilia, 
calls attention to Socrates’ argument to the effect that wisdom 
and moderation cannot be separated: to those who raise the 
possibility of one’s knowing what ought to be done and yet 
proceeding to do the contrary, Socrates replies that immoder¬ 
ate individuals are always ignorant as well, for in any case men 
“choose and follow the course which they judge most advanta¬ 
geous.” 16 These principles are discussed at length by Aristotle, 
without his critique ending a debate that would continue in 
and around Stoicism. But whether or not one granted the 
possibility of doing wrong while knowing it to be wrong, and 
whatever the mode of knowledge that one assumed in those 
who acted in defiance of the principles that they knew, there 
was one point that was not contested: one could not practice 
moderation without a certain form of knowledge that was at 
least one of its essential conditions. One could not form oneself 
as an ethical subject in the use of pleasures without forming 
oneself at the same time as a subject of knowledge. 

The relationship to the logos in the practice of pleasures was 
described by Greek philosophy of the fourth century in terms 
of three principal forms. First, there was a structural form: 
moderation implied that the logos be placed in a position of 
supremacy in the human being and that it be able to subdue 
the desires and regulate behavior. Whereas in the immoderate
