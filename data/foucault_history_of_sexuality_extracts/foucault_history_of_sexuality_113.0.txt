rules tyrannically, in the individual who is sophron, it is reason 
that commands and prescribes, in consonance with the struc¬ 
ture of the human being: “it is fitting that the reasonable part 
should rule,” Socrates says, “it being wise and exercising fore¬ 
sight on behalf of the whole soul”; and he proceeds to define 
the sophron as the man in whom the different parts of the soul 
are in agreement and harmony, when the part that commands 
and the part that obeys are at one in their recognition that it 
is proper for reason to rule and that they should not contend 
for its authority. 17 And in spite of all the differences that 
opposed the Platonic tripartition of the soul and the Aris¬ 
totelian conception at the time of the Nicomachean Ethics, it 
is still in terms of the superiority of reason over desire that 
sophrosyne is characterized in that text: “in an irrational being 
the desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it tries every source 
of gratification,” so that desire will grow excessive if one is not 
“chastened and made obedient to authority”; and this author¬ 
ity is that of the logos to which “the appetitive element” (to 
epithumetikon) must submit. 18 

But the exercise of the logos in the practice of moderation 
is also described in terms of an instrumental form. In fact, 
since one’s domination of the pleasures ensures a use that is 
adaptable to needs, times, and circumstances, a practical rea¬ 
son is necessary in order to determine, as Aristotle says, “the 
things he ought, as he ought, and when he ought.” 19 Plato 
emphasizes that it is important for the individual and for the 
city not to use the pleasures “without knowledge [anepistemon- 
ds] and at the wrong time [ ektos ton kairon]." 20 And from a 
similar viewpoint, Xenophon shows that the man of modera¬ 
tion is also the man of dialectics—competent to command and 
discuss, capable of being the best—for, as Socrates explains 
in the Memorabilia, “only the self-controlled have power to 
consider things that matter most, and sorting them out after 
their kind, by word and deed alike to prefer the good and re¬ 
ject the evil.” 21 

In Plato the exercise of the logos in the practice of modera-

The Use of Pleasure 


tion appears in a third form: that of the ontological recogni¬ 
tion of the self by the self. The need to know oneself in order 
to practice virtue and subdue the desires is a Socratic theme. 
But a text like the great speech in the Phaedrus, telling of the 
voyage of souls and the birth of love, fills in the details. This 
text is doubtless the first description in ancient literature of 
what will later be known as “spiritual combat.” Here one is 
far from the impassiveness and the feats of endurance and 
abstinence of the sort that Socrates was able to display accord¬ 
ing to Alcibiades of the Symposium, for the Phaedrus presents 
a whole drama of the soul struggling with itself and against 
the violence of its desires. These different elements were des¬ 
tined to have a long career in the history of spirituality: the 
distress that takes hold of the soul, so alien that the latter 
cannot even give it a name; the anxiety that keeps the soul on 
the alert; the mysterious seething; the suffering and pleasure 
that alternate and intermix; the movement that transports 
one’s being; the struggle between opposing powers; the lapses, 
the wounds, the pains, the reward and the final appeasement. 
Now, throughout this narrative that claims to reveal the true 
nature of the human and divine soul, the relation to truth 
plays a fundamental role. When the soul is caught up in a 
frenzy of love, driven wild and deprived of self-control, it is 
indeed because it had beheld “the realities that are outside the 
heavens” and perceived their reflection in an earthly beauty; 
but it is also because its memories carry it “towards the reality 
of Beauty,” and because it “sees her again enthroned in her 
holy place attended by Chastity,” that it holds back, that it 
undertakes to restrain physical desire and seeks to rid itself of 
everything that might burden it down and prevent it from 
rediscovering the truth that it has seen. 22 The relation of the 
soul to truth is at the same time what founds Eros in its 
movement, its force, and its intensity, and what helps it to 
become detached from all physical enjoyment, enabling it to 
become true love. 

The point is obvious: be it in the form of a hierarchical
