rules tyrannically, in the individual who is sophron, it is reason 
that commands and prescribes, in consonance with the struc¬ 
ture of the human being: “it is fitting that the reasonable part 
should rule,” Socrates says, “it being wise and exercising fore¬ 
sight on behalf of the whole soul”; and he proceeds to define 
the sophron as the man in whom the different parts of the soul 
are in agreement and harmony, when the part that commands 
and the part that obeys are at one in their recognition that it 
is proper for reason to rule and that they should not contend 
for its authority. 17 And in spite of all the differences that 
opposed the Platonic tripartition of the soul and the Aris¬ 
totelian conception at the time of the Nicomachean Ethics, it 
is still in terms of the superiority of reason over desire that 
sophrosyne is characterized in that text: “in an irrational being 
the desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it tries every source 
of gratification,” so that desire will grow excessive if one is not 
“chastened and made obedient to authority”; and this author¬ 
ity is that of the logos to which “the appetitive element” (to 
epithumetikon) must submit. 18 

But the exercise of the logos in the practice of moderation 
is also described in terms of an instrumental form. In fact, 
since one’s domination of the pleasures ensures a use that is 
adaptable to needs, times, and circumstances, a practical rea¬ 
son is necessary in order to determine, as Aristotle says, “the 
things he ought, as he ought, and when he ought.” 19 Plato 
emphasizes that it is important for the individual and for the 
city not to use the pleasures “without knowledge [anepistemon- 
ds] and at the wrong time [ ektos ton kairon]." 20 And from a 
similar viewpoint, Xenophon shows that the man of modera¬ 
tion is also the man of dialectics—competent to command and 
discuss, capable of being the best—for, as Socrates explains 
in the Memorabilia, “only the self-controlled have power to 
consider things that matter most, and sorting them out after 
their kind, by word and deed alike to prefer the good and re¬ 
ject the evil.” 21 

In Plato the exercise of the logos in the practice of modera-
