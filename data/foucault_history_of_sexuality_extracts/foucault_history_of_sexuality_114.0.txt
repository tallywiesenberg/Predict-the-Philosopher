structure of the human being, in the form of a practice of 
prudence or of the soul’s recognition of its own being, the 
relation to truth constituted an essential element of modera¬ 
tion. It was necessary for the measured use of pleasures, neces¬ 
sary for controlling their violence. But it is important to note 
that this relation to truth never took the form of a decipher¬ 
ment of the self by the self, never that of a hermeneutics of 
desire. It was a factor constituting the mode of being of the 
moderate subject; it was not equivalent to an obligation for the 
subject to speak truthfully concerning himself; it never opened 
up the soul as a domain of potential knowledge where barely 
discernible traces of desire needed to be read and interpreted. 
The relation to truth was a structural, instrumental, and onto¬ 
logical condition for establishing the individual as a moderate 
subject leading a life of moderation; it was not an epistemolog¬ 
ical condition enabling the individual to recognize himself in 
his singularity as a desiring subject and to purify himself of the 
desire that was thus brought to light. 

4. Now, while this relation to truth, constitutive of the 
moderate subject, did not lead to a hermeneutics of desire, it 
did on the other hand open onto an aesthetics of existence. 
And what I mean by this is a way of life whose moral value 
did not depend either on one’s being in conformity with a code 
of behavior, or on an effort of purification, but on certain 
formal principles in the use of pleasures, in the way one dis¬ 
tributed them, in the limits one observed, in the hierarchy one 
respected. Through the logos, through reason and the relation 
to truth that governed it, such a life was committed to the 
maintenance and reproduction of an ontological order; more¬ 
over, it took on the brilliance of a beauty that was revealed to 
those able to behold it or keep its memory present in mind. 
Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle often provide glimpses of this 
moderate existence whose hallmark, grounded in truth, was 
both its regard for an ontological structure and its visibly 
beautiful shape. For example, this is the way Socrates de-
