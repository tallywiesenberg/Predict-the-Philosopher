structure of the human being, in the form of a practice of 
prudence or of the soul’s recognition of its own being, the 
relation to truth constituted an essential element of modera¬ 
tion. It was necessary for the measured use of pleasures, neces¬ 
sary for controlling their violence. But it is important to note 
that this relation to truth never took the form of a decipher¬ 
ment of the self by the self, never that of a hermeneutics of 
desire. It was a factor constituting the mode of being of the 
moderate subject; it was not equivalent to an obligation for the 
subject to speak truthfully concerning himself; it never opened 
up the soul as a domain of potential knowledge where barely 
discernible traces of desire needed to be read and interpreted. 
The relation to truth was a structural, instrumental, and onto¬ 
logical condition for establishing the individual as a moderate 
subject leading a life of moderation; it was not an epistemolog¬ 
ical condition enabling the individual to recognize himself in 
his singularity as a desiring subject and to purify himself of the 
desire that was thus brought to light. 

4. Now, while this relation to truth, constitutive of the 
moderate subject, did not lead to a hermeneutics of desire, it 
did on the other hand open onto an aesthetics of existence. 
And what I mean by this is a way of life whose moral value 
did not depend either on one’s being in conformity with a code 
of behavior, or on an effort of purification, but on certain 
formal principles in the use of pleasures, in the way one dis¬ 
tributed them, in the limits one observed, in the hierarchy one 
respected. Through the logos, through reason and the relation 
to truth that governed it, such a life was committed to the 
maintenance and reproduction of an ontological order; more¬ 
over, it took on the brilliance of a beauty that was revealed to 
those able to behold it or keep its memory present in mind. 
Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle often provide glimpses of this 
moderate existence whose hallmark, grounded in truth, was 
both its regard for an ontological structure and its visibly 
beautiful shape. For example, this is the way Socrates de-

The Use of Pleasure 


scribes it in the Gorgias, supplying his own answers to the 
questions he puts to a silent Callicles: “The virtue of each 
thing, a tool, a body, and, further, a soul and a whole animal, 
doesn’t come to be present in the best way just at random, but 
by some structure and correctness and craft [taxis, orthotes, 
techne ], the one that is assigned to each of them. Is this so? 
I say so. Then the virtue of each thing is something structured 
and ordered by a structure? I would say so myself. Then it is 
some order [kosmos tis] —the proper order for each of the 
things that are—which makes the thing good by coming to be 
present in it? I myself think so. Then a soul with its proper 
order is better than a disordered soul? It must be. But now the 
soul which has order is orderly? Of course it is. And the 
orderly soul is temperate? It certainly must be. Then the tem¬ 
perate soul is good. . . . And so I set these things down this 
way, and say that these things are true. And if they are true, 
then apparently the man who wants to be happy must pursue 
and practice temperance [diokteon kai asketeon]." 2i 

As if echoing this text that links moderation with the beauty 
of a soul whose order corresponds to its real nature, the Re¬ 
public will show, conversely, how the brilliance of a soul and 
that of a body are incompatible with the excess and violence 
of the pleasures: “When a man’s soul has a beautiful character 
[kala ethe ], and his body matches it in beauty and is thus in 
harmony with it, that harmonizing combination, sharing the 
same mould, is the most beautiful spectacle for anyone who 
has eyes to see.” “It certainly is.” “And that which is most 
beautiful is most lovable [< erasmiotaton ].” “Of course. . . .” 
“Tell me this, however, is excessive pleasure compatible with 
moderation?” “How can it be since it drives one to frenzy?” 
“Or with the other virtues?” “In no way.” “Well then, is it 
compatible with violence and lack of restraint [hubris, 
akolasia]T' “Very much so.” “Can you think of a greater and 
sharper pleasure than the sexual?” “No, nor a madder one.” 
“But the right kind of love [ho orthos eros ] is to love a well- 
behaved and beautiful person with moderation and restraint?”

“Certainly.” “The right kind of love has nothing frenzied or 
licentious about it?” “Nothing.” 24 

We may also recall Xenophon’s idealized description of 
Cyrus’ court, which presented a vision of beauty for its own 
enjoyment, due to the perfect dominion that each individual
