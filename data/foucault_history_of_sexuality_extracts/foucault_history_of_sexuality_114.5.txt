thing, a tool, a body, and, further, a soul and a whole animal, 
doesn’t come to be present in the best way just at random, but 
by some structure and correctness and craft [taxis, orthotes, 
techne ], the one that is assigned to each of them. Is this so? 
I say so. Then the virtue of each thing is something structured 
and ordered by a structure? I would say so myself. Then it is 
some order [kosmos tis] —the proper order for each of the 
things that are—which makes the thing good by coming to be 
present in it? I myself think so. Then a soul with its proper 
order is better than a disordered soul? It must be. But now the 
soul which has order is orderly? Of course it is. And the 
orderly soul is temperate? It certainly must be. Then the tem¬ 
perate soul is good. . . . And so I set these things down this 
way, and say that these things are true. And if they are true, 
then apparently the man who wants to be happy must pursue 
and practice temperance [diokteon kai asketeon]." 2i 

As if echoing this text that links moderation with the beauty 
of a soul whose order corresponds to its real nature, the Re¬ 
public will show, conversely, how the brilliance of a soul and 
that of a body are incompatible with the excess and violence 
of the pleasures: “When a man’s soul has a beautiful character 
[kala ethe ], and his body matches it in beauty and is thus in 
harmony with it, that harmonizing combination, sharing the 
same mould, is the most beautiful spectacle for anyone who 
has eyes to see.” “It certainly is.” “And that which is most 
beautiful is most lovable [< erasmiotaton ].” “Of course. . . .” 
“Tell me this, however, is excessive pleasure compatible with 
moderation?” “How can it be since it drives one to frenzy?” 
“Or with the other virtues?” “In no way.” “Well then, is it 
compatible with violence and lack of restraint [hubris, 
akolasia]T' “Very much so.” “Can you think of a greater and 
sharper pleasure than the sexual?” “No, nor a madder one.” 
“But the right kind of love [ho orthos eros ] is to love a well- 
behaved and beautiful person with moderation and restraint?”

“Certainly.” “The right kind of love has nothing frenzied or 
licentious about it?” “Nothing.” 24 

We may also recall Xenophon’s idealized description of 
Cyrus’ court, which presented a vision of beauty for its own 
enjoyment, due to the perfect dominion that each individual
