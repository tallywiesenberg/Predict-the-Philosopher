exercised over himself; the ruler publicly exhibited a mastery 
and a restraint that spread to everyone, issuing out from them, 
according to the rank they held, in the form of a moderate 
conduct, a respect for oneself and for others, a caref ul supervi¬ 
sion of the soul and the body, and a frugal economy of acts, 
so that no involuntary and violent movement disturbed the 
beautiful order that seemed to be present in everyone’s mind: 
“Among them you would never have detected any one raising 
his voice in anger or giving vent to his delight in boisterous 
laughter; but on seeing them you would have judged that they 
were in truth making a noble life their aim. ” 25 The individual 
fulfilled himself as an ethical subject by shaping a precisely 
measured conduct that was plainly visible to all and deserving 
to be long remembered. 

The foregoing is only a rough sketch for preliminary pur¬ 
poses; a few general traits that characterized the way in which, 
in classical Greek thought, sexual practice was conceptualized 
and made into an ethical domain. The elements of this domain 
—the “ethical substance”—were formed by the aphrodisia; 
that is, by acts intended by nature, associated by nature with 
an intense pleasure, and naturally motivated by a force that 
was always liable to excess and rebellion. The principle ac¬ 
cording to which this activity was meant to be regulated, the 
“mode of subjection,” was not defined by a universal legisla¬ 
tion determining permitted and forbidden acts; but rather by 
a savoir-faire, an art that prescribed the modalities of a use 
that depended on different variables (need, time, status). The 
effort that the individual was urged to bring to bear on himself, 
the necessary ascesis, had the form of a battle to be fought, a 
victory to be won in establishing a dominion of self over self,

modeled after domestic or political authority. Finally, the 
mode of being to which this self-mastery gave access was 
characterized as an active freedom, a freedom that was indis- 
sociable from a structural, instrumental, and ontological rela¬ 
tion to truth. 

As we shall see, this moral reflection developed themes of 
austerity—concerning the body, marriage, and love of boys— 
that show a resemblance to the precepts and interdictions that 
were to appear later on. But we must not let this apparent
