exercised over himself; the ruler publicly exhibited a mastery 
and a restraint that spread to everyone, issuing out from them, 
according to the rank they held, in the form of a moderate 
conduct, a respect for oneself and for others, a caref ul supervi¬ 
sion of the soul and the body, and a frugal economy of acts, 
so that no involuntary and violent movement disturbed the 
beautiful order that seemed to be present in everyone’s mind: 
“Among them you would never have detected any one raising 
his voice in anger or giving vent to his delight in boisterous 
laughter; but on seeing them you would have judged that they 
were in truth making a noble life their aim. ” 25 The individual 
fulfilled himself as an ethical subject by shaping a precisely 
measured conduct that was plainly visible to all and deserving 
to be long remembered. 

The foregoing is only a rough sketch for preliminary pur¬ 
poses; a few general traits that characterized the way in which, 
in classical Greek thought, sexual practice was conceptualized 
and made into an ethical domain. The elements of this domain 
—the “ethical substance”—were formed by the aphrodisia; 
that is, by acts intended by nature, associated by nature with 
an intense pleasure, and naturally motivated by a force that 
was always liable to excess and rebellion. The principle ac¬ 
cording to which this activity was meant to be regulated, the 
“mode of subjection,” was not defined by a universal legisla¬ 
tion determining permitted and forbidden acts; but rather by 
a savoir-faire, an art that prescribed the modalities of a use 
that depended on different variables (need, time, status). The 
effort that the individual was urged to bring to bear on himself, 
the necessary ascesis, had the form of a battle to be fought, a 
victory to be won in establishing a dominion of self over self,

The Use of Pleasure 


modeled after domestic or political authority. Finally, the 
mode of being to which this self-mastery gave access was 
characterized as an active freedom, a freedom that was indis- 
sociable from a structural, instrumental, and ontological rela¬ 
tion to truth. 

As we shall see, this moral reflection developed themes of 
austerity—concerning the body, marriage, and love of boys— 
that show a resemblance to the precepts and interdictions that 
were to appear later on. But we must not let this apparent 
continuity obscure the fact that the ethical subject would no 
longer be constituted in the same manner. In the Christian 
morality of sexual behavior, the ethical substance was to be 
defined not by the aphrodisia, but by a domain of desires that lie 
hidden among the mysteries of the heart, and by a set of acts 
that are carefully specified as to their form and their conditions. 
Subjection was to take the form not of a savoir-faire, but of a 
recognition of the law and an obedience to pastoral authority. 
Hence the ethical subject was to be characterized not so much 
by the perf ect rule of the self by the self in the exercise of a virile 
type of activity, as by self-renunciation and a purity whose 
model was to be sought in virginity. This being the case, one can 
understand the significance that was attached, in Christian 
morality, to two opposite yet complementary practices: a 
codification of sexual acts that would become more and more 
specific, and the development of a hermeneutics of desire to¬ 
gether with procedures of self-decipherment. 

Putting it schematically, we could say that classical antiq¬ 
uity’s moral reflection concerning the pleasures was not di¬ 
rected toward a codification of acts, nor toward a hermeneutics 
of the subject, but toward a stylization of attitudes and an 
aesthetics of existence. A stylization, because the rarefaction of 
sexual activity presented itself as a sort of open-ended require¬ 
ment. The textual record is clear in this regard: neither the 
doctors who made recommendations about the regimen one 
should follow, nor the moralists who demanded that husbands 
respect their wives, nor those who gave advice concerning the 
right conduct to manifest in the love of boys, ever say exactly 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

what ought or ought not to be done in the way of sexual acts or 
practices. And it is very unlikely that this was owing to the 
authors’ reticence or sense of shame; rather, it was because the 
problem was elsewhere: sexual moderation was an exercise of 
freedom that took form in self-mastery; and the latter was 
shown in the manner in which the subject behaved, in the 
self-restraint he displayed in his virile activity, in the way he 
related to himself in the relationship he had with others. It was 
this attitude—much more than the acts one committed or the 
desires one concealed—that made one liable to value judg¬ 
ments. A moral value that was also an aesthetic value and a 
truth value since it was by aiming at the satisfaction of real
