needs, by respecting the true hierarchy of the human being, and 
by never forgetting where one stood in regard to truth, that one 
would be able to give one’s conduct the form that would assure 
one of a name meriting remembrance. 

Now we will see how some of the great themes of sexual 
austerity—themes that would have a historical destiny ex¬ 
tending well beyond Greek culture—were formed and elabo¬ 
rated in the thought of the fourth century. I will not start from 
the general theories of pleasure and virtue; rather, I will take 
as my source material the existing and recognized practices by 
which men sought to shape their conduct: their dietary prac¬ 
tice, their practice of domestic government, their courtship 
practice as expressed in amorous behavior. I will try to show 
how these three practices were conceptualized in medicine or 
philosophy and how these reflections resulted in various 
recommendations, not for codifying sexual conduct in a pre¬ 
cise way, but for “stylizing” it: stylizations within dietetics, 
understood as an art of the everyday relationship of the indi¬ 
vidual with his body; in economics as an art of a man’s behav¬ 
ior as head of a family; and in erotics as an art of the reciprocal 
conduct of a man and a boy in a love relationship.* 

•Henri Joly’s work Le Renversement platonicien offers an example of how Greek 
thought can be analyzed from the standpoint of the relationships that existed between 
the field of practices and philosophical reflection. 




PART TWO 

Dietetics 





The moral reflection of the Greeks on sexual behavior did 
not seek to justify interdictions, but to stylize a freedom—that 
freedom which the “free” man exercised in his activity. This 
produced a state of affairs that might well seem paradoxical 
at first glance: the Greeks practiced, accepted, and valued 
relations between men and boys; and yet their philosophers 
dealt with the subject by conceiving and elaborating an ethics 
of abstention. They were quite willing to grant that a married 
man might go in search of sexual pleasures outside of mar¬ 
riage, and yet their moralists conceived the principle of a 
matrimonial life in which the husband would have relations 
only with his own wife. They never imagined that sexual 
pleasure was in itself an evil or that it could be counted among 
the natural stigmata of a transgression; and yet their doctors 
worried over the relationship between sexual activity and 
health, and they developed an entire theory concerning the 
dangers of sexual practice. 

Let us begin by considering this last point. First of all, it 
should be noted that f or the most part their reflection was not 
concerned with analyzing the different pathological effects of 
sexual activity; nor did they seek to organize this behavior as 
a domain in which normal behavior might be distinguished 
from abnormal and pathological practices. These themes were 
not totally absent of course. But this was not what constituted 
the general theme of the inquiry into the relationships between 
the aphrodisia, health, life, and death. The main objective of 
this reflection was to define the use of pleasures—which condi¬ 
tions were favorable, which practice was recommended, 
which rarefaction was necessary—in terms of a certain way of 
caring for one’s body. The preoccupation was much more

“dietetic” than “therapeutic”: a matter of regimen aimed 
at regulating an activity that was recognized as being impor¬ 
tant for health. The medical problematization of sexual be¬ 
havior was accomplished less out of a concern for eliminating 
pathological forms than out of a desire to integrate it as 
fully as possible into the management of health and the 
life of the body.
