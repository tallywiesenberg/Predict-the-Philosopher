needs, by respecting the true hierarchy of the human being, and 
by never forgetting where one stood in regard to truth, that one 
would be able to give one’s conduct the form that would assure 
one of a name meriting remembrance. 

Now we will see how some of the great themes of sexual 
austerity—themes that would have a historical destiny ex¬ 
tending well beyond Greek culture—were formed and elabo¬ 
rated in the thought of the fourth century. I will not start from 
the general theories of pleasure and virtue; rather, I will take 
as my source material the existing and recognized practices by 
which men sought to shape their conduct: their dietary prac¬ 
tice, their practice of domestic government, their courtship 
practice as expressed in amorous behavior. I will try to show 
how these three practices were conceptualized in medicine or 
philosophy and how these reflections resulted in various 
recommendations, not for codifying sexual conduct in a pre¬ 
cise way, but for “stylizing” it: stylizations within dietetics, 
understood as an art of the everyday relationship of the indi¬ 
vidual with his body; in economics as an art of a man’s behav¬ 
ior as head of a family; and in erotics as an art of the reciprocal 
conduct of a man and a boy in a love relationship.* 

•Henri Joly’s work Le Renversement platonicien offers an example of how Greek 
thought can be analyzed from the standpoint of the relationships that existed between 
the field of practices and philosophical reflection.

Dietetics 





The moral reflection of the Greeks on sexual behavior did 
not seek to justify interdictions, but to stylize a freedom—that 
freedom which the “free” man exercised in his activity. This 
produced a state of affairs that might well seem paradoxical 
at first glance: the Greeks practiced, accepted, and valued 
relations between men and boys; and yet their philosophers 
dealt with the subject by conceiving and elaborating an ethics 
of abstention. They were quite willing to grant that a married 
man might go in search of sexual pleasures outside of mar¬ 
riage, and yet their moralists conceived the principle of a 
matrimonial life in which the husband would have relations 
only with his own wife. They never imagined that sexual
