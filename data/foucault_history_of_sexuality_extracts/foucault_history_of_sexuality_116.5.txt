pleasure was in itself an evil or that it could be counted among 
the natural stigmata of a transgression; and yet their doctors 
worried over the relationship between sexual activity and 
health, and they developed an entire theory concerning the 
dangers of sexual practice. 

Let us begin by considering this last point. First of all, it
