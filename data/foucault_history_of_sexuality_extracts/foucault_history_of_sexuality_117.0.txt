gave to “dietetics” and the way in which they linked its prac¬ 
tice to medicine, we can refer to two origin stories: one is 
found in the Hippocratic collection, the other in Plato. 

The author of the treatise on Ancient Medicine, far from 
considering regimen as an adjacent practice associated with 
the medical art—one of its applications or extensions—attrib¬ 
utes the birth of medicine to a primordial and essential preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen. 1 According to him, mankind set itself 
apart from animal life by means of sort of dietary disjunction. 
In the beginning, the story goes, men did eat the same kind 
of food as animals: meat and raw plants. This type of nourish¬ 
ment was apt to toughen the most vigorous individuals, but 
it was hard on the weaker ones; in a word, people died young 
or old. Consequently, men sought a diet that was better suited 
“to their nature”: it was this regimen that still characterized 
the present way of life. But with this milder diet, illness had 
become less immediately fatal, and it was realized that the 
food healthy people ate was not suited to people who were ill: 
they needed other nourishment. Medicine thus came into 
being as an appropriate “diet” for the sick, emerging from a 
search for the specific regimen for their condition. In this tale 
of genesis, it is dietetics that appears to be initial; it gives rise 
to medicine as one of its particular applications.

The Use of Pleasure 


Plato—being rather suspicious of dietetic practice, or at 
least fearful of the excesses he associates with it, for political 
and ethical reasons we shall consider below—thinks, on the 
contrary, that the concern with regimen was born of a change 
in medical practices: 2 in the beginning, the god Asclepius 
taught men how to cure illnesses and heal wounds by means 
of drastic and effective remedies. According to Plato, Homer 
provides evidence of this practice of simple treatments in the 
account he gives of the cures of Menelaus and Eurypylus 
beneath the walls of Troy: the blood of the wounded was 
sucked, emollients were poured over their wounds, and they 
were made to drink wine sprinkled with barley meal and 
grated cheese.* It was later, when men had forsaken the 
rough, healthy life of former times, that one would attempt to
