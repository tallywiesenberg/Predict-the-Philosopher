gave to “dietetics” and the way in which they linked its prac¬ 
tice to medicine, we can refer to two origin stories: one is 
found in the Hippocratic collection, the other in Plato. 

The author of the treatise on Ancient Medicine, far from 
considering regimen as an adjacent practice associated with 
the medical art—one of its applications or extensions—attrib¬ 
utes the birth of medicine to a primordial and essential preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen. 1 According to him, mankind set itself 
apart from animal life by means of sort of dietary disjunction. 
In the beginning, the story goes, men did eat the same kind 
of food as animals: meat and raw plants. This type of nourish¬ 
ment was apt to toughen the most vigorous individuals, but 
it was hard on the weaker ones; in a word, people died young 
or old. Consequently, men sought a diet that was better suited 
“to their nature”: it was this regimen that still characterized 
the present way of life. But with this milder diet, illness had 
become less immediately fatal, and it was realized that the 
food healthy people ate was not suited to people who were ill: 
they needed other nourishment. Medicine thus came into 
being as an appropriate “diet” for the sick, emerging from a 
search for the specific regimen for their condition. In this tale 
of genesis, it is dietetics that appears to be initial; it gives rise 
to medicine as one of its particular applications.

The Use of Pleasure 


Plato—being rather suspicious of dietetic practice, or at 
least fearful of the excesses he associates with it, for political 
and ethical reasons we shall consider below—thinks, on the 
contrary, that the concern with regimen was born of a change 
in medical practices: 2 in the beginning, the god Asclepius 
taught men how to cure illnesses and heal wounds by means 
of drastic and effective remedies. According to Plato, Homer 
provides evidence of this practice of simple treatments in the 
account he gives of the cures of Menelaus and Eurypylus 
beneath the walls of Troy: the blood of the wounded was 
sucked, emollients were poured over their wounds, and they 
were made to drink wine sprinkled with barley meal and 
grated cheese.* It was later, when men had forsaken the 
rough, healthy life of former times, that one would attempt to 
follow illnesses “step by step” and, by means of a protracted 
regimen, to sustain those who were in bad health precisely 
because, no longer living as they should, they were victims of 
lasting sicknesses. According to this genesis, dietetics came 
into existence as a kind of medicine for soft times; it was 
designed for mismanaged lives that sought to prolong them¬ 
selves. But it is clear that if, for Plato, dietetics was not an 
original art, this was not because regimen (diaite) was unim¬ 
portant; the reason people did not concern themselves with 
dietetics in the time of Asclepius or his first successors was 
that the “regimen” that men actually followed, the manner in 
which they nourished themselves and exercised their bodies, 
was in accord with nature. 4 Viewed from this perspective, 
dietetics did represent one modality in medicine, but it did not 
become an extension of the art of healing until the day when 
regimen as a way of life became separated from nature; and 
while it always constituted a necessary accompaniment of 
medicine, this was simply because one could not treat a person 
without rectifying the lifestyle that made him sick in the first 
place. 5

Dietetics

In any case, whether dietetic knowledge was considered an 
original art or seen as a later derivation, it is clear that “diet” 
itself—regimen—was a fundamental category through which 
human behavior could be conceptualized. It characterized the 
way in which one managed one’s existence, and it enabled a 
set of rules to be affixed to conduct; it was a mode of prob- 
lematization of behavior that was indexed to a nature which 
had to be preserved and to which it was right to conform. 
Regimen was a whole art of living. 

1. The area that a properly designed regimen ought to 
cover was defined by a list that became almost conventional 
as time went on. It is the list found in Book VI of the Epidem¬ 
ics; it included “exercises \ponoi\ foods [sitia], drinks \pota ], 
sleep [hypnoi], and sexual relations [aphrodisia ]"—everything 
that needed to be “measured.” 6 Among the exercises, those 
that were natural (walking, strolling) were distinguished from 
those that were violent (foot races, wrestling); and it was
