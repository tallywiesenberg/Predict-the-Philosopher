determined which ones ought to be practiced and with what 
intensity, depending on the time of day, the season of the year, 
the age of the subject, the food he had consumed. Exercises 
might be combined with baths—hot or cold, and also depend¬ 
ing on season, age, activities, and meals already eaten or to be 
prepared. The alimentary regimen—food and drink—had to 
take into consideration the nature and quantity of what one 
ingested, the general condition of the body, the climate, and 
the activities one engaged in. Evacuations—purges and vomit¬ 
ing—served to correct alimentary practice and its excesses. 
Sleep, too, comprised different components, which could be 
made to vary according to the regimen: the time allotted to it, 
the hours one chose, the quality of the bed, its hardness, its 
warmth. Hence regimen had to take account of numerous 
elements in the physical life of a man, or at least that of a free 
man, and this meant day by day, all day long, from getting up 
in the morning to going to bed at night. When broken down 
into its component parts, regimen looks like a real daily rou-

tine: thus the regimen suggested by Diodes follows the course 
of an ordinary day, moment by moment, from waking up on 
through to the evening meal and the onset of sleep, with 
attention given along the way to the very first exercises, the 
ablutions and massagings of the body and the head, the walks, 
the private activities and the gymnasium, lunch, napping, and 
another round of walking and gymnasium activities, oiling 
and massage, dinner. At all times, and encompassing all of a 
man’s activities, regimen problematized the relation to the 
body and developed a way of living whose forms, options, and 
variables were determined by a concern with the body. But the 
body was not the only thing in question. 

2. In the different areas where it was required, regimen 
needed to establish a measure: “even a pig would know,” says 
one of the interlocutors in the Platonic dialogue The Lovers: 
“in everything connected with the body,” what is useful is 
“the right measure,” and not what is large or small in quan¬ 
tity. 7 Now, this measure is to be understood as referring not 
only to the corporal realm but to the moral realm as well. The 
Pythagoreans, who doubtless played an important part in the 
development of dietetics, strongly emphasized the correlation 
between the care given the body and the concern for preserv¬ 
ing the purity and harmony of the soul. While it is true that 
they expected medicine to purge the body and music to cleanse 
the soul, they also credited song and instruments with benefi¬ 
cial effects on the equilibrium of the organism. 8 The many 
alimentary taboos they set for themselves had cultural and 
religious significance; and the criticism they directed against 
every abuse connected with eating, drinking, exercises, and 
sexual activities had both the authority of a moral precept and 
the utility of sound advice for health.* 

*“For bodily ailments, he had curative tunes which he sang that got sick people on 
their feet again. Others made one forget pain, calmed fits of anger, drove out immod¬ 
erate desires. Now for his diet: for lunch honey, for dinner a biscuit and vegetables, 
meat infrequently. ... In this way his body kept the same condition, as if on a straight 
line, without being sometimes healthy, sometimes sick, and without growing heavier

Even outside the strictly Pythagorean context, regimen was 
regularly defined with reference to these two associated di¬ 
mensions of good health maintenance and proper care of the 
soul. This was because the one implied the other, but also 
because the resolve to follow a measured and reasonable regi¬ 
men and the diligence one manifested in the actual task were 
themselves evidence of an indispensable moral fortitude. 
Xenophon’s Socrates calls attention to this correlation when 
he advises young people to exercise their bodies regularly by 
practicing gymnastics. He sees this as a means of ensuring that 
they will be able to defend themselves better in warfare, to 
avoid earning a coward’s reputation as a soldier, to best serve 
their native land, and to obtain high rewards (and hence to 
bequeath wealth and status to their descendants). He believes 
the practice will provide protection against illnesses and infir¬ 
mities of the body; but he also points up the good effects of 
gymnastics that accrue, he says, where one would least expect 
to see them: in the mind, for an unhealthy body causes forget¬ 
fulness, loss of courage, bad temper, and madness, so that in 
the end the knowledge one has acquired may even be dis¬ 
lodged from the soul. 10 

But it was also the case that the severity of a physical 
regimen, with the determination that was required in order to 
keep to it, called for an essential moral firmness, which made 
its observance possible. Moreover, as Plato saw it, this was the
