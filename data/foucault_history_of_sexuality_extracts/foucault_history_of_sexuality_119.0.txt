real justification for these practices by which one sought to 
acquire strength, beauty, and physical health. Not only will 
the judicious man, says Socrates in Book IX of the Republic, 
“not abandon his body to the irrational pleasure of the beast”; 
not only will he not “turn himself that way”; he will do more: 
“It is not even health he aims at, nor does he consider it 
important that he should be strong, healthy, or beautiful, 
unless he acquires moderation as a result.” The physical regi- 

and stouter, then thinner and leaner; and by his expression, his soul always showed 
the same character [to homoion ethos].” It seems that Pythagoras also gave advice 
on regimen to athletes.’

The Use of Pleasure 


men ought to accord with the principle of a general aesthetics 
of existence in which the equilibrium of the body was one of 
the conditions of the proper hierarchy of the soul: “He will 
cultivate harmony in his body for the sake of consonance in 
his soul”—which will enable him to conduct himself like a 
true musician (mousikos). 11 Physical regimen must not, there¬ 
fore, be too intensely cultivated for its own sake. 

The possibility of a danger in the very practice of “diet” was 
readily acknowledged. For if the aim of regimen was to pre¬ 
vent excesses, one might exaggerate the importance one lent 
to it and the autonomy one permitted it to assume. This risk 
was generally perceived as having two forms. There was the 
danger of what might be called “athletic” excess; this was due 
to repeated workouts that overdeveloped the body and ended 
by making the soul sluggish, enveloped as it was within a 
too-powerful musculature; on several occasions Plato finds 
fault with this athletic forcing, declaring that he would want 
nothing of the sort for the young people of his city.* 

But there was also the danger of what could be called 
“valetudinary” excess; that is, the constant vigilance that one 
applied to one’s body, one’s health, to the least ailment. The 
best example of this excess was furnished, according to Plato, 
by an individual held to be one of the founders of dietetics, 
Herodicus the trainer; entirely taken up in the effort to avoid 
breaking the least rule of the regimen he had imposed on 
himself, he “trained” away for years, while living the life of 
a dying man. This attitude drew two reproaches from Plato. 
It was characteristic of idle men who were of no use to the city; 
there was a telling comparison that could be made with those 
serious craftsmen who would not stop to swathe their heads 
on account of a migraine, for they had no time to lose in petty 
medical treatments. But it was also characteristic of those 
who, in order to keep from losing their hold on life, tried their

utmost to delay the term that had been appointed by nature. 
The practice carried the danger—moral but political as well 
—of exaggerating one’s care of the body (peritte epimeleia tou 
somatos ). 13 Asclepius, whose treatment was confined to po¬ 
tions and surgery, was politically astute: he knew that in a 
well-governed state, no one had the leisure to spend his life 
being sick and having himself treated* 

3. The distrust of excessive regimens shows that the pur¬ 
pose of diet was not to extend life as far as possible in time nor as 
high as possible in performance, but rather to make it useful 
and happy within the limits that had been set for it. Nor was 
diet supposed to determine the conditions of existence once and 
for all. A regimen was not good if it only permitted one to live in 
one place, with one type of food, and if it did not allow one to be 
open to any change. The usefulness of a regimen lay precisely in 
the possibility it gave individuals to face different situations. It 
is in these terms that Plato contrasts the regimen of athletes, 
which is so strict that they cannot depart from it without 
becoming “seriously and violently ill,” with the regimen he 
would like to see adopted for his warriors. They need to be like 
dogs always on the alert; in their campaigns they will “endure 
frequent changes of drinking water and food, of summer and 
winter weather” and still maintain an “unvarying health.” 15 
Plato’s warriors would have special responsibilities no doubt. 
But more general regimens also obeyed this same principle. 
The author of the Regimen in the Hippocratic collection is 
careful to emphasize that his advice is not addressed to a 
privileged minority of idle individuals, but to the great majority 
of people, to “those who work, those who travel, go on sea 
voyages, expose themselves to sun and cold.” 16 This passage 
has sometimes been interpreted as indicating a particular inter¬
