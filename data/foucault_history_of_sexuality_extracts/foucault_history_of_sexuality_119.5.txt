It was characteristic of idle men who were of no use to the city; 
there was a telling comparison that could be made with those 
serious craftsmen who would not stop to swathe their heads 
on account of a migraine, for they had no time to lose in petty 
medical treatments. But it was also characteristic of those 
who, in order to keep from losing their hold on life, tried their

utmost to delay the term that had been appointed by nature. 
The practice carried the danger—moral but political as well 
—of exaggerating one’s care of the body (peritte epimeleia tou 
somatos ). 13 Asclepius, whose treatment was confined to po¬ 
tions and surgery, was politically astute: he knew that in a 
well-governed state, no one had the leisure to spend his life 
being sick and having himself treated* 

3. The distrust of excessive regimens shows that the pur¬ 
pose of diet was not to extend life as far as possible in time nor as 
high as possible in performance, but rather to make it useful 
and happy within the limits that had been set for it. Nor was 
diet supposed to determine the conditions of existence once and 
for all. A regimen was not good if it only permitted one to live in 
one place, with one type of food, and if it did not allow one to be 
open to any change. The usefulness of a regimen lay precisely in 
the possibility it gave individuals to face different situations. It 
is in these terms that Plato contrasts the regimen of athletes, 
which is so strict that they cannot depart from it without 
becoming “seriously and violently ill,” with the regimen he 
would like to see adopted for his warriors. They need to be like 
dogs always on the alert; in their campaigns they will “endure 
frequent changes of drinking water and food, of summer and 
winter weather” and still maintain an “unvarying health.” 15 
Plato’s warriors would have special responsibilities no doubt. 
But more general regimens also obeyed this same principle. 
The author of the Regimen in the Hippocratic collection is 
careful to emphasize that his advice is not addressed to a 
privileged minority of idle individuals, but to the great majority 
of people, to “those who work, those who travel, go on sea 
voyages, expose themselves to sun and cold.” 16 This passage 
has sometimes been interpreted as indicating a particular inter¬
