cal bits of knowledge on them, or use them as a basis for 
constructing a science that is beyond their grasp—all this 
together enables us to link an intensification of the interven¬ 
tions of power to a multiplication of discourse. The sex of 
children and adolescents has become, since the eighteenth 
century, an important area of contention around which innu¬ 
merable institutional devices and discursive strategies have 
been deployed. It may well be true that adults and children 
themselves were deprived of a certain way of speaking about 
sex, a mode that was disallowed as being too direct, crude, 
or coarse. But this was only the counterpart of other dis¬ 
courses, and perhaps the condition necessary in order for 
them to function, discourses that were interlocking, hier¬ 
archized, and all highly articulated around a cluster of power 
relations. 

One could mention many other centers which in the eigh¬ 
teenth or nineteenth century began to produce discourses on 
sex. First there was medicine, via the “nervous disorders”; 
next psychiatry, when it set out to discover the etiology of 
mental illnesses, focusing its gaze first on “excess,” then 
onanism, then frustration, then “frauds against procrea¬ 
tion,” but especially when it annexed the whole of the sexual 
perversions as its own province; criminal justice, too, which 
had long been concerned with sexuality, particularly in the 
form of “heinous” crimes and crimes against nature, but 
which, toward the middle of the nineteenth century, broad¬ 
ened its jurisdiction to include petty offenses, minor indecen¬ 
cies, insignificant perversions; and lastly, all those social 
controls, cropping up at the end of the last century, which 
screened the sexuality of couples, parents and children, dan¬ 
gerous and endangered adolescents—undertaking to protect,

separate, and forewarn, signaling perils everywhere, awaken¬ 
ing people’s attention, calling for diagnoses, piling up re¬ 
ports, organizing therapies. These sites radiated discourses 
aimed at sex, intensif ying people’s awareness of it as a con¬ 
stant danger, and this in turn created a further incentive to 
talk about it.
