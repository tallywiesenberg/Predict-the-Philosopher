cal bits of knowledge on them, or use them as a basis for 
constructing a science that is beyond their grasp—all this 
together enables us to link an intensification of the interven¬ 
tions of power to a multiplication of discourse. The sex of 
children and adolescents has become, since the eighteenth 
century, an important area of contention around which innu¬ 
merable institutional devices and discursive strategies have 
been deployed. It may well be true that adults and children 
themselves were deprived of a certain way of speaking about 
sex, a mode that was disallowed as being too direct, crude, 
or coarse. But this was only the counterpart of other dis¬ 
courses, and perhaps the condition necessary in order for 
them to function, discourses that were interlocking, hier¬ 
archized, and all highly articulated around a cluster of power 
relations. 

One could mention many other centers which in the eigh¬ 
teenth or nineteenth century began to produce discourses on 
sex. First there was medicine, via the “nervous disorders”; 
next psychiatry, when it set out to discover the etiology of 
mental illnesses, focusing its gaze first on “excess,” then 
onanism, then frustration, then “frauds against procrea¬ 
tion,” but especially when it annexed the whole of the sexual 
perversions as its own province; criminal justice, too, which 
had long been concerned with sexuality, particularly in the 
form of “heinous” crimes and crimes against nature, but 
which, toward the middle of the nineteenth century, broad¬ 
ened its jurisdiction to include petty offenses, minor indecen¬ 
cies, insignificant perversions; and lastly, all those social 
controls, cropping up at the end of the last century, which 
screened the sexuality of couples, parents and children, dan¬ 
gerous and endangered adolescents—undertaking to protect,

separate, and forewarn, signaling perils everywhere, awaken¬ 
ing people’s attention, calling for diagnoses, piling up re¬ 
ports, organizing therapies. These sites radiated discourses 
aimed at sex, intensif ying people’s awareness of it as a con¬ 
stant danger, and this in turn created a further incentive to 
talk about it. 

One day in 1867, a farm hand from the village of Lapcourt, 
who was somewhat simple-minded, employed here then 
there, depending on the season, living hand-to-mouth from 
a little charity or in exchange for the worst sort of labor, 
sleeping in barns and stables, was turned in to the authorities. 
At the border of a field, he had obtained a few caresses from 
a little girl, just as he had done before and seen done by the 
village urchins round about him; for, at the edge of the wood, 
or in the ditch by the road leading to Saint-Nicolas, they 
would play the familiar game called “curdled milk.” So he 
was pointed out by the girl’s parents to the mayor of the 
village, reported by the mayor to the gendarmes, led by the 
gendarmes to the judge, who indicted him and turned him 
over first to a doctor, then to two other experts who not only 
wrote their report but also had it published. 14 What is the 
significant thing about this story? The pettiness of it all; the 
fact that this everyday occurrence in the life of village sexual¬ 
ity, these inconsequential bucolic pleasures, could become, 
from a certain time, the object not only of a collective intoler¬ 
ance but of a judicial action, a medical intervention, a careful 
clinical examination, and an entire theoretical elaboration. 
The thing to note is that they went so far as to measure the 
brainpan, study the facial bone structure, and inspect for 
possible signs of degenerescence the anatomy of this person¬ 
age who up to that moment had been an integral part of 
village life; that they made him talk; that they questioned 
him concerning his thoughts, inclinations, habits, sensations, 
and opinions. And then, acquitting him of any crime, they

decided finally to make him into a pure object of medicine 
and knowledge—an object to be shut away till the end of his 
life in the hospital at Mareville, but also one to be made 
known to the world of learning through a detailed analysis. 
One can be fairly certain that during this same period the 
Lapcourt schoolmaster was instructing the little villagers to 
mind their language and not talk about all these things aloud. 
But this was undoubtedly one of the conditions enabling the 
institutions of knowledge and power to overlay this everyday 
bit of theater with their solemn discourse. So it was that our 
society—and it was doubtless the first in history to take such 
measures—assembled around these timeless gestures, these
