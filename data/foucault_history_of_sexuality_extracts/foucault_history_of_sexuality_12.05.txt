How could power exercise its highest prerogatives 
by putting people to death, when its main role was to ensure, 
sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order?For such 
a power, execution was at the same time a limit, a scandal, 
and a contradiction.Hence capital punishment could not be 
maintained except by invoking less the enormity of the crime 
itself than the monstrosity of the criminal, his incorrigibility, 
and the safeguard of society.One had the right to kill those 
who represented a kind of biological danger to others.One might say that the ancient right to take life or let live 
was replaced by a power to foster life or disallow it to the 
point of death.
