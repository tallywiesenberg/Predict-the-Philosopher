This is perhaps what explains that disqualifi¬ 
cation of death which marks the recent wane of the rituals 
that accompanied it.That death is so carefully evaded is 
linked less to a new anxiety which makes death unbearable 
for our societies than to the fact that the procedures of power

this world to the other, death was the manner in which a 
terrestrial sovereignty was relieved by another, singularly 
more powerful sovereignty; the pageantry that surrounded it 
was in the category of political ceremony.Now it is over life, 
throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its domin¬

circumstances or individual accidents, was one of the first 
astonishments of a society in which political power had as¬ 
signed itself the task of administering life.
