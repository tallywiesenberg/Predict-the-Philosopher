In concrete terms, starting in the seventeenth century, this 
power over life evolved in two basic forms; these forms were 
not antithetical, however; they constituted rather two poles 
of development linked together by a whole intermediary 
cluster of relations.One of these poles—the first to be 
formed, it seems—centered on the body as a machine: its 
disciplining, the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion 
of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its 
docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic 
controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power that 
characterized the disciplines: an anatomo-politics of the 
human body.The second, formed somewhat later, focused 
on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of 
life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propa¬ 
gation, births and mortality, the level of health, life expect¬ 
ancy and longevity, with all the conditions that can cause 
these to vary.Their supervision was effected through an 
entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a bio¬ 
politics of the population.The disciplines of the body and the 
regulations of the population constituted the two poles 
around which the organization of power over life was de¬ 
ployed.
