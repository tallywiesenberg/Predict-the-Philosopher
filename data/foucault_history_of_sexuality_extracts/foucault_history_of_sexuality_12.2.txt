and the calculated management of life.During the classical 
period, there was a rapid development of various disciplines 
—universities, secondary schools, barracks, workshops; 
there was also the emergence, in the field of political prac¬

for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of 
populations, marking the beginning of an era of “bio¬

appeared to be clearly separate in the eighteenth century.With regard to discipline, this development was embodied in 
institutions such as the army and the schools, and in reflec¬ 
tions on tactics, apprenticeship, education, and the nature of 
societies, ranging from the strictly military analyses of Mar¬ 
shal de Saxe to the political reveries of Guibert or Servan.
