If the develop¬ 
ment of the great instruments of the state, as institutions of 
power, ensured the maintenance of production relations, the 
rudiments of anatomo- and bio-politics, created in the eigh¬

and the forces working to sustain them.They also acted as 
factors of segregation and social hierarchization, exerting 
their influence on the respective forces of both these move¬

hegemony.The adjustment of the accumulation of men to 
that of capital, the joining of the growth of human groups to 
the expansion of productive forces and the differential alloca¬ 
tion of profit, were made possible in part by the exercise of 
bio-power in its many forms and modes of application.The 
investment of the body, its valorization, and the distributive 
management of its forces were at the time indispensable.One knows how many times the question has been raised 
concerning the role of an ascetic morality in the first forma¬ 
tion of capitalism; but what occurred in the eighteenth cen¬ 
tury in some Western countries, an event bound up with the 
development of capitalism, was a different phenomenon hav¬

entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species
