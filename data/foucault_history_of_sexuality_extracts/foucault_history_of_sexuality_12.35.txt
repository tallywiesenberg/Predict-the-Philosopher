It is not a question of claiming that this 
was the moment when the first contact between life and 
history was brought about.On the contrary, the pressure 
exerted by the biological on the historical had remained very 
strong for thousands of years; epidemics and famine were the 
two great dramatic forms of this relationship that was always 
dominated by the menace of death.But through a circular 
process, the economic—and primarily agricultural—devel¬ 
opment of the eighteenth century, and an increase in produc¬ 
tivity and resources even more rapid than the demographic 
growth it encouraged, allowed a measure of relief from these 
profound threats: despite some renewed outbreaks, the pe¬ 
riod of great ravages from starvation and plague had come 
to a close before the French Revolution; death was ceasing 
to torment life so directly.But at the same time, the develop¬ 
ment of the different fields of knowledge concerned with life 
in general, the improvement of agricultural techniques, and 
the observations and measures relative to man’s life and 
survival contributed to this relaxation: a relative control over 
life averted some of the imminent risks of death.In the space 
for movement thus conquered, and broadening and organiz¬ 
ing that space, methods of power and knowledge assumed 
responsibility for the life processes and undertook to control 
and modify them.
