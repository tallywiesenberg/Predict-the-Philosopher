Western man was gradually learning what 
it meant to be a living species in a living world, to have a 
body, conditions of existence, probabilities of life, an individ¬ 
ual and collective welfare, forces that could be modified, and 
a space in which they could be distributed in an optimal 
manner.For the first time in history, no doubt, biological 
existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living 
was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged 
from time to time, amid the randomness of death and its 
fatality; part of it passed into knowledge’s field of control and 
power’s sphere of intervention.Power would no longer be 
dealing simply with legal subjects over whom the ultimate

dominion was death, but with living beings, and the mastery 
it would be able to exercise over them would have to be 
applied at the level of life itself; it was the taking charge of 
life, more than the threat of death, that gave power its access 
even to the body.If one can apply the term bio-history to the 
pressures through which the movements of life and the proc¬ 
esses of history interfere with one another, one would have 
to speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its 
mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made 
knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life.It is not that life has been totally integrated into techniques 
that govern and administer it; it constantly escapes them.
