Outside the Western world, famine exists, on a greater scale 
than ever; and the biological risks confronting the species are 
perhaps greater, and certainly more serious, than before the 
birth of microbiology.But what might be called a society’s 
“threshold of modernity” has been reached when the life of 
the species is wagered on its own political strategies.For 
millennia, man remained what he was for Aristotle: a living 
animal with the additional capacity for a political existence; 
modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence 
as a living being in question.This transformation had considerable consequences.It 
would serve no purpose here to dwell on the rupture that 
occurred then in the pattern of scientific discourse and on the 
manner in which the twofold problematic of life and man 
disrupted and redistributed the order of the classical epis- 
teme.
