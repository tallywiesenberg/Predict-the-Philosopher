a little charity or in exchange for the worst sort of labor, 
sleeping in barns and stables, was turned in to the authorities. 
At the border of a field, he had obtained a few caresses from 
a little girl, just as he had done before and seen done by the 
village urchins round about him; for, at the edge of the wood, 
or in the ditch by the road leading to Saint-Nicolas, they 
would play the familiar game called “curdled milk.” So he 
was pointed out by the girl’s parents to the mayor of the 
village, reported by the mayor to the gendarmes, led by the 
gendarmes to the judge, who indicted him and turned him

decided finally to make him into a pure object of medicine 
and knowledge—an object to be shut away till the end of his 
life in the hospital at Mareville, but also one to be made 
known to the world of learning through a detailed analysis. 
One can be fairly certain that during this same period the 
Lapcourt schoolmaster was instructing the little villagers to 
mind their language and not talk about all these things aloud. 
But this was undoubtedly one of the conditions enabling the 
institutions of knowledge and power to overlay this everyday 
bit of theater with their solemn discourse. So it was that our 
society—and it was doubtless the first in history to take such 
measures—assembled around these timeless gestures, these
