But a power whose task is to take charge of life 
needs continuous regulatory and corrective mechanisms.It 
is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field 
of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of 
value and utility.Such a power has to qualify, measure, 
appraise, and hierarchize, rather than display itself in its 
murderous splendor; it does not have to draw the line that 
separates the enemies of the sovereign from his obedient 
subjects; it effects distributions around the norm.I do not 
mean to say that the law fades into the background or that 
the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather that 
the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the 
judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a con¬ 
tinuum of apparatuses (medical, administrative, and so on) 
whose functions are for the most part regulatory.A normal¬ 
izing society is the historical outcome of a technology of 
power centered on life.
