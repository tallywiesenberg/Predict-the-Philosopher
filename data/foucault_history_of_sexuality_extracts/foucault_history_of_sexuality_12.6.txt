We have entered a phase of juridical 
regression in comparison with the pre-seventeenth-century 
societies we are acquainted with; we should not be deceived 
by all the Constitutions framed throughout the world since 
the French Revolution, the Codes written and revised, a 
whole continual and clamorous legislative activity: these 
were the forms that made an essentially normalizing power 
acceptable.Moreover, against this power that was still new in the 
nineteenth century, the forces that resisted relied for support 
on the very thing it invested, that is, on life and man as a 
living being.Since the last century, the great struggles that

have challenged the general system of power were not guided 
hy the belief in a return to former rights, or by the age-old 
dream of a cycle of time or a Golden Age.One no longer 
aspired toward the coming of the emperor of the poor, or the 
kingdom of the latter days, or even the restoration of our 
imagined ancestral rights; what was demanded and what 
served as an objective was life, understood as the basic needs, 
manâ€™s concrete essence, the realization of his potential, a 
plenitude of the possible.Whether or not it was Utopia that 
was wanted is of little importance; what we have seen has 
been a very real process of struggle; life as a political object 
was in a sense taken at face value and turned back against 
the system that was bent on controlling it.
