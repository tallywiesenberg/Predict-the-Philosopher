It was life more 
than the law that became the issue of political struggles, even 
if the latter were formulated through affirmations concerning 
rights.The “right” to life, to one’s body, to health, to happi¬ 
ness, to the satisfaction of needs, and beyond all the oppres¬ 
sions or “alienations,” the “right” to rediscover what one is 
and all that one can be, this “right”—which the classical 
juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending— 
was the political response to all these new procedures of 
power which did not derive, either, from the traditional right 
of sovereignty.This is the background that enables us to understand the 
importance assumed by sex as a political issue.It was at the 
pivot of the two axes along which developed the entire politi¬ 
cal technology of life.On the one hand it was tied to the 
disciplines of the body: the harnessing, intensification, and 
distribution of forces, the adjustment and economy of ener¬ 
gies.
