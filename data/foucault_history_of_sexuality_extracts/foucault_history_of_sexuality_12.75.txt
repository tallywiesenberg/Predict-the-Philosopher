This is why in the nineteenth 
century sexuality was sought out in the smallest details of 
individual existences; it was tracked down in behavior, pur¬ 
sued in dreams; it was suspected of underlying the least 
follies, it was traced back into the earliest years of childhood; 
it became the stamp of individuality—at the same time what 
enabled one to analyze the latter and what made it possible 
to master it.But one also sees it becoming the theme of 
political operations, economic interventions (through incite¬ 
ments to or curbs on procreation), and ideological campaigns 
for raising standards of morality and responsibility: it was 
put forward as the index of a society’s strength, revealing of 
both its political energy and its biological vigor.Spread out 
from one pole to the other of this technology of sex was a 
whole series of different tactics that combined in varying 
proportions the objective of disciplining the body and that of 
regulating populations.Whence the importance of the four great lines of attack 
along which the politics of sex advanced for two centuries.Each one was a way of combining disciplinary techniques 
with regulative methods.
