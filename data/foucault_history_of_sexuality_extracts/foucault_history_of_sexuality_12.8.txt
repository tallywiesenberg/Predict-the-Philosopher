The first two rested on the require¬ 
ments of regulation, on a whole thematic of the species, 
descent, and collective welfare, in order to obtain results at 
the level of discipline; the sexualization of children was ac¬ 
complished in the form of a campaign for the health of the 
race (precocious sexuality was presented from the eighteenth 
century to the end of the nineteenth as an epidemic menace 
that risked compromising not only the future health of adults 
but the future of the entire society and species); the hysteriza- 
tion of women, which involved a thorough medicalization of 
their bodies and their sex, was carried out in the name of the

responsibility they owed to the health of their children, the 
solidity of the family institution, and the safeguarding of 
society.It was the reverse relationship that applied in the 
case of birth controls and the psychiatrization of perversions: 
here the intervention was regulatory in nature, but it had to 
rely on the demand for individual disciplines and constraints 
(dressages).Broadly speaking, at the juncture of the “body” 
and the “population,” sex became a crucial target of a power 
organized around the management of life rather than the 
menace of death.The blood relation long remained an important element in 
the mechanisms of power, its manifestations, and its rituals.For a society in which the systems of alliance, the political 
form of the sovereign, the differentiation into orders and 
castes, and the value of descent lines were predominant; for 
a society in which famine, epidemics, and violence made 
death imminent, blood constituted one of the fundamental 
values.
