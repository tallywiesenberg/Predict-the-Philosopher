Power delineated it, aroused it, and employed it as the prolif¬ 
erating meaning that had always to be taken control of again 
lest it escape; it was an effect with a meaning-value.I do not 
mean to say that a substitution of sex for blood was by itself 
responsible for all the transformations that marked the 
threshold of our modernity.It is not the soul of two civiliza¬ 
tions or the organizing principle of two cultural forms that 
I am attempting to express; I am looking for the reasons for 
which sexuality, far from being repressed in the society of 
that period, on the contrary was constantly aroused.The 
new procedures of power that were devised during the classi¬ 
cal age and employed in the nineteenth century were what 
caused our societies to go from a symbolics of blood to an 
analytics of sexuality.Clearly, nothing was more on the side 
of the law, death, transgression, the symbolic, and sove¬ 
reignty than blood; just as sexuality was on the side of the 
norm, knowledge, life, meaning, the disciplines, and regula¬ 
tions.
