Sade and the first eugenists were contemporary with this 
transition from “sanguinity” to “sexuality.” But whereas the 
first dreams of the perfecting of the species inclined the whole 
problem toward an extremely exacting administration of sex 
(the art of determining good marriages, of inducing the 
desired fertilities, of ensuring the health and longevity of 
children), and while the new concept of race tended to oblit¬ 
erate the aristocratic particularities of blood, retaining only 
the controllable effects of sex, Sade carried the exhaustive 
analysis of sex over into the mechanisms of the old power of 
sovereignty and endowed it with the ancient but fully main¬ 
tained prestige of blood; the latter flowed through the whole 
dimension of pleasure—the blood of torture and absolute 
power, the blood of the caste which was respected in itself 
and which nonetheless was made to flow in the major rituals

of parricide and incest, the blood of the people, which was 
shed unreservedly since the sort that flowed in its veins was 
not even deserving of a name.In Sade, sex is without any 
norm or intrinsic rule that might be formulated from its own 
nature; but it is subject to the unrestricted law of a power 
which itself knows no other law but its own; if by chance it 
is at times forced to accept the order of progressions carefully 
disciplined into successive days, this exercise carries it to a 
point where it is no longer anything but a unique and naked 
sovereignty: an unlimited right of all-powerful monstrosity.While it is true that the analytics of sexuality and the 
symbolics of blood were grounded at first in two very distinct 
regimes of power, in actual fact the passage from one to the 
other did not come about (any more than did these powers 
themselves) without overlappings, interactions, and echoes.In different ways, the preoccupation with blood and the law 
has for nearly two centuries haunted the administration of 
sexuality.Two of these interferences are noteworthy, the one 
for its historical importance, the other for the problems it 
poses.
