The Use of Pleasure 


note, however, is the concern it shows—one that was shared by 
ethics and medicine—with preparing the individual for a mul¬ 
titude of possible circumstances. One could not and one should 
not expect regimen to circumvent fate or to alter nature. What 
could be expected of it was that it would enable one to react, 
with some degree of readiness, to unforeseen events as they 
occurred. Dietetics was a strategic art in the sense that it ought 
to permit one to respond to circumstances in a reasonable, 
hence usef ul, manner. 

In the vigilance it brought to bear on the body and its 
activities, dietetics necessitated two quite particular forms of 
attention on the part of the individual. It required what might 
be called a “serial” attention; that is, an attention to se¬ 
quences: activities were not simply good or bad in themselves; 
their value was determined in part by those that preceded 
them or those that followed, and the same thing (a certain 
food, a type of exercise, a hot or cold bath) would be recom¬ 
mended or advised against according to whether one had 
engaged in or was about to engage in such or such other 
activity (the practices that followed one after the other ought 
to counterbalance one another in their effects, but the contrast 
between them must not be too extreme). The practice of regi¬ 
men also implied a “circumstantial” vigilance, a sharply 
focused yet wide-ranging attention that must be directed to¬ 
ward the external world, its elements, its sensations: the cli¬ 
mate of course, the seasons, the hours of the day, the degree 
of humidity and dryness, of heat or cold, the winds, the char¬ 
acteristic features of a region, the layout of a city. And the 
relatively detailed instructions that are given by the Hippo¬ 
cratic regimen were meant to help the individual who familiar¬ 
ized himself with them to modulate his way of living 
according to all these variables. Regimen should not be under¬ 
stood as a corpus of universal and uniform rules; it was more 
in the nature of a manual for reacting to situations in which 
one might find oneself, a treatise for adjusting one’s behavior 
to fit the circumstances.
