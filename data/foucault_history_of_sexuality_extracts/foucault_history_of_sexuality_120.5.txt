107 


4. Lastly, dietetics was a technique of existence in the 
sense that it was not content to transmit the advice of a doctor 
to an individual, who would then be expected to apply it 
passively. Without going into the history of the dispute be¬ 
tween medicine and gymnastics over the issue of their respec¬ 
tive competence to determine the proper regimen, we must 
keep in mind that diet was not thought of as an unquestioning 
obedience to the authority of another; it was intended to be a 
deliberate practice on the part of an individual, involving 
himself and his body. In order to follow the right regimen, it 
was of course necessary to listen to those who knew, but this 
relationship was supposed to take the form of persuasion. If 
it was to be reasonable, properly adjusting itself to time and 
circumstances, the diet of the body had also to be a matter of 
thought, deliberation, and prudence. Whereas medications 
and operations acted upon the body, and the body submitted 
to that action, regimen addressed itself to the soul, and incul¬ 
cated principles in the soul. Thus, in the Laws, Plato distin¬ 
guishes between two kinds of doctors: those who are good for 
slaves (they are usually slaves themselves) and who confine 
themselves to giving prescriptions without offering any expla¬ 
nation; and the freeborn doctors who attend to free men. 17 Not 
contenting themselves with prescriptions, they enter into con¬ 
versation with the patient and gather information from him 
and his friends; they instruct him, exhort him, and persuade 
him with arguments that, once he is convinced, are likely to 
cause him to lead the right kind of life. From the expert 
doctor, the free man could expect more than the means for a 
cure in the strict sense of the term; he ought to receive a 
rational framework for the whole of his existence.* A brief 
passage in the Memorabilia shows a clear perception of regi¬ 
men as a concrete and active practice of the relation to self. 

•See Plato’s Timaeus, where the author sums up what he has just said concerning 
regimen as follows: “Let this suffice for the treatment of the living creature as a whole 
and of its bodily part, and the way in which a man may best lead a rational life, both 
governing and being governed by himself.""
