The Use of Pleasure 


In this text, one sees Socrates absorbed in the effort to make 
his disciples “independent,” irrespective of their social posi¬ 
tion. To this end he urges them to learn (either from him or 
from another teacher) whatever a gentleman should know, 
within the fixed limits of what is useful, and nothing beyond 
that: they should learn the essentials in the fields of geometry, 
astronomy, and arithmetic. But he also recommends that they 
“take care of their health.” And this “care,” which should be 
supported by accepted knowledge, should also develop into a 
vigilant attentiveness to themselves: self-observation, accom¬ 
panied—significantly—by taking notes: “Everyone should 
watch himself throughout his life, and notice what sort of 
meat and drink and what form of exercise suit his constitution, 
and how he should regulate them in order to enjoy good 
health.” To become an art of existence, good management of 
the body ought to include a setting down in writing carried out 
by the subject concerning himself; with the help of this note¬ 
taking, the individual would be able to gain his independence 
and choose judiciously between what was good and bad for 
him: “For by such attention to yourselves you can discover 
better than any doctor what suits your constitution.” 19 

In short, the practice of regimen as an art of living was 
something more than a set of precautions designed to prevent 
illnesses or complete their cure. It was a whole manner of 
forming oneself as a subject who had the proper, necessary, 
and sufficient concern for his body. A concern that permeated 
everyday life, making the major or common activities of exis¬ 
tence a matter both of health and of ethics. It defined a circum¬ 
stantial strategy involving the body and the elements that 
surrounded it; and finally, it proposed to equip the individual 
himself for a rational mode of behavior. What place was it 
agreed that the aphrodisia should have in this reasonable and 
natural management of life?
