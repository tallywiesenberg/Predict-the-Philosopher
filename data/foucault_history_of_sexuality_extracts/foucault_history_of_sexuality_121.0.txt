The Use of Pleasure 


In this text, one sees Socrates absorbed in the effort to make 
his disciples “independent,” irrespective of their social posi¬ 
tion. To this end he urges them to learn (either from him or 
from another teacher) whatever a gentleman should know, 
within the fixed limits of what is useful, and nothing beyond 
that: they should learn the essentials in the fields of geometry, 
astronomy, and arithmetic. But he also recommends that they 
“take care of their health.” And this “care,” which should be 
supported by accepted knowledge, should also develop into a 
vigilant attentiveness to themselves: self-observation, accom¬ 
panied—significantly—by taking notes: “Everyone should 
watch himself throughout his life, and notice what sort of 
meat and drink and what form of exercise suit his constitution, 
and how he should regulate them in order to enjoy good 
health.” To become an art of existence, good management of 
the body ought to include a setting down in writing carried out 
by the subject concerning himself; with the help of this note¬ 
taking, the individual would be able to gain his independence 
and choose judiciously between what was good and bad for 
him: “For by such attention to yourselves you can discover 
better than any doctor what suits your constitution.” 19 

In short, the practice of regimen as an art of living was 
something more than a set of precautions designed to prevent 
illnesses or complete their cure. It was a whole manner of 
forming oneself as a subject who had the proper, necessary, 
and sufficient concern for his body. A concern that permeated 
everyday life, making the major or common activities of exis¬ 
tence a matter both of health and of ethics. It defined a circum¬ 
stantial strategy involving the body and the elements that 
surrounded it; and finally, it proposed to equip the individual 
himself for a rational mode of behavior. What place was it 
agreed that the aphrodisia should have in this reasonable and 
natural management of life?

The Diet of 
Pleasures 


Two treatises of dietetics have come down to us. Both be¬ 
long to the Hippocratic collection. The older of the two, also 
the shorter, is the Peri diaites hygiaines (A Regimen for 
Health); it was long regarded as constituting the last part of 
the treatise The Nature of Man. 1 The other, the Peri diaites, 
is also the more developed. In addition, Oribasius included in 
his Medical Collection a text on hygiene by Diodes, which 
gives a meticulously detailed set of rules for everyday life. 2 
And lastly, this same Diodes, who lived at the end of the 
fourth century, has been credited with a very brief text that 
was collected in the works of Paul of Aegina; in this text, the 
author tells how to recognize the first signs of illness in oneself 
and offers a few general rules of seasonal regimen. 3 

Whereas A Regimen for Health does not say a word on the 
subject of the aphrodisia, the Peri diaites includes a series of 
recommendations and prescriptions relating to the question. 
The first part of the work is presented as a reflection on the 
general principles that should determine the organization of 
the regimen. The author acknowledges that some of his many 
predecessors have managed to give good advice on various 
particular points; however, none of them was able to present 
an adequate treatment of the subject matter they proposed to 
discuss, the reason being that in order to “treat correctly 
concerning human diet,” it is necessary to “acquire knowledge 
and discernment” of human nature in general, of man’s origi-

nal constitution (he ex arches systasis), and of the principle 
that ought to have control within the body (to epicrateon en 
toi somati). 4 The author considers the two fundamental ele¬ 
ments of regimen to be alimentation and exercise; the latter 
causes expenditures that food and drink serve to compensate. 

The second part of the text discusses the practice of dietetics 
from the standpoint of the properties and effects of the ele¬ 
ments that go into the regimen. After some remarks on places 
—high or low, dry or wet, exposed to such and such a wind 
—the author undertakes a review of foods (barley or wheat,

which the dough was kneaded, the quantity of water that was 
mixed with the flour; meats, differentiated in terms of their
