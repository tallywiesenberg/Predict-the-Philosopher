long to the Hippocratic collection. The older of the two, also 
the shorter, is the Peri diaites hygiaines (A Regimen for 
Health); it was long regarded as constituting the last part of 
the treatise The Nature of Man. 1 The other, the Peri diaites, 
is also the more developed. In addition, Oribasius included in 
his Medical Collection a text on hygiene by Diodes, which 
gives a meticulously detailed set of rules for everyday life. 2 
And lastly, this same Diodes, who lived at the end of the 
fourth century, has been credited with a very brief text that 
was collected in the works of Paul of Aegina; in this text, the 
author tells how to recognize the first signs of illness in oneself 
and offers a few general rules of seasonal regimen. 3 

Whereas A Regimen for Health does not say a word on the 
subject of the aphrodisia, the Peri diaites includes a series of 
recommendations and prescriptions relating to the question. 
The first part of the work is presented as a reflection on the 
general principles that should determine the organization of 
the regimen. The author acknowledges that some of his many 
predecessors have managed to give good advice on various 
particular points; however, none of them was able to present 
an adequate treatment of the subject matter they proposed to 
discuss, the reason being that in order to “treat correctly 
concerning human diet,” it is necessary to “acquire knowledge 
and discernment” of human nature in general, of man’s origi-

that ought to have control within the body (to epicrateon en

ments of regimen to be alimentation and exercise; the latter 
causes expenditures that food and drink serve to compensate. 

The second part of the text discusses the practice of dietetics 
from the standpoint of the properties and effects of the ele¬ 
ments that go into the regimen. After some remarks on places 
—high or low, dry or wet, exposed to such and such a wind 
—the author undertakes a review of foods (barley or wheat,

which the dough was kneaded, the quantity of water that was 
mixed with the flour; meats, differentiated in terms of their
