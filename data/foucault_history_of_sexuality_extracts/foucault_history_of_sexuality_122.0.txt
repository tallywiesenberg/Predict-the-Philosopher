varied origins; fruits and vegetables, evaluated according to 
their different varieties), then baths (hot, cold, taken before or 
after meals), vomitings, sleep, natural exercises (like those of 
hearing, voice, thought, or walking) and violent exercises 
(such as running, arm motions, wrestling, and punchball, per¬ 
formed in the dust or with an oiled body). In this enumeration 
of the elements of regimen, sexual activity (lagneie) is barely 
mentioned—between baths and oilings on one side, and vomit¬ 
ings on the other—and such mention as it does get is only 
owing to its three effects. Two of these are qualitative: a warm¬ 
ing due to the violence of the exercise (ponos), and to the 
elimination of a humid element; but also a moistening because 
the exercise has caused some of the flesh-parts to melt. A third 
effect is quantitative: the evacuation causes weight loss. “Sex¬ 
ual intercourse reduces, moistens, and warms. It warms owing 
to the fatigue and the excretion of moisture; it reduces owing 
to the evacuation; it moistens because of the-remnant in the 
body of matters melted by the fatigue.” 5 

On the other hand, in the third part of this Regimen, one 
does find a certain number of prescriptions concerning the 
aphrodisia. In its first pages, this part resembles a sort of great 
calendar of health, a permanent almanac of the seasons and 
the regimens appropriate to them. But the author notes that

it is not possible to give a general formula for determining the 
correct balance between exercises and foods. He stresses the 
need to take account of the differences among things, individu¬ 
als, places, and times; 6 the almanac is thus not to be read as 
a set of imperative recipes but as strategic principles that one 
must know how to adapt to circumstances. In short, whereas 
the second part of the text dealt more with the elements of 
regimen in themselves, with a view to their intrinsic properties 
(and the aphrodisia are mentioned only in passing), the third 
part, in its beginning, is especially concerned with situational 
variables. 

The year is divided into four seasons, of course. But these 
in turn are subdivided into shorter periods of a few weeks or 
even a few days. This is because the peculiar characteristics of 
each season often develop in stages; and further, it is always 
risky to alter one’s regimen abruptly; like excesses, sudden
