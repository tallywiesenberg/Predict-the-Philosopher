varied origins; fruits and vegetables, evaluated according to 
their different varieties), then baths (hot, cold, taken before or 
after meals), vomitings, sleep, natural exercises (like those of 
hearing, voice, thought, or walking) and violent exercises 
(such as running, arm motions, wrestling, and punchball, per¬ 
formed in the dust or with an oiled body). In this enumeration 
of the elements of regimen, sexual activity (lagneie) is barely 
mentioned—between baths and oilings on one side, and vomit¬ 
ings on the other—and such mention as it does get is only 
owing to its three effects. Two of these are qualitative: a warm¬ 
ing due to the violence of the exercise (ponos), and to the 
elimination of a humid element; but also a moistening because 
the exercise has caused some of the flesh-parts to melt. A third 
effect is quantitative: the evacuation causes weight loss. “Sex¬ 
ual intercourse reduces, moistens, and warms. It warms owing 
to the fatigue and the excretion of moisture; it reduces owing 
to the evacuation; it moistens because of the-remnant in the 
body of matters melted by the fatigue.” 5 

On the other hand, in the third part of this Regimen, one 
does find a certain number of prescriptions concerning the 
aphrodisia. In its first pages, this part resembles a sort of great 
calendar of health, a permanent almanac of the seasons and 
the regimens appropriate to them. But the author notes that

it is not possible to give a general formula for determining the 
correct balance between exercises and foods. He stresses the 
need to take account of the differences among things, individu¬ 
als, places, and times; 6 the almanac is thus not to be read as 
a set of imperative recipes but as strategic principles that one 
must know how to adapt to circumstances. In short, whereas 
the second part of the text dealt more with the elements of 
regimen in themselves, with a view to their intrinsic properties 
(and the aphrodisia are mentioned only in passing), the third 
part, in its beginning, is especially concerned with situational 
variables. 

The year is divided into four seasons, of course. But these 
in turn are subdivided into shorter periods of a few weeks or 
even a few days. This is because the peculiar characteristics of 
each season often develop in stages; and further, it is always 
risky to alter one’s regimen abruptly; like excesses, sudden 
changes have harmful consequences—“ ‘Little by little’ [to 
kata mikron] is a safe rule, especially in cases of change from 
one thing to another.” Which means that “in each season the 
various items of regimen should be changed gradually [kata 
mikron]." 1 Thus, the winter regimen should be subdivided as 
the season itself demands, into a period of forty-four days that 
extend from the setting of the Pleiades to the solstice, then into 
an exactly equivalent period followed by a relaxation of the 
regimen. Spring begins with a period of thirty-two days, from 
the rising of Arcturus and the arrival of the swallows to the 
equinox; within this time span, the season should be divided 
into six periods of eight days. Then comes the summer season, 
which comprises two phases: from the rising of the Pleiades 
to the solstice, and from the solstice to the equinox. From that 
time to the setting of the Pleiades, one should spend forty- 
eight hours preparing for the “winter regimen.” 

The author does not provide a complete regimen for these 
small subdivisions. Rather, he defines, more or less in detail, 
an overall strategy that depends on the qualities that are char¬ 
acteristic of each of these times of the year. This strategy is

based on a principle of compensation, if not opposition or 
resistance: the cold of one season should be counterbalanced 
by a warming regimen lest the body become chilled; inversely, 
extreme heat calls for a soothing, cooling regimen. But it 
should also obey the principle of imitation and conformity: a 
mild season that progresses gradually needs a mild and gradu¬ 
ated regimen; in the period when plants prepare for their 
growth, humans should do likewise, preparing to develop their 
bodies; similarly, just as trees harden and brace themselves 
against the harsh days of winter, men should toughen them¬ 
selves by not fleeing the cold but by exposing themselves to it 
“courageously.” 8 

This is the general context in which the aphrodisia are to 
be regulated, taking account of the effects they may have on 
the interaction of heat and cold, of dryness and moisture, 
according to the general notions that one finds in the second 
part of the text. Recommendations concerning them are 
placed for the most part between alimentary prescriptions and 
advice on exercises and evacuations. Winter, from the setting
