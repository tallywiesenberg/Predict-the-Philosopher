changes have harmful consequences—“ ‘Little by little’ [to 
kata mikron] is a safe rule, especially in cases of change from 
one thing to another.” Which means that “in each season the 
various items of regimen should be changed gradually [kata 
mikron]." 1 Thus, the winter regimen should be subdivided as 
the season itself demands, into a period of forty-four days that 
extend from the setting of the Pleiades to the solstice, then into 
an exactly equivalent period followed by a relaxation of the 
regimen. Spring begins with a period of thirty-two days, from 
the rising of Arcturus and the arrival of the swallows to the 
equinox; within this time span, the season should be divided 
into six periods of eight days. Then comes the summer season, 
which comprises two phases: from the rising of the Pleiades 
to the solstice, and from the solstice to the equinox. From that 
time to the setting of the Pleiades, one should spend forty- 
eight hours preparing for the “winter regimen.” 

The author does not provide a complete regimen for these 
small subdivisions. Rather, he defines, more or less in detail, 
an overall strategy that depends on the qualities that are char¬ 
acteristic of each of these times of the year. This strategy is

based on a principle of compensation, if not opposition or 
resistance: the cold of one season should be counterbalanced 
by a warming regimen lest the body become chilled; inversely, 
extreme heat calls for a soothing, cooling regimen. But it 
should also obey the principle of imitation and conformity: a 
mild season that progresses gradually needs a mild and gradu¬ 
ated regimen; in the period when plants prepare for their 
growth, humans should do likewise, preparing to develop their 
bodies; similarly, just as trees harden and brace themselves 
against the harsh days of winter, men should toughen them¬ 
selves by not fleeing the cold but by exposing themselves to it 
“courageously.” 8 

This is the general context in which the aphrodisia are to 
be regulated, taking account of the effects they may have on 
the interaction of heat and cold, of dryness and moisture, 
according to the general notions that one finds in the second 
part of the text. Recommendations concerning them are 
placed for the most part between alimentary prescriptions and 
advice on exercises and evacuations. Winter, from the setting
