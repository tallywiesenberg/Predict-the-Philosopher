of the Pleiades to the spring equinox, is a season in which 
regimen should have a drying and warming effect, considering 
the coldness and wetness of the season: hence, roasted rather 
than boiled meats, whole-wheat bread, small portions of dry 
vegetables, slightly diluted wine, but in small amounts; nu¬ 
merous exercises of every sort (running, wrestling, walking); 
baths that should be cold after running workouts, which al¬ 
ways heat up the body, and hot after all the other exercises; 
more frequent sexual relations, especially for older men whose 
bodies tend to become chilled; emetics three times per month 
for those with moist constitutions, two times per month for 
those who are dry. 9 During the spring period, when the air is 
warmer and dryer, and when one must prepare for the growth 
of the body, one should eat as many boiled meats as roasted, 
together with moist vegetables; take baths; decrease the quan¬ 
tity of sexual relations and emetics; vomit only two times per 
month, then even less frequently, so that the body will main-

tain “a pure flesh.” After the rising of the Pleiades, with the 
coming of summer, dryness is what regimen must fight 
against: drink light wines, white and diluted; eat barley cakes, 
boiled or raw vegetables, if they can be eaten without over¬ 
heating the body; abstain from emetics and reduce sexual 
activity to a minimum (toisi de aphrodisioisin hos hekista); 
exercise less; avoid running, which dessicates the body, as well 
as walking in the sun, giving preference instead to wrestling 
in the dust. 10 As one gets nearer to the rising of Arcturus and 
the autumn equinox, the regimen must be made milder and 
more moist; nothing specific is said about sexual regimen. 

Diodes’ Regimen is much less developed than that of Hip¬ 
pocrates. However, it is quite detailed in its treatment of daily 
routine, which takes up a large part of the text: from the 
massages that should immediately follow getting up from bed, 
in order to reduce the stiffness of the body, to the positions to 
take in bed when it is time to lie down (“neither too extended 
nor too bent,” and never on one’s back), all the important 
moments of the day are examined, with the baths, the rub- 
downs, the oilings, the evacuations, the walks, and the foods 
that ought to accompany them." The question of sexual pleas¬ 
ures and their modulation is considered only in connection 
with seasonal variations, and only after some general princi¬ 
ples of balance are called to mind: “It is a very important point 
for health that our body’s potency not be diminished by an¬ 
other potency.” But the author restricts himself to brief 
generalities: first, no one should “make frequent and continual 
use of sexual intercourse”; the latter is more suitable for “cold, 
moist, atrabilious, and flatulent persons,” and least suitable 
for thin ones; there are periods in life when it is more harmful, 
as in the case of old people or for those who are “in the period 
that extends from childhood to adolescence.” 12 As for the 
presumably later text, taken to be a letter from Diodes to 
King Antigonus, the economy of pleasures it sets forth is very 
close in its general outline to that of Hippocrates: at winter 
solstice, which is the time when one is most susceptible to

The Use of Pleasure 


catarrh, sexual practice should not be restricted. During the 
time of the Pleiades’ ascent, a period in which bitter bile is 
dominant in the body, one must indulge in sexual acts with a 
good deal of moderation. One should even forgo them com¬ 
pletely at summer solstice time, when black bile takes over in 
the organism; and it is necessary to abstain from sexual activ¬ 
ity, as well as from any vomiting, till the autumn equinox. 13 * 

Several aspects of this regimen of pleasures merit our atten¬ 
tion. First, there is the limited space given to the problem of 
sexual relations compared with that accorded to exercises, and 
especially to food. As far as the thinking on dietetics was 
concerned, the question of foods—considered in terms of their 
peculiar qualities, and of the circumstances in which they were 
consumed (whether the seasons of the year or the particular 
state of the organism)—was a good deal more important than 
sexual activity. In addition, it should be noted that the preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen was never focused on the form of the 
acts: nothing was said about the types of sexual relations, 
nothing about the “natural” position or about unseemly prac¬ 
tices, nothing about masturbation, nor anything about the 
questions—which would later become so important—of coi¬ 
tus interruptus and methods of contraception.! The aphrodi- 
sia were considered in the aggregate, as an activity whose 
significance was not determined by the various forms it could 
take; one needed to ask oneself only whether the activity ought 
to take place, how frequently, and in what context. The prob- 
lematization was carried out primarily in terms of quantity
