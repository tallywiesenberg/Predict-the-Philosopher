of the Pleiades to the spring equinox, is a season in which 
regimen should have a drying and warming effect, considering 
the coldness and wetness of the season: hence, roasted rather 
than boiled meats, whole-wheat bread, small portions of dry 
vegetables, slightly diluted wine, but in small amounts; nu¬ 
merous exercises of every sort (running, wrestling, walking); 
baths that should be cold after running workouts, which al¬ 
ways heat up the body, and hot after all the other exercises; 
more frequent sexual relations, especially for older men whose 
bodies tend to become chilled; emetics three times per month 
for those with moist constitutions, two times per month for 
those who are dry. 9 During the spring period, when the air is 
warmer and dryer, and when one must prepare for the growth 
of the body, one should eat as many boiled meats as roasted, 
together with moist vegetables; take baths; decrease the quan¬ 
tity of sexual relations and emetics; vomit only two times per 
month, then even less frequently, so that the body will main-

coming of summer, dryness is what regimen must fight 
against: drink light wines, white and diluted; eat barley cakes, 
boiled or raw vegetables, if they can be eaten without over¬ 
heating the body; abstain from emetics and reduce sexual 
activity to a minimum (toisi de aphrodisioisin hos hekista); 
exercise less; avoid running, which dessicates the body, as well 
as walking in the sun, giving preference instead to wrestling 
in the dust. 10 As one gets nearer to the rising of Arcturus and 
the autumn equinox, the regimen must be made milder and 
more moist; nothing specific is said about sexual regimen. 

Diodes’ Regimen is much less developed than that of Hip¬ 
pocrates. However, it is quite detailed in its treatment of daily 
routine, which takes up a large part of the text: from the 
massages that should immediately follow getting up from bed, 
in order to reduce the stiffness of the body, to the positions to 
take in bed when it is time to lie down (“neither too extended 
nor too bent,” and never on one’s back), all the important 
moments of the day are examined, with the baths, the rub- 
downs, the oilings, the evacuations, the walks, and the foods 
that ought to accompany them." The question of sexual pleas¬ 
ures and their modulation is considered only in connection 
with seasonal variations, and only after some general princi¬
