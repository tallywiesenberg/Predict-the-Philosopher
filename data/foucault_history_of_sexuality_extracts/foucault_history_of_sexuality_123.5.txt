ples of balance are called to mind: “It is a very important point 
for health that our body’s potency not be diminished by an¬ 
other potency.” But the author restricts himself to brief 
generalities: first, no one should “make frequent and continual 
use of sexual intercourse”; the latter is more suitable for “cold, 
moist, atrabilious, and flatulent persons,” and least suitable 
for thin ones; there are periods in life when it is more harmful, 
as in the case of old people or for those who are “in the period 
that extends from childhood to adolescence.” 12 As for the 
presumably later text, taken to be a letter from Diodes to 
King Antigonus, the economy of pleasures it sets forth is very 
close in its general outline to that of Hippocrates: at winter 
solstice, which is the time when one is most susceptible to

The Use of Pleasure 


catarrh, sexual practice should not be restricted. During the 
time of the Pleiades’ ascent, a period in which bitter bile is 
dominant in the body, one must indulge in sexual acts with a 
good deal of moderation. One should even forgo them com¬ 
pletely at summer solstice time, when black bile takes over in 
the organism; and it is necessary to abstain from sexual activ¬ 
ity, as well as from any vomiting, till the autumn equinox. 13 * 

Several aspects of this regimen of pleasures merit our atten¬ 
tion. First, there is the limited space given to the problem of 
sexual relations compared with that accorded to exercises, and 
especially to food. As far as the thinking on dietetics was 
concerned, the question of foods—considered in terms of their 
peculiar qualities, and of the circumstances in which they were 
consumed (whether the seasons of the year or the particular 
state of the organism)—was a good deal more important than 
sexual activity. In addition, it should be noted that the preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen was never focused on the form of the 
acts: nothing was said about the types of sexual relations, 
nothing about the “natural” position or about unseemly prac¬ 
tices, nothing about masturbation, nor anything about the 
questions—which would later become so important—of coi¬ 
tus interruptus and methods of contraception.! The aphrodi- 
sia were considered in the aggregate, as an activity whose 
significance was not determined by the various forms it could 
take; one needed to ask oneself only whether the activity ought 
to take place, how frequently, and in what context. The prob- 
lematization was carried out primarily in terms of quantity
