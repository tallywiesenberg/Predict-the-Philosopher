and circumstances. 

Moreover, this quantity was not evaluated in the form of a 
precise numerical determination. One always remained within 
the compass of a general assessment: use pleasures “more 
amply” (pleon), or in smaller amounts (elasson), or as little as

possible (hos hekista). Which did not mean that it was useless 
to concentrate one’s attention on the problem, but rather that 
it was not possible to determine in advance and for everyone, 
the rhythm of an activity that engaged an interplay of qualities 
—dryness, heat, moisture, cold—between the body and its 
milieu. If in fact sexual acts were a proper concern of regimen, 
and if they required “moderation,” this was because they 
produced—through the motions of the body and the ejacula¬ 
tion of semen—warming, cooling, drying, and moistening 
effects. They raised or lowered the level of each of the elements 
that were responsible for the body’s equilibrium. Hence they 
also altered the relationship between this equilibrium and the 
interaction of these elements in the outside world: heating or 
drying, which might be good for a cold, moist body, would be 
less so if the season and the climate were themselves hot and 
dry. It was not the function of regimen to prescribe quantities 
and determine rhythms: given relations that could only be 
defined in terms of their general characteristics, the role of 
regimen was to negotiate qualitative changes and make such 
readjustments as were necessitated by circumstances. We may 
note in passing that the author of the Aristotelian Problems 
seems to have been the only one to draw from one of the 
best-known principles of this qualitative psychology (namely, 
that women are generally cold and moist while men are hot 
and dry) the inference that the active season for sexual rela¬ 
tions was not the same for both sexes: summer was when 
women were most disposed to sexual intercourse, whereas 
men felt the strongest inclination in winter. 15 

Thus, dietetics problematized sexual practice not as a set of 
acts to be differentiated according to their forms and accord¬ 
ing to the value of each of them, but as an “activity” the whole 
of which should be given free rein or curtailed depending on 
chronological considerations. A point that allows us to draw 
a parallel between this regimen and certain regulations found 
later, in the Christian pastoral ministry. There too, in fact, 
some of the criteria used for delimiting sexual activity are

temporal in nature. But those criteria are not only more pre¬ 
cise; they operate in a completely different way: they deter¬ 
mine times when sexual practice is permitted and other times 
when it is forbidden; and this strict partition is established in 
reference to different variables: the liturgical year, menstrual 
cycles, the period of pregnancy, or the time subsequent to 
childbirth.* In the ancient medical regimens, on the other 
hand, the variations were gradual; and instead of being orga¬ 
nized according to the binary form of permitted and forbid¬ 
den, they suggest a constant oscillation between more and less. 
The sexual act was not considered as a licit or an illicit practice 
according to the temporal boundaries within which it was 
inscribed: situated at the point of intersection between the 
individual and the world, temperament and climate, the quali¬ 
ties of the body and those of the seasons, it was viewed as an 
activity that could be more or less pernicious in its conse¬ 
quences and should therefore be subjected to a more or less 
restrictive economy. It was a practice that demanded reflec¬ 
tion and prudence. So it was not a question of determining the 
“working days” of sexual pleasures, uniformly and for every¬ 
one, but of how best to calculate the opportune times and the 
appropriate frequencies. 

*On this point, J. L. Flandrin’s book Un Temps pour embrasser (1983) should be 
consulted. Citing sources from the seventh century, it shows the importance of the 
divisions between permitted times and forbidden times, together with the many forms 
taken by that rhythmic ordering. One sees how this distribution of time was different 
from the circumstantial strategies of Greek dietetics.
