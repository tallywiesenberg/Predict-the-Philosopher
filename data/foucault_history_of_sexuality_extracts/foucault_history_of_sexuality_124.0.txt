Moreover, this quantity was not evaluated in the form of a 
precise numerical determination. One always remained within 
the compass of a general assessment: use pleasures “more 
amply” (pleon), or in smaller amounts (elasson), or as little as

possible (hos hekista). Which did not mean that it was useless 
to concentrate one’s attention on the problem, but rather that 
it was not possible to determine in advance and for everyone, 
the rhythm of an activity that engaged an interplay of qualities 
—dryness, heat, moisture, cold—between the body and its 
milieu. If in fact sexual acts were a proper concern of regimen, 
and if they required “moderation,” this was because they 
produced—through the motions of the body and the ejacula¬ 
tion of semen—warming, cooling, drying, and moistening 
effects. They raised or lowered the level of each of the elements 
that were responsible for the body’s equilibrium. Hence they 
also altered the relationship between this equilibrium and the 
interaction of these elements in the outside world: heating or 
drying, which might be good for a cold, moist body, would be 
less so if the season and the climate were themselves hot and 
dry. It was not the function of regimen to prescribe quantities 
and determine rhythms: given relations that could only be 
defined in terms of their general characteristics, the role of 
regimen was to negotiate qualitative changes and make such 
readjustments as were necessitated by circumstances. We may 
note in passing that the author of the Aristotelian Problems 
seems to have been the only one to draw from one of the 
best-known principles of this qualitative psychology (namely, 
that women are generally cold and moist while men are hot 
and dry) the inference that the active season for sexual rela¬ 
tions was not the same for both sexes: summer was when 
women were most disposed to sexual intercourse, whereas 
men felt the strongest inclination in winter. 15
