Thus, dietetics problematized sexual practice not as a set of 
acts to be differentiated according to their forms and accord¬ 
ing to the value of each of them, but as an “activity” the whole 
of which should be given free rein or curtailed depending on 
chronological considerations. A point that allows us to draw 
a parallel between this regimen and certain regulations found 
later, in the Christian pastoral ministry. There too, in fact, 
some of the criteria used for delimiting sexual activity are

temporal in nature. But those criteria are not only more pre¬ 
cise; they operate in a completely different way: they deter¬ 
mine times when sexual practice is permitted and other times 
when it is forbidden; and this strict partition is established in 
reference to different variables: the liturgical year, menstrual 
cycles, the period of pregnancy, or the time subsequent to 
childbirth.* In the ancient medical regimens, on the other 
hand, the variations were gradual; and instead of being orga¬ 
nized according to the binary form of permitted and forbid¬ 
den, they suggest a constant oscillation between more and less. 
The sexual act was not considered as a licit or an illicit practice 
according to the temporal boundaries within which it was 
inscribed: situated at the point of intersection between the 
individual and the world, temperament and climate, the quali¬ 
ties of the body and those of the seasons, it was viewed as an 
activity that could be more or less pernicious in its conse¬ 
quences and should therefore be subjected to a more or less 
restrictive economy. It was a practice that demanded reflec¬ 
tion and prudence. So it was not a question of determining the 
“working days” of sexual pleasures, uniformly and for every¬ 
one, but of how best to calculate the opportune times and the 
appropriate frequencies. 

*On this point, J. L. Flandrin’s book Un Temps pour embrasser (1983) should be 
consulted. Citing sources from the seventh century, it shows the importance of the 
divisions between permitted times and forbidden times, together with the many forms 
taken by that rhythmic ordering. One sees how this distribution of time was different 
from the circumstantial strategies of Greek dietetics.
