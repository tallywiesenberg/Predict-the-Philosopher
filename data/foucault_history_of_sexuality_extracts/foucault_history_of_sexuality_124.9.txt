*On this point, J. L. Flandrinâ€™s book Un Temps pour embrasser (1983) should be 
consulted. Citing sources from the seventh century, it shows the importance of the 
divisions between permitted times and forbidden times, together with the many forms 
taken by that rhythmic ordering. One sees how this distribution of time was different 
from the circumstantial strategies of Greek dietetics.
