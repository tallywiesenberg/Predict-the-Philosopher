Risks and 
Dangers 


The regimen of the aphrodisia, with the need to moderate 
their practice, did not operate on the assumption that sexual 
acts in themselves and by nature were bad. They were not the 
object of any disqualification based on principle. The question 
that was raised concerning them had to do with use, a use that 
was to be modulated according to the condition of the body 
and external circumstances. However, the need to have re¬ 
course to a careful regimen and to bring vigilant attention to 
bear on sexual practice was justified by two sets of reasons that 
reveal a certain anxiety about the effects of this activity. 

1. The first set of reasons concerns the effects of the sexual 
act on the individual’s body. Granted there were constitutions 
for which sexual activity was beneficial on the whole: this was 
the case for those suffering from an abundance of phlegm— 
for intercourse facilitated the elimination of fluids which 
would otherwise become corrupt, giving rise to that humor— 
or for those whose digestion was bad, whose body consumed 
itself, and whose belly was cold and dry. 1 But for others, 
whose bodies and heads were congested with humors, its 
effects were largely detrimental. 2 

Yet, despite this neutral valuation, this contextual ambiva¬ 
lence, sexual activity was the object of a rather constant suspi¬ 
cion. Diogenes Laertius reports a phrase by Pythagoras in 
which the general requirements of a seasonal regimen are

The Use of Pleasure 


directly associated with a need for continuous rarefaction and 
a conviction that the aphrodisia are intrinsically harmful: 
“Keep to the winter for sexual pleasures, in summer abstain; 
they are less harmful in autumn and spring, but they are 
always harmful and not conducive to health.” And he goes on 
to cite this response from Pythagoras to the person who asked 
him when the best time was for making love: “When you want 
to lose what strength you have.” 3 But the Pythagoreans were
