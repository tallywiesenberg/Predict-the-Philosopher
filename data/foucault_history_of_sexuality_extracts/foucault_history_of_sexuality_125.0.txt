Risks and 
Dangers 


The regimen of the aphrodisia, with the need to moderate 
their practice, did not operate on the assumption that sexual 
acts in themselves and by nature were bad. They were not the 
object of any disqualification based on principle. The question 
that was raised concerning them had to do with use, a use that 
was to be modulated according to the condition of the body 
and external circumstances. However, the need to have re¬ 
course to a careful regimen and to bring vigilant attention to 
bear on sexual practice was justified by two sets of reasons that 
reveal a certain anxiety about the effects of this activity. 

1. The first set of reasons concerns the effects of the sexual 
act on the individual’s body. Granted there were constitutions 
for which sexual activity was beneficial on the whole: this was 
the case for those suffering from an abundance of phlegm— 
for intercourse facilitated the elimination of fluids which 
would otherwise become corrupt, giving rise to that humor— 
or for those whose digestion was bad, whose body consumed 
itself, and whose belly was cold and dry. 1 But for others, 
whose bodies and heads were congested with humors, its 
effects were largely detrimental. 2 

Yet, despite this neutral valuation, this contextual ambiva¬ 
lence, sexual activity was the object of a rather constant suspi¬ 
cion. Diogenes Laertius reports a phrase by Pythagoras in 
which the general requirements of a seasonal regimen are

The Use of Pleasure 


directly associated with a need for continuous rarefaction and 
a conviction that the aphrodisia are intrinsically harmful: 
“Keep to the winter for sexual pleasures, in summer abstain; 
they are less harmful in autumn and spring, but they are 
always harmful and not conducive to health.” And he goes on 
to cite this response from Pythagoras to the person who asked 
him when the best time was for making love: “When you want 
to lose what strength you have.” 3 But the Pythagoreans were 
not the only ones by any means to manifest this sort of appre¬ 
hension; the rule of “as little as possible” and the pursuit of 
the “lesser evil” are also invoked in texts whose aims are 
purely medical or hygienic: Diodes’ Regimen proposes to 
establish the conditions in which the use of pleasures would 
cause “the least harm” (hekista enochlei); and the Aristotelian 
Problems, where the effects of the sexual act are compared to 
those of pulling a plant from the ground, which always dam¬ 
ages the roots, advises one to have relations only in case of a 
pressing need. 4 In this dietetics, whose business it was to deter¬ 
mine when it was beneficial and when it was harmful to prac¬ 
tice the pleasures, one perceives the emergence of a general 
tendency toward a restrictive economy. 

This distrust is apparent in the idea that several of the most 
important organs are affected by sexual activity and may suffer 
from its abuses. Aristotle remarks that the brain is the first 
organ to feel the consequences of the sexual act, for it is the 
“coldest part” of the whole body; by withdrawing a “pure 
natural heat” from the organism, the emission of semen in¬ 
duces a general cooling effect. 5 Diodes places the gall bladder, 
kidneys, lungs, eyes, and spinal cord among the organs that 
are particularly exposed to the effects of pleasure’s excesses. 6 
According to the Problems, it is especially the eyes and the 
loins that are affected, either because they contribute to the act 
more than the other organs, or because the excessive heat 
produces a liquefaction within them. 7 

These manifold organic correlations explain the various 
pathological consequences that were associated with sexual

activity when it did not obey the rules of an indispensable 
economy. It should be remarked that one finds little mention 
—in the case of men at least*—of the troubles that might be 
caused by total abstinence. Illnesses due to a poor distribution 
of sexual activity were much more often illnesses of excess. 
Such as the famous “dorsal phthisis” defined by Hippocrates 
in the treatise Diseases and redescribed with the same etiology 
over a very long span of Western medicine: it was a disease 
that “attacks young married people in particular” and “people 
fond of sexual intercourse” (philolagnoi); its point of origin 
was the marrow (considered to be the part of the body where
