not the only ones by any means to manifest this sort of appre¬ 
hension; the rule of “as little as possible” and the pursuit of 
the “lesser evil” are also invoked in texts whose aims are 
purely medical or hygienic: Diodes’ Regimen proposes to 
establish the conditions in which the use of pleasures would 
cause “the least harm” (hekista enochlei); and the Aristotelian 
Problems, where the effects of the sexual act are compared to 
those of pulling a plant from the ground, which always dam¬ 
ages the roots, advises one to have relations only in case of a 
pressing need. 4 In this dietetics, whose business it was to deter¬ 
mine when it was beneficial and when it was harmful to prac¬ 
tice the pleasures, one perceives the emergence of a general 
tendency toward a restrictive economy. 

This distrust is apparent in the idea that several of the most 
important organs are affected by sexual activity and may suffer 
from its abuses. Aristotle remarks that the brain is the first 
organ to feel the consequences of the sexual act, for it is the 
“coldest part” of the whole body; by withdrawing a “pure 
natural heat” from the organism, the emission of semen in¬ 
duces a general cooling effect. 5 Diodes places the gall bladder, 
kidneys, lungs, eyes, and spinal cord among the organs that 
are particularly exposed to the effects of pleasure’s excesses. 6 
According to the Problems, it is especially the eyes and the 
loins that are affected, either because they contribute to the act 
more than the other organs, or because the excessive heat 
produces a liquefaction within them. 7 

These manifold organic correlations explain the various 
pathological consequences that were associated with sexual

activity when it did not obey the rules of an indispensable 
economy. It should be remarked that one finds little mention 
—in the case of men at least*—of the troubles that might be 
caused by total abstinence. Illnesses due to a poor distribution 
of sexual activity were much more often illnesses of excess. 
Such as the famous “dorsal phthisis” defined by Hippocrates 
in the treatise Diseases and redescribed with the same etiology 
over a very long span of Western medicine: it was a disease 
that “attacks young married people in particular” and “people 
fond of sexual intercourse” (philolagnoi); its point of origin 
was the marrow (considered to be the part of the body where
