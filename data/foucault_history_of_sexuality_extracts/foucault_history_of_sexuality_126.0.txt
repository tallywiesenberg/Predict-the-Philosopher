the sperm is located, as we shall see); it gave a tingling sensa¬ 
tion that descended the length of the spinal column; the sperm 
discharged spontaneously during sleep, in the urine and the 
stools; the patient became sterile. When the disease was ac¬ 
companied by breathing difficulties and headaches, he could 
die from it. A regimen of softening food and evacuation might 
bring about a cure, but only after a whole year of abstention 
from wine, exercise, and aphrodisia . 9 The Epidemics also men¬ 
tion subjects in whom an abuse of pleasures brought on serious 
illnesses: in the case of a resident of Abdera, sexual relations 
and drinking had resulted in a fever, accompanied at the start 
by nausea, heart pain, thirst, dark urine, and a parched 
tongue; the cure was finally obtained on the twenty-fourth 
day, after several remissions and recurrences of fever; but a 
young man from Meliboea died in the midst of a delirium after 
a twenty-four-day illness, which had begun with intestinal and 
respiratory troubles, subsequent to repeated abuses of alcohol 
and sexual pleasures. 10 

By contrast, the regimen of athletes, often criticized for its 
exaggerations, was cited as an example of the beneficial effects 
that could result from sexual abstinence. Plato calls attention 

*But we shall see further on that sexual intercourse was regarded as a health factor 
where women were concerned. The author of the Problems observes, however, that 
healthy, well-nourished men experience bile attacks if they do not engage in sexual 
activity.'

The Use of Pleasure 


to this in the Laws, in regard to Iccus of Tarentum, a winner at 
Olympia: he was so set on victory, and “possessed in his soul 
such art, and such courage mixed with moderation that he 
never touched a woman—or a boy, for that matter—during the 
entire time of his intensive training.” Tradition said that the 
same was true of Crison, Astylus, and Diopompus." Several 
related themes converged on this practice no doubt: that of a 
ritual abstention which, in contests and battles alike, formed 
one of the conditions for success; that of a moral victory which 
the athlete needed to win over himself if he wished to be capable 
and worthy of assuring his superiority over others; but also that 
of an economy necessary for his body in order to conserve 
strength, which the sexual act would waste on the outside. 
Whereas women needed sexual relations so that the discharge
