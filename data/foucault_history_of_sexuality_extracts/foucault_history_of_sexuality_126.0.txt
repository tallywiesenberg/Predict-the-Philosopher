the sperm is located, as we shall see); it gave a tingling sensa¬ 
tion that descended the length of the spinal column; the sperm 
discharged spontaneously during sleep, in the urine and the 
stools; the patient became sterile. When the disease was ac¬ 
companied by breathing difficulties and headaches, he could 
die from it. A regimen of softening food and evacuation might 
bring about a cure, but only after a whole year of abstention 
from wine, exercise, and aphrodisia . 9 The Epidemics also men¬ 
tion subjects in whom an abuse of pleasures brought on serious 
illnesses: in the case of a resident of Abdera, sexual relations 
and drinking had resulted in a fever, accompanied at the start 
by nausea, heart pain, thirst, dark urine, and a parched 
tongue; the cure was finally obtained on the twenty-fourth 
day, after several remissions and recurrences of fever; but a 
young man from Meliboea died in the midst of a delirium after 
a twenty-four-day illness, which had begun with intestinal and 
respiratory troubles, subsequent to repeated abuses of alcohol 
and sexual pleasures. 10 

By contrast, the regimen of athletes, often criticized for its 
exaggerations, was cited as an example of the beneficial effects 
that could result from sexual abstinence. Plato calls attention 

*But we shall see further on that sexual intercourse was regarded as a health factor 
where women were concerned. The author of the Problems observes, however, that 
healthy, well-nourished men experience bile attacks if they do not engage in sexual 
activity.'

The Use of Pleasure 


to this in the Laws, in regard to Iccus of Tarentum, a winner at 
Olympia: he was so set on victory, and “possessed in his soul 
such art, and such courage mixed with moderation that he 
never touched a woman—or a boy, for that matter—during the 
entire time of his intensive training.” Tradition said that the 
same was true of Crison, Astylus, and Diopompus." Several 
related themes converged on this practice no doubt: that of a 
ritual abstention which, in contests and battles alike, formed 
one of the conditions for success; that of a moral victory which 
the athlete needed to win over himself if he wished to be capable 
and worthy of assuring his superiority over others; but also that 
of an economy necessary for his body in order to conserve 
strength, which the sexual act would waste on the outside. 
Whereas women needed sexual relations so that the discharge 
necessary to their organism might occur in a regular manner, 
men could—in certain cases at least—retain all their semen; far 
from causing them harm, strict abstinence on their part would 
preserve their force in its entirety, accumulate it, concentrate it, 
and carry it finally to a higher level. 

Hence a paradox resides in this preoccupation with a regi¬ 
men by which one sought both an equitable distribution of an 
activity that could not in itself be regarded as a vice, and a 
restrictive economy in which “less” seemed almost always 
preferable to “more.” While it was natural that the body 
produce a vigorous substance having the capacity to procre¬ 
ate, the very act that roused the organism and cast it out into 
the world actually risked being as dangerous in its effects as 
it was harmonious with nature in its principle. The whole 
body, with its most important or most fragile organs, risked 
paying a high price for an expenditure that nature had 
nonetheless willed; and to retain that substance which sought 
by its own power to escape, could be a means of charging the 
body with its most intense energy. 

2. A concern about progeny also motivated the vigilance 
that one needed to display in the use of pleasures. For while

it was granted that nature had organized the union of the sexes 
in order to provide people with a lineage and to ensure the 
survival of the species; and also granted that, for the same 
reason, she had associated the sexual relation with such a keen 
pleasure, this lineage was recognized as being fragile, at least 
in terms of its quality and worth. It was dangerous for the 
individual to take his pleasure at random; but if he procreated 
at random and no matter how, the future of his family would 
be placed in jeopardy. In the Laws, Plato solemnly under¬ 
scores the importance of the precautions that had to be taken 
for this purpose that concerned parents and the city as a 
whole. There were measures to be taken at the time of the first 
sexual act between the two partners on the occasion of mar¬ 
riage: all the values and all the dangers traditionally associated 
with inaugural acts were present here: on that day and night, 
it was necessary to refrain from any misdeed with respect to 
the matter at hand, “for the beginning, which among human 
beings is established as a god, is the saviour of all things—if
