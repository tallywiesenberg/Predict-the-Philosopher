necessary to their organism might occur in a regular manner, 
men could—in certain cases at least—retain all their semen; far 
from causing them harm, strict abstinence on their part would 
preserve their force in its entirety, accumulate it, concentrate it, 
and carry it finally to a higher level. 

Hence a paradox resides in this preoccupation with a regi¬ 
men by which one sought both an equitable distribution of an 
activity that could not in itself be regarded as a vice, and a 
restrictive economy in which “less” seemed almost always 
preferable to “more.” While it was natural that the body 
produce a vigorous substance having the capacity to procre¬ 
ate, the very act that roused the organism and cast it out into 
the world actually risked being as dangerous in its effects as 
it was harmonious with nature in its principle. The whole 
body, with its most important or most fragile organs, risked 
paying a high price for an expenditure that nature had 
nonetheless willed; and to retain that substance which sought 
by its own power to escape, could be a means of charging the 
body with its most intense energy.

that one needed to display in the use of pleasures. For while

in order to provide people with a lineage and to ensure the 
survival of the species; and also granted that, for the same 
reason, she had associated the sexual relation with such a keen 
pleasure, this lineage was recognized as being fragile, at least 
in terms of its quality and worth. It was dangerous for the 
individual to take his pleasure at random; but if he procreated 
at random and no matter how, the future of his family would 
be placed in jeopardy. In the Laws, Plato solemnly under¬ 
scores the importance of the precautions that had to be taken 
for this purpose that concerned parents and the city as a 
whole. There were measures to be taken at the time of the first 
sexual act between the two partners on the occasion of mar¬ 
riage: all the values and all the dangers traditionally associated 
with inaugural acts were present here: on that day and night, 
it was necessary to refrain from any misdeed with respect to 
the matter at hand, “for the beginning, which among human 
beings is established as a god, is the saviour of all things—if
