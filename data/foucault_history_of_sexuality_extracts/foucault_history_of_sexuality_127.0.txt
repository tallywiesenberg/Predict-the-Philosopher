She receives the proper honor from each of those who make 
use of Her.” But it was also necessary to be cautious each day 
during the whole life of the marriage: indeed, no one knew 
“what day or night” the deity would assist in a conception; 
hence “throughout the whole year and all one’s life,” espe¬ 
cially during the period of procreation, one must “be careful 
and avoid doing anything that voluntarily brings on sickness 
or involves insolence or injustice. Otherwise, one will neces¬ 
sarily stamp these effects on the souls and bodies of the em¬ 
bryos”; one ran the risk of “begetting offspring who are 
irregular, untrustworthy, and not at all straight in character 
or body.” 12 

The dangers that were suspected and hence the precautions 
that were recommended related to three important questions. 
The age of the parents, first of all. The age at which a man was 
thought to be capable of producing the finest offspring was 
relatively late: from thirty to thirty-five, according to Plato; 
whereas in the case of girls he limited the age for marriage to

the years between sixteen and twenty. 13 * The same chronologi¬ 
cal disparity appears in Aristotle; he holds it to be absolutely 
necessary in order to ensure a vigorous progeny, and he calcu¬ 
lates that with this age gap the husband and wife will arrive 
together at the age when fertility declines and when in any 
case it will hardly be desirable for procreation to take place. 
Moreover, children who are conceived during this period of 
life will offer the advantage of reaching the right age in time 
to relieve their parents’ burden in their declining years: 
“Women should therefore marry about the age of eighteen, 
and men at thirty-seven or thereabouts. If those ages are ob¬ 
served, union will begin while the bodies of both partners are 
still in their prime.” 15 

Another important question was the “diet” of parents: 
avoid excesses of course, be careful not to procreate in a state 
of drunkenness, but also follow a general and continuous regi¬ 
men. Xenophon praises Lycurgus’ legislation and measures 
that were taken to assure healthy offspring by providing for 
vigorous parents; girls who were destined to be mothers were 
not to drink wine, or if they did, only when it was diluted with 
water; bread and meats were carefully measured out to them;
