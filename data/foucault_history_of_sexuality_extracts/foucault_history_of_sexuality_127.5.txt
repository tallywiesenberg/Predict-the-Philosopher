like men, they were supposed to do physical exercises; Lycur¬ 
gus even instituted “races and trials of strength for women 
competitors and for men, believing that if both parents are 
strong they produce more vigorous offspring.” l6 t Aristotle, on 
the other hand, was against a strenuous athletic regimen; he 
preferred a regimen suitable for a citizen, one that ensured the 
disposition the citizen needed for his activity (euexia politike): 
“The best habit is one which comes midway between the 
athletic and the valetudinarian, some amount of exertion must 
therefore go to its making. But the exertion must not be vio¬ 
lent or specialized, as is the case with the athlete; it should

would give them the same kind of qualities.* 

As for the time of year or season that was most conducive 
to obtaining a fine progeny, it was seen as depending on a 
whole cluster of complex elements; it was no doubt precau¬ 
tions of this sort, among other things, that would occupy the 
attention of the women inspectors—in Plato’s scheme—who 
were to oversee the good conduct of married couples during 
the ten years within which they were required or allowed to 
procreate. 20 Aristotle mentions briefly the knowledge that the 
doctors of his day and the naturalists were capable of impart¬ 
ing on this subject. According to him, the husband and wife 
ought to acquaint themselves with all these lessons: “doctors 
can tell them all they need to know about the times of good 
physical condition” (according to convention, winter is best); 
as for the “physicists,” they “hold that the north wind is better 
than the south.” 21 

In view of all these obligatory precautions, it is clear that 
procreative practice required a great deal of attention, indeed 
a whole moral attitude, if one wished to avert all the dangers 
that threatened it and to achieve the desired results. Plato
