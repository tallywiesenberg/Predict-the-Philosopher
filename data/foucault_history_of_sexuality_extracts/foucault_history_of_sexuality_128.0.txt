insists that both spouses must keep in mind (dianoeisthai) that 
they are expected to present the city with “the noblest and best 
children possible.” They should earnestly reflect on the task, 
guided by the principle that human beings accomplish what 
they set out to do “if they reflect intelligently upon themselves 
and the deed itself,” whereas they fail “if they don’t apply 
their intelligence to it, or if they lack intelligence.” Therefore, 
“the groom should reflect intelligently [prosecheto ton noun ]

do likewise—especially during the time when they don’t yet 

* According to Xenophon, it was so that they might have vigorous offspring that the

“With this restriction on intercourse the desire of the one for the other must necessar¬

have children.” 22 We may recall in this connection an observa¬ 
tion that appears in the Aristotelian Problems: if it is so often 
the case that the children of human beings do not resemble 
their parents, the reason is that the latter, at the time of the 
sexual act, had many other things on their minds instead of 
thinking only of what they were doing at that moment. 23 Later 
on, in the world of the flesh, it would be a rule necessary for 
justifying the sexual act, that it must be performed with a 
single purpose in mind, that of procreation. Here, however, 
such an intention was not necessary in order for sexual inter¬ 
course to avoid being a mortal sin. Yet, in order for it to 
achieve its aim, enabling the individual to live on in his chil¬ 
dren and to contribute to the security of the city, a whole 
mental endeavor was necessary: an unfailing concern for the 
dangers that surrounded the use of pleasures, threatening the 
purpose that nature gave them.* 

* Plato, in the Laws, would have women lead a life sheltered from overly intense 
pleasures and pains.”
