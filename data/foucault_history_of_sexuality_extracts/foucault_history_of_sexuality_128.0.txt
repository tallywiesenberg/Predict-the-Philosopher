insists that both spouses must keep in mind (dianoeisthai) that 
they are expected to present the city with “the noblest and best 
children possible.” They should earnestly reflect on the task, 
guided by the principle that human beings accomplish what 
they set out to do “if they reflect intelligently upon themselves 
and the deed itself,” whereas they fail “if they don’t apply 
their intelligence to it, or if they lack intelligence.” Therefore, 
“the groom should reflect intelligently [prosecheto ton noun ] 
on the bride and the making of children and the bride should 
do likewise—especially during the time when they don’t yet 

* According to Xenophon, it was so that they might have vigorous offspring that the 
young married couples of Sparta were not supposed to have relations very often: 
“With this restriction on intercourse the desire of the one for the other must necessar¬ 
ily be increased, and their offspring was bound to be more vigorous than if they were 
surfeited with one another .” 19

have children.” 22 We may recall in this connection an observa¬ 
tion that appears in the Aristotelian Problems: if it is so often 
the case that the children of human beings do not resemble 
their parents, the reason is that the latter, at the time of the 
sexual act, had many other things on their minds instead of 
thinking only of what they were doing at that moment. 23 Later 
on, in the world of the flesh, it would be a rule necessary for 
justifying the sexual act, that it must be performed with a 
single purpose in mind, that of procreation. Here, however, 
such an intention was not necessary in order for sexual inter¬ 
course to avoid being a mortal sin. Yet, in order for it to 
achieve its aim, enabling the individual to live on in his chil¬ 
dren and to contribute to the security of the city, a whole 
mental endeavor was necessary: an unfailing concern for the 
dangers that surrounded the use of pleasures, threatening the 
purpose that nature gave them.* 

* Plato, in the Laws, would have women lead a life sheltered from overly intense 
pleasures and pains.”

And yet, while the use of pleasures constituted a problem 
in the individual’s relationship with his own body, and made 
it difficult to define a regimen for him, the reason lay not 
simply in the fact that this use was suspected of being the 
source of certain illnesses or that people feared its conse¬ 
quences for their offspring. The sexual act was certainly not 
perceived by the Greeks as an evil; for them it was not the 
object of a moral disqualification. But the texts bear witness 
to an anxiety concerning the activity itself. And this anxiety 
revolved around three focal points: the very form of the act, 
the cost it entailed, and the death to which it was linked. It 
would be a mistake to see in Greek thought only a positive 
valuation of the sexual act. Medical and philosophical reflec¬ 
tion describes it as posing a threat, through its violence, to the 
control and mastery that one ought to exercise over oneself; 
as sapping the strength the individual should conserve and 
maintain, through the exhaustion it caused; and as prefiguring 
the death of the individual while assuring the survival of the 
species. If the regimen of pleasures was important, this was 
not simply because excess might lead to an illness; it was 
because in sexual activity in general man’s mastery, strength, 
and life were at stake. To give this activity the rarefied and 
stylized form of a regimen was to ensure oneself against future 
ills; it was also to form, exercise, and prove oneself an individ¬ 
ual capable of controlling his violence and of allowing it to

operate within appropriate limits, of keeping the source of his 
energy within himself, and of accepting his death while pro¬ 
viding for the birth of his descendants. The physical regimen 
of the aphrodisia was a health precaution; at the same time, 
it was an exercise—an askesis —of existence.

aphrodisia when, in the Philebus, he described the effects of 
pleasure when it is mixed with a little distress: pleasure “takes
