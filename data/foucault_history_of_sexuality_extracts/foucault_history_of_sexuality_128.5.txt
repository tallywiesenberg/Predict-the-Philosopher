Act, Expenditure, 
Death 


And yet, while the use of pleasures constituted a problem 
in the individual’s relationship with his own body, and made 
it difficult to define a regimen for him, the reason lay not 
simply in the fact that this use was suspected of being the 
source of certain illnesses or that people feared its conse¬ 
quences for their offspring. The sexual act was certainly not 
perceived by the Greeks as an evil; for them it was not the 
object of a moral disqualification. But the texts bear witness 
to an anxiety concerning the activity itself. And this anxiety 
revolved around three focal points: the very form of the act, 
the cost it entailed, and the death to which it was linked. It 
would be a mistake to see in Greek thought only a positive 
valuation of the sexual act. Medical and philosophical reflec¬ 
tion describes it as posing a threat, through its violence, to the 
control and mastery that one ought to exercise over oneself; 
as sapping the strength the individual should conserve and 
maintain, through the exhaustion it caused; and as prefiguring 
the death of the individual while assuring the survival of the 
species. If the regimen of pleasures was important, this was 
not simply because excess might lead to an illness; it was 
because in sexual activity in general man’s mastery, strength, 
and life were at stake. To give this activity the rarefied and 
stylized form of a regimen was to ensure oneself against future 
ills; it was also to form, exercise, and prove oneself an individ¬ 
ual capable of controlling his violence and of allowing it to

energy within himself, and of accepting his death while pro¬ 
viding for the birth of his descendants. The physical regimen 
of the aphrodisia was a health precaution; at the same time, 
it was an exercise—an askesis —of existence. 

1. The violence of the act. Plato was thinking about the 
aphrodisia when, in the Philebus, he described the effects of 
pleasure when it is mixed with a little distress: pleasure “takes
