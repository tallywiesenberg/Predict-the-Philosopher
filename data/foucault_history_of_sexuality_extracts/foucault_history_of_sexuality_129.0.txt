possession of a man, sometimes making him leap about in 
ecstasy, so that he changes complexion, takes up all kinds of 
strange positions, pants in strange ways, and is driven com¬ 
pletely out of his senses with mad cries and shouts.... He feels 
bound to say to himself, as do others, that he is almost dying 
with enjoyment when he indulges in these delights. The more 
unrestrained and intemperate [ akolastoteros, aphronesteros ] 
he is, the more fervently he goes after them in wholehearted 
pursuit.” 1 

Hippocrates has been credited with the statement that or¬ 
gasm has the form of a brief epileptic seizure: at any rate, that 
is what Aulus Gellius reports: “Hippocrates, a man of divine 
wisdom, believed of venery [coitus venereus] that it was part 
of the horrible disease which our countrymen call comitalis, 
or the ‘election disease’; for these are his very words as they 
have come down to us: ‘coition is a brief epilepsy’ [ten synou- 
sian einai mikran epilepsian ].” 2 Actually the phrase comes 
from Democritus. The Hippocratic treatise The Seed, which 
in its first pages gives a detailed description of the sexual act, 
accords with another tradition, that of Diogenes of Apollonia; 
the model this tradition (also represented by Clement of Alex¬ 
andria) referred to was not the pathological model of epilepsy, 
but the mechanical model of a heated, foaming fluid: “Some 
people,” reports The Pedagogue, “suppose that the semen of 
living creatures is the foamy substance of the blood. The blood 
being greatly agitated during the intertwining of bodies, and 
heated by the natural warmth of the male, forms a froth and

spreads through the spermatic veins. According to Diogenes 
of Apollonia, this phenomenon would explain the term aphro- 
disia. ” 3 This general theme of fluids, agitation, and spreading 
foam is treated in The Seed from the Hippocratic collection, 
in the form of a description organized entirely around what 
might be called the “ejaculatory schema”; it is this schema 
that is carried over unchanged from man to woman, and used 
to decipher the relationships between male and female roles in 
terms of confrontation and contest, but also domination and 
regulation of the one by the other. 

The sexual act is analyzed, from start to finish, as a violent 
mechanical action that is directed toward the emission of 
sperm. 4 First, the rubbing of the genitals and the movement 
given to the whole body produce a general warming effect; the 
latter, combined with agitation, gives the humor, diffused into 
the whole body, a greater fluidity, so that it begins to “foam” 
(aphrein), “in the same way as all other fluids produce foam 
when they are agitated.” At this stage a phenomenon of “sepa¬ 
ration” (apokrisis) occurs; the most vigorous part of this 
foaming fluid, “the most potent and the richest” (to ischyrota- 
ton kaipiotaton) is carried to the brain and the spinal marrow, 
descending its length to the loins. Then the warm foam passes 
to the kidneys and from there through the testicles to the 
penis, from which it is expelled by means of a violent spasm 
(tarache). This process, which is voluntary at the beginning 
when there is sexual union and “rubbing of the genitals,” can 
also unfold in an entirely involuntary manner. This is what 
occurs in the case of nocturnal emission, an occurrence men¬ 
tioned by the author of The Seed: when work or another 
activity has caused the body to be heated, the fluid starts to 
produce foam spontaneously; it “behaves as in coition,” and 
ejaculation takes place, accompanied by dream images, no 
doubt following the frequently invoked principle that dreams, 
or at least some of them, reveal the current state of the body. 5 

The Hippocratic description establishes a general isomor¬ 
phism between the man’s sexual act and that of the woman.

The Use of Pleasure 


The process is the same, except that in the case of the woman 
the heating starts in the womb stimulated by the male sex 
organ during intercourse: “In the case of women, it is my 
contention that when during intercourse the vagina is rubbed 
and the womb is disturbed, an irritation is set up in the womb 
which produces pleasure and heat in the rest of the body. A 
woman also releases something from her body, sometimes into 
the womb, and sometimes externally as well.” 6 There is the 
same type of substance and the same formation (sperm formed 
from blood through warming and separation); there is also the 
same mechanism and the same terminal act of ejaculation. 
The author does bring out certain differences, however, relat¬ 
ing not to the nature of the act but to its peculiar violence, and 
to the intensity and duration of the pleasure that accompanies 
it. In the act itself, the woman’s pleasure is much less intense 
than that of the man, because in the case of the latter the
