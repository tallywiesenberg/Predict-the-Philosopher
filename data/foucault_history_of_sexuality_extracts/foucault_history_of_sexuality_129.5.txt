sperm. 4 First, the rubbing of the genitals and the movement 
given to the whole body produce a general warming effect; the 
latter, combined with agitation, gives the humor, diffused into 
the whole body, a greater fluidity, so that it begins to “foam” 
(aphrein), “in the same way as all other fluids produce foam 
when they are agitated.” At this stage a phenomenon of “sepa¬ 
ration” (apokrisis) occurs; the most vigorous part of this 
foaming fluid, “the most potent and the richest” (to ischyrota- 
ton kaipiotaton) is carried to the brain and the spinal marrow, 
descending its length to the loins. Then the warm foam passes 
to the kidneys and from there through the testicles to the 
penis, from which it is expelled by means of a violent spasm 
(tarache). This process, which is voluntary at the beginning 
when there is sexual union and “rubbing of the genitals,” can 
also unfold in an entirely involuntary manner. This is what 
occurs in the case of nocturnal emission, an occurrence men¬ 
tioned by the author of The Seed: when work or another 
activity has caused the body to be heated, the fluid starts to 
produce foam spontaneously; it “behaves as in coition,” and 
ejaculation takes place, accompanied by dream images, no 
doubt following the frequently invoked principle that dreams, 
or at least some of them, reveal the current state of the body. 5 

The Hippocratic description establishes a general isomor¬ 
phism between the man’s sexual act and that of the woman.

The Use of Pleasure 


The process is the same, except that in the case of the woman 
the heating starts in the womb stimulated by the male sex 
organ during intercourse: “In the case of women, it is my 
contention that when during intercourse the vagina is rubbed 
and the womb is disturbed, an irritation is set up in the womb 
which produces pleasure and heat in the rest of the body. A 
woman also releases something from her body, sometimes into 
the womb, and sometimes externally as well.” 6 There is the 
same type of substance and the same formation (sperm formed 
from blood through warming and separation); there is also the 
same mechanism and the same terminal act of ejaculation. 
The author does bring out certain differences, however, relat¬ 
ing not to the nature of the act but to its peculiar violence, and 
to the intensity and duration of the pleasure that accompanies 
it. In the act itself, the woman’s pleasure is much less intense 
than that of the man, because in the case of the latter the
