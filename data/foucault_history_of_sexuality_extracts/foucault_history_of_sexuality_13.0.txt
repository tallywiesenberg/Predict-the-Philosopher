Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, 
the thematics of blood was sometimes called on to lend its 
entire historical weight toward revitalizing the type of politi¬ 
cal power that was exercised through the devices of sexuality.Racism took shape at this point (racism in its modern, “bi¬ 
ologizing,” statist form): it was then that a whole politics of 
settlement (peuplement), family, marriage, education, social 
hierarchization, and property, accompanied by a long series 
of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct, 
health, and everyday life, received their color and their jus¬

fantasies of blood and the paroxysms of a disciplinary power.A eugenic ordering of society, with all that implied in the 
way of extension and intensification of micro-powers, in the

risk of exposing oneself to a total sacrifice.It is an irony of 
history that the Hitlerite politics of sex remained an insignifi¬ 
cant practice while the blood myth was transformed into the 
greatest blood bath in recent memory.
