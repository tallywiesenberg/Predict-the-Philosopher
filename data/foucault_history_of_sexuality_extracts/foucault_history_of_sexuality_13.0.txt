barely furtive pleasures between simple-minded adults and 
alert children, a whole machinery for speechifying, analyz¬ 
ing, and investigating. 

Between the licentious Englishman, who earnestly re¬ 
corded for his own purposes the singular episodes of his 
secret life, and his contemporary, this village halfwit who 
would give a few pennies to the little girls for favors the older 
ones refused him, there was without doubt a profound con¬ 
nection: in any case, from one extreme to the other, sex 
became something to say, and to say exhaustively in accord¬ 
ance with deployments that were varied, but all, in their own 
way, compelling. Whether in the form of a subtle confession 
in confidence or an authoritarian interrogation, sex—be it 
refined or rustic—had to be put into words. A great polymor¬ 
phous injunction bound the Englishman and the poor Lor- 
rainese peasant alike. As history would have it, the latter was 
named Jouy.* 

Since the eighteenth century, sex has not ceased to pro¬ 
voke a kind of generalized discursive erethism. And these 
discourses on sex did not multiply apart from or against 
power, but in the very space and as the means of its exercise. 
Incitements to speak were orchestrated from all quarters, 

*Jouy sounds like the past participle of jouir, the French verb meaning to enjoy, 
to delight in (something), but also to have an orgasm, to come. (Translator’s note)

apparatuses everywhere for listening and recording, proce¬ 
dures for observing, questioning, and formulating. Sex was 
driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive 
existence. From the singular imperialism that compels every¬ 
one to transform their sexuality into a perpetual discourse, 
to the manifold mechanisms which, in the areas of economy, 
pedagogy, medicine, and justice, incite, extract, distribute, 
and institutionalize the sexual discourse, an immense verbos¬ 
ity is what our civilization has required and organized. 
Surely no other type of society has ever accumulated—and 
in such a relatively short span of time—a similar quantity of 
discourses concerned with sex. It may well be that we talk 
about sex more than anything else; we set our minds to the 
task; we convince ourselves that we have never said enough 
on the subject, that, through inertia or submissiveness, we 
conceal from ourselves the blinding evidence, and that what 
is essential always eludes us, so that we must always start out 
once again in search of it. It is possible that where sex is 
concerned, the most long-winded, the most impatient of soci¬ 
eties is our own. 

But as this first overview shows, we are dealing less with 
a discourse on sex than with a multiplicity of discourses 
produced by a whole series of mechanisms operating in diff¬ 
erent institutions. The Middle Ages had organized around 
the theme of the flesh and the practice of penance a discourse 
that was markedly unitary. In the course of recent centuries, 
this relative uniformity was broken apart, scattered, and 
multiplied in an explosion of distinct discursivities which 
took form in demography, biology, medicine, psychiatry, 
psychology, ethics, pedagogy, and political criticism. More 
precisely, the secure bond that held together the moral theol¬ 
ogy of concupiscence and the obligation of confession (equiv¬ 
alent to the theoretical discourse on sex and its first-person 
formulation) was, if not broken, at least loosened and diver¬ 
sified: between the objectification of sex in rational dis¬ 
courses, and the movement by which each individual was set

The History of Sexuality 


to the task of recounting his own sex, there has occurred, 
since the eighteenth century, a whole series of tensions, con¬ 
flicts, efforts at adjustment, and attempts at retranscription. 
So it is not simply in terms of a continual extension that we 
must speak of this discursive growth; it should be seen rather 
as a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated, 
a diversification of their forms, and the complex deployment 
of the network connecting them. Rather than the uniform 
concern to hide sex, rather than a general prudishness of 
language, what distinguishes these last three centuries is the 
variety, the wide dispersion of devices that were invented for 
speaking about it, for having it be spoken about, for inducing 
it to speak of itself, for listening, recording, transcribing, and 
Redistributing what is said about it: around sex, a whole 
network of varying, specific, and coercive transpositions into 
discourse. Rather than a massive censorship, beginning with 
the verbal proprieties imposed by the Age of Reason, what 
was involved was a regulated and polymorphous incitement
