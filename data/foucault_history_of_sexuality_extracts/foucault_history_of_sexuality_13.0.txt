barely furtive pleasures between simple-minded adults and 
alert children, a whole machinery for speechifying, analyz¬ 
ing, and investigating. 

Between the licentious Englishman, who earnestly re¬ 
corded for his own purposes the singular episodes of his 
secret life, and his contemporary, this village halfwit who 
would give a few pennies to the little girls for favors the older 
ones refused him, there was without doubt a profound con¬ 
nection: in any case, from one extreme to the other, sex 
became something to say, and to say exhaustively in accord¬ 
ance with deployments that were varied, but all, in their own 
way, compelling. Whether in the form of a subtle confession 
in confidence or an authoritarian interrogation, sex—be it 
refined or rustic—had to be put into words. A great polymor¬ 
phous injunction bound the Englishman and the poor Lor- 
rainese peasant alike. As history would have it, the latter was 
named Jouy.* 

Since the eighteenth century, sex has not ceased to pro¬ 
voke a kind of generalized discursive erethism. And these 
discourses on sex did not multiply apart from or against 
power, but in the very space and as the means of its exercise. 
Incitements to speak were orchestrated from all quarters,

dures for observing, questioning, and formulating. Sex was 
driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive 
existence. From the singular imperialism that compels every¬ 
one to transform their sexuality into a perpetual discourse, 
to the manifold mechanisms which, in the areas of economy, 
pedagogy, medicine, and justice, incite, extract, distribute, 
and institutionalize the sexual discourse, an immense verbos¬ 
ity is what our civilization has required and organized. 
Surely no other type of society has ever accumulated—and 
in such a relatively short span of time—a similar quantity of 
discourses concerned with sex. It may well be that we talk 
about sex more than anything else; we set our minds to the 
task; we convince ourselves that we have never said enough
