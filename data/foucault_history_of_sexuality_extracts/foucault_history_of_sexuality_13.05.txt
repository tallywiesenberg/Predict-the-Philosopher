At the opposite extreme, starting from this same end of the 
nineteenth century, we can trace the theoretical effort to 
reinscribe the thematic of sexuality in the system of law, the 
symbolic order, and sovereignty.It is to the political credit 
of psychoanalysis—or at least, of what was most coherent in 
it—that it regarded with suspicion (and this from its incep¬ 
tion, that is, from the moment it broke away from the neu¬ 
ropsychiatry of degenerescence) the irrevocably proliferating 
aspects which might be contained in these power mech¬ 
anisms aimed at controlling and administering the everyday 
life of sexuality: whence the Freudian endeavor (out of reac¬ 
tion no doubt to the great surge of racism that was contem¬ 
porary with it) to ground sexuality in the law—the law of 
alliance, tabooed consanguinity, and the Sovereign-Father, 
in short, to surround desire with all the trappings of the old 
order of power.It was owing to this that psychoanalysis was 
—in the main, with a few exceptions—in theoretical and 
practical opposition to fascism.But this position of psychoa¬ 
nalysis was tied to a specific historical conjuncture.And yet, 
to conceive the category of the sexual in terms of the law, 
death, blood, and sovereignty—whatever the references 
to Sade and Bataille, and however one might gauge their 
“subversive” influence—is in the last analysis a historical 
“retro-version.” We must conceptualize the deployment of 
sexuality on the basis of the techniques of power that are 
contemporary with it.
