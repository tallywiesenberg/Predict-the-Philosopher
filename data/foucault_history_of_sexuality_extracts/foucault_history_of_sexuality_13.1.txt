biologically established existence of sexual functions for the 
benefit of phenomena that are variable, perhaps, but fragile, 
secondary, and ultimately superficial; and that I speak of 
sexuality as if sex did not exist.And one would be entitled 
to object as follows: “You claim to analyze in detail the 
processes by which women’s bodies, the lives of children, 
family relationships, and an entire network of social relations 
were sexualized.You wish to describe that great awakening 
of sexual concern since the eighteenth century and our grow¬ 
ing eagerness to suspect the presence of sex in everything.Let 
us admit as much and suppose that the mechanisms of power 
were in fact used more to arouse and ‘excite’ sexuality than 
to repress it.But here you remain quite near to the thing you 
no doubt believe you have gotten away from; at bottom, 
when you point out phenomena of diffusion, anchorage, and 
fixation of sexuality, you are trying to reveal what might be 
called the organization of ‘erotic zones’ in the social body; it 
may well be the case that you have done nothing more than 
transpose to the level of diffuse processes mechanisms which 
psychoanalysis has identified with precision at the level of the 
individual.
