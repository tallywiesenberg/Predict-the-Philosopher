But you pass over the thing on the basis of which 
this sexualization was able to develop and which psychoanal¬ 
ysis does not fail to recognize—namely, sex.Before Freud, 
one sought to localize sexuality as closely as possible: in sex, 
in its reproductive functions, in its immediate anatomical 
localizations; one fell back upon a biological minimum: 
organ, instinct, and finality.You, on the other hand, are in 
a symmetrical and inverse position: for you, there remain 
only groundless effects, ramifications without roots, a sexual¬ 
ity without a sex.What is this if not castration once again?” 

Here we need to distinguish between two questions.First, 
does the analysis of sexuality necessarily imply the elision of 
the body, anatomy, the biological, the functional?
