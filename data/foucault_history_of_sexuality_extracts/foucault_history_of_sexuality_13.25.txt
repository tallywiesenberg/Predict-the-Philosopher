That sexuality is not, in relation to power, an 
exterior domain to which power is applied, that on the con¬ 
trary it is a result and an instrument of power’s designs, is 
all very well.But as for sex, is it not the “other” with respect 
to power, while being the center around which sexuality 
distributes its effects?Now, it is precisely this idea of sex in 
itself that we cannot accept without examination.Is “sex” 
really the anchorage point that supports the manifestations 
of sexuality, or is it not rather a complex idea that was 
formed inside the deployment of sexuality?In any case, one 
could show how this idea of sex took form in the different 
strategies of power and the definite role it played therein.
