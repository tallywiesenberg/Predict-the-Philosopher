All along the great lines which the development of the 
deployment of sexuality has followed since the nineteenth 
century, one sees the elaboration of this idea that there exists 
something other than bodies, organs, somatic localizations, 
functions, anatomo-physiological systems, sensations, and

pleasures; something else and something more, with intrinsic 
properties and laws of its own: “sex.” Thus, in the process 
of hysterization of women, “sex” was defined in three ways: 
as that which belongs in common to men and women; as that 
which belongs, par excellence, to men, and hence is lacking 
in women; but at the same time, as that which by itself 
constitutes woman’s body, ordering it wholly in terms of the 
functions of reproduction and keeping it in constant agita¬ 
tion through the effects of that very function.Hysteria was 
interpreted in this strategy as the movement of sex insofar as 
it was the “one” and the “other,” whole and part, principle 
and lack.In the sexualization of childhood, there was formed 
the idea of a sex that was both present (from the evidence of 
anatomy) and absent (from the standpoint of physiology), 
present too if one considered its activity, and deficient if one 
referred to its reproductive finality; or again, actual in its 
manifestations, but hidden in its eventual effects, whose path¬ 
ological seriousness would only become apparent later.If the 
sex of the child was still present in the adult, it was in the 
form of a secret causality that tended to nullify the sex of the 
latter (it was one of the tenets of eighteenth- and nineteenth- 
century medicine that precocious sex would eventually result 
in sterility, impotence, frigidity, the inability to experience 
pleasure, or the deadening of the senses); by sexualizing 
childhood, the idea was established of a sex characterized 
essentially by the interplay of presence and absence, the visi¬ 
ble and the hidden; masturbation and the effects imputed to 
it were thought to reveal in a privileged way this interplay 
of presence and absence, of the visible and the hidden.In the psychiatrization of perversions, sex was related to 
biological functions and to an anatomo-physiological ma¬ 
chinery that gave it its “meaning,” that is, its finality; but it 
was also referred to an instinct which, through its peculiar 
development and according to the objects to which it could 
become attached, made it possible for perverse behavior pat¬ 
terns to arise and made their genesis intelligible.
