Through a reversal 
that doubtless had its surreptitious beginnings long ago—it 
was already making itself felt at the time of the Christian 
pastoral of the flesh—we have arrived at the point where we 
expect our intelligibility to come from what was for many 
centuries thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body 
from what was long considered its stigma and likened to a 
wound; our identity from what was perceived as an obscure 
and nameless urge.Hence the importance we ascribe to it, 
the reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we 
take to know it.Hence the fact that over the centuries it has 
become more important than our soul, more important al¬ 
most than our life; and so it is that all the world’s enigmas 
appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in 
each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than 
any other.The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been 
instilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as 
follows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the 
truth and the sovereignty of sex.Sex is worth dying for.
