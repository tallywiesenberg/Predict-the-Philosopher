It 
is in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued 
with the death instinct.When a long while ago the West 
discovered love, it bestowed on it a value high enough to 
make death acceptable; nowadays it is sex that claims this 
equivalence, the highest of all.And while the deployment of 
sexuality permits the techniques of power to invest life, the 
fictitious point of sex, itself marked by that deployment, 
exerts enough charm on everyone for them to accept hearing 
the grumble of death within it.By creating the imaginary element that is “sex,” the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality established one of its most essential 
internal operating principles: the desire for sex—the desire to 
have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to 
articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth.It con¬ 
stituted “sex” itself as something desirable.
