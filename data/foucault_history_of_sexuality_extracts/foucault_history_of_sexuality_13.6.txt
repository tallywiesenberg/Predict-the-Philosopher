Right of Death and Power over Life

desirability of sex that attaches each one of us to the injunc¬ 
tion to know it, to reveal its law and its power; it is this 
desirability that makes us think we are affirming the rights 
of our sex against all power, when in fact we are fastened to 
the deployment of sexuality that has lifted up from deep 
within us a sort of mirage in which we think we see ourselves 
reflected—the dark shimmer of sex.“It is sex,” said Kate in The Plumed Serpent.“How won¬ 
derful sex can be, when men keep it powerful and sacred, and 
it fills the world!like sunshine through and through one!” 

So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency 
of sex; but rather show how “sex” is historically subordinate 
to sexuality.We must not place sex on the side of reality, and 
sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is 
a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the 
notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its opera¬ 
tion.
