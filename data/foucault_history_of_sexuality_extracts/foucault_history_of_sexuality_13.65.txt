We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says 
no to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid 
out by the general deployment of sexuality.It is the agency 
of sex that we must break away from, if we aim—through a 
tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality—to 
counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleas¬ 
ures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibil¬ 
ity of resistance.The rallying point for the counterattack 
against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex- 
desire, but bodies and pleasures.“There has been so much action in the past,” said D. H. 
Lawrence, “especially sexual action, a wearying repetition 
over and over, without a corresponding thought, a corre¬ 
sponding realization.Now our business is to realize sex.
