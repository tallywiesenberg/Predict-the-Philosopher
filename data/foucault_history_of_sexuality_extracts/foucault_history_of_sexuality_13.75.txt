And 
what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and 
the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the 
centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling 
sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon 
sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when 
in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality.People will be amused at the reproach of pansexualism

the good genius of Freud had placed it at one of the critical 
points marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the 
strategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effec¬ 
tive he was—worthy of the greatest spiritual fathers and 
directors of the classical period—in giving a new impetus to 
the secular injunction to study sex and transform it into 
discourse.
