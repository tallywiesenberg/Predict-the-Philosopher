We are often reminded of the countless procedures 
which Christianity once employed to make us detest the 
body; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for 
centuries to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it 
desirable and everything said about it precious.Let us con¬ 
sider the stratagems by which we were induced to apply all 
our skills to discovering its secrets, by which we were at¬ 
tached to the obligation to draw out its truth, and made 
guilty for having failed to recognize it for so long.These 
devices are what ought to make us wonder today.Moreover, 
we need to consider the possibility that one day, perhaps, in 
a different economy of bodies and pleasures, people will no 
longer quite understand how the ruses of sexuality, and the 
power that sustains its organization, were able to subject us 
to that austere monarchy of sex, so that we became dedicated 
to the endless task of forcing its secret, of exacting the truest 
of confessions from a shadow.The irony of this deployment is in having us believe that 
our “liberation” is in the balance.
