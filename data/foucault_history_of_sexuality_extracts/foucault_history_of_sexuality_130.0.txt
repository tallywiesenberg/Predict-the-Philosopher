excretion of fluid occurs abruptly and with much greater vio¬ 
lence. In the case of the woman, on the other hand, the pleas¬ 
ure begins at the start of the act and lasts as long as intercourse 
itself. Throughout intercourse her pleasure depends on the 
man; it does not cease until “the man releases the woman”; 
and if she happens to reach orgasm before him, this does not 
mean her pleasure ends—it is only experienced in a different 
way. 7 

Between these two acts having the same form in the man 
and in the woman, the Hippocratic text posits a relation that 
is causal and competitive at the same time: a contest, as it 
were, where the male plays the role of instigator and where he 
should always have the final victory. In order to explain the 
effects of the man’s pleasure on that of the woman, the text 
appeals—as do other, no doubt ancient passages from the 
Hippocratic collection—to the two elements of water and fire, 
and to the reciprocal effects of heat and cold; the male liquor 
sometimes acts as the stimulant, sometimes as the dampener; 
as for the female element, always hot, it is sometimes repre-

sented by flame and sometimes by a liquid. If the woman’s 
pleasure intensifies “at the moment the sperm arrives in the 
womb,” this happens in the way a flame suddenly flares up 
when one pours wine on it; if, on the other hand, the man’s 
ejaculation puts an end to the woman’s pleasure, it is like 
pouring a cold liquid on very hot water: the boiling stops 
immediately. 8 Two similar acts, therefore, bringing analogous 
substances into play, but substances endowed with opposing 
qualities that confront one another in sexual union: force 
against force, cold water against boiling, alcohol on a flame. 
But, in any case, it is the male act that determines, regulates, 
stimulates, dominates. It is the male act, too, that ensures the 
health of the female organs by ensuring that they function 
properly: “If women have intercourse with men their health 
is better than if they do not. For in the first place, the womb 
is moistened by intercourse, whereas when the womb is drier 
than it should be it becomes extremely contracted, and this 
extreme contraction causes pain to the body. In the second 
place, intercourse by heating the blood and rendering it more 
fluid gives an easier passage to the menses; whereas if the 
menses do not flow, women’s bodies become prone to sick¬ 
ness.” 9 For the woman’s body, penetration by the man and 
absorption of sperm are the primary source of the equilibrium 
of its qualities and the key stimulus for the necessary flow of 
its humors. 

This “ejaculatory schema,” through which sexual activity 
as a whole—and in both sexes—was always perceived, shows 
unmistakably the near-exclusive domination of the virile 
model. The female act was not exactly the complement of the 
male act; it was more in the nature of a duplicate, but in the 
form of a weakened version that depended on the male act 
both for health and for pleasure. By focusing entirely on this 
moment of emission—of foamy excretion, seen as the essential 
part of the act—one placed at the core of sexual activity a 
process that was characterized by its violence, an all but irre-

pressible mechanics, and a force that escaped control. But one 
also raised—as an important problem in the use of pleasures 
—a question of economy and expenditure. 

2. Expenditure. The sexual act extracted from the body a 
substance that was capable of imparting life, but only because 
it was itself tied to the existence of the individual and claimed 
a portion of that existence. By expelling their semen, living 
creatures did not just evacuate a surplus fluid, they deprived 
themselves of elements that were valuable for their own 
existence. 

All the various authors do not give the same explanation for 
this preciousness of the sperm. The Seed seems to refer to two 
conceptions of the origin of sperm. According to one of these, 
it originates in the head: formed in the brain, it descends via 
the marrow to the lower parts of the body. By Diogenes 
Laertius’ account, this was the general principle of the Py¬ 
thagorean conception: the sperm was held to be “a clot of 
brain containing hot vapor within it”; from that fragment of 
matter the whole body would subsequently be formed, with its 
“flesh, sinews, bones, hairs”; from the hot ether that it con¬ 
tained, the soul of the embryo would be born, along with 
sensation. 10 This privileging of the head in the formation of 
semen is echoed in the Hippocratic text, where there is the 
statement that for men who have had an incision made next
