ness.” 9 For the woman’s body, penetration by the man and 
absorption of sperm are the primary source of the equilibrium 
of its qualities and the key stimulus for the necessary flow of 
its humors. 

This “ejaculatory schema,” through which sexual activity 
as a whole—and in both sexes—was always perceived, shows 
unmistakably the near-exclusive domination of the virile 
model. The female act was not exactly the complement of the 
male act; it was more in the nature of a duplicate, but in the 
form of a weakened version that depended on the male act 
both for health and for pleasure. By focusing entirely on this 
moment of emission—of foamy excretion, seen as the essential 
part of the act—one placed at the core of sexual activity a 
process that was characterized by its violence, an all but irre-

pressible mechanics, and a force that escaped control. But one 
also raised—as an important problem in the use of pleasures 
—a question of economy and expenditure. 

2. Expenditure. The sexual act extracted from the body a 
substance that was capable of imparting life, but only because 
it was itself tied to the existence of the individual and claimed 
a portion of that existence. By expelling their semen, living 
creatures did not just evacuate a surplus fluid, they deprived 
themselves of elements that were valuable for their own 
existence. 

All the various authors do not give the same explanation for 
this preciousness of the sperm. The Seed seems to refer to two 
conceptions of the origin of sperm. According to one of these, 
it originates in the head: formed in the brain, it descends via 
the marrow to the lower parts of the body. By Diogenes 
Laertius’ account, this was the general principle of the Py¬ 
thagorean conception: the sperm was held to be “a clot of 
brain containing hot vapor within it”; from that fragment of 
matter the whole body would subsequently be formed, with its 
“flesh, sinews, bones, hairs”; from the hot ether that it con¬ 
tained, the soul of the embryo would be born, along with 
sensation. 10 This privileging of the head in the formation of 
semen is echoed in the Hippocratic text, where there is the 
statement that for men who have had an incision made next
