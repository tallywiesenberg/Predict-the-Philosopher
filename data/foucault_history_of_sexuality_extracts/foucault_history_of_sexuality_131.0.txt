to the ear, while they remain capable of sexual intercourse, 
they have a semen that is small in quantity, weak, and sterile: 
“For the greater part of the sperm travels from the head past 
the ears into the spinal marrow: now when the incision has 
formed a scar, this passage becomes obstructed.” 11 But this 
importance given to the head is not incompatible, in the trea¬ 
tise The Seed, with the general principle that semen issues 
from the body as a whole: a man’s sperm “comes from all the 
fluid in the body” through “veins and nerves which extend 
from every part of the body through the penis”; it is secreted 
“from the whole body—from the hard parts as well as the soft,

and from the total bodily fluid” in its four forms. 12 A woman 
also “ejaculates from the entire body”; and if boys and girls 
are not able to secrete semen before puberty, this is because 
at that age the veins are so small and narrow that they “pre¬ 
vent the passage of sperm.” 13 In any case, emanating from the 
whole body, or coming for the most part from the head, semen 
is regarded as the result of a process that separates, isolates, 
and concentrates “the most potent part” of the bodily fluid: 
to ischyrotaton. This force is manifested in the rich and foamy 
nature of semen, and in the violence with which it is expelled; 
it is also evidenced by the weakness that is always felt after 
coition, however small the amount excreted. 14 

Actually, the origin of semen remained a topic of debate in 
the medical and philosophical literature. But no matter what 
explanations were submitted, they had to account for what 
enabled semen to transmit life, to give rise to another living 
creature. And where did the seminal substance get its potency 
if not from the source of life that was found in the individual 
from whom it came? The life that it imparted had to have been 
borrowed and separated from the living being where it origi¬ 
nated. In every emission of sperm there was something that 
issued, and was withdrawn, from the most precious elements 
of the individual. The creator in the Timaeus thus rooted this 
seed in what constituted, for humans, the nexus of the body 
and the soul, of death and immortality. This nexus was the 
marrow (which, in its round cranial part, housed the seat of 
the immortal soul): “For it was in this that the bonds of life 
by which the soul is bound to the body were fastened, and 
implanted the roots of the mortal kind.” 15 From this source 
flowed, via the two dorsal veins, the moisture which the body 
needed and which remained enclosed within it; this was also 
the source of the semen that was emitted through the sex 
organ to conceive another individual. Living beings and their 
offspring had one and the same life principle. 

Aristotle’s analysis is very different from those of both Plato 
and Hippocrates. Different as to localizations, different as to

mechanisms. And yet here, too, one finds the same principle 
of precious loss. In the Generation of Animals, the sperm is 
explained as the residue (perittoma) of nutriment: the end 
product, concentrated in very small quantities and useful in 
the same way as is the raw material for growth that the 
organism draws from food. For Aristotle, in fact, the final 
processing of what alimentation brings into the body furnishes 
a material, one portion of which is conveyed to all parts of the 
body, causing them to grow, imperceptibly, every day—while 
the other portion awaits the expulsion that will enable it, once 
inside the womb of a woman, to give rise to the formation of 
an embryo. 16 The development and reproduction of the indi¬ 
vidual thus depend on the same elements and have their 
source in the same substance. The growth elements and the 
seminal fluid are doublets resulting from an alimentary proc¬ 
essing that maintains the life of one individual and makes 
possible the birth of another. Given these conditions, it is 
understandable that the discharge of this semen constitutes an 
important event for the body: it withdraws a substance that 
is precious, being the end result of a lengthy distillation by the 
organism and concentrating elements which, in accordance 
with nature, might have gone “to all parts of the body,” and 
hence might have made it grow if they had not been removed 
from the body. It is also understandable why this discharge— 
which is entirely possible at an age when a human being needs 
only to renew his organism without having to develop it—does 
not take place in early youth when all the resources of nourish¬ 
ment are used for development; at that age, “all the nutriment 
is used up too soon,” says Aristotle; it is understandable, too, 
that in old age, the production of sperm slows down: “The 
organism does not concoct enough.” 17 The entire life of the 
individual—from youth, when one needs to grow, to old age, 
when one has so much trouble sustaining oneself—is marked
