to the ear, while they remain capable of sexual intercourse, 
they have a semen that is small in quantity, weak, and sterile: 
“For the greater part of the sperm travels from the head past 
the ears into the spinal marrow: now when the incision has 
formed a scar, this passage becomes obstructed.” 11 But this 
importance given to the head is not incompatible, in the trea¬ 
tise The Seed, with the general principle that semen issues 
from the body as a whole: a man’s sperm “comes from all the 
fluid in the body” through “veins and nerves which extend 
from every part of the body through the penis”; it is secreted 
“from the whole body—from the hard parts as well as the soft,

and from the total bodily fluid” in its four forms. 12 A woman 
also “ejaculates from the entire body”; and if boys and girls 
are not able to secrete semen before puberty, this is because 
at that age the veins are so small and narrow that they “pre¬ 
vent the passage of sperm.” 13 In any case, emanating from the 
whole body, or coming for the most part from the head, semen 
is regarded as the result of a process that separates, isolates, 
and concentrates “the most potent part” of the bodily fluid: 
to ischyrotaton. This force is manifested in the rich and foamy 
nature of semen, and in the violence with which it is expelled; 
it is also evidenced by the weakness that is always felt after 
coition, however small the amount excreted. 14 

Actually, the origin of semen remained a topic of debate in 
the medical and philosophical literature. But no matter what 
explanations were submitted, they had to account for what 
enabled semen to transmit life, to give rise to another living 
creature. And where did the seminal substance get its potency 
if not from the source of life that was found in the individual 
from whom it came? The life that it imparted had to have been 
borrowed and separated from the living being where it origi¬ 
nated. In every emission of sperm there was something that 
issued, and was withdrawn, from the most precious elements 
of the individual. The creator in the Timaeus thus rooted this 
seed in what constituted, for humans, the nexus of the body 
and the soul, of death and immortality. This nexus was the 
marrow (which, in its round cranial part, housed the seat of 
the immortal soul): “For it was in this that the bonds of life 
by which the soul is bound to the body were fastened, and 
implanted the roots of the mortal kind.” 15 From this source
