flowed, via the two dorsal veins, the moisture which the body 
needed and which remained enclosed within it; this was also 
the source of the semen that was emitted through the sex 
organ to conceive another individual. Living beings and their 
offspring had one and the same life principle. 

Aristotle’s analysis is very different from those of both Plato 
and Hippocrates. Different as to localizations, different as to

mechanisms. And yet here, too, one finds the same principle 
of precious loss. In the Generation of Animals, the sperm is 
explained as the residue (perittoma) of nutriment: the end 
product, concentrated in very small quantities and useful in 
the same way as is the raw material for growth that the 
organism draws from food. For Aristotle, in fact, the final 
processing of what alimentation brings into the body furnishes 
a material, one portion of which is conveyed to all parts of the 
body, causing them to grow, imperceptibly, every day—while 
the other portion awaits the expulsion that will enable it, once 
inside the womb of a woman, to give rise to the formation of 
an embryo. 16 The development and reproduction of the indi¬ 
vidual thus depend on the same elements and have their 
source in the same substance. The growth elements and the 
seminal fluid are doublets resulting from an alimentary proc¬ 
essing that maintains the life of one individual and makes 
possible the birth of another. Given these conditions, it is 
understandable that the discharge of this semen constitutes an 
important event for the body: it withdraws a substance that 
is precious, being the end result of a lengthy distillation by the 
organism and concentrating elements which, in accordance 
with nature, might have gone “to all parts of the body,” and 
hence might have made it grow if they had not been removed 
from the body. It is also understandable why this discharge— 
which is entirely possible at an age when a human being needs 
only to renew his organism without having to develop it—does 
not take place in early youth when all the resources of nourish¬ 
ment are used for development; at that age, “all the nutriment 
is used up too soon,” says Aristotle; it is understandable, too, 
that in old age, the production of sperm slows down: “The 
organism does not concoct enough.” 17 The entire life of the 
individual—from youth, when one needs to grow, to old age, 
when one has so much trouble sustaining oneself—is marked
