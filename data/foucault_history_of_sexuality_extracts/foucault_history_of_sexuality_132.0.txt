originates where the body and the soul are joined to one 
another, or is formed at the end of a lengthy internal process¬ 
ing of food, the sexual act that expels it constitutes a costly 
expenditure for the human being. Pleasure may well accom¬ 
pany it, as nature intended, so that men would think of provid¬ 
ing themselves with descendants; it nonetheless constitutes a 
hard jolt for the being itself, involving as it does the relinquish¬ 
ing of a whole portion of that which contains a “being itself.” 
This is how Aristotle explains the “obvious” dejection that 
follows intercourse 18 ; it is also how the author of the Problems 
explains the dislike felt by young men for the first woman with 
whom they chanced to have sexual relations. 19 Although the 
volume is small—proportionately larger, however, in men 
than in other animals—living creatures deprive themselves of 
a whole portion of the elements that are essential to their own 
existence. 20 One sees how in certain instances, as in the case 
of dorsal consumption described by Hippocrates, the misuse 
of sexual pleasure might lead to death. 

3. Death and Immortality. It was not just the fear of exces¬ 
sive expenditure that caused medical and philosophical reflec¬ 
tion to associate sexual activity with death. This reflection also 
linked them together in the very principle of reproduction, by 
holding that the purpose of reproduction was to compensate 
for the passing away of living beings and to provide the species 
as a whole with the eternity that could not be given to each 
individual. If animals united in sexual intercourse, and if this 
relation gave them descendants, it was in order that the species 
might—as the Laws puts it—endlessly accompany the march 
of time. This was its way of cheating death: leaving “the 
children of children” behind it while remaining the same, it 
“partakes of immortality by means of coming-in to-being.” 21 
For Aristotle and Plato alike, the sexual act was at the point 
of junction of an individual life that was bound to perish—and 
from which, moreover, it drew off a portion of its most pre¬ 
cious resources—and an immortality that assumed the con-
