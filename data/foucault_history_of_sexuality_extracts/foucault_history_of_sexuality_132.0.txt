by this relation of complementarity between the power to 
procreate and the capacity to develop or continue existing.

originates where the body and the soul are joined to one 
another, or is formed at the end of a lengthy internal process¬ 
ing of food, the sexual act that expels it constitutes a costly 
expenditure for the human being. Pleasure may well accom¬ 
pany it, as nature intended, so that men would think of provid¬ 
ing themselves with descendants; it nonetheless constitutes a 
hard jolt for the being itself, involving as it does the relinquish¬ 
ing of a whole portion of that which contains a “being itself.” 
This is how Aristotle explains the “obvious” dejection that 
follows intercourse 18 ; it is also how the author of the Problems 
explains the dislike felt by young men for the first woman with 
whom they chanced to have sexual relations. 19 Although the 
volume is small—proportionately larger, however, in men 
than in other animals—living creatures deprive themselves of 
a whole portion of the elements that are essential to their own 
existence. 20 One sees how in certain instances, as in the case 
of dorsal consumption described by Hippocrates, the misuse 
of sexual pleasure might lead to death. 

3. Death and Immortality. It was not just the fear of exces¬ 
sive expenditure that caused medical and philosophical reflec¬ 
tion to associate sexual activity with death. This reflection also 
linked them together in the very principle of reproduction, by 
holding that the purpose of reproduction was to compensate 
for the passing away of living beings and to provide the species 
as a whole with the eternity that could not be given to each 
individual. If animals united in sexual intercourse, and if this 
relation gave them descendants, it was in order that the species 
might—as the Laws puts it—endlessly accompany the march 
of time. This was its way of cheating death: leaving “the 
children of children” behind it while remaining the same, it 
“partakes of immortality by means of coming-in to-being.” 21 
For Aristotle and Plato alike, the sexual act was at the point 
of junction of an individual life that was bound to perish—and 
from which, moreover, it drew off a portion of its most pre¬ 
cious resources—and an immortality that assumed the con-

crete form of a survival of the species. Between these two lives, 
the sexual relation constituted, as Plato says, an “artifice” 
(mechane) that was designed to join them together so that the 
first might, in its own way, participate in the second; this 
mechane provided the individual with an “offspring” of him¬ 
self (apoblastema). 

In Plato this link, contrived and natural at the same time, 
is sustained by the longing for self-perpetuation and immortal¬ 
ity, which characterizes every perishable creature. 22 In the 
Symposium, Diotima points out that such a longing exists in 
animals which, seized by the urge to procreate, “fall prey to 
a violent love-sickness,” and they are “ready to die if need be 
in order to secure the survival of their progeny.” 23 It also exists 
in the human animal who, once his life is over, does not want 
to lie in a grave uncelebrated and “nameless.” 24 This is why, 
according to the Laws, he should marry and provide himself 
with descendants in the best possible circumstances. But it is 
this same desire that makes some individuals who love boys 
eager, not to sow their seed in the body, but to engender in the 
soul and to give birth to that which is, of itself, beautiful. 25 In 
Aristotle, in certain early texts like the treatise On the Soul, 
sexual activity’s connection with death and immortality is still 
expressed in the somewhat “Platonizing” form of a desire for 
participation in the eternal; 26 in later texts such as the treatise 
On Generation and Corruption, or Generation of Animals, it 
is conceived in the form of a differentiation and distribution 
of beings in the natural order, according to a set of ontological 
principles concerning being, nonbeing, and the better. Propos¬ 
ing to explain in terms of final causes why there is procreation 
of animals and separate existence of the sexes, the second book 
of the Generation of Animals invokes a few basic principles 
governing the relationships of the myriads of beings to being 
per se. First, some things are eternal and divine, while others 
can be or not be; second, the beautiful and divine is always the 
better and what is not eternal can participate in the better and 
the worse; third, it is better to be than not to be, to live than
