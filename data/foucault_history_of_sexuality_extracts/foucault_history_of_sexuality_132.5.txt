The Use of Pleasure 


crete form of a survival of the species. Between these two lives, 
the sexual relation constituted, as Plato says, an “artifice” 
(mechane) that was designed to join them together so that the 
first might, in its own way, participate in the second; this 
mechane provided the individual with an “offspring” of him¬ 
self (apoblastema). 

In Plato this link, contrived and natural at the same time, 
is sustained by the longing for self-perpetuation and immortal¬ 
ity, which characterizes every perishable creature. 22 In the 
Symposium, Diotima points out that such a longing exists in 
animals which, seized by the urge to procreate, “fall prey to 
a violent love-sickness,” and they are “ready to die if need be 
in order to secure the survival of their progeny.” 23 It also exists 
in the human animal who, once his life is over, does not want 
to lie in a grave uncelebrated and “nameless.” 24 This is why, 
according to the Laws, he should marry and provide himself 
with descendants in the best possible circumstances. But it is 
this same desire that makes some individuals who love boys 
eager, not to sow their seed in the body, but to engender in the 
soul and to give birth to that which is, of itself, beautiful. 25 In 
Aristotle, in certain early texts like the treatise On the Soul, 
sexual activity’s connection with death and immortality is still 
expressed in the somewhat “Platonizing” form of a desire for 
participation in the eternal; 26 in later texts such as the treatise 
On Generation and Corruption, or Generation of Animals, it 
is conceived in the form of a differentiation and distribution 
of beings in the natural order, according to a set of ontological 
principles concerning being, nonbeing, and the better. Propos¬ 
ing to explain in terms of final causes why there is procreation 
of animals and separate existence of the sexes, the second book 
of the Generation of Animals invokes a few basic principles 
governing the relationships of the myriads of beings to being 
per se. First, some things are eternal and divine, while others 
can be or not be; second, the beautiful and divine is always the 
better and what is not eternal can participate in the better and 
the worse; third, it is better to be than not to be, to live than
