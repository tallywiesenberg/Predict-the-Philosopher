not to live, to be animate than inanimate. And, observing that 
beings who are subject to becoming can be eternal only with¬ 
in the limits of their capability, he concludes that this is 
why there is generation of animals, and that the latter, 
excluded from eternity as individuals, can be eternal as 
a species: “numerically,” an animal “cannot be eternal, 
for the substance of things that are is particular; and if it 
were such, it would be eternal—but it is possible for it as 
a species.” 27 

Hence sexual activity was located within the broad parame¬ 
ters of life and death, of time, becoming, and eternity. It 
became necessary because the individual was fated to die, and 
in order that he might in a sense escape death. To be sure, 
these philosophical speculations were not immediately present 
in reflection regarding the use of pleasures and their regimen. 
But notice the solemnity with which Plato refers to these 
themes in the “persuasive” legislation—laws that must be of 
first importance since they were to be “the first laid down in 
every city”—that he proposes concerning marriage: “A man 
is to marry after he reaches the age of thirty and before he 
reaches thirty-five, bearing in mind that there is a sense in 
which the human species has by a certain nature a share in 
immortality, and that it is the nature of everyone to desire 
immortality in every way. For the desire to become famous 
and not to lie nameless after one has died is a desire for such 
a thing. Thus the species of human beings has something in 
its nature that is bound together with all of time, which it 
accompanies and will always accompany to the end. In this 
way the species is immortal; by leaving behind the children of 
children and remaining one and the same for always, it par¬ 
takes of immortality by means of coming-into-being.” 28 The 
interlocutors of the Lam know that these lengthy considera¬ 
tions are not part of the customary practice of legislators. But 
the Athenian remarks that things are the same in this sphere 
as in medicine; the latter, when it speaks to reasonable and free 
men, cannot be content to lay down precepts; it must explain,

give reasons, and persuade so that the patient might regulate 
his way of living. To give such explanations about the individ¬ 
ual and the species, time and eternity, life and death, is to 
ensure that citizens will accept, “in a frame of mind more 
favorably disposed and therefore more apt to learn some¬ 
thing,” the prescriptions that are meant to regulate their sex¬ 
ual activity and their marriage, the reasonable regimen of their 
moderate life. 29 

Greek medicine and philosophy concerned themselves with 
the aphrodisia and the use that ought to be made of them if 
one wished to care properly for one’s body. This problematiza- 
tion did not lead to a drawing of distinctions among those acts, 
their possible forms and varieties, in order to decide which 
ones were admissible and which were harmful or “abnormal.” 
By considering them in the aggregate, as the manifestation of 
a generic activity, it sought to determine the principles that 
would enable individuals to engage in them at the appropriate 
intensity and to distribute them in the right way, according to 
circumstances. Yet the clearly restrictive tendencies of such an 
economy attest to an anxiety about this sexual activity. An 
anxiety that related to the possible consequences of abuses; an 
anxiety that also related—especially so—to the act itself, 
which was always perceived in terms of a male, ejaculatory, 
“paroxystic” schema that appeared to adequately define all 
sexual activity. We see, then, that the importance that was 
accorded to the sexual act and to the forms of its rarefaction 
was owing not only to its negative effects on the body, but to 
what it was in itself and by nature: a violence that confounded 
the will, an expenditure that wasted the body’s resources, a 
procreation that was linked to the future death of the individ¬ 
ual. The sexual act did not occasion anxiety because it was 
associated with evil but because it disturbed and threatened 
the individual’s relationship with himself and his integrity as 
an ethical subject in the making; if it was not properly mea¬ 
sured and distributed, it carried the threat of a breaking forth

of involuntary forces, a lessening of energy, and death without 
honorable descendants. 

We may note that these three great themes of preoccupation 
are not peculiar to ancient culture: indications of this anxiety,
