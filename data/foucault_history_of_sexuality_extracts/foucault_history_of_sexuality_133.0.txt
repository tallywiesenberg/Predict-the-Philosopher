not to live, to be animate than inanimate. And, observing that 
beings who are subject to becoming can be eternal only with¬ 
in the limits of their capability, he concludes that this is 
why there is generation of animals, and that the latter, 
excluded from eternity as individuals, can be eternal as 
a species: “numerically,” an animal “cannot be eternal, 
for the substance of things that are is particular; and if it 
were such, it would be eternal—but it is possible for it as 
a species.” 27 

Hence sexual activity was located within the broad parame¬ 
ters of life and death, of time, becoming, and eternity. It 
became necessary because the individual was fated to die, and 
in order that he might in a sense escape death. To be sure, 
these philosophical speculations were not immediately present 
in reflection regarding the use of pleasures and their regimen. 
But notice the solemnity with which Plato refers to these 
themes in the “persuasive” legislation—laws that must be of 
first importance since they were to be “the first laid down in 
every city”—that he proposes concerning marriage: “A man 
is to marry after he reaches the age of thirty and before he 
reaches thirty-five, bearing in mind that there is a sense in 
which the human species has by a certain nature a share in 
immortality, and that it is the nature of everyone to desire 
immortality in every way. For the desire to become famous 
and not to lie nameless after one has died is a desire for such 
a thing. Thus the species of human beings has something in 
its nature that is bound together with all of time, which it 
accompanies and will always accompany to the end. In this 
way the species is immortal; by leaving behind the children of 
children and remaining one and the same for always, it par¬ 
takes of immortality by means of coming-into-being.” 28 The 
interlocutors of the Lam know that these lengthy considera¬ 
tions are not part of the customary practice of legislators. But 
the Athenian remarks that things are the same in this sphere 
as in medicine; the latter, when it speaks to reasonable and free 
men, cannot be content to lay down precepts; it must explain,
