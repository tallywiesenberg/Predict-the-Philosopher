give reasons, and persuade so that the patient might regulate 
his way of living. To give such explanations about the individ¬ 
ual and the species, time and eternity, life and death, is to 
ensure that citizens will accept, “in a frame of mind more 
favorably disposed and therefore more apt to learn some¬ 
thing,” the prescriptions that are meant to regulate their sex¬ 
ual activity and their marriage, the reasonable regimen of their 
moderate life. 29 

Greek medicine and philosophy concerned themselves with 
the aphrodisia and the use that ought to be made of them if 
one wished to care properly for one’s body. This problematiza- 
tion did not lead to a drawing of distinctions among those acts, 
their possible forms and varieties, in order to decide which 
ones were admissible and which were harmful or “abnormal.” 
By considering them in the aggregate, as the manifestation of 
a generic activity, it sought to determine the principles that 
would enable individuals to engage in them at the appropriate 
intensity and to distribute them in the right way, according to 
circumstances. Yet the clearly restrictive tendencies of such an 
economy attest to an anxiety about this sexual activity. An 
anxiety that related to the possible consequences of abuses; an 
anxiety that also related—especially so—to the act itself, 
which was always perceived in terms of a male, ejaculatory, 
“paroxystic” schema that appeared to adequately define all 
sexual activity. We see, then, that the importance that was 
accorded to the sexual act and to the forms of its rarefaction 
was owing not only to its negative effects on the body, but to 
what it was in itself and by nature: a violence that confounded 
the will, an expenditure that wasted the body’s resources, a 
procreation that was linked to the future death of the individ¬ 
ual. The sexual act did not occasion anxiety because it was 
associated with evil but because it disturbed and threatened 
the individual’s relationship with himself and his integrity as 
an ethical subject in the making; if it was not properly mea¬ 
sured and distributed, it carried the threat of a breaking forth

honorable descendants. 

We may note that these three great themes of preoccupation 
are not peculiar to ancient culture: indications of this anxiety,
