which identify the sexual act with the “virile” form of semen 
and associate it with violence, exhaustion, and death, could 
doubtless be found frequently elsewhere. For example, the 
documents assembled by Van Gulik, pertaining to ancient 
Chinese culture, seem to show the presence of this same the¬ 
matic complex: fear of the irrepressible and costly act, dread 
of its harmful consequences for the body and health, represen¬ 
tation of the man-woman relationship in the form of a contest, 
preoccupation with obtaining descendants of good quality by 
means of a well-regulated sexual activity. 30 But the ancient 
Chinese “bedroom” treatises responded to that anxiety in a 
manner completely different from what one finds in classical 
Greece. The dread one felt when faced with the violence of the 
act and the fear of losing one’s semen were answered by meth¬ 
ods of willful retention; the encounter with the other sex was 
perceived as a way to come into contact with the vital princi¬ 
ple the latter held in her possession and, by absorbing it, to 
internalize it for one’s own benefit. So that a well-managed 
sexual activity not only precluded any danger, it could also 
result in a strengthening of one’s existence and it could be a 
means of restoring one’s youthfulness. Elaboration and exer¬ 
cise in this case concerned the act itself, its unfolding, the play 
of forces that sustained it, and of course the pleasure with 
which it was associated; the nullification or indefinite post¬ 
ponement of its completion enabled one both to carry it to its 
highest degree in the realm of pleasure and to turn it to one’s 
greatest advantage in life. In this “erotic art,” which sought, 
with pronounced ethical concerns, to intensify insofar as pos¬ 
sible the positive effects of a controlled, deliberate, multifari¬ 
ous, and prolonged sexual activity, time—a time that 
terminated the act, aged the body, and brought death—was 
exorcised.

The Use of Pleasure 


It would also be easy to find in the Christian doctrine of 
the flesh closely related themes of anxiety: the involuntary 
violence of the act, its kinship with evil, and its place in the 
play of life and death. But in the irrepressible force of desire 
and the sexual act, Saint Augustine was to see one of the 
main stigmata of the Fall (that involuntary movement repro¬ 
duced in the human body man’s rebellion against God); the 
Christian pastoral ministry was to set the rules of economy, 
on a precise calendar and according to a detailed morphol¬ 
ogy of acts; and the doctrine of marriage was to give the 
procreative finality the dual role of ensuring the survival or 
even the proliferation of God’s people, and of making it pos¬ 
sible for individuals to avoid pledging their souls to eternal 
death through indulgence in that activity. In short, this was 
a juridico-moral codification of acts, moments, and inten¬ 
tions that legitimated an activity that was of itself a bearer of 
negative values; and it inscribed it in the dual order of the 
ecclesiastical institution and the matrimonial institution. The 
time of rites and the time of legitimate procreation could 
absolve it of blame. 

Among the Greeks, these same anxiety themes (violence, 
expenditure, and death) took shape within a reflection that did 
not aim at a codification of acts, nor at the creation of an erotic 
art; rather, its objective was to develop a technique of exis¬ 
tence. This technique did not require that the acts be divested 
of their primordial naturalness; nor did it attempt to augment 
their pleasurable effects; it sought to distribute them in the 
closest conformity with what nature demanded. The material 
it sought to elaborate was not, as in an erotic art, the unfolding 
of the act; nor was it the conditions of the act’s institutional 
legitimation, as it would be in Christianity; it was much more 
the relationship between oneself and that activity “considered 
in the aggregate,” the ability to control, limit, and apportion 
it in the right manner. This techne created the possibility of 
forming oneself as a subject in control of his conduct; that is, 
the possibility of making oneself like the doctor treating sick-

one who had a sense of the right time and the right measure. 
We can thus understand why the necessity of a regimen for the 
aphrodisia was underscored so insistently, while so few details 
were given regarding the troubles that an abuse could bring 
about, and very few particulars concerning what one should 
or shouldn’t do. Because it was the most violent of all the 
pleasures, because it was more costly than most physical ac¬ 
tivities, and because it participated in the game of life and 
death, it constituted a privileged domain for the ethical forma¬ 
tion of the subject: a subject who ought to be distinguished by 
his ability to subdue the tumultuous forces that were loosed
