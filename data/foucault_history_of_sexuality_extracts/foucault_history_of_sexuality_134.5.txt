ogy of acts; and the doctrine of marriage was to give the 
procreative finality the dual role of ensuring the survival or 
even the proliferation of God’s people, and of making it pos¬ 
sible for individuals to avoid pledging their souls to eternal 
death through indulgence in that activity. In short, this was 
a juridico-moral codification of acts, moments, and inten¬ 
tions that legitimated an activity that was of itself a bearer of 
negative values; and it inscribed it in the dual order of the 
ecclesiastical institution and the matrimonial institution. The 
time of rites and the time of legitimate procreation could 
absolve it of blame. 

Among the Greeks, these same anxiety themes (violence, 
expenditure, and death) took shape within a reflection that did 
not aim at a codification of acts, nor at the creation of an erotic 
art; rather, its objective was to develop a technique of exis¬ 
tence. This technique did not require that the acts be divested 
of their primordial naturalness; nor did it attempt to augment 
their pleasurable effects; it sought to distribute them in the 
closest conformity with what nature demanded. The material 
it sought to elaborate was not, as in an erotic art, the unfolding 
of the act; nor was it the conditions of the act’s institutional 
legitimation, as it would be in Christianity; it was much more 
the relationship between oneself and that activity “considered 
in the aggregate,” the ability to control, limit, and apportion 
it in the right manner. This techne created the possibility of 
forming oneself as a subject in control of his conduct; that is, 
the possibility of making oneself like the doctor treating sick-

We can thus understand why the necessity of a regimen for the 
aphrodisia was underscored so insistently, while so few details 
were given regarding the troubles that an abuse could bring 
about, and very few particulars concerning what one should 
or shouldn’t do. Because it was the most violent of all the 
pleasures, because it was more costly than most physical ac¬ 
tivities, and because it participated in the game of life and 
death, it constituted a privileged domain for the ethical forma¬ 
tion of the subject: a subject who ought to be distinguished by 
his ability to subdue the tumultuous forces that were loosed
