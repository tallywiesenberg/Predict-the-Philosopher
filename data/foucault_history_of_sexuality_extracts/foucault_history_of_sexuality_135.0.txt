make his life into an oeuvre that would endure beyond his own 
ephemeral existence. The physical regimen of pleasures and 
the economy it required were part of a whole art of the self. 

♦These three “arts of governing” were often likened to one another, as arts that 
demanded a knowledge and prudence attuned to circumstances; they were also 
comparable because they were knowledges that were associated with an ability to 
command. They were frequently referred to where it was a question of an individual's 
search for the principles or the authority that would help him to “conduct himself.”

Marriage 


How, in what form, and why were sexual relations between 
husband and wife “problematical” in Greek thought? What 
reason was there to be worried about them? And above all, 
what reason was there to question the husband’s behavior, to 
reflect on the moderation it necessitated, and—in a society so 
strongly marked by the rule of “free men”—to make it a 
theme of moral preoccupation? It looks as if there were none, 
or in any case very little. At the end of the legal argument 
Against Neaera, attributed to Demosthenes, the author deliv¬ 
ers a sort of aphorism that has remained famous: “Mistresses 
we keep for the sake of pleasure, concubines for the daily care 
of our persons, but wives to bear us legitimate children and to 
be faithful guardians of our households.”' 

With a formula like this one, which seems to speak of a 
strict distribution of roles, we could not be further from the 
arts of conjugal pleasure such as one finds, according to Van 
Gulik, in ancient China. There, prescriptions concerning the 
woman’s obedience, her respect, and her devotion were closely 
linked with advice on the correct erotic behavior to manifest 
in order to increase the partners’ pleasure, or at least that of
