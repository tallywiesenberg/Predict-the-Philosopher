the man, and with opinions on the right conditions for obtain¬ 
ing the best possible progeny. 2 This was because, in that 
polygamous society, the wife found herself in a competitive 
situation where her status was tied directly to her ability to 
give pleasure; questions concerning sexual behavior and the

forms of its possible improvement formed part of the society’s 
reflection about existence; the skillful practice of pleasures and 
the equilibrium of married life belonged to the same set of 
concerns. 

The Against Neaera formula is also far removed from what 
one finds in the Christian doctrine and its pastoral application, 
but for entirely different reasons. In that strictly monogamous 
situation, the man was to be prohibited from going in pursuit 
of any other form of pleasure beyond the pleasure he was 
allowed to take with his lawful wife; and even that pleasure 
was to pose a number of problems, seeing that the stated goal 
of sexual relations was not in sensual delight but in procrea¬ 
tion. Around this central cluster of themes, a whole inquiry 
was to develop regarding the status of pleasures within the 
conjugal relationship. In this case, the problematization did 
not grow out of a polygamous structure but out of a monoga¬ 
mous obligation; and it did not seek to tie the quality of the 
relationship to the intensity of pleasure and the variety of 
partners, but on the contrary it sought to dissociate, insofar 
as possible, the constancy of a single conjugal relationship 
from the pursuit of pleasure.* 

The formula expressed in Against Neaera appears to have 
been based on an altogether different system. On the one hand, 
this system operated on the principle of a single lawful wife; 
but on the other hand, it very clearly located the domain of 
pleasures outside the marital relationship. In it, marriage 
would encounter the sexual relation only in its reproductive 
function, while the sexual relation would raise the question of 
pleasure only outside of marriage. And consequently one does 
not see why sexual relations would be a problem in married
