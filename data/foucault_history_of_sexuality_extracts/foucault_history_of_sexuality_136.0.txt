•We have to be careful not to schematize, not to reduce the Christian doctrine or 
marital relations to the procreative function, excluding pleasure. In actual fact, the 
doctrine was to be complex and open to discussion, and it was to have numerous 
variants. But the thing to bear in mind in our context is that the question of pleasure 
in the conjugal relationship and the question of the place it ought to be given, of the 
precautions that one had to take against it, as well as of the concessions that one had 
to grant it (taking account of the weakness and lustfulness of the other), constituted 
an active focus of reflection.

life, unless it was a matter of the husband’s obtaining legiti¬ 
mate and promising descendants. Thus, it is quite logical that 
one finds in Greek thought technical and medical inquiries 
concerning sterility and its causes, 3 considerations from the 
viewpoint of dietetics and hygiene on how to have healthy 
children (and boys rather than girls)/ political and social 
reflections on the best possible matching of marriage partners, 5 
and finally, juridical debates on the conditions in which 
descendants could be considered legitimate and have the 
benefit of citizenship (this was what was at issue in Against 
Neaera). 

Moreover, one fails to see why the problematization of 
sexual relations between spouses would take other forms or 
become attached to other questions, given the status of mar¬ 
ried couples in Athens and the obligations to which both 
husband and wife were held. The definition of what was al¬ 
lowed, forbidden, and prescribed for spouses by the institution 
of marriage in matters of sexual practice was simple enough, 
and clearly symmetrical enough so that additional moral regu¬ 
lation did not appear necessary. As far as women were con¬ 
cerned, in fact, they were bound by their juridical and social 
status as wives; all their sexual activity had to be within the 
conjugal relationship and their husband had to be their exclu¬ 
sive partner. They were under his power; it was to him that 
they had to give their children, who would be citizens and 
heirs. In case of adultery, the punishment meted out was 
private, but it was also public (a woman guilty of adultery no 
longer had the right to appear in public religious ceremonies): 
as Demosthenes says, the law “has declared that our women 
may be inspired with a fear sufficient to make them live soberly 
[sophronein], and avoid all vice [meden hamartanein ] and, as 
their duty is, to keep to their household tasks”; the law warns 
them that “if a woman is guilty of any such sin, she will be 
outcast from her husband’s home and from the sanctuaries of 
the city.” 6 The familial and civic status of a married woman 
made her subject to the rules of a conduct that was character-

The Use of Pleasure 


ized by a strictly conjugal sexual practice. It was not that 
virtue was of no use to women, far from it; but their sophrosyne 
had the role of ensuring that they would manage, by an exer¬ 
cise of will and reason, to respect the rules that were laid down 
for them. 

For his part, the husband was bound by a certain number 
of obligations toward his wife (one of Solon’s laws 7 required 
the husband to have sexual relations with his wife at least 
three times a month if she was an “heiress”).* But having 
sexual relations only with his lawful wife did not by any means 
form part of his obligations. It is true that every man, whoever 
he might be, married or not, had to respect a married woman 
(or a girl under parental control); but this was because she was 
under someone else’s authority; it was not his own status that 
prevented him, but that of the girl or woman who was the 
object of his attack. His offense was essentially against the man 
who held authority over the woman; this was why, if he was 
an Athenian, he would be punished less severely if he commit¬ 
ted rape, overcome by the voracity of his desire, than if he 
deliberately and artfully seduced a woman; as Lysias says in 
On the Murder of Eratosthenes, seducers “corrupt their vic¬ 
tims’ souls, thus making the wives of others more closely 
attached to themselves than to their husbands, and get the 
whole house into their hands, and cause uncertainty as to 
whose the children really are.” 9 The rapist violated only the 
woman’s body, while the seducer violated the husband’s au¬ 
thority. All things considered, the married man was prohib¬ 
ited only from contracting another marriage; no sexual 
relation was forbidden him as a consequence of the marriage 
obligation he had entered into; he could have an intimate 
affair, he could frequent prostitutes, he could be the lover of 
a boy—to say nothing of the men or women slaves he had in 

*One also finds evidence of an obligation in regard to conjugal duties in Pythagorean 
teaching, as reported by Diogenes Laertius: “Hieronymus, however, says that, when 
he had descended into Hades ... he saw under torture those who had neglected to
