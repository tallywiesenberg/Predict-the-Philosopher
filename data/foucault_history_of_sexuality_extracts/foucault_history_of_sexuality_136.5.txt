them that “if a woman is guilty of any such sin, she will be 
outcast from her husband’s home and from the sanctuaries of 
the city.” 6 The familial and civic status of a married woman 
made her subject to the rules of a conduct that was character-

The Use of Pleasure 


ized by a strictly conjugal sexual practice. It was not that 
virtue was of no use to women, far from it; but their sophrosyne 
had the role of ensuring that they would manage, by an exer¬ 
cise of will and reason, to respect the rules that were laid down 
for them. 

For his part, the husband was bound by a certain number 
of obligations toward his wife (one of Solon’s laws 7 required 
the husband to have sexual relations with his wife at least 
three times a month if she was an “heiress”).* But having 
sexual relations only with his lawful wife did not by any means 
form part of his obligations. It is true that every man, whoever 
he might be, married or not, had to respect a married woman 
(or a girl under parental control); but this was because she was 
under someone else’s authority; it was not his own status that 
prevented him, but that of the girl or woman who was the 
object of his attack. His offense was essentially against the man 
who held authority over the woman; this was why, if he was 
an Athenian, he would be punished less severely if he commit¬ 
ted rape, overcome by the voracity of his desire, than if he 
deliberately and artfully seduced a woman; as Lysias says in 
On the Murder of Eratosthenes, seducers “corrupt their vic¬ 
tims’ souls, thus making the wives of others more closely 
attached to themselves than to their husbands, and get the 
whole house into their hands, and cause uncertainty as to 
whose the children really are.” 9 The rapist violated only the 
woman’s body, while the seducer violated the husband’s au¬ 
thority. All things considered, the married man was prohib¬ 
ited only from contracting another marriage; no sexual 
relation was forbidden him as a consequence of the marriage 
obligation he had entered into; he could have an intimate 
affair, he could frequent prostitutes, he could be the lover of 
a boy—to say nothing of the men or women slaves he had in 

*One also finds evidence of an obligation in regard to conjugal duties in Pythagorean 
teaching, as reported by Diogenes Laertius: “Hieronymus, however, says that, when 
he had descended into Hades ... he saw under torture those who had neglected to
