his household at his disposal. A man’s marriage did not re¬ 
strict him sexually. 

Juridically, this meant that adultery was not a breach of the 
marriage contract if it was committed by one of the two part¬ 
ners. It constituted an infraction only in cases where a married 
woman had relations with a man who was not her husband; 
it was the marital status of the woman, never that of the man, 
that made it possible to define a relation as adultery. And from 
a moral standpoint, it is clear that there did not exist for the 
Greeks that category of “mutual fidelity” which would later 
introduce into married life a sort of “sexual right” having 
moral weight, juridical effects, and religious significance. The 
principle of a double monopoly, making exclusive partners of 
the two spouses, was not required in the marital relation. For 
while the wife belonged to the husband, the husband belonged 
only to himself. Reciprocal sexual fidelity, as a duty, a com¬ 
mitment, and a feeling shared equally, did not constitute the 
necessary guarantee nor the highest expression of married life. 
All this favors the conclusion that sexual pleasures posed their 
problems, and while married life posed problems of its own, 
there were few meeting points between the two problematiza- 
tions. At any rate, marriage ought not to have raised any 
questions as far as the ethics of pleasure was concerned, for 
the reasons we have just considered: in the case of one of the 
partners—the wife—the restrictions were defined by status, 
law, and custom, and they were guaranteed by punishments 
or sanctions; in the case of the other—the husband—marital 
status did not impose precise rules on him, except to designate 
the woman from whom he must expect to obtain his legitimate 
heirs. 

We cannot stop at that, however. It is true that, at least 
during that era, marriage—and within marriage, sexual rela¬ 
tions between partners—did not constitute a very intense 
focus of questioning; it is true that less thought seems to have 
been given to sexual conduct in the relation that one might 
have with one’s wife than in the relation that one might have

The Use of Pleasure 


with one’s own body, or, as we shall see, in the relationship 
with boys. But it would be incorrect to think that things were 
so simple that the behavior of women—as wives—was too 
imperiously set to need any reflection, or that the behavior of 
men—as husbands—was so free that there was no need to 
question oneself concerning it. First, we have many statements 
about feelings of jealousy; wives commonly reproached their 
husbands for the pleasures they would go elsewhere to enjoy, 
and the fickle wife of Euphiletus took exception to his intima¬ 
cies with a mere slave girl. 10 More generally, public opinion 
expected a man who was about to be married to exhibit a 
certain change in his sexual behavior; it was understood that 
during youthful bachelorhood (it often happened that men 
would not marry before they reached thirty) one would read¬ 
ily tolerate an intensity and variety of pleasures that it was 
good to curtail after marriage, even though the latter did not 
explicitly impose any precise limitation. But apart from these 
common behaviors and attitudes, there also existed a concep¬ 
tual thematics of marital austerity. The moralists—some of 
them, at any rate—gave it to be understood in clear terms that 
a married man could not rightly feel free to indulge in pleas¬ 
ures as if he were not married. One was to hear Nicocles, in 
the speech Isocrates attributes to him, declare not only that 
he ruled his subjects justly, but that since his marriage he had 
had sexual relations only with his own wife. And Aristotle was 
to assert in the Politics that intercourse “of the husband with 
another woman, or the wife with another man” must be con¬ 
sidered “a dishonorable action.” An isolated and unimportant 
phenomenon? Already the birth of a new ethics? But as few 
in number as these texts are, and especially considering how 
far removed they are from real social practice and from the 
actual behavior of individuals, it is still pertinent to ask our¬ 
selves: why did moral reflection concern itself with the sexual 
behavior of married men? What was the nature of this con¬ 
cern, what was its origin, and what were its forms? 

We will do well in this connection to avoid two interpreta¬ 
tions, neither one of which seems entirely adequate.
