his household at his disposal. A man’s marriage did not re¬ 
strict him sexually. 

Juridically, this meant that adultery was not a breach of the 
marriage contract if it was committed by one of the two part¬ 
ners. It constituted an infraction only in cases where a married 
woman had relations with a man who was not her husband; 
it was the marital status of the woman, never that of the man, 
that made it possible to define a relation as adultery. And from 
a moral standpoint, it is clear that there did not exist for the 
Greeks that category of “mutual fidelity” which would later 
introduce into married life a sort of “sexual right” having 
moral weight, juridical effects, and religious significance. The 
principle of a double monopoly, making exclusive partners of 
the two spouses, was not required in the marital relation. For 
while the wife belonged to the husband, the husband belonged 
only to himself. Reciprocal sexual fidelity, as a duty, a com¬ 
mitment, and a feeling shared equally, did not constitute the 
necessary guarantee nor the highest expression of married life. 
All this favors the conclusion that sexual pleasures posed their 
problems, and while married life posed problems of its own, 
there were few meeting points between the two problematiza- 
tions. At any rate, marriage ought not to have raised any 
questions as far as the ethics of pleasure was concerned, for 
the reasons we have just considered: in the case of one of the 
partners—the wife—the restrictions were defined by status, 
law, and custom, and they were guaranteed by punishments 
or sanctions; in the case of the other—the husband—marital 
status did not impose precise rules on him, except to designate 
the woman from whom he must expect to obtain his legitimate 
heirs. 

We cannot stop at that, however. It is true that, at least 
during that era, marriage—and within marriage, sexual rela¬ 
tions between partners—did not constitute a very intense 
focus of questioning; it is true that less thought seems to have 
been given to sexual conduct in the relation that one might 
have with one’s wife than in the relation that one might have
