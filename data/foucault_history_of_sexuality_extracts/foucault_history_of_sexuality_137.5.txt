The Use of Pleasure 


with one’s own body, or, as we shall see, in the relationship 
with boys. But it would be incorrect to think that things were 
so simple that the behavior of women—as wives—was too 
imperiously set to need any reflection, or that the behavior of 
men—as husbands—was so free that there was no need to 
question oneself concerning it. First, we have many statements 
about feelings of jealousy; wives commonly reproached their 
husbands for the pleasures they would go elsewhere to enjoy, 
and the fickle wife of Euphiletus took exception to his intima¬ 
cies with a mere slave girl. 10 More generally, public opinion 
expected a man who was about to be married to exhibit a 
certain change in his sexual behavior; it was understood that 
during youthful bachelorhood (it often happened that men 
would not marry before they reached thirty) one would read¬ 
ily tolerate an intensity and variety of pleasures that it was 
good to curtail after marriage, even though the latter did not 
explicitly impose any precise limitation. But apart from these 
common behaviors and attitudes, there also existed a concep¬ 
tual thematics of marital austerity. The moralists—some of 
them, at any rate—gave it to be understood in clear terms that 
a married man could not rightly feel free to indulge in pleas¬ 
ures as if he were not married. One was to hear Nicocles, in 
the speech Isocrates attributes to him, declare not only that 
he ruled his subjects justly, but that since his marriage he had 
had sexual relations only with his own wife. And Aristotle was 
to assert in the Politics that intercourse “of the husband with 
another woman, or the wife with another man” must be con¬ 
sidered “a dishonorable action.” An isolated and unimportant 
phenomenon? Already the birth of a new ethics? But as few 
in number as these texts are, and especially considering how 
far removed they are from real social practice and from the 
actual behavior of individuals, it is still pertinent to ask our¬ 
selves: why did moral reflection concern itself with the sexual 
behavior of married men? What was the nature of this con¬ 
cern, what was its origin, and what were its forms? 

We will do well in this connection to avoid two interpreta¬ 
tions, neither one of which seems entirely adequate.
