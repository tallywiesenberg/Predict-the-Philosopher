One of them would consist in thinking that intercourse 
between husband and wife had no other function for the 
Greeks in the classical period than the calculation which allied 
two families, two strategies, and two fortunes, and which had 
the sole objective of producing descendants. The Against Nea- 
era aphorism, which seems to sharply differentiate the roles 
that ought to be played in a man’s life by the courtesan, the 
concubine, and the wife, has sometimes been read as a triparti¬ 
tion that implies exclusive functions: sexual pleasure on one 
side, everyday life on the other, and for the wife nothing more 
than the maintenance of the line of descent. But one has to 
consider the context in which this harsh-sounding maxim was 
formulated. It was part of a litigant’s attempt to invalidate the 
apparently legitimate marriage of one of his enemies, as well 
as the claim to citizenship of the children born of that mar¬ 
riage. And the arguments given had to do with the wife’s birth, 
her past as a prostitute, and her current status, which could 
only be that of a concubine. The object therefore was not to 
show that pleasure was to be sought elsewhere than with the 
legal wife, but that legitimate descendants could not be ob¬ 
tained except with the wife herself. This is why, as Lacey 
comments, it would be a mistake to interpret this text as 
offering a definition of three distinct roles; it is more in the 
nature of a cumulative enumeration, to be read as follows: 
pleasure is the only thing a courtesan can give; as for the 
concubine, she is capable of providing the satisfactions of 
everyday life besides; but only the wife can exercise a certain 
function that is owing to her special status: she can bear 
legitimate children and ensure the continuity of the family 
institution. 11 It needs to be understood that in Athens mar¬ 
riage was not the only kind of union that was accepted; it 
actually formed a particular and privileged union, which alone 
could lead to matrimonial cohabitation and legitimate off¬ 
spring. Further, there exists a good deal of evidence testifying 
to the value that was attached to the wife’s beauty, to the 
importance of the sexual relations that one might have with 
her, and to the existence of mutual love (as in the play of Eros
