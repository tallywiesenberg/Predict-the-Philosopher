One of them would consist in thinking that intercourse 
between husband and wife had no other function for the 
Greeks in the classical period than the calculation which allied 
two families, two strategies, and two fortunes, and which had 
the sole objective of producing descendants. The Against Nea- 
era aphorism, which seems to sharply differentiate the roles 
that ought to be played in a man’s life by the courtesan, the 
concubine, and the wife, has sometimes been read as a triparti¬ 
tion that implies exclusive functions: sexual pleasure on one 
side, everyday life on the other, and for the wife nothing more 
than the maintenance of the line of descent. But one has to 
consider the context in which this harsh-sounding maxim was 
formulated. It was part of a litigant’s attempt to invalidate the 
apparently legitimate marriage of one of his enemies, as well 
as the claim to citizenship of the children born of that mar¬ 
riage. And the arguments given had to do with the wife’s birth, 
her past as a prostitute, and her current status, which could 
only be that of a concubine. The object therefore was not to 
show that pleasure was to be sought elsewhere than with the 
legal wife, but that legitimate descendants could not be ob¬ 
tained except with the wife herself. This is why, as Lacey 
comments, it would be a mistake to interpret this text as 
offering a definition of three distinct roles; it is more in the 
nature of a cumulative enumeration, to be read as follows: 
pleasure is the only thing a courtesan can give; as for the 
concubine, she is capable of providing the satisfactions of 
everyday life besides; but only the wife can exercise a certain 
function that is owing to her special status: she can bear 
legitimate children and ensure the continuity of the family 
institution. 11 It needs to be understood that in Athens mar¬ 
riage was not the only kind of union that was accepted; it 
actually formed a particular and privileged union, which alone 
could lead to matrimonial cohabitation and legitimate off¬ 
spring. Further, there exists a good deal of evidence testifying 
to the value that was attached to the wife’s beauty, to the 
importance of the sexual relations that one might have with 
her, and to the existence of mutual love (as in the play of Eros

and Anteros that unites Niceratus and his wife in Xenophon’s 
Symposium). 11 The radical separation between marriage and 
the play of pleasures and passions is doubtless not an adequate 
formula for characterizing marital life in antiquity. 

By being too intent on detaching Greek marriage from 
affective and personal implications that did in fact assume 
much greater importance in later times, and by insisting on 
distinguishing it from subsequent forms of conjugality, one is 
led, by an opposite impulse, to draw too close a parallel be¬ 
tween the austere ethics of the philosophers and Christian 
morality. Often in these texts where good behavior is con¬ 
ceived, evaluated, and regulated in the form of “sexual 
fidelity,” people are tempted to perceive the first draft of a still 
nonexistent moral code: the code that was to symmetrically 
impose the same obligation on the two spouses to engage in 
sexual relations only within the marital union, and the same 
duty to give these relations procreation as the privileged if not 
exclusive aim. There is a tendency to regard the passages that 
Xenophon or Isocrates devote to the husband’s duties as “ex¬ 
ceptional in view of the morals of the time.” 13 They are excep¬ 
tional inasmuch as they are rare. But even so, is that a reason 
to see in them the anticipation of a future ethics or the sign 
heralding a new sensibility? That these texts have shown a 
retrospective similarity to later formulations is a fact. Does it 
suffice to sever this moral reflection and this demand for aus¬ 
terity from contemporaneous behaviors and attitudes? Is it a 
reason for seeing in them the isolated forerunner of an ethics 
to come? 

If one is willing to examine these texts, not for the bit of 
code they formulate, but for the manner in which the sexual 
behavior of men is problematized, one soon realizes that this 
problematization did not have to do with the marriage tie itself 
and with the direct, symmetrical, and reciprocal obligation 
that might derive from it. To be sure, it was insofar as he was 
married that a man needed to restrict his pleasures, or at least 
his partners; but being married in this case meant, above all.
