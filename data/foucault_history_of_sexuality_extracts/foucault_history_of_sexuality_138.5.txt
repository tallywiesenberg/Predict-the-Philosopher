and Anteros that unites Niceratus and his wife in Xenophon’s 
Symposium). 11 The radical separation between marriage and 
the play of pleasures and passions is doubtless not an adequate 
formula for characterizing marital life in antiquity. 

By being too intent on detaching Greek marriage from 
affective and personal implications that did in fact assume 
much greater importance in later times, and by insisting on 
distinguishing it from subsequent forms of conjugality, one is 
led, by an opposite impulse, to draw too close a parallel be¬ 
tween the austere ethics of the philosophers and Christian 
morality. Often in these texts where good behavior is con¬ 
ceived, evaluated, and regulated in the form of “sexual 
fidelity,” people are tempted to perceive the first draft of a still 
nonexistent moral code: the code that was to symmetrically 
impose the same obligation on the two spouses to engage in 
sexual relations only within the marital union, and the same 
duty to give these relations procreation as the privileged if not 
exclusive aim. There is a tendency to regard the passages that 
Xenophon or Isocrates devote to the husband’s duties as “ex¬ 
ceptional in view of the morals of the time.” 13 They are excep¬ 
tional inasmuch as they are rare. But even so, is that a reason 
to see in them the anticipation of a future ethics or the sign 
heralding a new sensibility? That these texts have shown a 
retrospective similarity to later formulations is a fact. Does it 
suffice to sever this moral reflection and this demand for aus¬ 
terity from contemporaneous behaviors and attitudes? Is it a 
reason for seeing in them the isolated forerunner of an ethics 
to come? 

If one is willing to examine these texts, not for the bit of 
code they formulate, but for the manner in which the sexual 
behavior of men is problematized, one soon realizes that this 
problematization did not have to do with the marriage tie itself 
and with the direct, symmetrical, and reciprocal obligation 
that might derive from it. To be sure, it was insofar as he was 
married that a man needed to restrict his pleasures, or at least 
his partners; but being married in this case meant, above all.
