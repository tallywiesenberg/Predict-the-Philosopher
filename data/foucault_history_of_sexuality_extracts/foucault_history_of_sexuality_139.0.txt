a citizen. This is why reflection on marriage and the good 
behavior of husbands was regularly combined with reflection 
concerning the oikos (house and household). 

Thus, it becomes clear that the principle that obligated a 
man to have no partner outside the couple he formed was 
different in nature from that which tied a woman to an analo¬ 
gous obligation. In the case of the woman, it was insofar as 
she was under the authority of her husband that this obliga¬ 
tion was imposed on her. In the man’s case, it was because he 
exercised authority and because he was expected to exhibit 
self-mastery in the use of this authority, that he needed to limit 
his sexual options. For the wife, having sexual relations only 
with her husband was a consequence of the fact that she was 
under his control. For the husband, having sexual relations 
only with his wife was the most elegant way of exercising his 
control. This was not nearly so much the prefiguration of a 
symmetry that was to appear in the subsequent ethics, as it 
was the stylization of an actual dissymmetry. The restriction, 
which was analogous in what it allowed or forbade the two 
spouses, did not cover the same manner of “conducting one¬ 
self.” This is exemplified very well in a text devoted to the way 
in which a man was to conduct the affairs of his household and 
conduct himself as the master of the household.

Household 


Xenophon’s Oeconomicus contains the most fully devel¬ 
oped treatise on married life that classical Greece has left us. 
The text is presented as a set of precepts concerning the way 
to manage one’s estate. In conjunction with some specific 
advice on administering the domain, supervising the workers, 
undertaking different kinds of cultivation, applying the right 
techniques at the right time, and selling or buying as one 
should and when one should, Xenophon develops a number 
of general ideas: considerations on the need, in these matters, 
to rely on rational practices, which he sometimes designates 
by the term “knowledge” (episteme) and sometimes by the 
term signifying art or technique (techne); considerations on 
the goal to have in view (to preserve and develop the estate); 
and lastly, considerations on the means of achieving this ob¬ 
jective—that is, on the art of ruling. It is this theme that recurs
