The mileu in which this analysis is placed is socially and 
politically quite distinct. It is the small society of landholders 
who must maintain and increase the family wealth and be¬ 
queath it to those who bear their name. Xenophon explicitly 
contrasts this world with that of craftsmen, whose life is not 
beneficial either to their own health (because of their way of 
living), or to their friends, or to the city (seeing that they do 
not have the leisure to attend to its affairs). 1 The activity of 
landowners, on the other hand, is practiced in the market-

place, in the agora, where they can fulfill their duties as friends 
and as citizens, as well as in the oikos. But the oikos comprises 
more than just the house proper; it also includes the fields and 
possessions, wherever they may be located (even outside the 
boundaries of the city): “whatever someone possesses is part 
of his household”; it defines a whole sphere of activities. 2 And 
this activity is connected to a lifestyle and an ethical order. 
The landowner’s existence, if he takes proper care of his estate, 
is good for him first of all; in any case it is an endurance 
exercise, physical training that is good for the body, for its 
health and vigor; it also encourages piety by making it possible 
to offer rich sacrifices to the gods; it favors friendship relations 
by providing the occasion to show generosity, to satisfy fully 
one’s hospitality obligations, and to manifest one’s beneficence 
toward other citizens. Further, this activity is useful to the 
entire city in that it adds to its wealth and especially because 
it supplies it with good defenders: the landowner, being used 
to strenuous work, is a strong soldier and the wealth he pos¬ 
sesses motivates him to courageously defend the homeland. 3 

All these personal and civic advantages of the landowner’s 
life center on what is given to be the principal merit of the 
“economic” art: it teaches the practice of commanding and is 
indissociable from the latter. To manage the oikos is to com¬ 
mand, and being in charge of the household is not different 
from the power that is to be exercised in the city. Socrates says 
to Nicomachides in the Memorabilia: “Don’t look down on 
businessmen. For the management of private concerns differs
