to discourse. 

The objection will doubtless be raised that if so many 
stimulations and constraining mechanisms were necessary in 
order to speak of sex, this was because there reigned over 
everyone a certain fundamental prohibition; only definite 
necessities—economic pressures, political requirements— 
were able to lift this prohibition and open a few approaches 
to the discourse on sex, but these were limited and carefully 
coded; so much talk about sex, so many insistent devices 
contrived for causing it to be talked about—but under strict 
conditions: does this not prove that it was an object of se¬ 
crecy, and more important, that there is still an attempt to 
keep it that way? But this often-stated theme, that sex is 
outside of discourse and that only the removing of an obsta¬ 
cle, the breaking of a secret, can clear the way leading to it, 
is precisely what needs to be examined. Does it not partake 
of the injunction by which discourse is provoked? Is it not 
with the aim of inciting people to speak of sex that it is made

to mirror, at the outer limit of every actual discourse, some¬ 
thing akin to a secret whose discovery is imperative, a thing 
abusively reduced to silence, and at the same time difficult 
and necessary, dangerous and precious to divulge? We must 
not forget that by making sex into that which, above all else, 
had to be confessed, the Christian pastoral always presented 
it as the disquieting enigma: not a thing which stubbornly 
shows itself, but one which always hides, the insidious pres¬ 
ence that speaks in a voice so muted and often disguised that 
one risks remaining deaf to it. Doubtless the secret does not 
reside in that basic reality in relation to which all the incite¬ 
ments to speak of sex are situated—whether they try to force 
the secret, or whether in some obscure way they reinforce it 
by the manner in which they speak of it. It is a question 
rather of a theme that forms part of the very mechanics of 
these incitements: a way of giving shape to the requirement 
to speak about the matter, a fable that is indispensable to the 
endlessly proliferating economy of the discourse on sex. 
What is peculiar to modern societies, in fact, is not that they 
consigned sex to a shadow existence, but that they dedicated 
themselves to speaking of it ad infinitum, while exploiting it 
as the secret.
