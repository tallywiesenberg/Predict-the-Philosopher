to discourse. 

The objection will doubtless be raised that if so many 
stimulations and constraining mechanisms were necessary in 
order to speak of sex, this was because there reigned over 
everyone a certain fundamental prohibition; only definite 
necessities—economic pressures, political requirements— 
were able to lift this prohibition and open a few approaches 
to the discourse on sex, but these were limited and carefully 
coded; so much talk about sex, so many insistent devices 
contrived for causing it to be talked about—but under strict 
conditions: does this not prove that it was an object of se¬ 
crecy, and more important, that there is still an attempt to 
keep it that way? But this often-stated theme, that sex is 
outside of discourse and that only the removing of an obsta¬ 
cle, the breaking of a secret, can clear the way leading to it, 
is precisely what needs to be examined. Does it not partake 
of the injunction by which discourse is provoked? Is it not 
with the aim of inciting people to speak of sex that it is made

to mirror, at the outer limit of every actual discourse, some¬ 
thing akin to a secret whose discovery is imperative, a thing 
abusively reduced to silence, and at the same time difficult 
and necessary, dangerous and precious to divulge? We must 
not forget that by making sex into that which, above all else, 
had to be confessed, the Christian pastoral always presented 
it as the disquieting enigma: not a thing which stubbornly 
shows itself, but one which always hides, the insidious pres¬ 
ence that speaks in a voice so muted and often disguised that 
one risks remaining deaf to it. Doubtless the secret does not 
reside in that basic reality in relation to which all the incite¬ 
ments to speak of sex are situated—whether they try to force 
the secret, or whether in some obscure way they reinforce it 
by the manner in which they speak of it. It is a question 
rather of a theme that forms part of the very mechanics of 
these incitements: a way of giving shape to the requirement 
to speak about the matter, a fable that is indispensable to the 
endlessly proliferating economy of the discourse on sex. 
What is peculiar to modern societies, in fact, is not that they 
consigned sex to a shadow existence, but that they dedicated 
themselves to speaking of it ad infinitum, while exploiting it 
as the secret.

The Perverse 
Implantation 


A possible objection: it would be a mistake to see in this 
proliferation of discourses merely a quantitative phenome¬ 
non, something like a pure increase, as if what was said in 
them were immaterial, as if the fact of speaking about sex 
were of itself more important than the forms of imperatives 
that were imposed on it by speaking about it. For was this 
transformation of sex into discourse not governed by the 
endeavor to expel from reality the forms of sexuality that 
were ntrt amenable to the strict economy of reproduction: to 
say no to unproductive activities, to banish casual pleasures, 
to reduce or exclude practices whose object was not procrea¬ 
tion? Through the various discourses, legal sanctions against 
minor perversions were multiplied; sexual irregularity was 
annexed to mental illness; from childhood to old age, a norm 
of sexual development was defined and all the possible devia¬ 
tions were carefully described; pedagogical controls and 
medical treatments were organized; around the least fanta¬ 
sies, moralists, but especially doctors, brandished the whole 
emphatic vocabulary of abomination. Were these anything 
more than means employed to absorb, for the benefit of a 
genitally centered sexuality, all the fruitless pleasures? All 
this garrulous attention which has us in a stew over sexuality, 
is it not motivated by one basic concern: to ensure popula-

tion, to reproduce labor capacity, to perpetuate the form of 
social relations: in short, to constitute a sexuality that is 
economically useful and politically conservative? 

I still do not know whether this is the ultimate objective. 
But this much is certain: reduction has not been the means
