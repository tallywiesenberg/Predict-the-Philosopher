Modifications 


This series of studies is being published later than I had 
anticipated, and in a form that is altogether different.I will 
explain why.It was intended to be neither a history of sexual behaviors 
nor a history of representations, but a history of “sexuality” 
—the quotation marks have a certain importance.My aim was 
not to write a history of sexual behaviors and practices, tracing 
their successive forms, their evolution, and their dissemina¬ 
tion; nor was it to analyze the scientific, religious, or philo¬ 
sophical ideas through which these behaviors have been 
represented.I wanted first to dwell on that quite recent and 
banal notion of “sexuality”: to stand detached from it, brack¬ 
eting its familiarity, in order to analyze the theoretical and 
practical context with which it has been associated.
