The term 
itself did not appear until the beginning of the nineteenth

fields of knowledge and linked to a system of rules and con¬

rience of sexuality, where experience is understood as the 
correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normativity, 
and forms of subjectivity in a particular culture.
