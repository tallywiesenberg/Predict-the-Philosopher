To speak of sexuality in this way, I had to break with a 
conception that was rather common.Sexuality was conceived 
of as a constant.The hypothesis was that where it was mani¬ 
fested in historically singular forms, this was through various 
mechanisms of repression to which it was bound to be sub¬ 
jected in every society.What this amounted to, in effect, was 
that desire and the subject of desire were withdrawn from the 
historical field, and interdiction as a general form was made 
to account for anything historical in sexuality.But rejection 
of this hypothesis was not sufficient by itself.
