After first studying the games of truth (jeuxde verite) in their 
interplay with one another, as exemplified by certain empirical 
sciences in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and then 
studying their interaction with power relations, as exemplified 
by punitive practices—I felt obliged to study the games of 
truth in the relationship of self with self and the forming of 
oneself as a subject, taking as my domain of reference and field

man.” 

But it was clear that to undertake this genealogy would 
carry me far from my original project.I had to choose: either 
stick to the plan I had set, supplementing it with a brief 
historical survey of the theme of desire, or reorganize the 
whole study around the slow formation, in antiquity, of a 
hermeneutics of the self.I opted for the latter, reasoning that, 
after all, what I have held to, what I have tried to maintain 
for many years, is the effort to isolate some of the elements 
that might be useful for a history of truth.Not a history that

of himself as a living, speaking, laboring being; when he judges 
and punishes himself as a criminal?
