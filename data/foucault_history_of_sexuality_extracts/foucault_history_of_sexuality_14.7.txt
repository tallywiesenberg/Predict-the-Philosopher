What were the games of 
truth by which human beings came to see themselves as desir¬ 
ing individuals?It seemed to me that by framing the question 
in this way, and by attempting to develop it for a period that 
was rather far from the horizons with which I was familiar, 
I would be going more closely into the inquiry that I have long 
been committed to—even if this approach were to demand a 
few years of additional work.This long detour carried risks, 
to be sure; but I was motivated, and I seemed to have discov¬ 
ered a certain theoretical advantage in the research that I 
envisaged.The risks?First, there was the likelihood of delaying and 
upsetting the publication schedule that I had projected.
