I am 
gratef ul to those who followed the advances and detours of my 
work—I am thinking of my auditors at the College de France 
—and to those who had the patience to wait for its outcome 
—Pierre Nora in particular.As to those for whom to work 
hard, to begin and begin again, to attempt and be mistaken, 
to go back and rework everything from top to bottom, and still 
find reason to hesitate from one step to the next—as to those, 
in short, for whom to work in the midst of uncertainty and 
apprehension is tantamount to failure, all I can say is that 
clearly we are not from the same planet.There was also the danger that I would be dealing with 
documents with which I was insufficiently acquainted.* I 

*1 am neither a Hellenist nor a Latinist.But it seemed to me that if I gave enough 
care, patience, modesty, and attention to the task, it would be possible to gain 
sufficient familiarity with the ancient Greek and Roman texts; that is, a familiarity 
that would allow me—in keeping with a practice that is doubtless fundamental to 
Western philosophy—to examine both the difference that keeps us at a remove from 
a way of thinking in which we recognize the origin of our own, and the proximity 
that remains in spite of that distance which we never cease to explore.
