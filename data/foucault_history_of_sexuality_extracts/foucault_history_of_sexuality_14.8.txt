it, to alien forms of analysis or to modes of inquiry that would 
scarcely suit them.In dealing with this risk, I have benefited 
greatly from the works of Peter Brown and those of Pierre 
Hadot, and I have been helped more than once by the conver¬ 
sations we have had and the views they have expressed.In the 
effort to familiarize myself with the ancient texts, I also ran 
the contrary risk of losing the thread of the questions I wanted

tioning, to undertake a theoretical and methodological reformu¬ 
lation.Francois Wahl offered me invaluable advice.Paul Veyne has given me constant assistance throughout 
these years.
