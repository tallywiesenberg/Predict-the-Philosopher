He knows, what the true historian’s search for 
truth is about, but he also knows the labyrinth one enters 
when one sets out to trace the history of the games of truth 
and error.He is one of those individuals (rare nowadays) who 
are willing to face the hazard that the history of truth poses 
for all thought.His influence on what I have written here is 
pervasive.As for what motivated me, it is quite simple; I 
would hope that in the eyes of some people it might be suffi¬ 
cient in itself.It was curiosity—the only kind of curiosity, in 
any case, that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy: 
not the curiosity that seeks to assimilate what it is proper for 
one to know, but that which enables one to get free of oneself.
