only in point of number from that of public affairs. In other 
respects they are much alike . . . those who take charge of 
public affairs employ just the same men when they attend to 
their own; and those who understand how to employ them are 
successful directors of public and private concerns.” 4 The dia¬ 
logue on “economics” is structured as a grand analysis of the 
art of commanding. The beginning of the text evokes Cyrus 
the Younger, who personally supervised the cultivation of his 
land, worked in his garden as a daily practice, and who had

in this way acquired so much skill at leading men that when 
he was obliged to go to war, none of his soldiers ever deserted 
his army; rather than abandon him, they preferred to die 
fighting near his corpse. 5 In symmetrical fashion, the end of 
the text evokes the replica of that model ruler, such as one 
might find personified in those “great-minded” leaders whose 
armies always followed them without faltering, or in the estate 
master whose kingly ways sufficed to stir the workers to 
greater efforts as soon as they saw him, without his having to 
lose his temper, threaten, or punish. The domestic art was of 
the same nature as the political art or the military art, at least 
insofar as all three involved ruling others. 6 

It is in this framework of an art of “economy” that Xeno¬ 
phon introduces the problem of the relations between husband 
and wife. Now, the wife, as mistress of the house, is a key 
figure in the management of the oikos and she is essential for 
its good government. Socrates asks Critobulus: “Is there any¬ 
one to whom you entrust more serious matters than to your 
wife?”; and a little later, he adds: “I hold that a woman who 
is a good partner in the household is a proper counterweight 
to the man in attaining the good”; and in this sphere, “when 
things turn out well, the households increase, but when done 
badly, the households diminish.” 7 But, in spite of the wife’s 
importance, nothing has really prepared her to play the re¬ 
quired role, given her extreme youth, first of all, and the very 
brief education she has received (“Did you marry her when 
she was a very young girl and had seen and heard as little as 
possible?”), and also the near-total absence of relations with 
her husband, with whom she rarely converses (“is there any¬ 
one with whom you discuss fewer things than with your 
wife?”). 8 This is precisely where the need exists for the hus¬ 
band to establish relations with his wife that are for the pur¬ 
pose of training and guidance at the same time. In a society 
in which girls were given at a very young age—often around 
fifteen—to men who were often twice as old as they, the 
marital relationship, for which the oikos served as a support

and context, took the form of a pedagogy and a government 
of behavior. This was the husband’s responsibility. When the 
wife’s conduct, instead of bringing profit to the husband, 
caused him only detriment, who should get the blame? The 
husband. “When sheep fare badly, we usually fault the shep¬ 
herd, and when a horse behaves badly, we usually speak badly 
of the horseman; as for the woman, if she has been taught the 
good things by the man and still acts badly, the woman could 
perhaps justly be held at fault; on the other hand, if he doesn’t 
teach the fine and good things but makes use of her as though 
she is quite ignorant of them, wouldn’t the man justly be held 
at fault?” 9 

We see, then, that relations between spouses are not ques¬ 
tioned in themselves; they are not first seen as the simple 
relationship of a couple comprised of a man and a woman who 
might, in addition, have to attend to a house and family. 
Xenophon deals at length with the marital relation, but in an 
indirect, contextual, and technical fashion: he deals with it in 
the context of the oikos, as one aspect of the husband’s govern¬ 
mental responsibility and with a view to determining how the 
husband will be able to make his wife into the co-worker, the 
partner, the synergos he needs for the reasonable practice of 
economy. 

Ischomachus is asked to show that this technique can be 
taught; he has nothing more, and nothing less, in the way of 
teaching credentials than the fact of being a “gentleman”; he 
once found himself in the same situation as Critobulus is in; 
he married a woman who was quite young—she was fifteen, 
and her education had scarcely taught her more than how to 
make a cloak and how to give out the wool to the spinner 
maids; 10 but he had trained her so well and had made her such 
a valuable partner that he could put the house in her care 
while he went about his work, whether this was in the fields 
or in the agora —that is, in those places where male activity
