only in point of number from that of public affairs. In other 
respects they are much alike . . . those who take charge of 
public affairs employ just the same men when they attend to 
their own; and those who understand how to employ them are 
successful directors of public and private concerns.” 4 The dia¬ 
logue on “economics” is structured as a grand analysis of the 
art of commanding. The beginning of the text evokes Cyrus 
the Younger, who personally supervised the cultivation of his 
land, worked in his garden as a daily practice, and who had

in this way acquired so much skill at leading men that when 
he was obliged to go to war, none of his soldiers ever deserted 
his army; rather than abandon him, they preferred to die 
fighting near his corpse. 5 In symmetrical fashion, the end of 
the text evokes the replica of that model ruler, such as one 
might find personified in those “great-minded” leaders whose 
armies always followed them without faltering, or in the estate 
master whose kingly ways sufficed to stir the workers to 
greater efforts as soon as they saw him, without his having to 
lose his temper, threaten, or punish. The domestic art was of 
the same nature as the political art or the military art, at least 
insofar as all three involved ruling others. 6 

It is in this framework of an art of “economy” that Xeno¬ 
phon introduces the problem of the relations between husband 
and wife. Now, the wife, as mistress of the house, is a key 
figure in the management of the oikos and she is essential for 
its good government. Socrates asks Critobulus: “Is there any¬ 
one to whom you entrust more serious matters than to your 
wife?”; and a little later, he adds: “I hold that a woman who 
is a good partner in the household is a proper counterweight 
to the man in attaining the good”; and in this sphere, “when 
things turn out well, the households increase, but when done 
badly, the households diminish.” 7 But, in spite of the wife’s 
importance, nothing has really prepared her to play the re¬ 
quired role, given her extreme youth, first of all, and the very 
brief education she has received (“Did you marry her when 
she was a very young girl and had seen and heard as little as 
possible?”), and also the near-total absence of relations with 
her husband, with whom she rarely converses (“is there any¬ 
one with whom you discuss fewer things than with your 
wife?”). 8 This is precisely where the need exists for the hus¬
