pose of training and guidance at the same time. In a society 
in which girls were given at a very young age—often around 
fifteen—to men who were often twice as old as they, the 
marital relationship, for which the oikos served as a support

and context, took the form of a pedagogy and a government 
of behavior. This was the husband’s responsibility. When the 
wife’s conduct, instead of bringing profit to the husband, 
caused him only detriment, who should get the blame? The 
husband. “When sheep fare badly, we usually fault the shep¬ 
herd, and when a horse behaves badly, we usually speak badly 
of the horseman; as for the woman, if she has been taught the 
good things by the man and still acts badly, the woman could 
perhaps justly be held at fault; on the other hand, if he doesn’t 
teach the fine and good things but makes use of her as though 
she is quite ignorant of them, wouldn’t the man justly be held 
at fault?” 9 

We see, then, that relations between spouses are not ques¬ 
tioned in themselves; they are not first seen as the simple 
relationship of a couple comprised of a man and a woman who 
might, in addition, have to attend to a house and family. 
Xenophon deals at length with the marital relation, but in an 
indirect, contextual, and technical fashion: he deals with it in 
the context of the oikos, as one aspect of the husband’s govern¬ 
mental responsibility and with a view to determining how the 
husband will be able to make his wife into the co-worker, the 
partner, the synergos he needs for the reasonable practice of 
economy. 

Ischomachus is asked to show that this technique can be 
taught; he has nothing more, and nothing less, in the way of 
teaching credentials than the fact of being a “gentleman”; he 
once found himself in the same situation as Critobulus is in; 
he married a woman who was quite young—she was fifteen, 
and her education had scarcely taught her more than how to 
make a cloak and how to give out the wool to the spinner 
maids; 10 but he had trained her so well and had made her such 
a valuable partner that he could put the house in her care 
while he went about his work, whether this was in the fields 
or in the agora —that is, in those places where male activity
