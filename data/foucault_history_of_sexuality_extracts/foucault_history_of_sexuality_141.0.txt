the oikos, for the benefit of Socrates and Critobulus. Before 
giving advice on administering an agricultural domain, he will 
quite naturally begin by speaking of the household proper, 
whose administration must be well thought out if one wishes 
to have the time to take care of the animals and the fields, and 
if one does not want all the effort expended there to be wasted 
on account of domestic disorder. 

1. Ischomachus recalls the first principle of marriage by 
citing the discourse he remembers having addressed to his 
young wife shortly after marriage, when she had become “ac¬ 
customed” to her husband and “domesticated to the extent 
that we could have discussions”: “Tell me, woman, have you 
thought yet why it was that I took you and your parents gave 
you to me?” Ischomachus answers the question himself: “I 
considered for myself, and your parents for you, whom we 
might take as the best partner for the household and chil¬ 
dren.” 11 The marriage bond is thus represented in its original 
dissymmetry—the man decides for himself whereas it is the 
family that decides for the young woman—and in its dual 
finality: the house and the children. We may note, further, that 
the question of descendants is left aside for the moment and 
that before being trained for motherhood, the young woman 
must become a good mistress of the house. 12 And Ischoma¬ 
chus shows that this role is that of partner; the respective 
contribution of each does not have to be taken into considera¬ 
tion,* but only the way each one acts with a view to the 
common goal, which is “to keep their substance in the best 
condition but also to add as much as possible to it by fine and 
just means.” 14 One should note this emphasis on the necessary 
equalization of initial differences between the husband and the 
wife, and on the partnership that must be established between 
them; and yet it is clear that this community, this koinonia, 
is not established in the dual relation between two individuals,

may be substantial in terms of what each partner contributes. 1 ’

but is mediated by a common purpose, which is the household: 
its maintenance and also the dynamics of its increase. This will 
serve as a starting point for analyzing the forms of that “com¬ 
munity” and the specific nature of the roles that the two 
marriage partners should play. 

2. In order to define the respective functions of the two 
spouses in the household, Xenophon starts from the notion of 
the “shelter” (stegos): it seems that when the gods created the 
human couple, they were thinking of offspring and of the 
perpetuation of the race, of the support one needs in old age, 
and of the necessity “not to live in the open air, like beasts” 
—humans “obviously need shelter.” At first it looks as if 
descendants provide the family with its temporal dimension 
and shelter gives it its spatial organization. But things are a 
little more complex than that. The “shelter” does delimit an 
outside and an inside, the first being the man’s domain and the 
second constituting the privileged place of the woman; but it 
is also the place where they bring in, store, and preserve that 
which has been acquired; to shelter is to provide for future 
distribution at the right times. Outside, therefore, the man 
sows, cultivates, plows, and tends the flocks; he brings back 
the things he has produced, earned, or acquired through ex¬ 
change. Indoors, the woman for her part receives, preserves, 
and allocates according to need. Generally speaking, it is the 
husband’s activity that brings provisions into the house, but 
it is the wife’s management that regulates their expenditure. 15 
The two roles are exactly complementary and the absence of 
one would make the other useless: “My guarding and distribu¬ 
tion of the indoor things would look somewhat ridiculous,” 
says the wife, “if it weren’t your concern to bring in something 
from outside.” To which the husband replies that if there were 
no one to keep secure the things that are brought into the 
house, he would look as ridiculous as “those who are said to 
draw water with a leaking jar.” 16 Thus, two places, two forms 
of activity, and two ways of organizing time: on one side (that
