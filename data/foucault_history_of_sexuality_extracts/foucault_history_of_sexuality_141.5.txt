but is mediated by a common purpose, which is the household: 
its maintenance and also the dynamics of its increase. This will 
serve as a starting point for analyzing the forms of that “com¬ 
munity” and the specific nature of the roles that the two 
marriage partners should play. 

2. In order to define the respective functions of the two 
spouses in the household, Xenophon starts from the notion of 
the “shelter” (stegos): it seems that when the gods created the 
human couple, they were thinking of offspring and of the 
perpetuation of the race, of the support one needs in old age, 
and of the necessity “not to live in the open air, like beasts” 
—humans “obviously need shelter.” At first it looks as if 
descendants provide the family with its temporal dimension 
and shelter gives it its spatial organization. But things are a 
little more complex than that. The “shelter” does delimit an 
outside and an inside, the first being the man’s domain and the 
second constituting the privileged place of the woman; but it 
is also the place where they bring in, store, and preserve that 
which has been acquired; to shelter is to provide for future 
distribution at the right times. Outside, therefore, the man 
sows, cultivates, plows, and tends the flocks; he brings back 
the things he has produced, earned, or acquired through ex¬ 
change. Indoors, the woman for her part receives, preserves, 
and allocates according to need. Generally speaking, it is the 
husband’s activity that brings provisions into the house, but 
it is the wife’s management that regulates their expenditure. 15 
The two roles are exactly complementary and the absence of 
one would make the other useless: “My guarding and distribu¬ 
tion of the indoor things would look somewhat ridiculous,” 
says the wife, “if it weren’t your concern to bring in something 
from outside.” To which the husband replies that if there were 
no one to keep secure the things that are brought into the 
house, he would look as ridiculous as “those who are said to 
draw water with a leaking jar.” 16 Thus, two places, two forms 
of activity, and two ways of organizing time: on one side (that
