of the man), production, the rhythm of the seasons, waiting 
for the harvest, respecting and foreseeing the opportune time; 
on the other side (that of the woman), preservation and ex¬ 
penditure, ordering and distributing what is needed, orderly 
storage above all: Ischomachus dwells at length on all the 
advice he remembers giving his wife on how to store things in 
the space of the house so that she might find what she has put 
away, thus making her home a place of order and memory. 

In order that they might work together in the exercise of 
these different functions, the gods endowed each of the two 
sexes with particular qualities. Physical traits, first of all: to 
men, who must work in the open air “plowing, sowing, plant¬ 
ing, herding,” they gave the capacity to endure cold, heat, and 
journeys on foot; women, who work indoors, were given bod¬ 
ies that are less resistant. Character traits as well: women have 
a natural fear, but one that has positive effects—it induces 
them to be mindful of the provisions, to worry about losing 
them, to be in dread of using them up. The man, on the other 
hand, is brave, for he is obliged to defend himself outdoors 
against everything that might cause him injury. In short, “the 
god directly prepared the woman’s nature for indoor works 
and the man for works of the open air.” 17 But he also equipped 
them with common qualities: since in their respective roles 
men and women have to “give and take,” since in their activity 
as household managers they have to gather in and mete out, 
they both received memory and diligence (mneme and epi- 
meleia ). 18 

Hence each of the two marriage partners has a nature, a 
form of activity, and a place, which are defined in relation to 
the necessities of the oikos. That they remain steadfast part¬ 
ners is a good thing in the eyes of the “law,” the nomos —i.e., 
the regular custom that conforms exactly to nature’s inten¬ 
tions, assigns each person his role, and defines what is good 
and fine to do and not to do. This “law” declares good (kala) 
“what the god has brought forth each to be capable of”: hence 
“it is a finer thing [kallion \ for the woman to stay indoors than

to spend her time in the open” and not good for the man “to 
stay indoors instead of concerning himself with outdoor 
things.” To alter this division, going from one activity to the 
other, is to be in contempt of this nomos; it is at the same time 
to go against nature and to abandon one’s place: “When some¬ 
one acts in a way contrary to what the god has brought forth, 
perhaps in causing some disorder [atakton ] he is noticed by 
the gods and pays the penalty for neglecting his own works or 
for doing the woman’s works.” 19 The natural oppositeness of 
man and woman and the specificity of their aptitudes are 
indissociably tied to the good order of the household; they are 
designed for this order, and inversely, order demands them as 
obligations. 

3. This text, so detailed when it is a matter of determining 
the division of household tasks, is quite discrete on the ques¬ 
tion of sexual relations, both in terms of their place in the 
marital relationship and in regard to the prohibitions that 
might result from marriage as such. It is not that the impor¬ 
tance of having descendants is neglected; the fact is noted 
several times in the course of Ischomachus’ speech: he re¬ 
marks that it is one of the main objectives of marriage;* he also 
points out that nature has endowed the woman with a special 
affection that makes her better suited to take care of children; 
and he remarks how fortunate it is when one grows old to find 
the support that one needs in one’s children. 21 But nothing is 
said in this text about either procreation itself or the precau¬ 
tions to take in order to have the finest possible offspring: it 
is not yet time to take up this kind of question with the young 
bride. 

And yet several passages do refer to sexual conduct, to the 
necessary moderation and to the physical attachment between 
husband and wife. We first have to recall the very beginning 
of the text, where the two interlocutors start to talk about 

*He specifies that the deity brings the man and woman together with a view to 
children, and the law makes them partners with a view to the household . 20
