of the man), production, the rhythm of the seasons, waiting 
for the harvest, respecting and foreseeing the opportune time; 
on the other side (that of the woman), preservation and ex¬ 
penditure, ordering and distributing what is needed, orderly 
storage above all: Ischomachus dwells at length on all the 
advice he remembers giving his wife on how to store things in 
the space of the house so that she might find what she has put 
away, thus making her home a place of order and memory. 

In order that they might work together in the exercise of 
these different functions, the gods endowed each of the two 
sexes with particular qualities. Physical traits, first of all: to 
men, who must work in the open air “plowing, sowing, plant¬ 
ing, herding,” they gave the capacity to endure cold, heat, and 
journeys on foot; women, who work indoors, were given bod¬ 
ies that are less resistant. Character traits as well: women have 
a natural fear, but one that has positive effects—it induces 
them to be mindful of the provisions, to worry about losing 
them, to be in dread of using them up. The man, on the other 
hand, is brave, for he is obliged to defend himself outdoors 
against everything that might cause him injury. In short, “the 
god directly prepared the woman’s nature for indoor works 
and the man for works of the open air.” 17 But he also equipped 
them with common qualities: since in their respective roles 
men and women have to “give and take,” since in their activity 
as household managers they have to gather in and mete out, 
they both received memory and diligence (mneme and epi- 
meleia ). 18 

Hence each of the two marriage partners has a nature, a 
form of activity, and a place, which are defined in relation to 
the necessities of the oikos. That they remain steadfast part¬ 
ners is a good thing in the eyes of the “law,” the nomos —i.e., 
the regular custom that conforms exactly to nature’s inten¬ 
tions, assigns each person his role, and defines what is good 
and fine to do and not to do. This “law” declares good (kala) 
“what the god has brought forth each to be capable of”: hence 
“it is a finer thing [kallion \ for the woman to stay indoors than
