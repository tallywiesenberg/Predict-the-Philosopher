softness of soul, insouciance, but also—mistresses more inflex¬ 
ible than the others—gluttony, drunkenness, lust, and foolish, 
expensive ambitions. Those who yield to this sort of despotism 
of the appetites will only bring ruin to their bodies, their souls, 
and their households. 22 But Critobulus prides himself on hav¬ 
ing already defeated these enemies; his moral training has 
supplied him with a sufficient amount of enkrateia: “On exam¬ 
ining myself I seem to find I am fairly self-controlled in such 
matters, so that if you advise me about what I might do to 
increase my household, it seems to me I wouldn’t be prevented 
from doing it, at least by those things you call mistresses.” 23 
This is what entitles Critobulus to say that he is now ready to 
play the role of master of a household and to learn the difficult 
tasks that are involved. It has to be understood that marriage, 
the functions of a head of a family, and the government of an 
oikos presuppose that one has acquired the ability to govern 
oneself. 

Further on, in Ischomachus’ listing of different qualities 
with which nature has supplied each of the two sexes in order 
for them to play their domestic roles, he mentions self-control 
(enkrateia). He does not describe it as a trait belonging specifi¬ 
cally to the man or the woman, but as a virtue common to both 
sexes, like memory and diligence; individual differences may 
modulate the distribution of this quality; and what shows its 
high value in married life is that it is awarded to the better of 
the marriage partners: be it the husband or the wife, the better 
one has the larger share of this virtue. 24 

Now, in the case of Ischomachus, we see how his self- 
restraint is manifested for its own sake and how it guides that 
of his wife. As a matter of fact, there is an incident spoken of 
in the dialogue that relates rather explicitly to certain aspects 
of the sexual life of the couple: I am thinking of the one having

to do with makeup and face paint. 25 This is an important 
theme in ancient morality, for adornment posed the problem 
of the relationships between truth and the pleasures, and by 
bringing the play of artifice into the latter, it confused the 
principles of their natural regulation. The question of coquetry 
in Ischomachus’ wife has nothing to do with her faithfulness, 
which is taken for granted throughout the text; nor does it 
concern her lack of thrift: it is a matter of knowing how the 
wife can display herself and be recognized by her husband as 
an object of pleasure and a sexual partner in the marital rela¬ 
tion. It is this question that Ischomachus addresses, in the 
form of a lesson, one day when, thinking to please him (by 
seeming to have “a fairer complexion” than she really has, 
“rosier” cheeks, and a “taller and more slender” figure), his 
wife appears before him perched on high sandals and all made 
up with ceruse and alkanet dye. Ischomachus will respond to 
this reprehensible behavior by giving a two-part lesson. 

The first part is negative; it consists in criticizing makeup 
as deception. This deception may fool strangers, but there is 
no way it can delude a man with whom one lives and who 
therefore has the possibility of seeing his wife when she rises 
from her bed, when she is sweating or in tears, and when she 
leaves her bath. But most important, Ischomachus criticizes 
this trickery for violating a basic principle of marriage. Xeno¬ 
phon does not appeal directly to the long-lived and often 
encountered aphorism that said marriage was a community 
(koinonia) of property, of life, and of bodies; but it is clear that 
the theme of a threefold community is at work throughout the 
text: a community of property concerning which the author 
declares that each partner ought to forget the share he or she 
has contributed; a community of life that makes the prosperity 
of the estate one of its objectives; and a community of bodies 
that is explicitly emphasized (ton somaton koinonesantes). 
Now, the community of property rules out deception; and the 
man would behave badly toward his wife if he made her think 
he possessed more than was really the case; in the same way,

they must not try to deceive one another about their bodies; 
for his part, he would not apply vermilion to his face; in the 
same way, she must not embellish herself with ceruse. The just 
community of bodies demands this consideration. The attrac¬ 
tion that should come into play between husband and wife is 
the kind that expresses itself naturally—as in every animal 
species—between male and female: “Just as the gods have 
made horses most pleasant to horses, oxen to oxen, and sheep 
to sheep, so human beings [anthropoi] suppose the undisguised 
body of a human being is most pleasant.” 26 It is natural attrac¬ 
tion that should serve as the basis for sexual relations between
