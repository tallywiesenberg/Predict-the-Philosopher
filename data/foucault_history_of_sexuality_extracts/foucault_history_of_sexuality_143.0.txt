softness of soul, insouciance, but also—mistresses more inflex¬ 
ible than the others—gluttony, drunkenness, lust, and foolish, 
expensive ambitions. Those who yield to this sort of despotism 
of the appetites will only bring ruin to their bodies, their souls, 
and their households. 22 But Critobulus prides himself on hav¬ 
ing already defeated these enemies; his moral training has 
supplied him with a sufficient amount of enkrateia: “On exam¬ 
ining myself I seem to find I am fairly self-controlled in such 
matters, so that if you advise me about what I might do to 
increase my household, it seems to me I wouldn’t be prevented 
from doing it, at least by those things you call mistresses.” 23 
This is what entitles Critobulus to say that he is now ready to 
play the role of master of a household and to learn the difficult 
tasks that are involved. It has to be understood that marriage, 
the functions of a head of a family, and the government of an 
oikos presuppose that one has acquired the ability to govern 
oneself. 

Further on, in Ischomachus’ listing of different qualities 
with which nature has supplied each of the two sexes in order 
for them to play their domestic roles, he mentions self-control 
(enkrateia). He does not describe it as a trait belonging specifi¬ 
cally to the man or the woman, but as a virtue common to both 
sexes, like memory and diligence; individual differences may 
modulate the distribution of this quality; and what shows its 
high value in married life is that it is awarded to the better of 
the marriage partners: be it the husband or the wife, the better 
one has the larger share of this virtue. 24 

Now, in the case of Ischomachus, we see how his self- 
restraint is manifested for its own sake and how it guides that 
of his wife. As a matter of fact, there is an incident spoken of 
in the dialogue that relates rather explicitly to certain aspects 
of the sexual life of the couple: I am thinking of the one having

to do with makeup and face paint. 25 This is an important 
theme in ancient morality, for adornment posed the problem 
of the relationships between truth and the pleasures, and by 
bringing the play of artifice into the latter, it confused the 
principles of their natural regulation. The question of coquetry 
in Ischomachus’ wife has nothing to do with her faithfulness, 
which is taken for granted throughout the text; nor does it
