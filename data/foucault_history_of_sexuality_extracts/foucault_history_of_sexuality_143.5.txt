concern her lack of thrift: it is a matter of knowing how the 
wife can display herself and be recognized by her husband as 
an object of pleasure and a sexual partner in the marital rela¬ 
tion. It is this question that Ischomachus addresses, in the 
form of a lesson, one day when, thinking to please him (by 
seeming to have “a fairer complexion” than she really has, 
“rosier” cheeks, and a “taller and more slender” figure), his 
wife appears before him perched on high sandals and all made 
up with ceruse and alkanet dye. Ischomachus will respond to 
this reprehensible behavior by giving a two-part lesson. 

The first part is negative; it consists in criticizing makeup 
as deception. This deception may fool strangers, but there is 
no way it can delude a man with whom one lives and who 
therefore has the possibility of seeing his wife when she rises 
from her bed, when she is sweating or in tears, and when she 
leaves her bath. But most important, Ischomachus criticizes 
this trickery for violating a basic principle of marriage. Xeno¬ 
phon does not appeal directly to the long-lived and often 
encountered aphorism that said marriage was a community 
(koinonia) of property, of life, and of bodies; but it is clear that 
the theme of a threefold community is at work throughout the 
text: a community of property concerning which the author 
declares that each partner ought to forget the share he or she 
has contributed; a community of life that makes the prosperity 
of the estate one of its objectives; and a community of bodies 
that is explicitly emphasized (ton somaton koinonesantes). 
Now, the community of property rules out deception; and the 
man would behave badly toward his wife if he made her think 
he possessed more than was really the case; in the same way,

they must not try to deceive one another about their bodies; 
for his part, he would not apply vermilion to his face; in the 
same way, she must not embellish herself with ceruse. The just 
community of bodies demands this consideration. The attrac¬ 
tion that should come into play between husband and wife is 
the kind that expresses itself naturally—as in every animal 
species—between male and female: “Just as the gods have 
made horses most pleasant to horses, oxen to oxen, and sheep 
to sheep, so human beings [anthropoi] suppose the undisguised 
body of a human being is most pleasant.” 26 It is natural attrac¬ 
tion that should serve as the basis for sexual relations between
