spouses and for the community of bodies they constitute. 
Ischomachus’ enkrateia rejects all the artifices that people use 
in order to increase desires and pleasures. 

But a question arises: how can the wife remain an object of 
desire for her husband? How can she be sure of not being 
supplanted someday by someone younger and prettier? The 
young wife of Ischomachus asks him directly: what can she do 
not just to seem beautiful but to be beautiful and remain so? 27 
And once again, by a logic that may appear strange to us, the 
household and the government of the household will be the 
crucial factor. According to Ischomachus, at any rate, the 
wife’s real beauty is sufficiently guaranteed by her household 
occupations, provided that she goes about them in the right 
way. He explains that by performing her appointed tasks, she 
will not sit about, huddled up like a slave, or remain idle like 
a coquette. She will stand, she will observe, she will supervise, 
she will go from room to room checking the work that is in 
progress; standing and walking will give her body that certain 
demeanor, that carriage which in the eyes of the Greeks cha¬ 
racterized the physique of the free individual (Ischomachus 
will later show that a man becomes vigorous as a soldier and 
free citizen through his active participation in the responsibili¬ 
ties of a taskmaster). 28 In the same way, it is good for the 
mistress of the house to mix flour and knead dough, and to 
shake out and fold the bedcovers. 29 In this way the body’s

handsomeness will be shaped and maintained; the condition of 
mastery has its physical version, which is beauty. Further, the 
wife’s clothes have a freshness and elegance that set her apart 
from her servants. In any case, she will always enjoy an advan¬ 
tage over the latter from the fact that she seeks willingly to 
please instead of being obliged to submit under compulsion 
like a slave girl. Here Xenophon seems to be referring to the 
same principle he evokes elsewhere: the pleasure that one 
takes by force is much less agreeable than that which is freely 
offered. 30 It is the latter pleasure that the wife can give her 
husband. Thus, by virtue of the forms of a physical beauty that 
is indissociable from her privileged status and by virtue of her 
unconstrained willingness to gratify (charizesthai), the mis¬ 
tress of the household will always be preeminent over the 
other women of the household. 

In this text devoted to the “masculine” art of governing a 
household—wife, servants, estate—there is no allusion to the 
sexual faithfulness of the wife or to the fact that her husband 
should be her only sexual partner: this is taken for granted as 
a necessary principle. As for the self-restrained attitude of the 
husband, it is never defined as the monopoly over all his sexual 
activity which he would concede to his wif e. What is at stake 
in this reflective practice of marital life, what appears as essen¬ 
tial to the orderliness of the household, to the peace that must 
reign within it, and to the woman’s expectations, is that she 
be able, as the lawful wife, to keep the preeminent place that 
marriage has assigned to her: not to see another woman given 
preference over her, not to suffer a loss of status and dignity, 
not to be replaced at her husband’s side by another—this was 
what mattered to her above all else. For the threat to marriage 
did not come from the pleasure which the husband happened 
to enjoy here or there, but from the rivalries that might form 
between the wife and the other women over one’s position in 
the household and over the order of precedence to be ob¬ 
served. The “faithful” husband (pistos) was not the one who 
linked the state of marriage to the renunciation of all sexual

The Use of Pleasure 


pleasure enjoyed with someone else; it was the husband who 
steadfastly maintained the privileges to which the wife was 
entitled by marriage. Moreover, this is how the “betrayed” 
women who appear in Euripides’ tragedies understand the 
matter. Medea complains bitterly of Jason’s “unfaithfulness”: 
he has forsaken her for a royal bride and he will beget descend¬ 
ants who will reduce his children by Medea to a state of 
humiliation and servitude. 31 What makes Creusa lament the 
imagined “betrayal” of Xuthus is the thought of living “a 
childless life, in a house forsaken and solitary”; it is that—at 
least this is what she is made to believe—“into her house,” 
which was the house of Erechtheus, will come “a motherless 
nobody, some slave’s brat.” 32 

This preeminence of the wife, which the husband must 
protect, was implied by the act of marriage. But it was not 
acquired once and for all; it was not guaranteed by any moral 
pledge on the part of the husband; even in addition to the 
possibility of repudiation and divorce, there was always the
