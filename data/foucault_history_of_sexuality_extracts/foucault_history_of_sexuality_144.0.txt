spouses and for the community of bodies they constitute. 
Ischomachus’ enkrateia rejects all the artifices that people use 
in order to increase desires and pleasures. 

But a question arises: how can the wife remain an object of 
desire for her husband? How can she be sure of not being 
supplanted someday by someone younger and prettier? The 
young wife of Ischomachus asks him directly: what can she do 
not just to seem beautiful but to be beautiful and remain so? 27 
And once again, by a logic that may appear strange to us, the 
household and the government of the household will be the 
crucial factor. According to Ischomachus, at any rate, the 
wife’s real beauty is sufficiently guaranteed by her household 
occupations, provided that she goes about them in the right 
way. He explains that by performing her appointed tasks, she 
will not sit about, huddled up like a slave, or remain idle like 
a coquette. She will stand, she will observe, she will supervise, 
she will go from room to room checking the work that is in 
progress; standing and walking will give her body that certain 
demeanor, that carriage which in the eyes of the Greeks cha¬ 
racterized the physique of the free individual (Ischomachus 
will later show that a man becomes vigorous as a soldier and 
free citizen through his active participation in the responsibili¬ 
ties of a taskmaster). 28 In the same way, it is good for the 
mistress of the house to mix flour and knead dough, and to 
shake out and fold the bedcovers. 29 In this way the body’s

handsomeness will be shaped and maintained; the condition of 
mastery has its physical version, which is beauty. Further, the 
wife’s clothes have a freshness and elegance that set her apart 
from her servants. In any case, she will always enjoy an advan¬ 
tage over the latter from the fact that she seeks willingly to 
please instead of being obliged to submit under compulsion 
like a slave girl. Here Xenophon seems to be referring to the 
same principle he evokes elsewhere: the pleasure that one 
takes by force is much less agreeable than that which is freely 
offered. 30 It is the latter pleasure that the wife can give her 
husband. Thus, by virtue of the forms of a physical beauty that 
is indissociable from her privileged status and by virtue of her 
unconstrained willingness to gratify (charizesthai), the mis¬ 
tress of the household will always be preeminent over the 
other women of the household.
