In this text devoted to the “masculine” art of governing a 
household—wife, servants, estate—there is no allusion to the 
sexual faithfulness of the wife or to the fact that her husband 
should be her only sexual partner: this is taken for granted as 
a necessary principle. As for the self-restrained attitude of the 
husband, it is never defined as the monopoly over all his sexual 
activity which he would concede to his wif e. What is at stake 
in this reflective practice of marital life, what appears as essen¬ 
tial to the orderliness of the household, to the peace that must 
reign within it, and to the woman’s expectations, is that she 
be able, as the lawful wife, to keep the preeminent place that 
marriage has assigned to her: not to see another woman given 
preference over her, not to suffer a loss of status and dignity, 
not to be replaced at her husband’s side by another—this was 
what mattered to her above all else. For the threat to marriage 
did not come from the pleasure which the husband happened 
to enjoy here or there, but from the rivalries that might form 
between the wife and the other women over one’s position in 
the household and over the order of precedence to be ob¬

linked the state of marriage to the renunciation of all sexual

The Use of Pleasure 


pleasure enjoyed with someone else; it was the husband who 
steadfastly maintained the privileges to which the wife was 
entitled by marriage. Moreover, this is how the “betrayed” 
women who appear in Euripides’ tragedies understand the 
matter. Medea complains bitterly of Jason’s “unfaithfulness”: 
he has forsaken her for a royal bride and he will beget descend¬ 
ants who will reduce his children by Medea to a state of 
humiliation and servitude. 31 What makes Creusa lament the 
imagined “betrayal” of Xuthus is the thought of living “a 
childless life, in a house forsaken and solitary”; it is that—at 
least this is what she is made to believe—“into her house,” 
which was the house of Erechtheus, will come “a motherless 
nobody, some slave’s brat.” 32 

This preeminence of the wife, which the husband must 
protect, was implied by the act of marriage. But it was not 
acquired once and for all; it was not guaranteed by any moral 
pledge on the part of the husband; even in addition to the 
possibility of repudiation and divorce, there was always the
