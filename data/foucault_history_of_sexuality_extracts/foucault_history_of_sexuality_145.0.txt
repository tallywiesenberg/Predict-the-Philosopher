threat of a de facto loss of prestige. Now, what Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus and Ischomachus’ discourse show is that while 
the husband’s wisdom—his enkrateia but also his knowledge 
as head of a family—was always ready to acknowledge the 
wife’s privileges, the wife, if she was to preserve them, must 
in return exercise her function in the house and accomplish 
the tasks that were associated with it in the best possible way. 
Ischomachus does not promise his wife at the outset either 
“sexual fidelity” in the way we understand it, or even that she 
will never have to fear any other preference on his part; but 
just as he assures her that her activity as mistress of the house, 
her bearing and her way of dressing, will give her a greater 
charm than that of the servants, he also assures her that she 
can keep the place of honor in the house until old age. And 
he suggests a kind of contest between the two of them to see 
who behaves best and who is the most diligent in caring for 
the household; if she manages to win, she will then have 
nothing more to fear from any sort of rival, even a young one.

“But the most pleasant thing of all: if you look to be better 
than I and make me your servant, you will have no need to 
fear that with advancing age you will be honored any less in 
the household, and you may trust that as you grow older, the 
better a partner you prove to be for me, and for the children 
a better guardian of the household, by so much more will you 
be honored in the household.” 33 

In this ethics of married life, the “fidelity” that is recom¬ 
mended to the husband is therefore something quite different 
from the sexual exclusivity that marriage imposes on the wife. 
It has to do with maintaining the wife’s status and privileges, 
and her preeminence over other women. And while it does 
imply a certain reciprocity of behavior between the man and 
the woman, this is in the sense that the man’s faithfulness 
would correspond not so much to the good sexual conduct of 
the wife, which is always presupposed, but to the way in which 
she conducts the household and conducts herself in the house¬ 
hold. A reciprocity, then, but a fundamental dissymmetry 
since the two interdependent behaviors are not based on the 
same exigencies and do not obey the same principles. The 
husband’s self-restraint pertains to an art of governing—gov¬ 
erning in general, governing oneself, and governing a wife who 
must be kept under control and respected at the same time, 
since in relation to her husband she is the obedient mistress 
of the household.

Three Policies of 
Moderation 


Other texts, dating from the fourth century and the begin¬ 
ning of the fifth, also develop the theme that the state of 
marriage calls for at least some form of sexual moderation. 
Three of these texts are especially noteworthy: the passage in 
the Laws where Plato discusses the rules and obligations of 
marriage; Isocrates’ exposition concerning the way Nicocles 
manages his life as a married man; and a treatise on economics 
attributed to Aristotle and definitely a product of his school. 
These texts are very different from one another in their subject 
matter: the first offers a system of authoritarian regulation of 
behaviors in the context of an ideal city; the second character¬ 
izes the personal lifestyle of an autocrat who is respectful of 
himself and others; the third seeks to define the principles that 
any man will find useful for directing his household. In any 
case, unlike Xenophon’s Oeconomicus, none of them refers to 
the appropriate way of life of a landowner nor consequently 
to the tasks associated with the management of an estate, tasks 
that he must assume in complementarity with his wife. In spite 
of the differences that separate them, these texts all seem to 
emphasize—more clearly than that of Xenophon—a demand 
resembling something that could be called the principle of 
“double sexual monopoly”; that is, they seem to want to local¬ 
ize a whole class of sexual activity, both for the man and for 
the woman, in the marital relation alone. In the same way as 
his spouse, the man is presented as being obligated, or at least
