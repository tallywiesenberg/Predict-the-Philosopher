Three Policies of 
Moderation 


Other texts, dating from the fourth century and the begin¬ 
ning of the fifth, also develop the theme that the state of 
marriage calls for at least some form of sexual moderation. 
Three of these texts are especially noteworthy: the passage in 
the Laws where Plato discusses the rules and obligations of 
marriage; Isocrates’ exposition concerning the way Nicocles 
manages his life as a married man; and a treatise on economics 
attributed to Aristotle and definitely a product of his school. 
These texts are very different from one another in their subject 
matter: the first offers a system of authoritarian regulation of 
behaviors in the context of an ideal city; the second character¬ 
izes the personal lifestyle of an autocrat who is respectful of 
himself and others; the third seeks to define the principles that 
any man will find useful for directing his household. In any 
case, unlike Xenophon’s Oeconomicus, none of them refers to 
the appropriate way of life of a landowner nor consequently 
to the tasks associated with the management of an estate, tasks 
that he must assume in complementarity with his wife. In spite 
of the differences that separate them, these texts all seem to 
emphasize—more clearly than that of Xenophon—a demand 
resembling something that could be called the principle of 
“double sexual monopoly”; that is, they seem to want to local¬ 
ize a whole class of sexual activity, both for the man and for 
the woman, in the marital relation alone. In the same way as 
his spouse, the man is presented as being obligated, or at least
