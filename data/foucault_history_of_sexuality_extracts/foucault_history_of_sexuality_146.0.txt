demand for a certain symmetry, therefore; and a tendency to 
define marriage not just as the privileged place, but perhaps 
as the only place for morally acceptable sexual relations. How¬ 
ever, a reading of these three texts shows that it would clearly 
be a mistake to project onto them retrospectively a principle 
of “reciprocal sexual fidelity” like the one that served as a 
juridico-moral pillar for later forms of matrimonial practice. 
The fact is that in all these texts, the obligation the husband 
is under, or the recommendation that is made to him, to be 
moderate to the extent of having no other sexual partner but 
his own wife is not the result of a personal commitment he 
might make with respect to her; it is the result of a political 
regulation that is imposed by fiat in the case of the Platonic 
laws, or—in the case of Isocrates or Aristotle—by the hus¬ 
band himself through a sort of deliberate self-limitation of 
his power. 

1. Thus, when it is stipulated in the Laws that one should 
marry at the proper age (for men, between the ages of twenty- 
five and thirty-five), beget children in the best possible condi¬ 
tions, and not have relations—whether one is a man or a 
woman—with anyone other than one’s marriage partner, all 
these injunctions take the form, not of a voluntary ethics, but 
of a coercive regimentation; it is true that the author remarks 
several times on the difficulty of legislating in this area and on 
the desirability for some measures to take the form of an 
ordinance only in the case of disorders and where the greatest 
number is no longer capable of moderation. 1 In any case, the 
principles of this moral code are always directly referred to the 
needs of the state, and never to the internal demands of the 
household, the family, or married life: one should bear in mind 
that the good marriage is the one that benefits the city and it 
is for the sake of the latter that the children ought to be “the 
noblest and best possible.” 2 Unions that—with respect to pro¬ 
portions beneficial to the state—should not be instances of the

rich marrying the rich; 3 meticulous inspections that would 
verify that young couples are carefully preparing themselves 
for the procreative task; 4 the injunction, backed up by penal¬ 
ties, to inseminate only one’s lawful wife without having any 
other sexual relations during the period in which one is capa¬ 
ble of procreation 5 —all this is tied to the particular structures 
of an ideal city and is rather foreign to a style of moderation 
based on the voluntary pursuit of moderation.* 

It should be noted, however, that Plato puts only a limited 
amount of trust in the law when it is a question of regulating 
sexual conduct. He does not believe it will achieve adequate 
results if one does not use measures other than its prescrip¬ 
tions and threats for controlling such violent desires. 7 More 
effective means of persuasion are needed for this, and Plato 
lists four. (1) Public opinion: Plato refers to what happens in 
the case of incest; how is it, he asks, that men have come to 
the point where they don’t even feel any desire for their broth¬ 
ers and sisters, their sons and daughters, however beautiful 
they may be? The explanation is that they have heard it said 
constantly that these acts are “hateful to the gods” and that 
no one has ever had the occasion to hear different pronounce¬ 
ments on the subject; what is needed, therefore, in regard to 
all blameworthy sexual acts, is for “the unanimous public 
voice” to be similarly “sanctified.” (2) Glory: Plato cites the 
example of athletes who, in their desire to win a victory in the 
games, place themselves under a strict regimen, not going near 
a woman, or a boy either, the whole time of their training: 
surely victory over those internal enemies, the pleasures, is 
finer than the victory one may win over rivals. 9 (3) The honor 
of the human being: Here Plato gives an example that will be 
used often subsequently; he speaks of those animals which live 
in bands, each in the midst of others, but “which live celibate, 

•Note that once past the age limit for having children, “the man or woman 
who behaves moderately [sophrorion kai sophronousa] in all such respects should be 
accorded an entirely good reputation; he who behaves in the opposite fashion should 
be honored in the opposite way—or rather dishonored .” 6

pure, and chaste”; when the age for procreation is reached, 
they separate from the group and pair into couples that will 
last. Now, it will be noticed that this animal conjugality is not 
cited as a natural principle that would be universal, but rather 
as a challenge that men ought to take up: how could calling 
attention to such a practice fail to prompt reasonable men to 
prove themselves “superior to the beasts.” 10 (4) Shame: By 
reducing the frequency of sexual activity, shame will “weaken 
the sway of this mistress”; without there being the need to
