of an ideal city and is rather foreign to a style of moderation 
based on the voluntary pursuit of moderation.* 

It should be noted, however, that Plato puts only a limited 
amount of trust in the law when it is a question of regulating 
sexual conduct. He does not believe it will achieve adequate 
results if one does not use measures other than its prescrip¬ 
tions and threats for controlling such violent desires. 7 More 
effective means of persuasion are needed for this, and Plato 
lists four. (1) Public opinion: Plato refers to what happens in 
the case of incest; how is it, he asks, that men have come to 
the point where they don’t even feel any desire for their broth¬ 
ers and sisters, their sons and daughters, however beautiful 
they may be? The explanation is that they have heard it said 
constantly that these acts are “hateful to the gods” and that 
no one has ever had the occasion to hear different pronounce¬ 
ments on the subject; what is needed, therefore, in regard to 
all blameworthy sexual acts, is for “the unanimous public 
voice” to be similarly “sanctified.” (2) Glory: Plato cites the 
example of athletes who, in their desire to win a victory in the 
games, place themselves under a strict regimen, not going near 
a woman, or a boy either, the whole time of their training: 
surely victory over those internal enemies, the pleasures, is 
finer than the victory one may win over rivals. 9 (3) The honor 
of the human being: Here Plato gives an example that will be 
used often subsequently; he speaks of those animals which live 
in bands, each in the midst of others, but “which live celibate, 

•Note that once past the age limit for having children, “the man or woman 
who behaves moderately [sophrorion kai sophronousa] in all such respects should be 
accorded an entirely good reputation; he who behaves in the opposite fashion should 
be honored in the opposite way—or rather dishonored .” 6

pure, and chaste”; when the age for procreation is reached, 
they separate from the group and pair into couples that will 
last. Now, it will be noticed that this animal conjugality is not 
cited as a natural principle that would be universal, but rather 
as a challenge that men ought to take up: how could calling 
attention to such a practice fail to prompt reasonable men to 
prove themselves “superior to the beasts.” 10 (4) Shame: By 
reducing the frequency of sexual activity, shame will “weaken 
the sway of this mistress”; without there being the need to
