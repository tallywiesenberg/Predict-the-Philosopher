prohibit the acts, it will be held “noble to engage in them if 
one escapes notice,” and people will have to learn that to 
commit them openly is “shameful” by “the custom laid down 
in habit and unwritten law.” 11 

Hence Plato’s legislation does set a requirement that is 
symmetrical for the man and the woman, each on their own 
account. It is because they have a certain role to play for the 
common purpose—that of father and mother of future citizens 
—that they are bound exactly in the same way by the same 
laws, which impose the same restrictions on both. But it is 
important to see that this symmetry in no way implies that 
husband and wife are held to “sexual fidelity” by a personal 
bond that would be intrinsic to the matrimonial relation and 
constitute a mutual commitment. The symmetry is not based 
on a direct and reciprocal relation between the two, but on an 
element that dominates both of them: principles and laws to 
which they are both subjected in the same way. It is true that 
their compliance must be voluntary, the result of an internal 
persuasion; but the latter does not involve an attachment they 
should have for one another; it involves the reverence one 
should feel for the law, or the concern one should have for 
oneself, one’s reputation, one’s honor. The relation of the 
individual to himself and to his city in the form of respect or 
shame, honor or glory—not the relation to the other person 
—is what imposes this obedience. 

And we may note that in Plato’s proposal for the law con¬ 
cerning “the choices of love,” he envisages two possible for-

mulations. According to one, every individual would be for¬ 
bidden to touch any woman of good birth who is not his lawful 
wife, to procreate outside of marriage, and to “go against 
nature and sow sterile seed in males.” The other formulation 
repeats the prohibition against male love relations, making it 
absolute this time; as for extramarital sexual relations, he 
contemplates punishment only in cases where the wrongdoing 
would not go unnoticed by “all men and women.”* Clearly, 
then, the double obligation to limit sexual activities relates to 
the stability of the city, to its public morality, to the conditions 
of good procreation, and not to the reciprocal obligations that 
attach to a dual relation between husbands and wives.
