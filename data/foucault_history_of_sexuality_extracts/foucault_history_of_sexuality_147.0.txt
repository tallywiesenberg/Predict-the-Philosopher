prohibit the acts, it will be held “noble to engage in them if 
one escapes notice,” and people will have to learn that to 
commit them openly is “shameful” by “the custom laid down 
in habit and unwritten law.” 11 

Hence Plato’s legislation does set a requirement that is 
symmetrical for the man and the woman, each on their own 
account. It is because they have a certain role to play for the 
common purpose—that of father and mother of future citizens 
—that they are bound exactly in the same way by the same 
laws, which impose the same restrictions on both. But it is 
important to see that this symmetry in no way implies that 
husband and wife are held to “sexual fidelity” by a personal 
bond that would be intrinsic to the matrimonial relation and 
constitute a mutual commitment. The symmetry is not based 
on a direct and reciprocal relation between the two, but on an 
element that dominates both of them: principles and laws to 
which they are both subjected in the same way. It is true that 
their compliance must be voluntary, the result of an internal 
persuasion; but the latter does not involve an attachment they 
should have for one another; it involves the reverence one 
should feel for the law, or the concern one should have for 
oneself, one’s reputation, one’s honor. The relation of the 
individual to himself and to his city in the form of respect or 
shame, honor or glory—not the relation to the other person 
—is what imposes this obedience. 

And we may note that in Plato’s proposal for the law con¬ 
cerning “the choices of love,” he envisages two possible for-

mulations. According to one, every individual would be for¬ 
bidden to touch any woman of good birth who is not his lawful 
wife, to procreate outside of marriage, and to “go against 
nature and sow sterile seed in males.” The other formulation 
repeats the prohibition against male love relations, making it 
absolute this time; as for extramarital sexual relations, he 
contemplates punishment only in cases where the wrongdoing 
would not go unnoticed by “all men and women.”* Clearly, 
then, the double obligation to limit sexual activities relates to 
the stability of the city, to its public morality, to the conditions 
of good procreation, and not to the reciprocal obligations that 
attach to a dual relation between husbands and wives. 

2. In the text by Isocrates, which has the form of an 
address by Nicocles to his fellow citizens, an explicit connec¬ 
tion is established between the views on moderation and mar¬ 
riage it sets forth and the exercise of political power. This 
speech is a companion piece to the one Isocrates addressed to 
Nicocles shortly after the latter came to power: the orator gave 
the young man advice on personal conduct and government, 
advice that ought to serve him well for the rest of his life. 
Nicocles’ speech is supposed to be an address by the monarch 
in which he explains to his subjects how they ought to behave 
toward him. Now, the whole first part of the text is devoted 
to justifying his power: the merits of a monarchical regime, the 
rights of the ruling family, the personal qualities of the ruler; 
and it is only once these justifications have been given that the 
obedience and attachment the citizens owe their ruler will be 
defined. By reason of his special virtues, the monarch is enti¬ 
tled to demand his subjects’ submission. Nicocles will there¬ 
fore dwell at some length on the qualities he sees himself as 
having: first, the justice— dikaiosyne —he has manifested in 

♦Note that, at least in the first formulation of the law, Plato seems to say that only 
women who are "free” and of “good birth” are forbidden to a married man. At any 
rate this is how Dies translates the passage. Robin interprets the text as meaning that 
this law applies only to free men of good birth . 12

financial affairs, in matters of penal jurisdiction, and in the 
good relations he has established or reestablished with the 
foreign powers; 13 next, his sophrosyne, his moderation, which 
he speaks of as if it were nothing but the control of sexual 
pleasures. And he explains the forms and reasons of this mod¬ 
eration in direct connection with the sovereign authority he 
exercises in his country. 

The last consideration he invokes concerns his lineage and 
the necessity of a bastardless race that can claim the distinc¬ 
tion of a noble birth and the continuity of a genealogy that can 
be traced all the way back to the gods: “Nor was I of the same 
mind as most kings in regard to the begetting of children. I 
did not think I should have some children by a woman of 
humbler station and others by one of higher degree, nor that 
I should leave after me bastard progeny, as well as progeny of
