address by Nicocles to his fellow citizens, an explicit connec¬ 
tion is established between the views on moderation and mar¬ 
riage it sets forth and the exercise of political power. This 
speech is a companion piece to the one Isocrates addressed to 
Nicocles shortly after the latter came to power: the orator gave 
the young man advice on personal conduct and government, 
advice that ought to serve him well for the rest of his life. 
Nicocles’ speech is supposed to be an address by the monarch 
in which he explains to his subjects how they ought to behave 
toward him. Now, the whole first part of the text is devoted 
to justifying his power: the merits of a monarchical regime, the 
rights of the ruling family, the personal qualities of the ruler; 
and it is only once these justifications have been given that the 
obedience and attachment the citizens owe their ruler will be 
defined. By reason of his special virtues, the monarch is enti¬

this law applies only to free men of good birth . 12

good relations he has established or reestablished with the 
foreign powers; 13 next, his sophrosyne, his moderation, which 
he speaks of as if it were nothing but the control of sexual 
pleasures. And he explains the forms and reasons of this mod¬ 
eration in direct connection with the sovereign authority he 
exercises in his country. 

The last consideration he invokes concerns his lineage and 
the necessity of a bastardless race that can claim the distinc¬ 
tion of a noble birth and the continuity of a genealogy that can 
be traced all the way back to the gods: “Nor was I of the same 
mind as most kings in regard to the begetting of children. I 
did not think I should have some children by a woman of 
humbler station and others by one of higher degree, nor that 
I should leave after me bastard progeny, as well as progeny of
