legitimate birth; but that all my children should be able to 
trace their lineage back through the same father and the same 
mother to Evagoras, my father, among mortals, to the Aea- 
cides among the demigods, and to Zeus among the gods, and 
that not one of the children sprung from my loins should be 
cheated of this noble origin.” 14 

Another reason for Nicocles to be moderate has to do with 
the continuity and homogeneity between the government of a 
state and that of a household. This continuity is defined in two 
ways: by the principle that one should respect all associations 
(koinoniai) that one has formed with others; thus Nicocles 
does not want to be like those men who respect their other 
commitments but behave badly toward a wife, despite the 
lifelong association (koinonia pantos tou biouj they have 
formed with her: since one does not feel obliged to suffer any 
hurt from one’s wife, one must not make her suffer any be¬ 
cause of the pleasures that one enjoys; the king who wishes to 
be just must be so with his own wife. 15 But there is also the 
continuity and a kind of isomorphism between the good order 
that should reign in the monarch’s house and the order that 
should prevail in his government: “If kings are to rule well,

they must try to preserve harmony, not only in the states over 
which they hold dominion, but also in their own households 
and in their places of abode; for all these things are the works 
of temperance and justice.” 16 

The link between moderation and power that Nicocles re¬ 
fers to throughout the text is conceived primarily as an essen¬ 
tial relationship between dominion over others and dominion 
over oneself, following the general principle that was stated in 
the discourse addressed to Nicocles: “Govern yourself no less 
than your subjects, and consider that you are in the highest 
sense a king when you are a slave to no pleasure, but rule over 
your desires more firmly than over your people.” 17 As for this 
self-mastery as a moral precondition for leading others, Nico¬ 
cles starts out by proving that he has it: unlike so many 
tyrants, he has not used his power to possess himself of other 
men’s wives and children by force; he has been mindful of how 
attached men are to their spouses and their progeny and of 
how often political crises and revolutions originated in abuses
