legitimate birth; but that all my children should be able to 
trace their lineage back through the same father and the same 
mother to Evagoras, my father, among mortals, to the Aea- 
cides among the demigods, and to Zeus among the gods, and 
that not one of the children sprung from my loins should be 
cheated of this noble origin.” 14 

Another reason for Nicocles to be moderate has to do with 
the continuity and homogeneity between the government of a 
state and that of a household. This continuity is defined in two 
ways: by the principle that one should respect all associations 
(koinoniai) that one has formed with others; thus Nicocles 
does not want to be like those men who respect their other 
commitments but behave badly toward a wife, despite the 
lifelong association (koinonia pantos tou biouj they have 
formed with her: since one does not feel obliged to suffer any 
hurt from one’s wife, one must not make her suffer any be¬ 
cause of the pleasures that one enjoys; the king who wishes to 
be just must be so with his own wife. 15 But there is also the 
continuity and a kind of isomorphism between the good order 
that should reign in the monarch’s house and the order that 
should prevail in his government: “If kings are to rule well,

they must try to preserve harmony, not only in the states over 
which they hold dominion, but also in their own households 
and in their places of abode; for all these things are the works 
of temperance and justice.” 16 

The link between moderation and power that Nicocles re¬ 
fers to throughout the text is conceived primarily as an essen¬ 
tial relationship between dominion over others and dominion 
over oneself, following the general principle that was stated in 
the discourse addressed to Nicocles: “Govern yourself no less 
than your subjects, and consider that you are in the highest 
sense a king when you are a slave to no pleasure, but rule over 
your desires more firmly than over your people.” 17 As for this 
self-mastery as a moral precondition for leading others, Nico¬ 
cles starts out by proving that he has it: unlike so many 
tyrants, he has not used his power to possess himself of other 
men’s wives and children by force; he has been mindful of how 
attached men are to their spouses and their progeny and of 
how often political crises and revolutions originated in abuses 
of this nature; 18 * he has therefore taken the greatest care to 
avoid such reproaches: no one can charge him with having 
had physical relations “with any person other than his wife” 
from the time he took the supreme office. 20 Nicocles has more 
positive reasons for being moderate, however. First, he wants 
to be an example to his fellow citizens; doubtless this does not 
mean that he expects the inhabitants of his country to practice 
the same sexual faithf ulness as he; it is unlikely that he intends 
to make a general rule of it; the strictness of his morals should 
be understood as a general invitation to be virtuous and as a 
model standing against the laxity that is always harmful to the 
state. 21 This principle of a rough analogy between the morals 
of the prince and those of the people was alluded to in the 
address to Nicocles: “Let your own self-control [sophrosyne] 
stand as an example to the rest, realizing that the manners 
[ethos] of the whole state are copied from its rulers. Let it be

take their pleasure everywhere but still govern justly . 1 ' 1

a sign to you that you rule wisely if you see all your subjects 
growing more prosperous and more temperate [euporoterous 
kai sophronesterous gignomenous ] because of your oversight 
[epimeleia]." 22 But Nicocles would not be content merely to 
make the majority behave like him; at the same time, and 
without there being a contradiction, he wants to be distin¬ 
guished from others, from the elite and even from those who 
are the most virtuous. What we are dealing with, therefore, is 
the moral formula of example (to be a model for everyone by 
being better than the best) combined with the political formula 
of competition for personal power in an aristocracy and the 
principle of a stable basis for wise and moderate tyranny (to 
be, in the eyes of the people, better endowed with virtue than 
the most virtuous): “I saw that while the majority of people 
are masters of themselves in other matters, even the best are 
slaves to the passions whose objects are boys and women; and 
therefore I wanted to show that I could be strong in those 
things in which I should be superior, not merely to people 
in general, but even to those who pride themselves on their 
virtue.” 23 

But it is essential to understand that this virtue that func¬
