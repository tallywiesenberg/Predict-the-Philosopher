of this nature; 18 * he has therefore taken the greatest care to 
avoid such reproaches: no one can charge him with having 
had physical relations “with any person other than his wife” 
from the time he took the supreme office. 20 Nicocles has more 
positive reasons for being moderate, however. First, he wants 
to be an example to his fellow citizens; doubtless this does not 
mean that he expects the inhabitants of his country to practice 
the same sexual faithf ulness as he; it is unlikely that he intends 
to make a general rule of it; the strictness of his morals should 
be understood as a general invitation to be virtuous and as a 
model standing against the laxity that is always harmful to the 
state. 21 This principle of a rough analogy between the morals 
of the prince and those of the people was alluded to in the 
address to Nicocles: “Let your own self-control [sophrosyne] 
stand as an example to the rest, realizing that the manners 
[ethos] of the whole state are copied from its rulers. Let it be

take their pleasure everywhere but still govern justly . 1 ' 1

growing more prosperous and more temperate [euporoterous 
kai sophronesterous gignomenous ] because of your oversight 
[epimeleia]." 22 But Nicocles would not be content merely to 
make the majority behave like him; at the same time, and 
without there being a contradiction, he wants to be distin¬ 
guished from others, from the elite and even from those who 
are the most virtuous. What we are dealing with, therefore, is 
the moral formula of example (to be a model for everyone by 
being better than the best) combined with the political formula 
of competition for personal power in an aristocracy and the 
principle of a stable basis for wise and moderate tyranny (to 
be, in the eyes of the people, better endowed with virtue than 
the most virtuous): “I saw that while the majority of people 
are masters of themselves in other matters, even the best are 
slaves to the passions whose objects are boys and women; and 
therefore I wanted to show that I could be strong in those 
things in which I should be superior, not merely to people 
in general, but even to those who pride themselves on their 
virtue.” 23 

But it is essential to understand that this virtue that func¬
