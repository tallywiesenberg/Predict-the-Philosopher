tions as an example and a sign of superiority does not owe its 
political value simply to the fact that it is an honorable behav¬ 
ior in everyone’s eyes. In reality, as far as the subjects are 
concerned, it reveals the form of relationship that the prince 
maintains with himself. This is an important political point 
because it is this relationship with the self that modulates and 
regulates the use the prince makes of the power he exercises 
over others. It is therefore important in itself, for the visible 
excellence it displays, and because of the rational frame that 
braces it. This is why Nicocles points out that his sophrosyne 
has passed a test before everyone’s witness; there are clearly 
circumstances and ages in which it is not difficult to show that 
one can be just and forgo money and pleasure; but when one 
assumes power in the midst of one’s youth, to give proof of 
moderation then constitutes a kind of qualifying test. 24 More-

over, he makes it clear that his virtue is not just a matter of 
nature but a result of reasoning (logismos) as well: conse¬ 
quently, his good behavior will not be due to chance or cir¬ 
cumstance; it will be deliberate and constant. 

Thus, the prince’s moderation, tested in the most hazardous 
of situations, and ensured by the continuous exercise of rea¬ 
son, serves as the basis of a sort of compact between the ruler 
and the ruled: the latter can obey him, seeing that he is master 
of himself. One can demand the subjects’ obedience, since it 
is warranted by the prince’s virtue. The prince is indeed capa¬ 
ble of moderating the power he exercises over others by means 
of the mastery he establishes over himself. This is in fact how 
the passage ends where Nicocles, having finished talking about 
himself, draws on what he has said in order to exhort his 
subjects to obey him: “The reason I have spoken at some 
length about myself ... is that I might leave you no excuse 
for not doing willingly and zealously whatever I counsel and 
command.” 25 The prince’s relationship with himself and the 
manner in which he forms himself as an ethical subject are an 
important component of the political structure; his austerity 
is part of it, contributing to its solidity. The prince, too, must 
practice an ascesis and exercise himself: “Therefore, no athlete 
is so called upon to train his body as is a king to train his soul; 
for not all the public festivals in the world offer a price compa¬ 
rable to those for which you who are kings strive every day
