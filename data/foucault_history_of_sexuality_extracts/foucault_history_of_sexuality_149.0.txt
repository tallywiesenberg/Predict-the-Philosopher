tions as an example and a sign of superiority does not owe its 
political value simply to the fact that it is an honorable behav¬ 
ior in everyone’s eyes. In reality, as far as the subjects are 
concerned, it reveals the form of relationship that the prince 
maintains with himself. This is an important political point 
because it is this relationship with the self that modulates and 
regulates the use the prince makes of the power he exercises 
over others. It is therefore important in itself, for the visible 
excellence it displays, and because of the rational frame that 
braces it. This is why Nicocles points out that his sophrosyne 
has passed a test before everyone’s witness; there are clearly 
circumstances and ages in which it is not difficult to show that 
one can be just and forgo money and pleasure; but when one 
assumes power in the midst of one’s youth, to give proof of 
moderation then constitutes a kind of qualifying test. 24 More-

over, he makes it clear that his virtue is not just a matter of 
nature but a result of reasoning (logismos) as well: conse¬ 
quently, his good behavior will not be due to chance or cir¬ 
cumstance; it will be deliberate and constant. 

Thus, the prince’s moderation, tested in the most hazardous 
of situations, and ensured by the continuous exercise of rea¬ 
son, serves as the basis of a sort of compact between the ruler 
and the ruled: the latter can obey him, seeing that he is master 
of himself. One can demand the subjects’ obedience, since it 
is warranted by the prince’s virtue. The prince is indeed capa¬ 
ble of moderating the power he exercises over others by means 
of the mastery he establishes over himself. This is in fact how 
the passage ends where Nicocles, having finished talking about 
himself, draws on what he has said in order to exhort his 
subjects to obey him: “The reason I have spoken at some 
length about myself ... is that I might leave you no excuse 
for not doing willingly and zealously whatever I counsel and 
command.” 25 The prince’s relationship with himself and the 
manner in which he forms himself as an ethical subject are an 
important component of the political structure; his austerity 
is part of it, contributing to its solidity. The prince, too, must 
practice an ascesis and exercise himself: “Therefore, no athlete 
is so called upon to train his body as is a king to train his soul; 
for not all the public festivals in the world offer a price compa¬ 
rable to those for which you who are kings strive every day 
of your lives.” 26 * 

3. As for the Economics attributed to Aristotle, we are 
aware of the difficulties with respect to the date of its composi¬ 
tion. The text that forms Books I and II is rather generally 
recognized as being from the “right period”—either edited 
from notes by an immediate disciple of Aristotle or the work 
of one of the very first generations of Peripatetics. In any case, 
we can leave aside the third part for the moment, or at least 

*The theme of the prince’s private virtue as a political problem would merit a whole 
study of its own.

the Latin text, which has been regarded as a “version” or an 
“adaptation” of the “lost” third book of the Economics. Much 
shorter and infinitely less rich than the text by Xenophon, 
Book I is likewise presented as a reflection on the art (techne) 
of economics. It aims to explain how to “own” a household 
and how to “make use of” it (ktesasthai, chresasthai). 27 The 
text purports to be an art of governing, and not so much things 
as people. This is in keeping with a principle stated elsewhere 
by Aristotle; namely, that in economics one is more concerned 
with persons than with inanimate property. 28 And the treatise 
Economics actually does devote the bulk of its instructions 
(without giving much space to the techniques of cultivation, 
as Xenophon does) to the tasks of leadership, oversight, and 
control. It is a master’s manual, for a master who must “con¬ 
cern himself” (epimelein) first and foremost with his wife. 29 

This text promotes more or less the same values as the 
treatise by Xenophon: praise of agriculture, which is capable 
of forming “virile” individuals, unlike the handicrafts and 
trades; affirmation of its primordial and fundamental charac¬ 
ter as determined by nature, and of its integral value for the 
city. 30 But many of its elements also carry the Aristotelian 
stamp; in particular, the emphasis on both the natural basis 
of the marital relation and the specificity of its form in human 
society. 

The partnership (koinonia) of man and woman is presented 
by the author as being something that exists “by nature” and 
as being exemplified among the animals: “their common life
