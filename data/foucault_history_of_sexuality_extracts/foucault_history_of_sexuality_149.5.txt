3. As for the Economics attributed to Aristotle, we are 
aware of the difficulties with respect to the date of its composi¬ 
tion. The text that forms Books I and II is rather generally 
recognized as being from the “right period”—either edited 
from notes by an immediate disciple of Aristotle or the work 
of one of the very first generations of Peripatetics. In any case, 
we can leave aside the third part for the moment, or at least

study of its own.

the Latin text, which has been regarded as a “version” or an 
“adaptation” of the “lost” third book of the Economics. Much 
shorter and infinitely less rich than the text by Xenophon, 
Book I is likewise presented as a reflection on the art (techne) 
of economics. It aims to explain how to “own” a household 
and how to “make use of” it (ktesasthai, chresasthai). 27 The 
text purports to be an art of governing, and not so much things 
as people. This is in keeping with a principle stated elsewhere 
by Aristotle; namely, that in economics one is more concerned 
with persons than with inanimate property. 28 And the treatise 
Economics actually does devote the bulk of its instructions 
(without giving much space to the techniques of cultivation, 
as Xenophon does) to the tasks of leadership, oversight, and 
control. It is a master’s manual, for a master who must “con¬ 
cern himself” (epimelein) first and foremost with his wife. 29 

This text promotes more or less the same values as the 
treatise by Xenophon: praise of agriculture, which is capable 
of forming “virile” individuals, unlike the handicrafts and 
trades; affirmation of its primordial and fundamental charac¬ 
ter as determined by nature, and of its integral value for the 
city. 30 But many of its elements also carry the Aristotelian 
stamp; in particular, the emphasis on both the natural basis 
of the marital relation and the specificity of its form in human 
society. 

The partnership (koinonia) of man and woman is presented 
by the author as being something that exists “by nature” and 
as being exemplified among the animals: “their common life
