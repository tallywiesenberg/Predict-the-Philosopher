employed for trying to achieve it. The nineteenth century 
and our own have been rather the age of multiplication: a 
dispersion of sexualities, a strengthening of their disparate 
forms, a multiple implantation of “perversions.” Our epoch 
has initiated sexual heterogeneities. 

Up to the end of the eighteenth century, three major explic¬ 
it codes—apart from the customary regularities and con¬ 
straints of opinion—governed sexual practices: canonical 
law, the Christian pastoral, and civil law. They determined, 
each in its own way, the division between licit and illicit. 
They were all centered on matrimonial relations: the marital 
obligation, the ability to fulfill it, the manner in which one 
complied with it, the requirements and violences that accom¬ 
panied it, the useless or unwarranted caresses for which it 
was a pretext, its fecundity or the way one went about mak¬ 
ing it sterile, the moments when one demanded it (dangerous 
periods of pregnancy or breast-feeding, forbidden times of 
Lent or abstinence), its frequency or infrequency, and so on. 
It was this domain that was especially saturated with pre¬ 
scriptions. The sex of husband and wife was beset by rules 
and recommendations. The marriage relation was the most 
intense focus of constraints; it was spoken of more than 
anything else; more than any other relation, it was required 
to give a detailed accounting of itself. It was under constant 
surveillance: if it was found to be lacking, it had to come 
forward and plead its case before a witness. The “rest” re¬ 
mained a good deal more confused: one only has to think of 
the uncertain status of “sodomy,” or the indifference regard¬ 
ing the sexuality of children. 

Moreover, these different codes did not make a clear dis¬ 
tinction between violations of the rules of marriage and

deviations with respect to genitality. Breaking the rules of 
marriage or seeking strange pleasures brought an equal meas¬ 
ure of condemnation. On the list of grave sins, and separated 
only by their relative importance, there appeared debauchery 
(extramarital relations), adultery, rape, spiritual or carnal 
incest, but also sodomy, or the mutual “caress.” As to the 
courts, they could condemn homosexuality as well as infi¬ 
delity, marriage without parental consent, or bestiality. 
What was taken into account in the civil and religious juris¬ 
dictions alike was a general unlawfulness. Doubtless acts 
“contrary to nature” were stamped as especially abominable, 
but they were perceived simply as an extreme form of acts 
“against the law”; they were infringements of decrees which 
were just as sacred as those of marriage, and which had been 
established for governing the order of things and the plan of 
beings. Prohibitions bearing on sex were essentially of a 
juridical nature. The “nature” on which they were based was 
still a kind of law. For a long time hermaphrodites were 
criminals, or crime’s offspring, since their anatomical dispo¬ 
sition, their very being, confounded the law that distin¬ 
guished the sexes and prescribed their union. 

The discursive explosion of the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries caused this system centered on legitimate alliance 
to undergo two modifications. First, a centrifugal movement 
with respect to heterosexual monogamy. Of course, the array 
of practices and pleasures continued to be referred to it as 
their internal standard; but it was spoken of less and less, or 
in any case with a growing moderation. Efforts to find out 
its secrets were abandoned; nothing further was demanded 
of it than to define itself from day to day. The legitimate 
couple, with its regular sexuality, had a right to more discre¬ 
tion. It tended to function as a norm, one that was stricter, 
perhaps, but quieter. On the other hand, what came under 
scrutiny was the sexuality of children, mad men and women, 
and criminals; the sensuality of those who did not like the 
opposite sex; reveries, obsessions, petty manias, or great tran-

sports of rage. It was time for all these figures, scarcely 
noticed in the past, to step forward and speak, to make the 
difficult confession of what they were. No doubt they were 
condemned all the same; but they were listened to; and if 
regular sexuality happened to be questioned once again, it 
was through a reflux movement, originating in these periph¬ 
eral sexualities. 

Whence the setting apart of the “unnatural” as a specific 
dimension in the field of sexuality. This kind of activity 
assumed an autonomy with regard to the other condemned 
forms such as adultery or rape (and the latter were con¬
