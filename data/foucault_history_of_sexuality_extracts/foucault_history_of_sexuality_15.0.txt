It was a philosophical exercise.The 
object was to learn to what extent the effort to think one’s own 
history can free thought from what it silently thinks, and so 
enable it to think differently.Was I right to take these risks?That is for others to say.I 
only know that by shifting, as I did, the theme and chronologi¬ 
cal frame of reference of my study, I obtained a certain theo¬ 
retical benefit; I could go on to make two generalizations that 
enabled me both to widen its scope and to specify its method 
and its goal more precisely.
