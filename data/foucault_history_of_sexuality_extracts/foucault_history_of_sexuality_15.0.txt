employed for trying to achieve it. The nineteenth century 
and our own have been rather the age of multiplication: a 
dispersion of sexualities, a strengthening of their disparate 
forms, a multiple implantation of “perversions.” Our epoch 
has initiated sexual heterogeneities. 

Up to the end of the eighteenth century, three major explic¬ 
it codes—apart from the customary regularities and con¬ 
straints of opinion—governed sexual practices: canonical 
law, the Christian pastoral, and civil law. They determined, 
each in its own way, the division between licit and illicit. 
They were all centered on matrimonial relations: the marital 
obligation, the ability to fulfill it, the manner in which one 
complied with it, the requirements and violences that accom¬ 
panied it, the useless or unwarranted caresses for which it 
was a pretext, its fecundity or the way one went about mak¬ 
ing it sterile, the moments when one demanded it (dangerous 
periods of pregnancy or breast-feeding, forbidden times of 
Lent or abstinence), its frequency or infrequency, and so on. 
It was this domain that was especially saturated with pre¬ 
scriptions. The sex of husband and wife was beset by rules 
and recommendations. The marriage relation was the most 
intense focus of constraints; it was spoken of more than 
anything else; more than any other relation, it was required 
to give a detailed accounting of itself. It was under constant 
surveillance: if it was found to be lacking, it had to come 
forward and plead its case before a witness. The “rest” re¬ 
mained a good deal more confused: one only has to think of 
the uncertain status of “sodomy,” or the indifference regard¬ 
ing the sexuality of children. 

Moreover, these different codes did not make a clear dis¬ 
tinction between violations of the rules of marriage and

deviations with respect to genitality. Breaking the rules of 
marriage or seeking strange pleasures brought an equal meas¬ 
ure of condemnation. On the list of grave sins, and separated 
only by their relative importance, there appeared debauchery 
(extramarital relations), adultery, rape, spiritual or carnal 
incest, but also sodomy, or the mutual “caress.” As to the 
courts, they could condemn homosexuality as well as infi¬ 
delity, marriage without parental consent, or bestiality.
