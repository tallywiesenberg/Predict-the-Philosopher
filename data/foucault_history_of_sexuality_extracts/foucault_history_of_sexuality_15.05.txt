The Use of Pleasure 


ceeding back through Christianity to antiquity, one would not 
be able to avoid raising a question that was at the same time 
very simple and very general: why is sexual conduct, why are 
the activities and pleasures that attach to it, an object of moral 
solicitude?Why this ethical concern—which, at certain times, 
in certain societies and groups, appears more important than 
the moral attention that is focused on other, likewise essential, 
areas of individual or collective life, such as alimentary behav¬ 
iors or the fulfillment of civic duties?A reply comes to mind 
immediately, I know: they have been the object of fundamen¬ 
tal interdictions, and transgressing the latter is considered a 
serious offense.But this is to make an answer of the question 
itself; and further, it shows a failure to recognize that the 
ethical concern over sexual conduct is not, in its intensity or 
its forms, always directly tied to the system of interdictions.It is often the case that the moral solicitude is strong precisely 
where there is neither obligation nor prohibition.
