In other 
words, the interdiction is one thing, the moral problematiza- 
tion is another.It seemed to me, therefore, that the question 
that ought to guide my inquiry was the following: how, why, 
and in what forms was sexuality constituted as a moral do¬ 
main?Why this ethical concern that was so persistent despite 
its varying forms and intensity?Why this “problematization”?But, after all, this was the proper task of a history of thought, 
as against a history of behaviors or representations: to define 
the conditions in which human beings “problematize” what 
they are, what they do, and the world in which they live.
