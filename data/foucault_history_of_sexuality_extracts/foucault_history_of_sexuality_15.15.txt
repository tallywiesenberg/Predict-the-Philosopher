But in raising this very general question, and in directing it 
to Greek and Greco-Roman culture, it occurred to me that 
this problematization was linked to a group of practices that 
have been of unquestionable importance in our societies: I am 
referring to what might be called the “arts of existence.” What 
I mean by the phrase are those intentional and voluntary 
actions by which men not only set themselves rules of conduct, 
but also seek to transform themselves, to change themselves 
in their singular being, and to make their life into an oeuvre

that carries certain aesthetic values and meets certain stylistic 
criteria.These “arts of existence,” these “techniques of the 
self,” no doubt lost some of their importance and autonomy 
when they were assimilated into the exercise of priestly power 
in early Christianity, and later, into educative, medical, and 
psychological types of practices.Still, I thought that the long 
history of these aesthetics of existence and these technologies 
of the self remained to be done, or resumed.It has been a long 
time now since Burckhardt pointed out their significance for 
the epoch of the Renaissance, but their perpetuation, their 
history, and their development do not end there.* In any case, 
it seemed to me that the study of the problematization of 
sexual behavior in antiquity could be regarded as a chapter— 
one of the first chapters—of that general history of the “tech¬ 
niques of the self.” 

There is irony in those efforts one makes to alter one’s way 
of looking at things, to change the boundaries of what one 
knows and to venture out a ways from there.
