Did mine actu¬ 
ally result in a different way of thinking?Perhaps at most they 
made it possible to go back through what I was already think¬ 
ing, to think it differently, and to see what I had done from 
a new vantage point and in a clearer light.Sure of having 
traveled far, one finds that one is looking down on oneself 
from above.The journey rejuvenates things, and ages the 
relationship with oneself.I seem to have gained a better per¬ 
spective on the way I worked—gropingly, and by means of 
different or successive fragments—on this project, whose goal 
is a history of truth.
