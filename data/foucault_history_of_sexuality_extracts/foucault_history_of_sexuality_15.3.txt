There was the problematization of 
madness and illness arising out of social and medical practices, 
and defining a certain pattern of “normalization”; a prob¬ 
lematization of life, language, and labor in discursive practices 
that conformed to certain “epistemic” rules; and a problemati¬ 
zation of crime and criminal behavior emerging from certain 
punitive practices conforming to a “disciplinary” model.And 
now I would like to show how, in classical antiquity, sexual 
activity and sexual pleasures were problematized through 
practices of the self, bringing into play the criteria of an “aes¬ 
thetics of existence.” 

These, then, are the reasons that led me to recenter my 
entire study on the genealogy of desiring man, from classical 
antiquity through the first centuries of Christianity.I have 
followed a simple chronological arrangement: this volume, 
The Use of Pleasure, is devoted to the manner in which sexual 
activity was problematized by philosophers and doctors in 
classical Greek culture of the fourth century B.C.; Care of the 
Self deals with the same problematization in the Greek and 
Latin texts of the first two centuries of our era; lastly, The 
Confessions of the Flesh deals with the formation of the doc¬ 
trine and ministry concerning the flesh.The documents I will 
refer to are for the most part “prescriptive” texts—that is, 
texts whose main object, whatever their form (speech, dia¬ 
logue, treatise, collection of precepts, etc.)
