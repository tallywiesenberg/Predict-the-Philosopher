is to suggest rules 
of conduct.I will appeal to the theoretical texts on the doc¬

the purpose of offering rules, opinions, and advice on how to

point where an archaelogy of problematizations and a 
genealogy of practices of the self intersect, I would like to 
dwell briefly, before getting started, on those two notions— 
that is, to account for the forms of “problematization” that I 
chose to examine, to indicate what is to be understood by 
“practices of the self,” and to explain how I was led, through 
certain paradoxes and difficulties, to substitute a history of 
ethical problematizations based on practices of the self, for a 
history of systems of morality based, hypothetically, on inter¬ 
dictions.
