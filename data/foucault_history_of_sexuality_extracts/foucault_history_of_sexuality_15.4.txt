Forms of 
Problematization 


Suppose for a moment that we accept categories as general 
as those of “paganism,” “Christianity,” “morality,” and “sex¬ 
ual morality.” Suppose that we ask on which points the “sex¬ 
ual morality of Christianity” contrasted most sharply with the 
“sexual morality of ancient paganism.” Prohibition of incest, 
male domination, subjugation of women?These are not the 
replies that will be given, no doubt; the extent and constancy 
of those phenomena in their various forms are well known.Other points of differentiation will more likely be submitted.For example, the meaning of the sexual act itself: it will be said 
that Christianity associated it with evil, sin, the Fall, and 
death, whereas antiquity invested it with positive symbolic 
values.Or the definition of the legitimate partner: it would 
appear that, in contrast to what occurred in the Greek and 
Roman societies, Christianity drew the line at monogamous 
marriage and laid down the principle of exclusively procrea¬ 
tive ends within that conjugal relationship.
