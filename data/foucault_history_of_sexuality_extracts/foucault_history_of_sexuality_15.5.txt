The first great Christian text devoted to sexual practice in 
married life—Chapter X of Book II of The Pedagogue by 
Clement of Alexandria—is supported by a number of scrip¬ 
tural references, but it also draws on a set of principles and 
precepts borrowed directly from pagan philosophy.One al¬ 
ready notes a certain association of sexual activity with evil, 
along with the rule of procreative monogamy, a condemnation 
of relations between individuals of the same sex, and a glorifi¬ 
cation of self-restraint.Furthermore, given a longer historical 
frame to consider, one could trace the persistence of themes, 
anxieties, and exigencies that no doubt marked the Christian 
ethic and the morality of modern European societies; but not 
only, since they were already present at the core of Greek and 
Greco-Roman thought.Below is some evidence to consider, 
comprising: (1) the expression of a fear, (2) a model of con¬ 
duct, (3) the image of a stigmatized attitude, and (4) an exam¬ 
ple of abstinence.1.
