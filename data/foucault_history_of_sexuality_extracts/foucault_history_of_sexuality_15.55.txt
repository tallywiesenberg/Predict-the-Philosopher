A fear.Young people afflicted with seminal weakness 
“of necessity become old in the habit of their body, dull, 
languid, dispirited, sluggish, stupidly silent, weak, wrinkled, 
incapable of any exertion, sallow, wan, effeminate; they lose 
their appetite, feel cold, a sense of weight in their limbs, and 
torpor in their legs, their strength fails, and they become 
paralyzed in every effort, and with many the disease goes on 
to palsy.For how could it be otherwise, that the power of the 
nerves should suffer when the generative principle is chilled?”

The Use of Pleasure 


This disease, which is “shameful in itself,” is “dangerous in 
that it leads to stagnation; harmful to society in that it goes 
against the propagation of the species; and because it is in all 
respects the source of countless ills, it requires prompt treat¬ 
ment.” 1 * One has no trouble recognizing in this text the obses¬ 
sive worries that medicine and pedagogy nurtured on the 
subject of pure sexual expenditure—that unproductive and 
partnerless activity—from the eighteenth century onward.The gradual exhaustion of the organism, the death of the 
individual, the destruction of his offspring, and finally, harm 
to the entire human race, were regularly promised, through an 
endlessly garrulous literature, to those who would make illicit 
use of their sex.These solicited fears seem to have been the 
“naturalistic” and scientific legacy, in medical thought of the 
nineteenth century, of a Christian tradition that consigned 
pleasure to the realm of death and evil.
