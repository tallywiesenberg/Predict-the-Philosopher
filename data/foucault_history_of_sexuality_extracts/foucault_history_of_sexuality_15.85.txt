6 And in his ideal city, 
Aristotle would have sexual relations of a husband with an¬ 
other woman, or the wife with another man, considered “dis¬ 
honorable ... in any circumstances whatsoever.” 7 The sexual 
“fidelity” of a husband with respect to his legitimate wife was 
not required either by law or by custom; it was nevertheless 
a question that people raised and a form of austerity on which 
some moralists set a high value.3.An image.In nineteenth-century texts there is a 
stereotypical portrait of the homosexual or invert: not only his 
mannerisms, his bearing, the way he gets dolled up, his co¬ 
quetry, but also his facial expressions, his anatomy, the femi¬ 
nine morphology of his whole body, are regularly included in 
this disparaging description.The image alludes both to the 
theme of role reversal and to the principle of a natural stigma 
attached to this offense against nature.
