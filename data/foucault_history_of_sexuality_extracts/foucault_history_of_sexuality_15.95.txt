9 One could 
see it again in the portrait of decadent youth, such as Seneca 
the Elder notices around him, with great repugnance: “Libidi¬ 
nous delight in song and dance transfixes these effeminates.Braiding the hair, refining the voice till it is as caressing as a 
woman’s, competing in bodily softness with women, beautify¬ 
ing themselves with filthy fineries—this is the pattern our 
youths set themselves.... Born feeble and spineless, they stay 
like that throughout their lives; taking others’ chastity by 
storm, careless of their own.” 10 But in its essential traits, the 
portrait is more ancient still.Socrates’ first speech in the Phae- 
drus alludes to it, when he voices disapproval of the love that 
is given to soft boys, too delicate to be exposed to the sun as 
they are growing up, and all made up with rouge and decked 
out in ornaments."And it is with these same traits that Aga- 
thon appears in The Thesmophoriazusae: pale complexion, 
smooth-shaven cheeks, woman’s voice, so much so that his 
interlocutor wonders if he is in the presence of a man or a 
woman.12 It would be completely incorrect to interpret this as 
a condemnation of love of boys, or of what we generally refer 
to as homosexual relations; but at the same time, one cannot 
fail to see in it the effect of strongly negative judgments con¬ 
cerning some possible aspects of relations between men, as 
well as a definite aversion to anything that might denote a 
deliberate renunciation of the signs and privileges of the mas¬ 
culine role.
