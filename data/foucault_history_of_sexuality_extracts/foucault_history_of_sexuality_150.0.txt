has necessarily arisen.” 31 This is a constant argument in Aris¬ 
totle—whether in the Politics, where this necessity is linked 
directly to procreation, or in the Nicomachean Ethics, which 
presents man as being a naturally “syndastic” creature des¬ 
tined to live in pairs. 32 But the author of the Economics re¬ 
marks that this koinonia has peculiar features not found in the 
other animal species: other animals practice forms of associa¬ 
tion that go well beyond mere procreative coupling, so it is not 
that; 33 it is that in humans, the finality of the tie that unites

The Use of Pleasure 


man and woman concerns not just “being” but “well-being” 
(einai, eu einai )—an important distinction in Aristotle. In 
humans, in any case, the existence of the couple allows for 
mutual help and support throughout existence; as for their 
offspring, they do not merely ensure the survival of the species; 
they are a means of “securing advantage” for the parents, for 
“the care which parents bestow on their helpless children 
when they are themselves vigorous is repaid to them in old age 
when they are helpless by their children, who are then in full 
vigor.” 34 And it was with this life enhancement in mind that 
nature arranged man and woman in the way that she did; it 
was with a view to their common life that “she organized both 
sexes.” The first is strong, the second is held back by fear; one 
finds his health in movement, the other is inclined to live a 
sedentary life; one brings provisions back to the house, the 
other watches over what is there; one nurtures the children, 
the other educates them. In a manner of speaking, nature has 
programmed the household economy and the parts that both 
spouses must take within it. Here, starting from Aristotelian 
principles, the author links up with the general outline of a 
traditional description, which had already been illustrated by 
Xenophon. 

It is immediately after this analysis of natural complemen¬ 
tarities that the author of the Economics addresses the ques¬ 
tion of sexual behavior. And this comes in a brief, elliptical 
passage that is worth quoting in its entirety: “First, then, he 
must do her no wrong, for thus a man is less likely himself to 
be wronged. This is indicated by the general law, as the Py¬ 
thagoreans say, that one least of all should injure a wife as 
being ‘a suppliant and taken from her hearth.’ Now wrong 
inflicted by a husband is the formation of connections outside 
his own house [thyraze synousiai ].” 35 It is hardly surprising 
that nothing is said about the wife’s conduct, since in her case 
the rules are well known and since we are dealing here with 
a manual for masters: it is their way of acting that is in 
question. We may also note that there is nothing said—here

or in Xenophon—about what the husband’s sexual behavior 
should be with respect to his wife, nothing about fulfilling the 
marital obligation, or about the rules of modesty. But the main 
concern is elsewhere. 

We may note first of all that the text situates the question 
of sexual relations squarely within the general framework of 
relations of justice between husband and wife. Now, what do 
these relations involve? What forms must they have? In spite 
of the text’s declaration a little earlier regarding the need to 
determine what kind of “association” (homilia) should unite 
man and woman, nothing is said in the Economics concerning 
its general form or its principle. In other texts, however, and 
particularly in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Politics, Aris¬ 
totle does reply to this question when he analyzes the political 
nature of the marriage tie; that is, the type of authority that 
is exercised within marriage. In his view, the relationship 
between man and wife is plainly nonegalitarian, since it is the 
man’s role to govern the wife (the reverse situation, which can 
be due to several causes, is “contrary to nature”). 36 However, 
this inequality must be carefully distinguished from three 
other inequalities: that which separates the master from the 
slave (the wife is a free being), that which separates a father 
from his children (and which makes for a kingly type of 
authority), and lastly, that which in a city separates the citi¬ 
zens who rule from those who are ruled. While the husband’s 
authority is in fact weaker, less total than in the first two 
relations, it does not have the provisional character one finds 
in the “political” relation in the strict sense of the term; that 
is, in relations between citizens in a state. This is because 
under a free constitution the citizens take turns ruling and 
being ruled, whereas in the household the man must always 
maintain superiority. 37 An inequality of free beings, therefore, 
but one that is permanent and based on a natural difference. 
It is in this sense that the political form of the association of 
husband and wife will be aristocracy: a government in which
