his own house [thyraze synousiai ].” 35 It is hardly surprising 
that nothing is said about the wife’s conduct, since in her case 
the rules are well known and since we are dealing here with 
a manual for masters: it is their way of acting that is in 
question. We may also note that there is nothing said—here

or in Xenophon—about what the husband’s sexual behavior 
should be with respect to his wife, nothing about fulfilling the 
marital obligation, or about the rules of modesty. But the main 
concern is elsewhere. 

We may note first of all that the text situates the question 
of sexual relations squarely within the general framework of 
relations of justice between husband and wife. Now, what do 
these relations involve? What forms must they have? In spite 
of the text’s declaration a little earlier regarding the need to 
determine what kind of “association” (homilia) should unite 
man and woman, nothing is said in the Economics concerning 
its general form or its principle. In other texts, however, and 
particularly in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Politics, Aris¬ 
totle does reply to this question when he analyzes the political 
nature of the marriage tie; that is, the type of authority that 
is exercised within marriage. In his view, the relationship 
between man and wife is plainly nonegalitarian, since it is the 
man’s role to govern the wife (the reverse situation, which can 
be due to several causes, is “contrary to nature”). 36 However, 
this inequality must be carefully distinguished from three 
other inequalities: that which separates the master from the 
slave (the wife is a free being), that which separates a father 
from his children (and which makes for a kingly type of 
authority), and lastly, that which in a city separates the citi¬ 
zens who rule from those who are ruled. While the husband’s 
authority is in fact weaker, less total than in the first two 
relations, it does not have the provisional character one finds 
in the “political” relation in the strict sense of the term; that 
is, in relations between citizens in a state. This is because 
under a free constitution the citizens take turns ruling and 
being ruled, whereas in the household the man must always 
maintain superiority. 37 An inequality of free beings, therefore, 
but one that is permanent and based on a natural difference. 
It is in this sense that the political form of the association of 
husband and wife will be aristocracy: a government in which
