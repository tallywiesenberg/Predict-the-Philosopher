share of authority, his role, and his functions according to his 
merit and his worth. As the Nicomachean Ethics expresses it: 
“The association of man and wife seems to be aristocratic; for 
the man rules in accordance with his fitness [kat’axian], and 
in those matters in which man should rule”; which implies, as 
in every aristocratic government, that he will delegate to his 
wife the part she is suited to play (if he tried to do everything 
by himself, the husband would transform his authority into an 
“oligarchy”). 38 The relationship with the wife is thus posited 
as a question of justice which is linked directly to the “politi¬ 
cal” nature of the marriage bond. Between father and son, says 
the Magna Moralia, the relationship cannot be one of justice, 
at least so long as the son has still not gained his independence, 
for he is only “a part of his father”; nor can it be a question 
of justice between master and servants unless by this is meant 
a justice “of the economic or household kind.” The same does 
not hold with the wife: doubtless the latter is and will always 
be inferior to the man, and the justice that should govern 
relations between spouses cannot be the same as the justice 
that obtains between citizens; and yet, because of their resem¬ 
blance, man and wife should be in a relationship that “ap¬ 
proaches near to political justice.” 39 Now, in the Economics 
passage where it is a question of the sexual behavior that the 
husband ought to exhibit, the author seems to be referring to 
a very different kind of justice; recalling a Pythagorean obser¬ 
vation, he declares that the wife is like “a suppliant and taken 
from her hearth.” However, a closer look at this passage 
indicates that this reference to the suppliant—and more gener¬ 
ally, to the fact that the wife was born in another household 
and that in her husband’s house she is not “at home”—is not 
meant to define the type of relations that should ordinarily 
obtain between a man and his wife. These relations, in their 
positive form and their conformity with the nonegalitarian 
justice that should govern them, had been spoken of indirectly 
in the preceding passage. We may suppose that by evoking the 
figure of the suppliant the author is saying that the marriage

itself does not authorize the wife to demand sexual faithf ulness 
of her husband, but that there is something in the married 
woman’s situation that calls for restraint and limitation on the 
part of the husband. The thing to note is precisely her position 
of weakness, which makes her subject to the benevolence of 
her husband, like a suppliant who has been taken from her 
household of birth. 

As for the nature of these unjust acts, it is not at all easy 
to specify in terms of the Economics. The text speaks of 
thyraze synousiai (“outside connections”). The word synousiai 
can signify a particular sexual union; it can also mean a “com¬ 
merce”, an “intimate relationship.” If we had to give the word 
its narrowest meaning here, it would denote any sexual act 
committed “outside the house,” which would constitute an 
injustice with regard to the wife. Such a standard appears 
rather improbable in a text that holds rather closely to the 
current thinking about ethics. If, on the other hand, we give 
the word synousia the more general meaning of “relation¬ 
ship,” we can easily see why there would be injustice in the 
exercise of an authority that is supposed to mete out to each 
according to his value, his merit, and his status: an extramari¬ 
tal liaison, a concubinage, and perhaps illegitimate children 
would be serious instances of derogation from the respect that 
is owing to the wife. In any case, as far as the husband’s sexual 
relations are concerned, anything that threatens the privileged 
position of the wife in the aristocratic government of the 
household also compromises the necessary and essential jus¬ 
tice of that government. Understood in this way, the formula¬ 
tion found in the Economics is not far removed in its concrete 
significance from what Xenophon implied by having Ischoma- 
chus promise his wife never to violate her privileges and status 
so long as she behaved well.* It should be noted, moreover, 
that the themes evoked in the lines that immediately follow are 

*It should be remarked, however, that Ischomachus was evoking situations of rivalry 
that could be produced by relations with the maidservants of the household, whereas 
here it is exterior liaisons that appear threatening.
