itself does not authorize the wife to demand sexual faithf ulness 
of her husband, but that there is something in the married 
woman’s situation that calls for restraint and limitation on the 
part of the husband. The thing to note is precisely her position 
of weakness, which makes her subject to the benevolence of 
her husband, like a suppliant who has been taken from her 
household of birth. 

As for the nature of these unjust acts, it is not at all easy 
to specify in terms of the Economics. The text speaks of 
thyraze synousiai (“outside connections”). The word synousiai 
can signify a particular sexual union; it can also mean a “com¬ 
merce”, an “intimate relationship.” If we had to give the word 
its narrowest meaning here, it would denote any sexual act 
committed “outside the house,” which would constitute an 
injustice with regard to the wife. Such a standard appears 
rather improbable in a text that holds rather closely to the 
current thinking about ethics. If, on the other hand, we give 
the word synousia the more general meaning of “relation¬ 
ship,” we can easily see why there would be injustice in the 
exercise of an authority that is supposed to mete out to each 
according to his value, his merit, and his status: an extramari¬ 
tal liaison, a concubinage, and perhaps illegitimate children 
would be serious instances of derogation from the respect that 
is owing to the wife. In any case, as far as the husband’s sexual 
relations are concerned, anything that threatens the privileged 
position of the wife in the aristocratic government of the 
household also compromises the necessary and essential jus¬ 
tice of that government. Understood in this way, the formula¬ 
tion found in the Economics is not far removed in its concrete 
significance from what Xenophon implied by having Ischoma- 
chus promise his wife never to violate her privileges and status 
so long as she behaved well.* It should be noted, moreover, 
that the themes evoked in the lines that immediately follow are 

*It should be remarked, however, that Ischomachus was evoking situations of rivalry 
that could be produced by relations with the maidservants of the household, whereas 
here it is exterior liaisons that appear threatening.
