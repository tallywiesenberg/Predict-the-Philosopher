quite close to those of Xenophon: the husband’s responsibility 
in the moral training of his spouse and the criticism of adorn¬ 
ment (kosmesis) as mendacity and trickery that must not be 
allowed to come between spouses. But whereas Xenophon 
makes the husband’s moderation an appropriate style for a 
vigilant and wise master of a household, the Aristotelian text 
seems to place it within the multifarious interaction of the 
different forms of justice that should govern relations of hu¬ 
mans in society. 

It is no doubt difficult to identify exactly which sexual 
practices the author of the Economics would allow or forbid 
the husband who wished to conduct himself properly. Even 
so, it does seem that the husband’s moderation—whatever its 
precise form—does not derive from the personal bond be¬ 
tween the spouses and that it is not imposed on him in the 
same way that strict faithfulness can be required of the wife. 
It is in the context of an unequal distribution of powers and 
functions that the husband has to privilege his wife; and it is 
through a voluntary attitude—based on interest and wisdom 
—that he will be able, as one who knows how to manage an 
aristocratic authority, to judge what is owing to each individ¬ 
ual. The husband’s moderation in this case is still an ethics of 
power that one exercises, but this ethics is conceived as one 
of the forms of justice. This is a nonegalitarian and formal way 
of defining the association between husband and wife and the 
place that their respective virtues ought to have in that associ¬ 
ation. Let us not forget that this way of thinking about marital 
relations did not in the least exclude the kind of intensity that 
was acknowledged in relations of friendship. The Nicoma- 
chean Ethics brings together all these elements—justice, ine¬ 
quality, virtue, the aristocratic form of government; and it is 
through them that Aristotle defines the special nature of the 
husband’s friendship for his wife; this philia between spouses 
“is the same as that which is found in an aristocracy; for it is 
in accordance with excellence—the better gets more of what 
is good, and each gets what befits him; and so, too, with the

justice in these relations.” 40 And further on, Aristotle adds: 
“How man and wife and in general friend and friend ought 
mutually to behave seems to be the same question as how it 
is just for them to behave.” 41 * 

One thus finds, in Greek thought of the classical period, 
elements of a marriage ethics that seems to demand on the 
part of both spouses a similar renunciation of all extramarital 
sexual activity. Now, the rule prescribing an exclusively con¬ 
jugal sexual practice, which in theory was imposed on the wife 
by her status and by the laws of the city and the family alike 
—it seems that some people may have believed that this rule 
was applicable to men as well; at any rate, this is the lesson 
that seems to emerge from Xenophon’s Oeconomicus and 
from the Aristotelian Economics, or from certain texts by 
Plato and Isocrates. These few texts appear quite isolated in 
the midst of a society in which neither the laws nor the cus¬ 
toms contained any such requirements. True. But it does not 
appear possible to see in this the first outlines of an ethics of 
reciprocal conjugal fidelity, or the beginnings of a codification 
of married life to which Christianity was to give a universal 
form, an imperative value, and the support of a whole institu¬ 
tional system. 

There are several reasons for this. Except in the Platonic 
city, where the same laws apply to everyone in the same way, 
the moderation that is demanded of the husband does not have 
the same ethical basis or the same forms as that which is 
imposed on the wife; in the latter case, these derive directly 

•It should be noted that in the ideal city described by Aristotle in the Politics, 
relations between husband and wife are defined in a way that is rather similar to what 
one finds in Plato. The obligation to procreate will be lifted when the parents risk 
being too old: “from that time forward we must regard them as indulging in inter¬ 
course for reasons of health, or for some similar cause.” As for adulterous relations 
of the husband with another woman or the wife with another man, they will rightly 
be regarded as a disgraceful action (trie kalon) “in whatever shape or form, during 
all the period of their being married and being called husband and wife.” For reasons 
easy to understand, this offense will have legal consequences— atimia —if it is com¬ 
mitted “during the period of bringing children into the world .” 42
