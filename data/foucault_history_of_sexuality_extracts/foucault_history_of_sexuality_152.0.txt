quite close to those of Xenophon: the husband’s responsibility 
in the moral training of his spouse and the criticism of adorn¬ 
ment (kosmesis) as mendacity and trickery that must not be 
allowed to come between spouses. But whereas Xenophon 
makes the husband’s moderation an appropriate style for a 
vigilant and wise master of a household, the Aristotelian text 
seems to place it within the multifarious interaction of the 
different forms of justice that should govern relations of hu¬ 
mans in society. 

It is no doubt difficult to identify exactly which sexual 
practices the author of the Economics would allow or forbid 
the husband who wished to conduct himself properly. Even 
so, it does seem that the husband’s moderation—whatever its 
precise form—does not derive from the personal bond be¬ 
tween the spouses and that it is not imposed on him in the 
same way that strict faithfulness can be required of the wife. 
It is in the context of an unequal distribution of powers and 
functions that the husband has to privilege his wife; and it is 
through a voluntary attitude—based on interest and wisdom 
—that he will be able, as one who knows how to manage an 
aristocratic authority, to judge what is owing to each individ¬ 
ual. The husband’s moderation in this case is still an ethics of 
power that one exercises, but this ethics is conceived as one 
of the forms of justice. This is a nonegalitarian and formal way 
of defining the association between husband and wife and the 
place that their respective virtues ought to have in that associ¬ 
ation. Let us not forget that this way of thinking about marital 
relations did not in the least exclude the kind of intensity that 
was acknowledged in relations of friendship. The Nicoma- 
chean Ethics brings together all these elements—justice, ine¬ 
quality, virtue, the aristocratic form of government; and it is 
through them that Aristotle defines the special nature of the 
husband’s friendship for his wife; this philia between spouses 
“is the same as that which is found in an aristocracy; for it is 
in accordance with excellence—the better gets more of what 
is good, and each gets what befits him; and so, too, with the
