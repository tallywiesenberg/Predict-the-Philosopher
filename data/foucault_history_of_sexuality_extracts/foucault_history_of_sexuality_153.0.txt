his life a certain form. A matter of style, as it were: the man 
is called upon to temper his conduct in terms of the mastery 
he intends to bring to bear on himself, and in terms of the 
moderation with which he aims to exercise his mastery over 
others. Whence the fact that this austerity is presented—in 
Isocrates, for instance—as a refinement whose exemplary 
value does not take the form of a universal principle; whence, 
too, the fact that the renunciation of every relation outside the 
conjugal relation is not explicitly prescribed by Xenophon or 
perhaps even by the Aristotelian author, and it does not take 
the form of a permanent commitment in Isocrates but that of 
an achievement instead. 

Furthermore, whether the prescription is symmetrical (as in 
Plato) or not, the moderation that is demanded of the husband 
is not based on the special nature and peculiar form of the 
conjugal relationship. No doubt it is because he is married that 
his sexual activity must undergo some restrictions and accept 
a certain delimitation. But it is the status of a married man, 
not the relation to the wife, that requires this: married—in 
Plato’s city—according to the forms that the state will decide, 
and in order to provide it with the citizens it needs; married 
and thus having to manage a household that should prosper 
in an orderly fashion and be maintained in a condition that 
will be, in everyone’s eyes, the image and proof of a good 
government (Xenophon and Isocrates); married and obligated 
to apply the rules of justice in the forms of inequality appropri¬ 
ate to marriage and to the wife’s nature (Aristotle). There is 
nothing in all this that would rule out personal feelings of 
attachment, affection, and concern. But it should be clearly 
understood that it is never vis-a-vis the wife that this sophro- 
syne is necessary, in the association that joins them together 
as individuals. The husband is self-obligated in this respect, 
since the fact of being married commits him to a particular

interplay of duties and demands in which his reputation, his 
relation to others, his prestige in the city, and his willingness 
to lead a fine and good existence are at stake. 

One understands, therefore, how the man’s moderation and 
the wife’s virtue could be presented as two simultaneous re¬ 
quirements, each deriving, in its own way and its own forms, 
from the state of marriage; and yet it is as if the question of 
sexual practice as an element—a crucial element—of the con¬ 
jugal relationship were hardly raised. Later, sexual relations 
between spouses, the form they should take, the acts that were 
permitted, the rules of decency they should observe—but also 
the intensity of the bonds they manifested and drew closer— 
were to be an important subject of reflection. The entire sexual 
life between husbands and wives was to give rise, in the Chris¬ 
tian pastoral ministry, to a codification that was often quite 
detailed; but already before this, Plutarch had broached ques¬ 
tions concerning not only the form of sexual relations between 
spouses but their affective significance as well; he had under¬ 
scored the importance of reciprocal pleasures for the mutual 
attachment of husband and wife. This new ethics would be 
characterized, not simply by the fact that man and wife would 
be restricted to one sexual partner, the spouse, but also by the 
fact that their sexual activity would be problematized as an 
essential, decisive, and especially delicate component of their 
personal conjugal relation. Nothing of the sort is visible in the 
moral reflection of the fourth century B.C. This is not to sug¬ 
gest that sexual pleasures had little importance in the married 
life of the Greeks of that period, or that they did not contrib¬ 
ute to a couple’s mutual understanding: that is another ques¬ 
tion in any case. But in order to understand the working out 
of sexual conduct as a moral problem, it is necessary to em¬ 
phasize that, in classical Greek thought, the sexual behavior 
of the two spouses was not questioned from the standpoint of 
their personal relationship. What occurred between them as¬ 
sumed importance from the moment it became a question of 
having children. Apart from that, their mutual sex life was not

an object of reflection and prescription: the point of prob- 
lematization was in the moderation that each of the two part¬ 
ners needed to show for reasons and in forms corresponding 
to their sex and their status. Moderation was not a matter 
shared between them and requiring concern on the part of the 
one for the other. In this we are f ar from the Christian teach¬ 
ing where each spouse would have to ensure the other’s chas¬ 
tity, being careful not to cause him or her to commit the sin 
of the flesh—either through indecent entreaties or through 
harsh refusals. For the Greek moralists of the classical epoch, 
moderation was prescribed to both partners in matrimony;
