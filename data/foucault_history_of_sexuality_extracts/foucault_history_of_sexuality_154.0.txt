but it depended on two distinct modes of relation to self, 
corresponding to the two individuals. The wife’s virtue 
constituted the correlative and the proof of a submissive 
behavior; the man’s austerity was part of an ethics of self¬ 
delimiting domination.

Erotics

A Problematic 
Relation 


The use of pleasures in the relationship with boys was a 
theme of anxiety for Greek thought—which is paradoxical in 
a society that is believed to have “tolerated” what we call 
“homosexuality.” But perhaps it would be just as well if we 
avoided those two terms here. 

As matter of fact, the notion of homosexuality is plainly 
inadequate as a means of referring to an experience, forms of 
valuation, and a system of categorization so different from 
ours. The Greeks did not see love for one’s own sex and love 
for the other sex as opposites, as two exclusive choices, two 
radically different types of behavior. The dividing lines did not 
follow that kind of boundary. What distinguished a moderate, 
self-possessed man from one given to pleasures was, from the 
viewpoint of ethics, much more important than what differen¬ 
tiated, among themselves, the categories of pleasures that in¬ 
vited the greatest devotion. To have loose morals was to be 
incapable of resisting either women or boys, without it being 
any more serious than that. When he portrays the tyrannical 
man—that is, one “in whose soul dwells the tyrant Eros who 
directs everything” 1 —Plato shows him from two equivalent 
angles, so that what we see in both instances is contempt for 
the most fundamental obligations and subjection to the rule of 
pleasure: “Do you think he would sacrifice his long beloved 
and irreplaceable mother for a recently acquired mistress 
whom he can do without, or, for the sake of a young boy

The Use of Pleasure 


recently become dear to him, sacrifice his aged and irreplace¬ 
able father, his oldest friend, beat him, and make his parents 
slaves of those others if he brought them under the same 
roof?” 2 When Alcibiades was censured for his debauchery, it 
was not for the former kind in contradistinction to the latter, 
it was, as Bion the Borysthenite put it, “that in his adolescence 
he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as a young 
man the wives from their husbands.” 3 

Conversely, if one wanted to show that a man was self- 
controlled, it was said of him—as Plato said concerning Iccus 
of Tarentum 4 —that he was able to abstain from relations with 
boys and women alike; and, according to Xenophon, the ad¬ 
vantage that Cyrus saw in relying on eunuchs for court service 
was that they were incapable of offending the honor of either 
women or boys. 5 So it seemed to people that of these two 
inclinations one was not more likely than the other, and the 
two could easily coexist in the same individual. 

Were the Greeks bisexual, then? Yes, if we mean by this that 
a Greek could, simultaneously or in turn, be enamored of a 
boy or a girl; that a married man could have paidika; that it 
was common for a male to change to a preference for women 
after “boy-loving” inclinations in his youth. But if we wish to 
turn our attention to the way in which they conceived of this 
dual practice, we need to take note of the fact that they did 
not recognize two kinds of “desire,” two different or compet¬ 
ing “drives,” each claiming a share of men’s hearts or appe¬ 
tites. We can talk about their “bisexuality,” thinking of the 
free choice they allowed themselves between the two sexes, but 
for them this option was not referred to a dual, ambivalent, 
and “bisexual” structure of desire. To their way of thinking, 
what made it possible to desire a man or a woman was simply 
the appetite that nature had implanted in man’s heart for 
“beautiful” human beings, whatever their sex might be. 6 

True, one finds in Pausanias’ speech a theory of two loves, 7 
the second of which—Urania, the heavenly love—is directed 
exclusively to boys. But the distinction that is made is not
