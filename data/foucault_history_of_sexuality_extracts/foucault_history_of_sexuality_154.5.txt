The Use of Pleasure 


recently become dear to him, sacrifice his aged and irreplace¬ 
able father, his oldest friend, beat him, and make his parents 
slaves of those others if he brought them under the same 
roof?” 2 When Alcibiades was censured for his debauchery, it 
was not for the former kind in contradistinction to the latter, 
it was, as Bion the Borysthenite put it, “that in his adolescence 
he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as a young 
man the wives from their husbands.” 3 

Conversely, if one wanted to show that a man was self- 
controlled, it was said of him—as Plato said concerning Iccus 
of Tarentum 4 —that he was able to abstain from relations with 
boys and women alike; and, according to Xenophon, the ad¬ 
vantage that Cyrus saw in relying on eunuchs for court service 
was that they were incapable of offending the honor of either 
women or boys. 5 So it seemed to people that of these two 
inclinations one was not more likely than the other, and the 
two could easily coexist in the same individual. 

Were the Greeks bisexual, then? Yes, if we mean by this that 
a Greek could, simultaneously or in turn, be enamored of a 
boy or a girl; that a married man could have paidika; that it 
was common for a male to change to a preference for women 
after “boy-loving” inclinations in his youth. But if we wish to 
turn our attention to the way in which they conceived of this 
dual practice, we need to take note of the fact that they did 
not recognize two kinds of “desire,” two different or compet¬ 
ing “drives,” each claiming a share of men’s hearts or appe¬ 
tites. We can talk about their “bisexuality,” thinking of the 
free choice they allowed themselves between the two sexes, but 
for them this option was not referred to a dual, ambivalent, 
and “bisexual” structure of desire. To their way of thinking, 
what made it possible to desire a man or a woman was simply 
the appetite that nature had implanted in man’s heart for 
“beautiful” human beings, whatever their sex might be. 6 

True, one finds in Pausanias’ speech a theory of two loves, 7 
the second of which—Urania, the heavenly love—is directed 
exclusively to boys. But the distinction that is made is not
