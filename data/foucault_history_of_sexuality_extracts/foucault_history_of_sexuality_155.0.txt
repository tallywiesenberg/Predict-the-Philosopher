between a heterosexual love and a homosexual love; Pausanias 
draws the dividing line between “the love which the baser sort 
of men feel”—its object is both women and boys, it only looks 
to the act itself (to diaprattesthai )—and the more ancient, 
nobler, and more reasonable love that is drawn to what has 
the most vigor and intelligence, which obviously can only 
mean the male sex. Xenophon’s Symposium shows very well 
that the choice between girls and boys in no way relates to the 
distinction between two tendencies or to the opposition be¬ 
tween two forms of desire. The dinner is given by Callias in 
honor of the very young Autolycus whom he is enamored of; 
the boy’s beauty is so striking that he draws looks from all the 
guests as “the sudden glow of a light at night draws all eyes 
to itself”; “there was not one . . . who did not feel his soul 
strangely stirred by the boy.” 8 Now, among the participants, 
several were engaged or married, like Niceratus—who felt a 
love for his wife that she reciprocated, in the play of Eros and 
Anteros—or Critobulus, who was nonetheless still of an age 
to have suitors and male lovers; 9 further, Critobulus tells of his 
love for Cleinias, a boy he has met at school and, in a comic 
joust with Socrates, he matches his own beauty against that 
of the latter; the contest prize is to be a kiss from a boy and 
one from a girl: the boy and girl belong to a Syracusan who 
has taught them a dance whose graceful charm and acrobatic 
movements are the delight of everyone present. He has also 
taught them to mime the loves of Dionysus and Ariadne; and 
the guests, who have just heard Socrates say what true love for 
boys should be, all feel extremely “excited” (aneptoromenoi) 
on seeing this “Dionysus truly handsome” and this “Ariadne 
truly fair” exchanging real kisses; one can tell from the lovers’ 
vows pronounced by the young acrobats that they “are now 
permitted to satisfy their long cherished desires.” 10 So many 
different incitements to love put everyone in the mood for 
pleasure: at the end of the Symposium, some ride off on their 
horses to reunite with their wives, while Callias and Socrates 
leave to rejoin the handsome Autolycus. At this banquet

The Use of Pleasure 


where they felt a common enchantment with the beauty of a 
girl or the charm of boys, men of various ages kindled the 
appetite for pleasure or serious love—love that some would 
look for in women, others in young men. 

To be sure, the preference for boys or girls was easily recog¬ 
nized as a character trait: men could be distinguished by the 
pleasure they were most fond of; 11 a matter of taste that could 
lend itself to humorous treatment, not a matter of topology 
involving the individual’s very nature, the truth of his desire, or 
the natural legitimacy of his predilection. People did not have 
the notion of two distinct appetites allotted to different in¬ 
dividuals or at odds with each other in the same soul; rather, 
they saw two ways of enjoying one’s pleasure, one of which was 
more suited to certain individuals or certain periods of exis¬ 
tence. The enjoyment of boys and of women did not constitute 
two classificatory categories between which individuals could 
be distributed; a man who preferred paidika did not think of 
himself as being “different” from those who pursued women. 

As for the notions of “tolerance” or “intolerance,” they too 
would be completely inadequate to account for the complexity 
of the phenomena we are considering. To love boys was a 
“free” practice in the sense that it was not only permitted by 
the laws (except in particular circumstances), it was accepted 
by opinion. Moreover, it found solid support in different (mili¬ 
tary or educational) institutions. It had religious guarantees in 
rites and festivals where the protection of the divine powers 
was invoked on its behalf. 12 And finally, it was a cultural 
practice that enjoyed the prestige of a whole literature that 
sang of it and a body of reflection that vouched for its excel¬ 
lence. Mixed in with all this, however, there were some quite 
different attitudes: a contempt for young men who were too 
“easy,” or too self-interested; a disqualification of effeminate 
men, who were so often mocked by Aristophanes and the 
comic authors;* a disallowance of certain shameful behaviors,
