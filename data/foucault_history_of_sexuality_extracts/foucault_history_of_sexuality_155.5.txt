The Use of Pleasure 


where they felt a common enchantment with the beauty of a 
girl or the charm of boys, men of various ages kindled the 
appetite for pleasure or serious love—love that some would 
look for in women, others in young men. 

To be sure, the preference for boys or girls was easily recog¬ 
nized as a character trait: men could be distinguished by the 
pleasure they were most fond of; 11 a matter of taste that could 
lend itself to humorous treatment, not a matter of topology 
involving the individual’s very nature, the truth of his desire, or 
the natural legitimacy of his predilection. People did not have 
the notion of two distinct appetites allotted to different in¬ 
dividuals or at odds with each other in the same soul; rather, 
they saw two ways of enjoying one’s pleasure, one of which was 
more suited to certain individuals or certain periods of exis¬ 
tence. The enjoyment of boys and of women did not constitute 
two classificatory categories between which individuals could 
be distributed; a man who preferred paidika did not think of 
himself as being “different” from those who pursued women. 

As for the notions of “tolerance” or “intolerance,” they too 
would be completely inadequate to account for the complexity 
of the phenomena we are considering. To love boys was a 
“free” practice in the sense that it was not only permitted by 
the laws (except in particular circumstances), it was accepted 
by opinion. Moreover, it found solid support in different (mili¬ 
tary or educational) institutions. It had religious guarantees in 
rites and festivals where the protection of the divine powers 
was invoked on its behalf. 12 And finally, it was a cultural 
practice that enjoyed the prestige of a whole literature that 
sang of it and a body of reflection that vouched for its excel¬ 
lence. Mixed in with all this, however, there were some quite 
different attitudes: a contempt for young men who were too 
“easy,” or too self-interested; a disqualification of effeminate 
men, who were so often mocked by Aristophanes and the 
comic authors;* a disallowance of certain shameful behaviors,
