such as that of the catamites, which Callicles could not bear 
to talk about despite his boldness and plainness of speech, and 
which he saw as the proof that not every pleasure could be 
good and honorable.* Indeed, it seems that this practice— 
though it was common and accepted—was surrounded by a 
diversity of judgments, that it was subjected to an interplay of 
positive and negative appraisals so complex as to make the 
ethics that governed it difficult to decipher. And there was a 
clear awareness of this complexity at the time; at least, that 
is what emerges from the passage in Pausanias’ speech where 
he shows how hard it is to know if people in Athens are in 
favor of or hostile to that form of love. On one hand, it was 
accepted so well—better still: it was valued so highly—that 
certain kinds of behavior on the part of male lovers were 
honored which were judged to be folly or dishonesty on the 
part of anyone else: the prayers, the entreaties, the stubborn 
wooings, all their false vows. But on the other hand, one noted 
the care fathers took to protect their sons from love affairs, 
how they demanded that tutors prevent them from occurring, 
and one heard boys’ comrades teasing each other for accepting 
such relationships.' 4 

Simple linear schemas do not enable us to understand the 
singular kind of attention that people of the fourth century 
gave to the love of boys. We need to take up the question 
afresh, using terms other than those of “tolerance” toward 
“homosexuality.” And instead of trying to determine the ex¬ 
tent to which the latter was free in ancient Greece (as if we 
were dealing with an unvarying experience uniformly sub¬ 
tending mechanisms of repression that change in the course of 
time), it would be more worthwhile to ask how and in what 
form the pleasure enjoyed between men was problematic. 
How did people think of it in relation to themselves? What

discussion to such things, Socrates?’’ ,,

The Use of Pleasure 


specific questions did it raise and what debate was it brought 
into? In short, given that it was a widespread practice, and the 
laws in no way condemned it, and its attraction was com¬ 
monly recognized, why was it the object of a special—and 
especially intense—moral preoccupation? So much so that it 
was invested with values, imperatives, demands, rules, advice, 
and exhortations that were as numerous as they were em¬ 
phatic and singular. 

To put things in a very schematic way: we tend nowadays 
to think that practices aimed at pleasure, when they are car¬ 
ried out between two partners of the same sex, are governed 
by a desire whose structure is particular; but we agree—if we 
are “tolerant”—that this is not a reason to refer them to a 
moral standard, to say nothing of a legislation, different from 
the one that is shared by all. We focus our questioning on the 
singularity of a desire that is not directed toward the other sex; 
and at the same time, we affirm that this type of relation 
should not be assigned a lesser value, nor given a special 
status. Now, it seems that the Greeks thought very differently 
about these things: they believed that the same desire attached 
to anything that was desirable—boy or girl—subject to the 
condition that the appetite was nobler that inclined toward 
what was more beautiful and more honorable; but they also 
thought that this desire called for a particular mode of behav¬ 
ior when it made a place for itself in a relationship between 
two male individuals. The Greeks could not imagine that a 
man might need a different nature—an “other” nature—in 
order to love a man; but they were inclined to think that the 
pleasures one enjoyed in such a relationship ought to be given 
an ethical form different from the one that was required when 
it came to loving a woman. In this sort of relation, the pleas¬ 
ures did not reveal an alien nature in the person who ex¬ 
perienced them; but their use demanded a special stylistics. 

And it is a fact that male loves were the object, in Greek 
culture, of a whole agitated production of ideas, observations, 
and discussions concerning the forms they should take or the

value one might attribute to them. It would be less than ade¬ 
quate if we saw in this discursive activity only the immediate 
and spontaneous representation of a free practice that chanced 
to express itself naturally in this fashion, as if all that was 
needed for a behavior to become a domain of inquiry or a focus 
of theoretical and moral concerns was that it not be prohib¬
