such as that of the catamites, which Callicles could not bear 
to talk about despite his boldness and plainness of speech, and 
which he saw as the proof that not every pleasure could be 
good and honorable.* Indeed, it seems that this practice— 
though it was common and accepted—was surrounded by a 
diversity of judgments, that it was subjected to an interplay of 
positive and negative appraisals so complex as to make the 
ethics that governed it difficult to decipher. And there was a 
clear awareness of this complexity at the time; at least, that 
is what emerges from the passage in Pausanias’ speech where 
he shows how hard it is to know if people in Athens are in 
favor of or hostile to that form of love. On one hand, it was 
accepted so well—better still: it was valued so highly—that 
certain kinds of behavior on the part of male lovers were 
honored which were judged to be folly or dishonesty on the 
part of anyone else: the prayers, the entreaties, the stubborn 
wooings, all their false vows. But on the other hand, one noted 
the care fathers took to protect their sons from love affairs, 
how they demanded that tutors prevent them from occurring, 
and one heard boys’ comrades teasing each other for accepting 
such relationships.' 4 

Simple linear schemas do not enable us to understand the 
singular kind of attention that people of the fourth century 
gave to the love of boys. We need to take up the question 
afresh, using terms other than those of “tolerance” toward 
“homosexuality.” And instead of trying to determine the ex¬ 
tent to which the latter was free in ancient Greece (as if we 
were dealing with an unvarying experience uniformly sub¬ 
tending mechanisms of repression that change in the course of 
time), it would be more worthwhile to ask how and in what 
form the pleasure enjoyed between men was problematic. 
How did people think of it in relation to themselves? What

shameful and wretched? Or will you dare to say that these people are happy if they

discussion to such things, Socrates?’’ ,,
