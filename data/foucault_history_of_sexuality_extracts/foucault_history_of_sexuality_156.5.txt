monly recognized, why was it the object of a special—and 
especially intense—moral preoccupation? So much so that it 
was invested with values, imperatives, demands, rules, advice, 
and exhortations that were as numerous as they were em¬ 
phatic and singular. 

To put things in a very schematic way: we tend nowadays 
to think that practices aimed at pleasure, when they are car¬ 
ried out between two partners of the same sex, are governed 
by a desire whose structure is particular; but we agree—if we 
are “tolerant”—that this is not a reason to refer them to a 
moral standard, to say nothing of a legislation, different from 
the one that is shared by all. We focus our questioning on the 
singularity of a desire that is not directed toward the other sex; 
and at the same time, we affirm that this type of relation 
should not be assigned a lesser value, nor given a special 
status. Now, it seems that the Greeks thought very differently 
about these things: they believed that the same desire attached 
to anything that was desirable—boy or girl—subject to the 
condition that the appetite was nobler that inclined toward 
what was more beautiful and more honorable; but they also 
thought that this desire called for a particular mode of behav¬ 
ior when it made a place for itself in a relationship between 
two male individuals. The Greeks could not imagine that a 
man might need a different nature—an “other” nature—in 
order to love a man; but they were inclined to think that the 
pleasures one enjoyed in such a relationship ought to be given 
an ethical form different from the one that was required when 
it came to loving a woman. In this sort of relation, the pleas¬ 
ures did not reveal an alien nature in the person who ex¬ 
perienced them; but their use demanded a special stylistics. 

And it is a fact that male loves were the object, in Greek 
culture, of a whole agitated production of ideas, observations, 
and discussions concerning the forms they should take or the

value one might attribute to them. It would be less than ade¬ 
quate if we saw in this discursive activity only the immediate 
and spontaneous representation of a free practice that chanced 
to express itself naturally in this fashion, as if all that was 
needed for a behavior to become a domain of inquiry or a focus 
of theoretical and moral concerns was that it not be prohib¬
