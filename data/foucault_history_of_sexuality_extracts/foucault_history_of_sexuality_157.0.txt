ited. But we would be just as remiss if we assumed that these 
texts were only an attempt to clothe the love one could direct 
to boys in an honorable justification: such an undertaking 
would presuppose condemnations or disqualifications, which 
in fact were declared much later. Rather, we must try and 
learn how and why this practice gave rise to an extraordinarily 
complex problematization. 

Very little remains of what Greek philosophers wrote on the 
subject of love and on the subject of that love in particular. 
The idea that one can justifiably form concerning these reflec¬ 
tions and their general thematics is bound to be rather uncer¬ 
tain considering that such a limited number of texts have been 
preserved; moreover, nearly all these belong to the Socratic- 
Platonic tradition, while we do not have, for example, the 
works that Diogenes Laertius mentions, by Antisthenes, Di¬ 
ogenes the Cynic, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Zeno, Chrysippus, 
and Crantor. Nevertheless, the speeches that are more or less 
ironically reported by Plato can give us some notion of what 
was at issue in these reflections and debates on love. 

1. The first thing to note is that the philosophical and 
moral reflections concerning love did not cover the whole field 
of sexual relations. Attention was focused for the most part on 
a “privileged” relationship—a problem area, an object of spe¬ 
cial concern: this was a relationship that implied an age differ¬ 
ence and, connected with it, a certain difference of status. The 
relationship that concerned people, that they discussed and 
reflected upon, was not the one that joined together two ma¬ 
ture adult males or two schoolboys of the same age; it was the 
relationship that developed between two men (and nothing

prevented them from both being young and rather near in age 
to one another) who were considered as belonging to two 
distinct age groups and one of whom was still quite young, had 
not finished his education, and had not attained his definitive 
status.* It is the existence of this disparity that marked the 
relationship that philosophers and moralists concerned them¬ 
selves with. This special attention should not lead us to draw 
hasty conclusions either about the sexual behaviors of the 
Greeks or about the details of their tastes (even though there 
is evidence from many areas of their culture that very young 
men were both represented and recognized as highly desirable 
erotic objects). We must not imagine in any case that only this 
type of relation was practiced; one finds many references to 
male love relationships that did not conform to this schema 
and did not include this “age differential.” We would be just 
as mistaken to suppose that, though practiced, these other 
forms of relations were frowned upon and regarded as un¬ 
seemly. Relations between young boys were deemed com¬ 
pletely natural and in keeping with their condition.f On the 
other hand, people could mention as a special case—without 
censure—an abiding love relationship between two men who 
were well past adolescence.^ Doubtless for reasons having to 
do, as we shall see, with the polar opposition of activity and 
passivity, an opposition regarded as necessary, relations be¬ 
tween two grown men were more apt to be an object of criti¬ 
cism and irony. Passivity was always disliked, and for an adult 
to be suspected of it was especially serious. But whether these 

•Although the texts often refer to this difference of age and status, it should be noted 
that the real age that is given for the partners tends to “float.” 1 ' Further, we see 
characters who play the role of lover in relation to some, and that of beloved in 
relation to others: e.g., Critobulus in Xenophon’s Symposium, where he tells of his 
love for Cleinias, whom he has met at school and who is a very young man like 
himself ." 1 

tin the Charmides, Plato describes the arrival of a youth whom everyone fastened 
their eyes upon, adults and boys, “down to the very smallest.””

latter was already a man in his prime. F. Buffiere notes in this connection an anecdote 
told by Aelian."

relations met with easy acceptance or tended to be suspect, the 
important thing for the moment is to see that they were not 
an object of moral solicitude or of a very great theoretical 
interest. Without being ignored or nonexistent, they did not 
belong to the domain of active and intense problematization. 
The attention and concern was concentrated on relations in 
which one can tell that much was at stake: relations that could 
be established between an older male who had finished his 
education—and who was expected to play the socially, mor¬ 
ally, and sexually active role—and a younger one, who had
