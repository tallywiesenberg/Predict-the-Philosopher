ited. But we would be just as remiss if we assumed that these 
texts were only an attempt to clothe the love one could direct 
to boys in an honorable justification: such an undertaking 
would presuppose condemnations or disqualifications, which 
in fact were declared much later. Rather, we must try and 
learn how and why this practice gave rise to an extraordinarily 
complex problematization. 

Very little remains of what Greek philosophers wrote on the 
subject of love and on the subject of that love in particular. 
The idea that one can justifiably form concerning these reflec¬ 
tions and their general thematics is bound to be rather uncer¬ 
tain considering that such a limited number of texts have been 
preserved; moreover, nearly all these belong to the Socratic- 
Platonic tradition, while we do not have, for example, the 
works that Diogenes Laertius mentions, by Antisthenes, Di¬ 
ogenes the Cynic, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Zeno, Chrysippus, 
and Crantor. Nevertheless, the speeches that are more or less 
ironically reported by Plato can give us some notion of what 
was at issue in these reflections and debates on love. 

1. The first thing to note is that the philosophical and 
moral reflections concerning love did not cover the whole field 
of sexual relations. Attention was focused for the most part on 
a “privileged” relationship—a problem area, an object of spe¬ 
cial concern: this was a relationship that implied an age differ¬ 
ence and, connected with it, a certain difference of status. The 
relationship that concerned people, that they discussed and 
reflected upon, was not the one that joined together two ma¬ 
ture adult males or two schoolboys of the same age; it was the 
relationship that developed between two men (and nothing

prevented them from both being young and rather near in age 
to one another) who were considered as belonging to two 
distinct age groups and one of whom was still quite young, had 
not finished his education, and had not attained his definitive 
status.* It is the existence of this disparity that marked the 
relationship that philosophers and moralists concerned them¬ 
selves with. This special attention should not lead us to draw 
hasty conclusions either about the sexual behaviors of the 
Greeks or about the details of their tastes (even though there 
is evidence from many areas of their culture that very young
