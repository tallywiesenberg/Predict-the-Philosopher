men were both represented and recognized as highly desirable 
erotic objects). We must not imagine in any case that only this 
type of relation was practiced; one finds many references to 
male love relationships that did not conform to this schema 
and did not include this “age differential.” We would be just 
as mistaken to suppose that, though practiced, these other 
forms of relations were frowned upon and regarded as un¬ 
seemly. Relations between young boys were deemed com¬ 
pletely natural and in keeping with their condition.f On the 
other hand, people could mention as a special case—without 
censure—an abiding love relationship between two men who 
were well past adolescence.^ Doubtless for reasons having to 
do, as we shall see, with the polar opposition of activity and 
passivity, an opposition regarded as necessary, relations be¬ 
tween two grown men were more apt to be an object of criti¬ 
cism and irony. Passivity was always disliked, and for an adult 
to be suspected of it was especially serious. But whether these

that the real age that is given for the partners tends to “float.” 1 ' Further, we see 
characters who play the role of lover in relation to some, and that of beloved in 
relation to others: e.g., Critobulus in Xenophon’s Symposium, where he tells of his 
love for Cleinias, whom he has met at school and who is a very young man like 
himself ." 1 

tin the Charmides, Plato describes the arrival of a youth whom everyone fastened 
their eyes upon, adults and boys, “down to the very smallest.””

relations met with easy acceptance or tended to be suspect, the 
important thing for the moment is to see that they were not 
an object of moral solicitude or of a very great theoretical 
interest. Without being ignored or nonexistent, they did not 
belong to the domain of active and intense problematization. 
The attention and concern was concentrated on relations in 
which one can tell that much was at stake: relations that could 
be established between an older male who had finished his 
education—and who was expected to play the socially, mor¬ 
ally, and sexually active role—and a younger one, who had
