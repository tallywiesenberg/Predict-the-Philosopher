not yet achieved his definitive status and who was in need of 
assistance, advice, and support. This disparity was at the heart 
of the relationship; in fact, it was what made it valuable and 
conceivable. Because of it, the relationship was considered in 
a positive light, made a subject of reflection; and where it was 
not apparent, people sought to discover it. Thus, one liked to 
talk about the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus, trying 
to determine what differentiated them from one another and 
which of the two had precedence over the other (since 
Homer’s text was ambiguous on this point).* A male relation¬ 
ship gave rise to a theoretical and moral interest when it was 
based on a rather pronounced difference on either side of the 
threshold separating adolescence from manhood. 

2. It does not appear that the privilege accorded to this 
particular type of relation can be attributed solely to the peda¬ 
gogical concerns of moralists and philosophers. We are in the 
habit of seeing a close connection between the Greek love of 
boys and Greek educational practice and philosophical in¬ 
struction. The story of Socrates invites this, as does the way 
in which the love of boys was constantly portrayed in antiq¬ 
uity. In reality, a very large context contributed to the valori¬ 
zation and elaboration of the relationship between men and 
adolescents. The philosophical reflection that took it as a

theme actually had its roots in practices that were widespread, 
accepted, and relatively complex. Unlike other sexual rela¬ 
tions, it seems—or in any case, more than they—the relations 
that united man and boy across a certain age and status 
threshold separating them were the object of a sort of rituali- 
zation, which by imposing certain rules on them gave them 
form, value, and interest. Even before they were taken up by 
philosophical reflection, these relations were already the pre¬ 
text for a whole social game. 

“Courtship” practices had formed around them. Doubtless 
these practices did not have the complexity found in other arts 
of loving such as those that would be developed in the Middle 
Ages. But by the same token, they were something quite differ¬
