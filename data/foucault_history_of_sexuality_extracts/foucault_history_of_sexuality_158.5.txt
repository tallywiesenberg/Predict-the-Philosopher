ent from the formalities that one observed in order to qualify 
for the hand of a young lady. They defined a whole set of 
conventional and appropriate behaviors, making this relation a 
culturally and morally overloaded domain. These practices— 
the reality of which has been amply documented by K. J. 
Dover 20 —defined the mutual behavior and the respective 
strategies that both partners should observe in order to give 
their relations a “beautiful” form; that is, one that was aestheti¬ 
cally and morally valuable. They determined the role of the 
erastes and that of the eromenos. The first was in a position of 
initiative—he was the suitor—and this gave him rights and 
obligations; he was expected to show his ardor, and to restrain 
it; he had gifts to make, services to render; he had functions to 
exercise with regard to the eromenos; and all this entitled him 
to expect a just reward. The other partner, the one who was 
loved and courted, had to be careful not to yield too easily; he 
also had to keep from accepting too many tokens of love, and 
from granting his favors heedlessly and out of self-interest, 
without testing the worth of his partner; he must also show 
gratitude for what the lover had done for him. Now, this 
courtship practice alone shows very well that the sexual rela¬ 
tion between man and boy did not “go without saying”: it had 
to be accompanied by conventions, rules of conduct, ways of

going about it, by a whole game of delays and obstacles de¬ 
signed to put off the moment of closure, and to integrate it into 
a series of subsidiary activities and relations. In other words, 
while this type of relation was fully accepted, it was not a 
matter of “indifference.” One would be missing the essential 
thing if one regarded all these precautions that were taken and 
the interest that was shown merely as the proof that this love 
was freely engaged in; it would be to ignore the distinction that 
was made between this sexual behavior and all the others whose 
recommended modalities were of little concern. All these 
preoccupations make it clear that pleasure relations between 
men and adolescent boys already constituted a delicate factor 
in society, an area so sensitive that one could not fail to be 
concerned about the conduct of the participants on both sides. 

3. But we may note at once a considerable difference in 
comparison with that other focus of interest and inquiry, mat¬ 
rimonial life: in the case of relations between men and boys,
