we are dealing with a game that was “open,” at least up to a 
certain point. 

Open “spatially.” In economics and the art of the house¬ 
hold, we saw a binary spatial structure where the spaces of the 
two marriage partners were carefully distinguished (the exte¬ 
rior for the husband, the interior for the wife; the men’s quar¬ 
ters on one side, the women’s on the other). With boys, the 
game unfolded in a very different space: a common space, at 
least from the time when they had reached a certain age—the 
space of the street and the gathering places, with some 
strategically important points (such as the gymnasium); but a 
space in which everyone moved about freely,* so that one had 
to pursue a boy, chase after him, watch for him in those places 
where he might pass and catch hold of him where he happened 
to be; it was a theme of ironic complaint on the part of lovers, 
that they were obliged to haunt the gymnasium, go hunting 

•In the schools, this freedom was supervised and limited. 2 '

with the eromenos, and pant alongside him in exercises, which 
they were no longer in any condition to do. 

But, more important, the game was also open in that one 
could not exercise any statutory authority over the boy, as 
long as he was not slaveborn—he was free in his choices, in 
what he accepted or rejected, in his preferences or his deci¬ 
sions. In order to get from him something that he always had 
the right to refuse, one had to be able to persuade him; anyone 
who wished to remain his favorite had, in his eyes, to outshine 
such rivals as might present themselves, and for this it was 
necessary to highlight one’s achievements, one’s qualities, or 
one’s presents; but the decision was the boy’s alone to make: 
in this game that one had initiated, one was never sure of 
winning. And yet this was the very thing that made it interest¬ 
ing. Nothing illustrates this better than the charming com¬ 
plaint of Hiero the tyrant, as reported by Xenophon. 22 Being 
a tyrant, he explains, does not make things pleasant either in 
regard to a wife or in regard to a boy. Fora tyrant cannot help 
but take a wife from an inferior family, thus losing all the 
advantages of marrying into a family “of greater wealth and 
influence.” As for the boy—and Hiero is enamored of Da'ilo-
