chus—the fact of having despotic power at one’s disposal 
raises other obstacles; the favors that Hiero would like so 
much to obtain, he would like the boy to give them out of 
friendship and of his own accord; but “to take them from him 
by force,” he would sooner desire “to do himself an injury.” 
To take something from one’s enemy against his will is the 
greatest of pleasures; but when it comes to the favors of boys, 
the sweetest are those that are freely granted. For example, 
what a pleasure it is to “exchange looks, how pleasant his 
questions and answers; how very pleasant and ravishing 
are the struggles and bickerings. But to take advantage of a 
favorite against his will seems to me more like brigan¬ 
dage than love.” 

In the case of marriage, the problematization of sexual 
pleasures and of the practices associated with them was car-

ried out on the basis of the statutory relation that empowered 
the husband to govern the wife, other individuals, the estate, 
and the household; the essential question concerned the mod¬ 
eration that needed to be shown in exercising power. In the 
case of the relationship with boys, the ethics of pleasures 
would have to bring into play—across age differences—subtle 
strategies that would make allowance for the other’s freedom, 
his ability to refuse, and his required consent. 

4. In this problematization of relationships with adoles¬ 
cent boys, the question of timing was important, but it was 
raised in a singular fashion; what mattered was not, as in 
dietetics, the opportune moment for the act, nor, as in eco¬ 
nomics, the continual maintenance of a relational structure; 
rather, it was the difficult question of precarious time and 
fugitive passage. It was expressed in different ways—as a prob¬ 
lem of “limit” first of all: what was the age limit after which 
a boy ought to be considered too old to be an honorable 
partner in a love relation? At what age was it no longer good 
for him to accept this role, nor for his lover to want to assign 
it to him? This involved the familiar casuistry of the signs of 
manhood. These were supposed to mark a threshold, one that 
was all the more intangible in theory as it must have very often 
been crossed in practice and as it offered the possibility of 
finding fault with those who had done so. As we know, the first
