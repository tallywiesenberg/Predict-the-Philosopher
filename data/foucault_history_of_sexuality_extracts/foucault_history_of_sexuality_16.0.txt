demned less and less): to marry a close relative or practice 
sodomy, to seduce a nun or engage in sadism, to deceive 
one’s wife or violate cadavers, became things that were essen¬ 
tially different. The area covered by the Sixth Command¬ 
ment began to fragment. Similarly, in the civil order, the 
confused category of “debauchery,” which for more than a 
century had been one of the most frequent reasons for ad¬ 
ministrative confinement, came apart. From the debris, there 
appeared on the one hand infractions against the legislation 
(or morality) pertaining to marriage and the family, and on 
the other, offenses against the regularity of a natural function 
(offenses which, it must be added, the law was apt to punish). 
Here we have a likely reason, among others, for the prestige 
of Don Juan, which three centuries have not erased. Under¬ 
neath the great violator of the rules of marriage—stealer of 
wives, seducer of virgins, the shame of families, and an insult 
to husbands and fathers—another personage can be 
glimpsed: the individual driven, in spite of himself, by the 
somber madness of sex. Underneath the libertine, the per¬ 
vert. He deliberately breaks the law, but at the same time, 
something like a nature gone awry transports him far from 
all nature; his death is the moment when the supernatural 
return of the crime and its retribution thwarts the flight into 
counternature. There were two great systems conceived by 
the West for governing sex: the law of marriage and the order

The History of Sexuality 


of desires—and the life of Don Juan overturned them both. 
We shall leave it to psychoanalysts to speculate whether he 
was homosexual, narcissistic, or impotent. 

Although not without delay and equivocation, the natural 
laws of matrimony and the immanent rules of sexuality 
began to be recorded on two separate registers. There 
emerged a world of perversion which partook of that of legal 
or moral infraction, yet was not simply a variety of the latter. 
An entire sub-race race was bom, different—despite certain 
kinship ties—from the libertines of the past. From the end 
of the eighteenth century to our own, they circulated through 
the pores of society; they were always hounded, but not 
always by laws; were often locked up, but not always in 
prisons; were sick perhaps, but scandalous, dangerous vic¬ 
tims, prey to a strange evil that also bore the name of vice 
and sometimes crime. They were children wise beyond their 
years, precocious little girls, ambiguous schoolboys, dubious 
servants and educators, cruel or maniacal husbands, solitary 
collectors, ramblers with bizarre impulses; they haunted the 
houses of correction, the penal colonies, the tribunals, and 
the asylums; they carried their infamy to the doctors and 
their sickness to the judges. This was the numberless family 
of perverts who were on friendly terms with delinquents and 
akin to madmen. In the course of the century they succes¬ 
sively bore the stamp of “moral folly,” “genital neurosis,” 
“aberration of the genetic instinct,” “degenerescence,” or 
“physical imbalance.” 

What does the appearance of all these peripheral sexuali¬ 
ties signify? Is the fact that they could appear in broad day¬ 
light a sign that the code had become more lax? Or does the 
fact that they were given so much attention testify to a 
stricter regime and to its concern to bring them under close 
supervision? In terms of repression, things are unclear. There 
was permissiveness, if one bears in mind that the severity of 
the codes relating to sexual offenses diminished considerably 
in the nineteenth century and that law itself often deferred 



The Repressive Hypothesis

to medicine. But an additional ruse of severity, if one thinks 
of all the agencies of control and all the mechanisms of 
surveillance that were put into operation by pedagogy or 
therapeutics. It may be the case that the intervention of the 
Church in conjugal sexuality and its rejection of “frauds” 
against procreation had lost much of their insistence over the 
previous two hundred years. But medicine made a forceful 
entry into the pleasures of the couple: it created an entire 
organic, functional, or mental pathology arising out of “in¬ 
complete” sexual practices; it carefully classified all forms of 
related pleasures; it incorporated them into the notions of 
“development” and instinctual “disturbances”; and it under¬ 
took to manage them. 

Perhaps the point to consider is not the level of indulgence 
or the quantity of repression but the form of power that was 
exercised. When this whole thicket of disparate sexualities 
was labeled, as if to disentangle them from one another, was 
the object to exclude them from reality? It appears, in fact,
