demned less and less): to marry a close relative or practice 
sodomy, to seduce a nun or engage in sadism, to deceive 
one’s wife or violate cadavers, became things that were essen¬ 
tially different. The area covered by the Sixth Command¬ 
ment began to fragment. Similarly, in the civil order, the 
confused category of “debauchery,” which for more than a 
century had been one of the most frequent reasons for ad¬ 
ministrative confinement, came apart. From the debris, there 
appeared on the one hand infractions against the legislation 
(or morality) pertaining to marriage and the family, and on 
the other, offenses against the regularity of a natural function 
(offenses which, it must be added, the law was apt to punish). 
Here we have a likely reason, among others, for the prestige 
of Don Juan, which three centuries have not erased. Under¬ 
neath the great violator of the rules of marriage—stealer of 
wives, seducer of virgins, the shame of families, and an insult 
to husbands and fathers—another personage can be 
glimpsed: the individual driven, in spite of himself, by the

something like a nature gone awry transports him far from 
all nature; his death is the moment when the supernatural 
return of the crime and its retribution thwarts the flight into 
counternature. There were two great systems conceived by 
the West for governing sex: the law of marriage and the order

We shall leave it to psychoanalysts to speculate whether he 
was homosexual, narcissistic, or impotent. 

Although not without delay and equivocation, the natural 
laws of matrimony and the immanent rules of sexuality 
began to be recorded on two separate registers. There 
emerged a world of perversion which partook of that of legal 
or moral infraction, yet was not simply a variety of the latter. 
An entire sub-race race was bom, different—despite certain 
kinship ties—from the libertines of the past. From the end 
of the eighteenth century to our own, they circulated through 
the pores of society; they were always hounded, but not 
always by laws; were often locked up, but not always in 
prisons; were sick perhaps, but scandalous, dangerous vic¬ 
tims, prey to a strange evil that also bore the name of vice
