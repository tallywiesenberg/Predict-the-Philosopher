Long before a thaumaturge like Apol¬ 
lonius of Tyana, who vowed chastity once and for all, and then 
had no more sexual relations for the rest of his life, 13 Greece 
had known and honored similar models.In some people, such 
extreme virtue was the visible mark of the mastery they 
brought to bear on themselves and hence of the power they 
were worthy of exercising over others.Thus Xenophon’s 
Agesilaus not only “kept at arm’s length those whose intimacy 
he did not desire,” but kept from embracing even the boy he 
did love; and he was careful to lodge only in temples or in a 
place where “all men’s eyes became witnesses to his recti¬ 
tude.” 14 But, for others, this abstention was linked directly to 
a form of wisdom that brought them into direct contact with 
some superior element in human nature and gave them access 
to the very essence of truth.The Socrates of the Symposium 
was like this, the one everybody wanted to be near, everybody 
was enamored of; the one whose wisdom everybody sought to 
appropriate—a wisdom that manifested and proved itself pre¬ 
cisely in the fact that he was himself able to keep from laying 
hands on the provocative beauty of Alcibiades.15 The themat- 
ics of a relationship between sexual abstinence and access to 
truth was already quite prominent.
