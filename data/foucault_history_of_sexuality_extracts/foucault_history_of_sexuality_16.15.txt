In 
classical thought, on the other hand, the demands of austerity 
were not organized into a unified, coherent, authoritarian 
moral system that was imposed on everyone in the same man¬ 
ner; they were more in the nature of a supplement, a “luxury” 
in relation to the commonly accepted morality.Further, they 
appeared in “scattered centers” whose origins were in differ¬ 
ent philosophical or religious movements.They developed in 
the midst of many separate groups.They proposed—more 
than they imposed—different styles of moderation or strict¬ 
ness, each having its specific character or “shape.” Py¬ 
thagorean austerity was not the same as that of the Stoics, 
which was very different in turn from that recommended by 
Epicurus.From the few similarities I have managed to point 
out, it should not be concluded that the Christian morality of 
sex was somehow “pre-formed” in ancient thought; one ought 
to imagine instead that very early in the moral thought of 
antiquity, a thematic complex—a “quadri-thematics” of sex¬ 
ual austerity—formed around and apropos of the life of the 
body, the institution of marriage, relations between men, and 
the existence of wisdom.
