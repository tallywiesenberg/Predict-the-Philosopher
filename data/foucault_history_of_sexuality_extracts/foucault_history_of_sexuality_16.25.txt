This appears very clearly in the dissymmetry that 
was a peculiar feature of all the moral reflection on sexual 
behavior of that age: women were generally subjected (except¬ 
ing the liberty they could be granted by a status like that of 
courtesan) to extremely strict constraints, and yet this ethics 
was not addressed to women; it was not their duties, or obliga¬ 
tions, that were recalled, justified, or spelled out.It was an 
ethics for men: an ethics thought, written, and taught by men, 
and addressed to men—to free men, obviously.A male ethics, 
consequently, in which women figured only as objects or, at 
most, as partners that one had best train, educate, and watch 
over when one had them under one’s power, but stay away

husband, tutor).This is doubtless one of the most remarkable 
aspects of that moral reflection: it did not try to define a 
field of conduct and a domain of valid rules—subject to the 
necessary modulations—for the two sexes in common; it was 
an elaboration of masculine conduct carried out from the
