Why did these axes of everyday experience give rise to 
a way of thinking that sought to rarefy sexual behavior, to 
moderate and condition it, and to define an austere style in the 
practice of pleasures?How did sexual behavior, insofar as it 
implied these different types of relations, come to be conceived 
as a domain of moral experience?3 


Morality and Practice 
of the Self 


In order to answer this question, some methodological con¬ 
siderations need to be brought in; more specifically, it is best 
to reflect on the object one has in view when one undertakes 
to study the forms and transformations of a “morality.” 

Everyone is aware of the word’s ambiguity.By “morality,” 
one means a set of values and rules of action that are recom¬ 
mended to individuals through the intermediary of various 
prescriptive agencies such as the family (in one of its roles), 
educational institutions, churches, and so forth.It is some¬ 
times the case that these rules and values are plainly set forth 
in a coherent doctrine and an explicit teaching.
