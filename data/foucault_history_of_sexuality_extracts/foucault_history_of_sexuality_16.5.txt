But 
another thing still is the manner in which one ought to “con¬ 
duct oneself’—that is, the manner in which one ought to form 
oneself as an ethical subject acting in reference to the prescrip¬ 
tive elements that make up the code.Given a code of actions, 
and with regard to a specific type of actions (which can be 
defined by their degree of conformity with or divergence from 
the code), there are different ways to “conduct oneself’ mor¬ 
ally, different ways for the acting individual to operate, not 
just as an agent, but as an ethical subject of this action.Take, 
for example, a code of sexual prescriptions enjoining the two 
marital partners to practice a strict and symmetrical conjugal 
fidelity, always with a view to procreation; there will be many 
ways, even within such a rigid frame, to practice that auster¬ 
ity, many ways to “be faithful.” These differences can bear on 
several points worth considering.They concern what might be called the determination of the 
ethical substance; that is, the way in which the individual has 
to constitute this or that part of himself as the prime material 
of his moral conduct.Thus, one can relate the crucial aspects 
of the practice of fidelity to the strict observance of interdic¬ 
tions and obligations in the very acts one accomplishes.
