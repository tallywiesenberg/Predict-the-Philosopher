But one can 
practice it, too, because one regards oneself as an heir to a 
spiritual tradition that one has the responsibility of maintain¬ 
ing or reviving; one can also practice fidelity in response to an 
appeal, by offering oneself as an example, or by seeking to give 
one’s personal life a form that answers to criteria of brilliance, 
beauty, nobility, or perfection.There are also possible differences in the forms of elabora¬ 
tion, of ethical work (travail ethique) that one performs on 
oneself, not only in order to bring one’s conduct into compli¬ 
ance with a given rule, but to attempt to transform oneself into 
the ethical subject of one’s behavior.Thus, sexual austerity 
can be practiced through a long effort of learning, memoriza¬ 
tion, and assimilation of a systematic ensemble of precepts, 
and through a regular checking of conduct aimed at measur¬ 
ing the exactness with which one is applying these rules.It can 
be practiced in the form of a sudden, all-embracing, and defini¬ 
tive renunciation of pleasures; it can also be practiced in the 
form of a relentless combat whose vicissitudes—including mo¬ 
mentary setbacks—can have meaning and value in them¬ 
selves; and it can be practiced through a decipherment as 
painstaking, continuous, and detailed as possible, of the move¬ 
ments of desire in all its hidden forms, including the most 
obscure.Other differences, finally, concern what might be called the 
telos of the ethical subject: an action is not only moral in itself,

tion and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of 
conduct.
