It is an element and an aspect of this conduct, and 
it marks a stage in its life, a possible advance in its continuity.A moral action tends toward its own accomplishment; but it 
also aims beyond the latter, to the establishing of a moral 
conduct that commits an individual, not only to other actions 
always in conformity with values and rules, but to a certain 
mode of being, a mode of being characteristic of the ethical 
subject.Many differences are possible here as well: conjugal 
fidelity can be associated with a moral conduct that aspires to 
an ever more complete mastery of the self; it can be a moral 
conduct that manifests a sudden and radical detachment vis-a- 
vis the world; it may strain toward a perfect tranquillity of 
soul, a total insensitivity to the agitations of the passions, or 
toward a purification that will ensure salvation after death and 
blissful immortality.In short, for an action to be “moral,” it must not be reduci¬ 
ble to an act or a series of acts conforming to a rule, a law, 
or a value.Of course all moral action involves a relationship 
with the reality in which it is carried out, and a relationship 
with the self.
