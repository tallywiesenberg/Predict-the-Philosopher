The latter is not simply “self-awareness” but 
self-formation as an “ethical subject,” a process in which the 
individual delimits that part of himself that will form the 
object of his moral practice, defines his position relative to the 
precept he will follow, and decides on a certain mode of being 
that will serve as his moral goal.And this requires him to act 
upon himself, to monitor, test, improve, and transform him¬ 
self.There is no specific moral action that does not refer to a 
unified moral conduct; no moral conduct that does not call for 
the forming of oneself as an ethical subject; and no forming 
of the ethical subject without “modes of subjectivation” and 
an “ascetics” or “practices of the self’ that support them.Moral action is indissociable from these forms of self-activity, 
and they do not differ any less from one morality to another 
than do the systems of values, rules, and interdictions.Introduction
