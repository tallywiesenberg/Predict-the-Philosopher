They also have consequences for historical 
analysis.Anyone who wishes to study the history of a “moral¬ 
ity” has to take into account the different realities that are 
covered by the term.A history of “moral behaviors” would 
study the extent to which actions of certain individuals or 
groups are consistent with the rules and values that are pre¬ 
scribed for them by various agencies.A history of “codes” 
would analyze the different systems of rules and values that 
are operative in a given society or group, the agencies or 
mechanisms of constraint that enforce them, the forms they 
take in their multifariousness, their divergences and their con¬ 
tradictions.And finally, a history of the way in which in¬ 
dividuals are urged to constitute themselves as subjects of 
moral conduct would be concerned with the models proposed 
for setting up and developing relationships with the self, for 
self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-examination, for the deci¬ 
pherment of the self by oneself, for the transformations that 
one seeks to accomplish with oneself as object.
