This last is 
what might be called a history of “ethics” and “ascetics,” 
understood as a history of the forms of moral subjectivation 
and of the practices of self that are meant to ensure it.If it is true, in fact, that every morality, in the broad sense, 
comprises the two elements I have just mentioned: codes of 
behavior and forms of subjectivation; if it is true that they can 
never be entirely dissociated, though they may develop in 
relative independence from one another—then we should not 
be surprised to find that in certain moralities the main empha¬ 
sis is placed on the code, on its systematicity, its richness, its 
capacity to adjust to every possible case and to embrace every 
area of behavior.With moralities of this type, the important 
thing is to focus on the instances of authority that enforce the 
code, that require it to be learned and observed, that penalize 
infractions; in these conditions, the subjectivation occurs basi¬

the organization of the penitential system at the beginning of 
the thirteenth century, and its development up to the eve of 
the Reformation, brought about a very strong “juridification” 
—more precisely, a very strong “codification”—of the moral 
experience.It was against this codification that many spiritual 
movements reacted before the Reformation.
