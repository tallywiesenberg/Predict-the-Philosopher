On the other hand, it is easy to conceive of moralities in 
which the strong and dynamic element is to be sought in the 
forms of subjectivation and the practices of the self.In this 
case, the system of codes and rules of behavior may be rather 
rudimentary.Their exact observance may be relatively unim¬ 
portant, at least compared with what is required of the indi¬ 
vidual in the relationship he has with himself, in his different 
actions, thoughts, and feelings as he endeavors to form himself 
as an ethical subject.Here the emphasis is on the forms of 
^relations with the self, on the methods and techniques by 
which he works them out, on the exercises by which he makes 
of himself an object to be known, and on the practices that 
enable him to transform his own mode of being.These “ethics- 
oriented” moralities (which do not necessarily correspond to 
those involving “ascetic denial”) have been very important in 
Christianity, functioning alongside the “code-oriented” 
moralities.
