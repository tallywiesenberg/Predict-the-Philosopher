This explains the choice of method I have kept to through¬ 
out this study on the sexual morality of pagan and Christian 
antiquity; that is, I had to keep in mind the distinction be¬ 
tween the code elements of a morality and the elements of 
ascesis, neglecting neither their coexistence, their interrela¬ 
tions, their relative autonomy, nor their possible differences of 
emphasis.I had to take into account everything, in these 
moralities, that seemed to have to do with the privileged status 
of the practices of the self and the interest that may have been 
accorded them; with the effort that was made to develop them, 
perfect them, and teach them; and with the debate that went 
on concerning them.Consequently, the question that is so 
often raised regarding the continuity (or break) between the 
philosophical moralities of antiquity and Christian morality 
had to be reformulated; instead of asking what were the code 
elements that Christianity may have borrowed from ancient 
thought, and what were those that it added in its own right, 
in order to define what was permitted and what forbidden 
within a sexuality assumed to be constant, it seemed more

number of rather simple principles: perhaps men are not much 
more inventive when it comes to interdictions than they are 
when it comes to pleasures.
