beard was believed to be that fateful mark, and it was said that 
the razor that shaved it must sever the ties of love. 23 In any 
case, one should note that people criticized not only boys who 
were willing to play a role that no longer corresponded to their 
virility, but also the men who frequented overaged boys. 24 The 
Stoics were criticized for keeping their lovers too long—up to 
the age of twenty-eight—but the argument they gave, which 
was more or less an extension of that given by Pausanias in 
the Symposium (he held that in order to make sure that men 
became attached only to youths of merit, the law should pro¬ 
hibit relations with boys who were too young), 25 shows that

The Use of Pleasure 


this limit was less a universal rule than a subject of debate that 
permitted a variety of solutions. 

This attention to the period of adolescence and its bounda¬ 
ries no doubt helped to increase people’s sensitivity to the 
juvenile body, to its special beauty, and to the different signs 
of its development; the adolescent physique became the object 
of a kind of cultural valorization that was quite pronounced. 
That the male body might be beautiful, well beyond its first 
bloom, was something that the Greeks were not blind to nor 
inclined to forget; classical figure sculpture paid more atten¬ 
tion to the adult body; and it is recalled in Xenophon’s Sympo¬ 
sium that in choosing garland-bearers for Athena, they were 
careful to select the most beautiful old men. 26 But in the sphere 
of sexual ethics, it was the juvenile body with its peculiar 
charm that was regularly suggested as the “right object’’ of 
pleasure. And it would be a mistake to think that its traits 
were valued because of what they shared with feminine 
beauty. They were appreciated in themselves or in their juxta¬ 
position with the signs and guarantees of a developing virility. 
Strength, endurance, and spirit also formed part of this 
beauty; hence it was good in fact if exercises, gymnastics, 
competitions, and hunting expeditions reinforced these quali¬ 
ties, guaranteeing that this gracefulness would not degenerate 
into softness and effeminization. 27 The feminine ambiguity 
that would be perceived later (and already in the course of 
antiquity, even) as a component—more exactly, as the secret 
cause—of the adolescent’s beauty, was, in the classical period, 
more something from which the boy needed to protect himself 
and be protected. Among the Greeks there was a whole moral 
aesthetics of the boy’s body; it told of his personal merit and 
of that of the love one felt for him. Virility as a physical mark 
should be absent from it; but it should be present as a preco¬ 
cious form and as a promise of future behavior: already to 
conduct oneself as the man one has not yet become. 

But this sensibility was also connected with feelings of anxi¬ 
ety in the face of those rapid changes and the nearness of their

completion; by a sense of the fleeting character of that beauty 
and of its legitimate desirability; and by fear, the double fear 
so often expressed in the lover, of seeing his beloved lose his 
charm, and in the beloved, of seeing his lover turn away from 
him. And the question that was then posed concerned the 
possible conversion—an ethically necessary and socially use¬ 
ful one—of the bond of love (doomed to disappear) into a 
relation of friendship, of philia. The latter differed from the 
love relation, out of which it would ideally and sometimes 
actually be formed: it was lasting, having no other limit than 
life itself; and it obliterated the dissymmetries that were im¬ 
plied in the erotic relation between man and adolescent. It was 
one of the frequent themes in moral reflection on this type of 
relation, that these relations needed to rid themselves of their 
precariousness: a precariousness that was due to the incon¬ 
stancy of the partners, and that was a consequence of the boy’s 
growing older and thereby losing his charm; but it was also 
a precept, since it was not good to love a boy who was past 
a certain age, just as it was not good for him to allow himself 
to be loved. This precariousness could be avoided only if, in 
the fervor of love, philia —friendship—already began to de¬ 
velop: philia, i.e., an affinity of character and mode of life, a 
sharing of thoughts and existence, mutual benevolence. 28 The 
beginning of this cultivation of indestructible friendship in the 
love relation is what Xenophon is describing when he portrays 
two lovers who look into each other’s faces, converse, confide 
in one another, rejoice together or feel a common distress over 
successes and failures, and look after each other: “It is by 
conducting themselves thus that men continue to love their 
mutual affection and enjoy it down to old age.”*

tionships with boys took the form of a reflection on love. This
