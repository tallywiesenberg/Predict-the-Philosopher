beard was believed to be that fateful mark, and it was said that 
the razor that shaved it must sever the ties of love. 23 In any 
case, one should note that people criticized not only boys who 
were willing to play a role that no longer corresponded to their 
virility, but also the men who frequented overaged boys. 24 The 
Stoics were criticized for keeping their lovers too long—up to 
the age of twenty-eight—but the argument they gave, which 
was more or less an extension of that given by Pausanias in 
the Symposium (he held that in order to make sure that men 
became attached only to youths of merit, the law should pro¬ 
hibit relations with boys who were too young), 25 shows that

The Use of Pleasure 


this limit was less a universal rule than a subject of debate that 
permitted a variety of solutions. 

This attention to the period of adolescence and its bounda¬ 
ries no doubt helped to increase people’s sensitivity to the 
juvenile body, to its special beauty, and to the different signs 
of its development; the adolescent physique became the object 
of a kind of cultural valorization that was quite pronounced. 
That the male body might be beautiful, well beyond its first 
bloom, was something that the Greeks were not blind to nor 
inclined to forget; classical figure sculpture paid more atten¬ 
tion to the adult body; and it is recalled in Xenophon’s Sympo¬ 
sium that in choosing garland-bearers for Athena, they were 
careful to select the most beautiful old men. 26 But in the sphere 
of sexual ethics, it was the juvenile body with its peculiar 
charm that was regularly suggested as the “right object’’ of 
pleasure. And it would be a mistake to think that its traits 
were valued because of what they shared with feminine 
beauty. They were appreciated in themselves or in their juxta¬ 
position with the signs and guarantees of a developing virility. 
Strength, endurance, and spirit also formed part of this 
beauty; hence it was good in fact if exercises, gymnastics, 
competitions, and hunting expeditions reinforced these quali¬ 
ties, guaranteeing that this gracefulness would not degenerate 
into softness and effeminization. 27 The feminine ambiguity 
that would be perceived later (and already in the course of 
antiquity, even) as a component—more exactly, as the secret 
cause—of the adolescent’s beauty, was, in the classical period, 
more something from which the boy needed to protect himself 
and be protected. Among the Greeks there was a whole moral
