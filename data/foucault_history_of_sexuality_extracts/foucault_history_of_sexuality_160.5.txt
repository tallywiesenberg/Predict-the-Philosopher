aesthetics of the boy’s body; it told of his personal merit and 
of that of the love one felt for him. Virility as a physical mark 
should be absent from it; but it should be present as a preco¬ 
cious form and as a promise of future behavior: already to 
conduct oneself as the man one has not yet become. 

But this sensibility was also connected with feelings of anxi¬ 
ety in the face of those rapid changes and the nearness of their

completion; by a sense of the fleeting character of that beauty 
and of its legitimate desirability; and by fear, the double fear 
so often expressed in the lover, of seeing his beloved lose his 
charm, and in the beloved, of seeing his lover turn away from 
him. And the question that was then posed concerned the 
possible conversion—an ethically necessary and socially use¬ 
ful one—of the bond of love (doomed to disappear) into a 
relation of friendship, of philia. The latter differed from the 
love relation, out of which it would ideally and sometimes 
actually be formed: it was lasting, having no other limit than 
life itself; and it obliterated the dissymmetries that were im¬ 
plied in the erotic relation between man and adolescent. It was 
one of the frequent themes in moral reflection on this type of 
relation, that these relations needed to rid themselves of their 
precariousness: a precariousness that was due to the incon¬ 
stancy of the partners, and that was a consequence of the boy’s 
growing older and thereby losing his charm; but it was also 
a precept, since it was not good to love a boy who was past 
a certain age, just as it was not good for him to allow himself 
to be loved. This precariousness could be avoided only if, in 
the fervor of love, philia —friendship—already began to de¬ 
velop: philia, i.e., an affinity of character and mode of life, a 
sharing of thoughts and existence, mutual benevolence. 28 The 
beginning of this cultivation of indestructible friendship in the 
love relation is what Xenophon is describing when he portrays 
two lovers who look into each other’s faces, converse, confide 
in one another, rejoice together or feel a common distress over 
successes and failures, and look after each other: “It is by 
conducting themselves thus that men continue to love their 
mutual affection and enjoy it down to old age.”*

tionships with boys took the form of a reflection on love. This
