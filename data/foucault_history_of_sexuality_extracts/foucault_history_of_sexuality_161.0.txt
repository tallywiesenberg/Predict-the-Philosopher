•This whole passage of Socrates’ speech is a good illustration of the anxiety that was 
felt in view of the precariousness of male love relationships, and of the role that the 
permanence of friendship was supposed to play in the scheme of things.”

The Use of Pleasure 


fact should not lead us to conclude that for the Greeks Eros 
had no place except in this type of relation, and that it could 
not play a part in relations with a woman: Eros could unite 
human beings no matter what their sex happened to be; in 
Xenophon, one can see that Niceratus and his wife are joined 
together by the ties of Eros and Anteros. 30 Eros was not neces¬ 
sarily “homosexual,” nor was it exclusive of marriage; and the 
marriage tie did not differ from the relation with boys by being 
incompatible with love’s intensity and reciprocity. The differ¬ 
ence was elsewhere. Matrimonial morality, and more precisely 
the sexual ethics of the married man, did not depend on the 
existence of an erotic relation in order to constitute itself and 
define its rules (although it was quite possible for this kind of 
bond to exist between marriage partners). On the other hand, 
when it was a matter of determining what use they might 
make of their pleasures within the relationship, then the refer¬ 
ence to Eros became necessary; the problematization of their 
relationship belonged to an “erotics.” This was because, in the 
case of two spouses, marital status, management of the oikos, 
and maintenance of the lineage could create standards of be¬ 
havior, define the rules of that behavior, and determine the 
forms of the requisite moderation. But in the case of a man or 
boy who were in a position of reciprocal independence and 
between whom there was no institutional constraint, but 
rather an open game (with preferences, choices, freedom of 
movement, uncertain outcome), the principle of regulation of 
behaviors was to be sought in the relation itself, in the nature 
of the attraction that drew them toward one another, and in 
the mutual attachment that connected them. Hence the prob¬ 
lematization would be carried out in the form of a reflection 
on the relation itself: an inquiry that was both theoretical 
about love and prescriptive about the way one lived. 

But in actual fact, this art of loving was intended for two 
classes of individuals. To be sure, the wife and her behavior 
were not completely absent from reflection on economics; but 
she was placed under her husband’s exclusive authority and 



Erotics

while it was right that she be respected in her privileges, this 
was insofar as she proved worthy of respect, the important 
thing being that the head of a family remain master of himself. 
The boy, on the other hand, could be expected to maintain the 
reserve that was appropriate at that age; with his possible 
refusals (dreaded but honorable) and his eventual acceptances 
(desired but likely to be suspect), he constituted an indepen¬ 
dent center vis-a-vis the lover. And this erotics would have to 
be deployed from one fixed point of this elliptical configura¬ 
tion to the other. In economics and dietetics, the voluntary 
moderation of the man was based mainly on his relation to 
himself; in erotics, the game was more complicated; it implied 
self-mastery on the part of the lover; it also implied an ability 
on the part of the beloved to establish a relation of dominion 
over himself; and lastly, it implied a relationship between their 
two moderations, expressed in their deliberate choice of one 
another. One can even note a certain tendency to privilege the 
boy’s point of view. The questions that were raised had to do 
with his conduct in particular, and it was to him that one 
offered observations, advice, and precepts: as if it were impor¬ 
tant above all to constitute an erotics of the loved object, or 
at least, of the loved object insofar as he had to form himself 
as a subject of ethical behavior; this is in fact what becomes 
apparent in a text like the eulogy of Epicrates, attributed to 
Demosthenes.

A Boy’s Honor 


In comparison with the two great Symposiums, Plato’s and 
Xenophon’s, and with the Phaedrus, Demosthenes’ Erotic 
Essay appears rather mediocre. A formulaic speech, it is both 
the encomium of a young man and an exhortation addressed 
to him. This was in fact the traditional function of encomiums, 
and the function that Xenophon alludes to in the Symposium: 
“in the very act of flattering Callias, you are educating him to
