•This whole passage of Socrates’ speech is a good illustration of the anxiety that was 
felt in view of the precariousness of male love relationships, and of the role that the 
permanence of friendship was supposed to play in the scheme of things.”

The Use of Pleasure 


fact should not lead us to conclude that for the Greeks Eros 
had no place except in this type of relation, and that it could 
not play a part in relations with a woman: Eros could unite 
human beings no matter what their sex happened to be; in 
Xenophon, one can see that Niceratus and his wife are joined 
together by the ties of Eros and Anteros. 30 Eros was not neces¬ 
sarily “homosexual,” nor was it exclusive of marriage; and the 
marriage tie did not differ from the relation with boys by being 
incompatible with love’s intensity and reciprocity. The differ¬ 
ence was elsewhere. Matrimonial morality, and more precisely 
the sexual ethics of the married man, did not depend on the 
existence of an erotic relation in order to constitute itself and 
define its rules (although it was quite possible for this kind of 
bond to exist between marriage partners). On the other hand, 
when it was a matter of determining what use they might 
make of their pleasures within the relationship, then the refer¬ 
ence to Eros became necessary; the problematization of their 
relationship belonged to an “erotics.” This was because, in the 
case of two spouses, marital status, management of the oikos, 
and maintenance of the lineage could create standards of be¬ 
havior, define the rules of that behavior, and determine the 
forms of the requisite moderation. But in the case of a man or 
boy who were in a position of reciprocal independence and 
between whom there was no institutional constraint, but 
rather an open game (with preferences, choices, freedom of 
movement, uncertain outcome), the principle of regulation of 
behaviors was to be sought in the relation itself, in the nature 
of the attraction that drew them toward one another, and in 
the mutual attachment that connected them. Hence the prob¬ 
lematization would be carried out in the form of a reflection 
on the relation itself: an inquiry that was both theoretical 
about love and prescriptive about the way one lived. 

But in actual fact, this art of loving was intended for two 
classes of individuals. To be sure, the wife and her behavior 
were not completely absent from reflection on economics; but 
she was placed under her husband’s exclusive authority and
