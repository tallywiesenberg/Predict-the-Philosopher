while it was right that she be respected in her privileges, this 
was insofar as she proved worthy of respect, the important 
thing being that the head of a family remain master of himself. 
The boy, on the other hand, could be expected to maintain the 
reserve that was appropriate at that age; with his possible 
refusals (dreaded but honorable) and his eventual acceptances 
(desired but likely to be suspect), he constituted an indepen¬

moderation of the man was based mainly on his relation to 
himself; in erotics, the game was more complicated; it implied 
self-mastery on the part of the lover; it also implied an ability 
on the part of the beloved to establish a relation of dominion 
over himself; and lastly, it implied a relationship between their 
two moderations, expressed in their deliberate choice of one 
another. One can even note a certain tendency to privilege the 
boy’s point of view. The questions that were raised had to do 
with his conduct in particular, and it was to him that one 
offered observations, advice, and precepts: as if it were impor¬ 
tant above all to constitute an erotics of the loved object, or 
at least, of the loved object insofar as he had to form himself 
as a subject of ethical behavior; this is in fact what becomes 
apparent in a text like the eulogy of Epicrates, attributed to 
Demosthenes.

In comparison with the two great Symposiums, Plato’s and

Essay appears rather mediocre. A formulaic speech, it is both 
the encomium of a young man and an exhortation addressed 
to him. This was in fact the traditional function of encomiums, 
and the function that Xenophon alludes to in the Symposium: 
“in the very act of flattering Callias, you are educating him to
