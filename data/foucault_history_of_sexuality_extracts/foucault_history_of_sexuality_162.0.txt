conform to the ideal.” 1 Praise and lesson at the same time, 
therefore. But despite the banality of the themes and their 
treatment—a kind of insipid Platonism—it is possible to dis¬ 
cover a few traits that were characteristic of other discourses 
on love and of the way in which the question of “pleasures” 
was posed within them. 

1. One preoccupation animates the entire text. It finds 
expression in a vocabulary that refers constantly to honor and 
shame. Throughout the speech it is a question of aischyne, 
that shame which is both the dishonor with which one can be 
branded and the feeling that causes one to turn away from it; 
it is a question of that which is ugly and shameful (aischron), 
in contrast to that which is fine, or both fine and honorable. 
Much is said, too, about that which results in blame and 
contempt (oneidos, epitime), as opposed to that which brings 
honor and leads to a good reputation (endoxos, entimos). In 
any case, Epicrates’ admirer states his objective from the very

start of the Erotic Essay: may this praise bring honor to his 
beloved, and not shame, as sometimes happens when eulogies 
are delivered by indiscreet suitors. 2 And he returns again and 
again to this concern: it is important that the young man 
remember that because of his birth and standing, the least 
negligence where honor is at stake may well cover him with 
shame; he must always keep in mind the example of those 
who, by being vigilant, have managed to preserve their honor 
in the course of their relationship; 3 he must take care not to 
“dishonor his natural qualities” and not to disappoint the 
hopes of those who are proud of him. 4 * 

The behavior of young men thus appears to have been a 
domain that was especially sensitive to the division between 
what was shameful and what was proper, between what re¬ 
flected credit and what brought dishonor. It was this question 
that preoccupied those who chose to reflect on young men, on 
the love that was manifested for them and the conduct they 
needed to exhibit. Pausanias, in Plato’s Symposium, calls at¬ 
tention to the diversity of morals and customs having to do 
with boys. He points out what is considered “disgraceful” or 
“good” in Elis, in Sparta, in Thebes, in Ionia or in areas under 
Persian rule, and lastly, in Athens. 6 And Phaedrus recalls the 
principle that should be one’s guide in the love of young men 
as well as in life in general: “shame at what is disgraceful and 
ambition for what is noble; without these feelings neither a 
state nor an individual can accomplish anything great or 
fine.” 7 But it should be remarked that this question was not 
confined to a few exacting moralists. A young man’s behavior, 
his honor and his disgrace were also the object of much social 
curiosity; people payed attention to this, spoke about it, 
remembered it. For example, in order to attack Timarchus, 
Aeschines had no qualms about rehashing the gossip that may 
have gone round many years previously, when his adversary 
was still a very young man. 8 Moreover, the Erotic Essay shows 

•Aristotle’s Rhetoric shows the importance of the categories of kalon and aischron 
in speeches of praise.’

The Use of Pleasure 


very well in passing just what sort of distrustful solicitude a 
boy could quite naturally be subjected to by his entourage; 
people watched him, spied on him, remarked on his demeanor 
and his relations; vicious tongues were active around him; 
spiteful people were ready to blame him if he showed arro¬ 
gance or conceit, but they were also quick to criticize him if 
he was too gracious. 9 Naturally, one cannot help but think 
about what the situation of girls in other societies must have 
been when—the age for marriage being much earlier for 
women—their premarital conduct became an important 
moral and social concern, of itself and for their families. 

2. But in regard to the Greek boy, the importance of his 
honor did not concern—as it would later in the case of the 
European girl—his future marriage; rather, it related to his 
status, his eventual place in the city. Of course, there is abun¬ 
dant evidence that boys of dubious reputation could exercise 
the highest political functions; but there is also evidence that 
this very thing could be held against them—without counting 
the substantial judicial consequences that certain kinds of mis¬ 
conduct might produce: theTimarchus affair makes this clear. 
The author of the Erotic Essay points it out to the young 
Epicrates; part of his future, including the rank he will be able 
to occupy in the city, depends this very day on the manner,
