conform to the ideal.” 1 Praise and lesson at the same time, 
therefore. But despite the banality of the themes and their 
treatment—a kind of insipid Platonism—it is possible to dis¬ 
cover a few traits that were characteristic of other discourses 
on love and of the way in which the question of “pleasures” 
was posed within them. 

1. One preoccupation animates the entire text. It finds 
expression in a vocabulary that refers constantly to honor and 
shame. Throughout the speech it is a question of aischyne, 
that shame which is both the dishonor with which one can be 
branded and the feeling that causes one to turn away from it; 
it is a question of that which is ugly and shameful (aischron), 
in contrast to that which is fine, or both fine and honorable. 
Much is said, too, about that which results in blame and 
contempt (oneidos, epitime), as opposed to that which brings 
honor and leads to a good reputation (endoxos, entimos). In

are delivered by indiscreet suitors. 2 And he returns again and

who, by being vigilant, have managed to preserve their honor 
in the course of their relationship; 3 he must take care not to 
“dishonor his natural qualities” and not to disappoint the 
hopes of those who are proud of him. 4 * 

The behavior of young men thus appears to have been a 
domain that was especially sensitive to the division between 
what was shameful and what was proper, between what re¬ 
flected credit and what brought dishonor. It was this question 
that preoccupied those who chose to reflect on young men, on 
the love that was manifested for them and the conduct they 
needed to exhibit. Pausanias, in Plato’s Symposium, calls at¬ 
tention to the diversity of morals and customs having to do 
with boys. He points out what is considered “disgraceful” or
