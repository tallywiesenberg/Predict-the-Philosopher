“good” in Elis, in Sparta, in Thebes, in Ionia or in areas under 
Persian rule, and lastly, in Athens. 6 And Phaedrus recalls the 
principle that should be one’s guide in the love of young men 
as well as in life in general: “shame at what is disgraceful and 
ambition for what is noble; without these feelings neither a 
state nor an individual can accomplish anything great or 
fine.” 7 But it should be remarked that this question was not 
confined to a few exacting moralists. A young man’s behavior, 
his honor and his disgrace were also the object of much social 
curiosity; people payed attention to this, spoke about it, 
remembered it. For example, in order to attack Timarchus, 
Aeschines had no qualms about rehashing the gossip that may 
have gone round many years previously, when his adversary 
was still a very young man. 8 Moreover, the Erotic Essay shows

gance or conceit, but they were also quick to criticize him if 
he was too gracious. 9 Naturally, one cannot help but think 
about what the situation of girls in other societies must have 
been when—the age for marriage being much earlier for 
women—their premarital conduct became an important 
moral and social concern, of itself and for their families. 

2. But in regard to the Greek boy, the importance of his 
honor did not concern—as it would later in the case of the 
European girl—his future marriage; rather, it related to his 
status, his eventual place in the city. Of course, there is abun¬ 
dant evidence that boys of dubious reputation could exercise 
the highest political functions; but there is also evidence that 
this very thing could be held against them—without counting 
the substantial judicial consequences that certain kinds of mis¬ 
conduct might produce: theTimarchus affair makes this clear. 
The author of the Erotic Essay points it out to the young 
Epicrates; part of his future, including the rank he will be able 
to occupy in the city, depends this very day on the manner,
