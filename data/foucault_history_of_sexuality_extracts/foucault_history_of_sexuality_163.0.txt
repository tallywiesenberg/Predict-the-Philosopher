honorable or not, in which he conducts himself: considering 
that the city cannot call upon just anyone, it will have to take 
account of established reputations; 10 and the man who scoffs 
at good advice will be punished all his life for his blindness. 
Two things are necessary, therefore: to mind one’s own con¬ 
duct when one is still very young, but also to look after the 
honor of younger men, when one has grown older. 

This transitional age, when the young man was so desirable 
and his honor so fragile, thus constituted a trial period: a time 
when his worth was tested, in the sense that it had to be 
formed, exercised, and measured all at the same time. A few 
lines at the end of the text point up the testlike characteristics

that the boy’s behavior assumed in this period of his life. In 
exhorting Epicrates, the author of the encomium reminds him 
that he will be put to the test (agon), and that the debate will

among the ephebi or citizens were admitted to certain magis¬ 
tracies. The young man’s conduct owed its importance and the 
attention that everyone needed to give it, to the fact that 
everyone saw it as a qualifying test. The text says this plainly, 
moreover: “I think . . . that the city will appoint you to be in

as your natural gifts are more conspicuous it will judge you 
worthy of greater responsibilities and will the sooner desire to 
make trial of your abilities.” 12 

3. What exactly was being tested? And with respect to 
what type of behavior was Epicrates supposed to draw the line 
between that which was honorable and that which was dis¬ 
graceful? The test pertained to the familiar points of Greek 
education: the demeanor of the body (carefully avoid rha- 
thymia, the sluggishness which was always a defamatory 
sign); one’s gaze (in which aidos, dignity, could be read), one’s 
way of talking (don’t take the easy option of silence, but be 
able to mix serious talk with casual talk); and the quality of 
one’s acquaintances. 

But it was especially in the sphere of amorous conduct that 
the distinction between what was honorable and what was
