honorable or not, in which he conducts himself: considering 
that the city cannot call upon just anyone, it will have to take 
account of established reputations; 10 and the man who scoffs 
at good advice will be punished all his life for his blindness. 
Two things are necessary, therefore: to mind one’s own con¬ 
duct when one is still very young, but also to look after the 
honor of younger men, when one has grown older. 

This transitional age, when the young man was so desirable 
and his honor so fragile, thus constituted a trial period: a time 
when his worth was tested, in the sense that it had to be 
formed, exercised, and measured all at the same time. A few 
lines at the end of the text point up the testlike characteristics

that the boy’s behavior assumed in this period of his life. In 
exhorting Epicrates, the author of the encomium reminds him 
that he will be put to the test (agon), and that the debate will 
be a dokimasia : 11 this was the word that designated the exami¬ 
nation upon whose completion young men were enrolled 
among the ephebi or citizens were admitted to certain magis¬ 
tracies. The young man’s conduct owed its importance and the 
attention that everyone needed to give it, to the fact that 
everyone saw it as a qualifying test. The text says this plainly, 
moreover: “I think . . . that the city will appoint you to be in 
charge of some department of her business, and in proportion 
as your natural gifts are more conspicuous it will judge you 
worthy of greater responsibilities and will the sooner desire to 
make trial of your abilities.” 12 

3. What exactly was being tested? And with respect to 
what type of behavior was Epicrates supposed to draw the line 
between that which was honorable and that which was dis¬ 
graceful? The test pertained to the familiar points of Greek 
education: the demeanor of the body (carefully avoid rha- 
thymia, the sluggishness which was always a defamatory 
sign); one’s gaze (in which aidos, dignity, could be read), one’s 
way of talking (don’t take the easy option of silence, but be 
able to mix serious talk with casual talk); and the quality of 
one’s acquaintances. 

But it was especially in the sphere of amorous conduct that 
the distinction between what was honorable and what was 
shameful operated. On this point, we may note first of all that 
the author—and this is what makes the text both a eulogy of 
love and praise of a young man—criticizes the opinion that 
would tie a boy’s honor to the systematic rejection of suitors: 
doubtless certain lovers defile the relation itself (lymainesthai 
toi pragmati ), 13 but one should not put them in the same class 
as those admirers who show moderation. The text does not 
draw the boundary line of honor between those who spurn 
their suitors and those who accept them. For a Greek youth,

The Use of Pleasure 


to be pursued by would-be lovers was obviously not a dis¬ 
honor: it was, rather, the visible mark of his qualities; the 
number of admirers could be an object of legitimate pride, and 
sometimes an object of vainglory. But to accept the love rela¬ 
tion, to enter the game (even if one did not play exactly the 
game the lover proposed) was not considered to be a disgrace 
either. The man who praises Epicrates explains to him that 
being beautiful and being loved constitute a double stroke of 
fortune (eutychia ); 14 it only remains for him to make the right 
use (orthos chresthai) of it. It is this point that the text empha¬ 
sizes and makes a “point of honor,” so to speak; these things 
(ta pragmata) are not, in themselves and absolutely, good or 
bad; they vary according to who practices them (para tous 
chromenous ). 15 It is “use” that determines their moral value, 
according to a principle that one sees often formulated else¬ 
where; in any case, we find quite similar expressions in the 
Symposium: “The truth of the matter I believe to be this. 
There is, as I stated at first, no absolute right and wrong in 
love, but everything depends upon the circumstances; to yield 
to a bad man in a bad way is wrong, but to yield to a worthy 
man in a right way is right.” 16 

Now, as for knowing precisely how the distribution of 
honor is to be carried out in the love relation, one must admit 
that the text is extremely elliptical. While it does offer specifics 
regarding what Epicrates should do or has done in order to 
exercise his body and develop his courage, or to acquire the 
philosophical knowledge that he will need, nothing is said 
concerning what is acceptable or objectionable in physical 
relations. One thing is clear: not everything should be refused 
(the young man “grants his favors”), but not everything 
should be consented to: “No one finds himself disappointed of
