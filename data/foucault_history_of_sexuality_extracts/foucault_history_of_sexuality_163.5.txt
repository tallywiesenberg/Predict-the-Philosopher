shameful operated. On this point, we may note first of all that 
the author—and this is what makes the text both a eulogy of 
love and praise of a young man—criticizes the opinion that 
would tie a boy’s honor to the systematic rejection of suitors: 
doubtless certain lovers defile the relation itself (lymainesthai 
toi pragmati ), 13 but one should not put them in the same class 
as those admirers who show moderation. The text does not 
draw the boundary line of honor between those who spurn 
their suitors and those who accept them. For a Greek youth,

The Use of Pleasure 


to be pursued by would-be lovers was obviously not a dis¬ 
honor: it was, rather, the visible mark of his qualities; the 
number of admirers could be an object of legitimate pride, and 
sometimes an object of vainglory. But to accept the love rela¬ 
tion, to enter the game (even if one did not play exactly the 
game the lover proposed) was not considered to be a disgrace 
either. The man who praises Epicrates explains to him that 
being beautiful and being loved constitute a double stroke of 
fortune (eutychia ); 14 it only remains for him to make the right 
use (orthos chresthai) of it. It is this point that the text empha¬ 
sizes and makes a “point of honor,” so to speak; these things 
(ta pragmata) are not, in themselves and absolutely, good or 
bad; they vary according to who practices them (para tous 
chromenous ). 15 It is “use” that determines their moral value, 
according to a principle that one sees often formulated else¬ 
where; in any case, we find quite similar expressions in the 
Symposium: “The truth of the matter I believe to be this. 
There is, as I stated at first, no absolute right and wrong in 
love, but everything depends upon the circumstances; to yield 
to a bad man in a bad way is wrong, but to yield to a worthy 
man in a right way is right.” 16 

Now, as for knowing precisely how the distribution of 
honor is to be carried out in the love relation, one must admit 
that the text is extremely elliptical. While it does offer specifics 
regarding what Epicrates should do or has done in order to 
exercise his body and develop his courage, or to acquire the 
philosophical knowledge that he will need, nothing is said 
concerning what is acceptable or objectionable in physical 
relations. One thing is clear: not everything should be refused 
(the young man “grants his favors”), but not everything 
should be consented to: “No one finds himself disappointed of
