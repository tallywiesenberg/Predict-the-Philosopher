favors from you which it is just and fair to ask, but no one is 
permitted even to hope for such liberties as lead to shame. So 
great is the latitude your discreetness permits to those who 
have the best intentions; so great is the discouragement it 
presents to those who would fling off restraint.” 17 The modera-

tion—the sophrosyne —that is one of the major qualities re¬ 
quired of boys clearly implies a discrimination in physical 
contacts. But it is not possible to infer from this text the acts 
and gestures that honor would compel one to refuse. It should 
be noted that in the Phaedrus the lack of precision is almost 
as great, even though the theme is developed more fully. 
Throughout the first two speeches on the advisability of yield¬ 
ing to a lover or a nonlover, and in the great fable of the soul 
as a team with its restive steed and its obedient steed, Plato’s 
text shows that the question of what constitutes “honorable” 
practice is crucial: and yet the acts are never designated except 
by expressions like “to gratify” or “to grant one’s favors” 
(charizesthai), “to do the thing” (diaprattesthai), “to derive 
the greatest possible pleasure from the beloved,” “to obtain 
what one wants” (pleithesthai), “to enjoy” (apolauesthai). A 
reticence inherent in this type of discourse? Without doubt, 
the Greeks would have found it improper that someone would 
call by name, in a set speech, things that were only vaguely 
alluded to even in polemics and law court addresses. One 
imagines, too, that it was hardly necessary to insist on distinc¬ 
tions that were common knowledge: everyone must have 
known what it was honorable or shamef ul f or a boy to consent 
to. But we may also recall an observation that was made in our 
discussion of dietetics and economics, where it became appar¬ 
ent that moral reflection was less concerned with specifying 
the codes to be respected and the list of acts that were permit¬ 
ted and prohibited than it was concerned with characterizing 
the type of attitude, of relationship with oneself that was 
required. 

4. Actually, while the text does not indicate the practical 
forms that are to be respected and the physical boundaries that 
are not to be crossed, it does at least designate the general 
principle that determines the way to conduct oneself in these 
matters. The entire eulogy of Epicrates refers to an agonistic 
context in which the worth and brilliance of the young man

must affirm itself through his superiority over others. Let us 
quickly review these motifs that were so frequent in set 
speeches. The individual being eulogized is greater than the 
praise that one offers him, and the words risk being less beauti¬ 
ful than the one to whom they are addressed; or the boy 
surpasses all others in physical and moral qualities; not only 
his gifts but his conversation places him above all others; 
among all the exercises in which one can excel, he has chosen 
the most noble, the most rewarding; his soul is prepared for 
“the rivalries of ambition,” and not content to distinguish 
himself by one quality, he combines “all the qualities of which 
a man might justly feel proud.” 18 

However, the merit of Epicrates is not just in this abun¬ 
dance of qualities that enable him to outstrip all his rivals and 
bring glory to his parents; 19 it also consists in the fact that with 
respect to all those who approach him he always maintains his 
eminent worth; he does not allow himself to be dominated by 
any of them; they all want to draw him into their intimacy— 
the word synetheia has both the general meaning of living 
together and the specific meaning of sexual relations—but he 
surpasses them in such a way, he gains such an ascendancy 
over them that they derive all their pleasure from the friend¬ 
ship they feel for him. 20 By not yielding, not submitting, re¬ 
maining the strongest, triumphing over suitors and lovers 
through one’s resistance, one’s firmness, one’s moderation 
(sophrosyne )—the young man proves his excellence in the 
sphere of love relations. 

Given this general indication, must we imagine a precise 
code based on the analogy—so familiar to the Greeks—be¬ 
tween positions in the social field (with the difference between 
“the first ones” and the others, the great who rule and those 
who obey, the masters and the servants) and the form of sexual 
relations {with dominant and subordinate positions, active 
and passive roles, penetration carried out by the man and 
undergone by his partner)? To say that one must not yield, not 
let others get the best of one, not accept a subordinate position
