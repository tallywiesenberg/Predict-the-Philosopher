where one would get the worst of it, is doubtless to exclude 
or advise against sexual practices that would be humiliating 
for the boy, putting him in a position of inferiority. 21 

But it is likely that the principle of honor and maintenance 
of “superiority” refers—beyond a few precise prescriptions— 
to a kind of general style: it was not good (especially in the 
eyes of public opinion) for a boy to behave “passively,” to let 
himself be manipulated and dominated, to yield without re¬ 
sistance, to become an obliging partner in the sensual pleas¬ 
ures of the other, to indulge his whims, and to offer his body 
to whomever it pleased and however it pleased them, out of 
weakness, lust, or self-interest. This was what dishonored boys 
who accepted the first comer, who showed off unscrupulously, 
who passed from hand to hand, who granted everything to the 
highest bidder. This was what Epicrates did not and would not 
do, mindful as he was of the opinion people had of him, of the 
rank he would have to hold, and of the useful relations he 
might enter into. 

5. I would like just to mention again briefly the role that 
the author of the Erotic Essay has philosophy play in this 
safeguarding of honor and these contests of superiority by 
which the boy is invited to test himself in a manner that befits 
his age. This philosophy, whose content is not specified apart 
from a reference to the Socratic theme of epimeleia heautou, 
“care of the self,” 22 and to the necessity, also Socratic, of 
combining knowledge and exercise (episteme, melete )—this 
philosophy is not presented as a guide for leading a different 
life, nor for abstaining from all the pleasures. It is invoked by 
Demosthenes as an indispensable complement of the other 
tests: “Reflect that ... of all things the most irrational is to 
be ambitious for wealth, bodily strength, and such things, and 
for their sake to submit to many tests . . . but not to aim at 
the improvement of the mind, which has supervision over all 
other powers.” 23 What philosophy can show, in fact, is how to 
become “stronger than oneself’ and when one has become so,

it also enables one to prevail over others. It is by nature a 
leadership principle since it alone is capable of directing 
thought: “Of the powers residing in human beings we shall 
find that thought leads all the rest and that philosophy alone 
is capable of directing it rightly and training it.” 24 It is clear 
that philosophy is an asset that is necessary for the young 
man’s wise conduct; not, however, in order to guide him to¬ 
ward another form of life, but to enable him to exercise self- 
mastery and to triumph over others in the difficult game of 
ordeals to be undergone and honor to be safeguarded. 

The entire Erotic Essay revolves, as we see, around the 
problem of this twofold superiority over oneself and over oth¬ 
ers in that difficult phase when the boy’s youth and beauty 
attract one man after the other, each trying to “get the best” 
of him. In dietetics, it was mainly a question of mastery over 
oneself and over the violence of a perilous act; in economics, 
it was a question of the control that one had to exercise over 
oneself in the practice of the authority that one exercised over 
one’s wife. Here, where erotics takes the boy’s point of view, 
the problem is to see how the boy is going to be able to achieve 
self-mastery in not yielding to others. The point at issue is not 
the sense of measure that one brings to one’s own power, but 
the best way to measure one’s strength against the power of 
others while ensuring one’s own mastery over self. In this 
regard, a brief narration that appears in the middle of the 
speech acquires a symbolic value. It is a commonplace account 
of a chariot race, but a direct relation is established between 
the little sports drama that is reported and the public test that 
the young man undergoes in his behavior with his suitors. We 
see Epicrates driving his team (a likely reference to the Phae- 
drus)\ he is on the verge of defeat, his chariot is about to be 
smashed to pieces by an opposing team; the crowd, despite the 
taste it ordinarily has for accidents, cheers for the hero, while 
he, “stronger even than the vigor of his team, manages to win 
the victory over the most favored of his rivals.” 25 

This prosaic address to Epicrates is certainly not one of the
