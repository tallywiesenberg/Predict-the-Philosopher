where one would get the worst of it, is doubtless to exclude 
or advise against sexual practices that would be humiliating 
for the boy, putting him in a position of inferiority. 21 

But it is likely that the principle of honor and maintenance 
of “superiority” refers—beyond a few precise prescriptions— 
to a kind of general style: it was not good (especially in the 
eyes of public opinion) for a boy to behave “passively,” to let 
himself be manipulated and dominated, to yield without re¬ 
sistance, to become an obliging partner in the sensual pleas¬ 
ures of the other, to indulge his whims, and to offer his body 
to whomever it pleased and however it pleased them, out of 
weakness, lust, or self-interest. This was what dishonored boys 
who accepted the first comer, who showed off unscrupulously, 
who passed from hand to hand, who granted everything to the 
highest bidder. This was what Epicrates did not and would not 
do, mindful as he was of the opinion people had of him, of the 
rank he would have to hold, and of the useful relations he 
might enter into. 

5. I would like just to mention again briefly the role that 
the author of the Erotic Essay has philosophy play in this 
safeguarding of honor and these contests of superiority by 
which the boy is invited to test himself in a manner that befits 
his age. This philosophy, whose content is not specified apart 
from a reference to the Socratic theme of epimeleia heautou, 
“care of the self,” 22 and to the necessity, also Socratic, of 
combining knowledge and exercise (episteme, melete )—this 
philosophy is not presented as a guide for leading a different 
life, nor for abstaining from all the pleasures. It is invoked by 
Demosthenes as an indispensable complement of the other 
tests: “Reflect that ... of all things the most irrational is to 
be ambitious for wealth, bodily strength, and such things, and 
for their sake to submit to many tests . . . but not to aim at 
the improvement of the mind, which has supervision over all 
other powers.” 23 What philosophy can show, in fact, is how to 
become “stronger than oneself’ and when one has become so,
