it also enables one to prevail over others. It is by nature a 
leadership principle since it alone is capable of directing 
thought: “Of the powers residing in human beings we shall 
find that thought leads all the rest and that philosophy alone 
is capable of directing it rightly and training it.” 24 It is clear 
that philosophy is an asset that is necessary for the young 
man’s wise conduct; not, however, in order to guide him to¬ 
ward another form of life, but to enable him to exercise self- 
mastery and to triumph over others in the difficult game of 
ordeals to be undergone and honor to be safeguarded. 

The entire Erotic Essay revolves, as we see, around the 
problem of this twofold superiority over oneself and over oth¬ 
ers in that difficult phase when the boy’s youth and beauty 
attract one man after the other, each trying to “get the best” 
of him. In dietetics, it was mainly a question of mastery over 
oneself and over the violence of a perilous act; in economics, 
it was a question of the control that one had to exercise over 
oneself in the practice of the authority that one exercised over 
one’s wife. Here, where erotics takes the boy’s point of view, 
the problem is to see how the boy is going to be able to achieve 
self-mastery in not yielding to others. The point at issue is not 
the sense of measure that one brings to one’s own power, but 
the best way to measure one’s strength against the power of 
others while ensuring one’s own mastery over self. In this 
regard, a brief narration that appears in the middle of the 
speech acquires a symbolic value. It is a commonplace account 
of a chariot race, but a direct relation is established between 
the little sports drama that is reported and the public test that 
the young man undergoes in his behavior with his suitors. We 
see Epicrates driving his team (a likely reference to the Phae- 
drus)\ he is on the verge of defeat, his chariot is about to be 
smashed to pieces by an opposing team; the crowd, despite the 
taste it ordinarily has for accidents, cheers for the hero, while 
he, “stronger even than the vigor of his team, manages to win 
the victory over the most favored of his rivals.” 25 

This prosaic address to Epicrates is certainly not one of the
