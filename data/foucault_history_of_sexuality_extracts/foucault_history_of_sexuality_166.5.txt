cultural elaboration. In broad terms, what is important to 
grasp here is not why the Greeks had a fondness for boys but 
why they had a “pederasty”; that is, why they elaborated a 
courtship practice, a moral reflection, and—as we shall see— 
a philosophical asceticism, around that fondness.

The Object of 
Pleasure 


In order to understand how the use of the aphrodisia was 
problematized in reflection on the love of boys, we have to 
recall a principle, which is doubtless not peculiar to Greek 
culture, but which assumed considerable importance within it 
and exercised a decisive authority in its moral valuations. I am 
referring to the principle of isomorphism between sexual rela¬ 
tions and social relations. What this means is that sexual 
relations—always conceived in terms of the model act of pene¬ 
tration, assuming a polarity that opposed activity and passiv¬ 
ity—were seen as being of the same type as the relationship 
between a superior and a subordinate, an individual who 
dominates and one who is dominated, one who commands and 
one who complies, one who vanquishes and one who is van¬ 
quished. Pleasure practices were conceptualized using the 
same categories as those in the field of social rivalries and 
hierarchies: an analogous agonistic structure, analogous oppo¬ 
sitions and differentiations, analogous values attributed to the 
respective roles of the partners. And this suggests that in 
sexual behavior there was one role that was intrinsically hon¬ 
orable and valorized without question: the one that consisted 
in being active, in dominating, in penetrating, in asserting 
one’s superiority. 

This principle had several consequences relating to the sta¬ 
tus of those who were supposed to be the passive partners in 
this activity. Slaves were at the master’s disposition, of course:
