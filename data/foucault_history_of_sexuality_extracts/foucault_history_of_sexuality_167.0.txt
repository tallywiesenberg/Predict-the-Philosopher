their condition made them sexual objects and this was taken 
for granted—so much so that people could be astonished that 
the same law would forbid the rape of slaves and that of 
children. In order to explain this anomaly, Aeschines submits 
that the aim was to show, by prohibiting violence even in the 
case of slaves, what a serious thing it was when directed at 
children of good birth. As for the woman’s passivity, it did 
denote an inferiority of nature and condition; but there was no 
reason to criticize it as a behavior, precisely because it was in 
conformity with what nature intended and with what the law 
prescribed. On the other hand, everything in the way of sexual 
behavior that might cause a free man—to say nothing of some¬ 
one who, by birth, fortune, and prestige, held or should hold 
one of the first ranks among men—to bear the marks of inferi¬ 
ority, submission to domination, and acceptance of servitude, 
could only be considered as shameful: a shame that was even 
greater if he offered himself as the obliging object of another’s 
pleasure. 

Now, in a game regulated according to such principles, the 
position of the (freeborn) boy was difficult. To be sure, he was 
still in an “inferior” position in the sense that he was a long 
way from benefiting from the rights and powers that would be 
his when he attained the full enjoyment of his status. And yet 
his place was not assimilable to that of a slave, nor to that of 
a woman. This was true even in the context of the household 
and the family. A passage from Aristotle’s Politics makes this 
clear. Discussing the relations of authority and forms of gov¬ 
ernment that are appropriate for the family, Aristotle defines 
the positions of the slave, the wife, and the (male) child in 
relation to the head of the family. Governing slaves, Aristotle 
says, is not like governing free beings; to govern a wife is to 
exercise a “political” authority in which relations are perma¬ 
nently unequal; in contrast, the governing of children can be 
called “royal” because it is based “on affection and seniority.” 1 
Indeed, the deliberative faculty is lacking in the slave; it is 
present in the woman, but she doesn’t exercise the decision-
