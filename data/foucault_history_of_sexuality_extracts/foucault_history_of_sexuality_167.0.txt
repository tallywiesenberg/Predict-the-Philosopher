their condition made them sexual objects and this was taken 
for granted—so much so that people could be astonished that 
the same law would forbid the rape of slaves and that of 
children. In order to explain this anomaly, Aeschines submits 
that the aim was to show, by prohibiting violence even in the 
case of slaves, what a serious thing it was when directed at 
children of good birth. As for the woman’s passivity, it did 
denote an inferiority of nature and condition; but there was no 
reason to criticize it as a behavior, precisely because it was in 
conformity with what nature intended and with what the law 
prescribed. On the other hand, everything in the way of sexual 
behavior that might cause a free man—to say nothing of some¬ 
one who, by birth, fortune, and prestige, held or should hold 
one of the first ranks among men—to bear the marks of inferi¬ 
ority, submission to domination, and acceptance of servitude, 
could only be considered as shameful: a shame that was even 
greater if he offered himself as the obliging object of another’s 
pleasure. 

Now, in a game regulated according to such principles, the 
position of the (freeborn) boy was difficult. To be sure, he was 
still in an “inferior” position in the sense that he was a long 
way from benefiting from the rights and powers that would be 
his when he attained the full enjoyment of his status. And yet 
his place was not assimilable to that of a slave, nor to that of 
a woman. This was true even in the context of the household 
and the family. A passage from Aristotle’s Politics makes this 
clear. Discussing the relations of authority and forms of gov¬ 
ernment that are appropriate for the family, Aristotle defines 
the positions of the slave, the wife, and the (male) child in 
relation to the head of the family. Governing slaves, Aristotle 
says, is not like governing free beings; to govern a wife is to 
exercise a “political” authority in which relations are perma¬ 
nently unequal; in contrast, the governing of children can be 
called “royal” because it is based “on affection and seniority.” 1 
Indeed, the deliberative faculty is lacking in the slave; it is 
present in the woman, but she doesn’t exercise the decision-

making function in her house; in the boy, the deficiency relates 
only to his incomplete development. And while the moral 
education of women is important, seeing that they constitute 
half the free population, that of male children is more so, for 
it concerns future citizens who will participate in the govern¬ 
ment of the city. 2 We can see, therefore, that the specific 
nature of the boy’s position, the particular form of his depen¬ 
dence, and the manner in which he is to be treated, even in 
the space where the considerable power of the patriarch is 
exercised, were marked by the status that would be his in 
future years. 

The same held true up to a point in the game of sexual 
relations. Among the various legitimate “objects,” the boy 
occupied a special position. He was definitely not a forbidden 
object; in Athens, certain laws protected free children (from 
adults, who at least for a time did not have the right to go into 
the schools; from slaves, who incurred the death penalty if 
they tried corrupting them; and from their fathers or tutors, 
who were punished if they prostituted them); 3 but nothing 
prevented or prohibited an adolescent from being the openly 
recognized sexual partner of a man. Yet there was a sort of 
intrinsic difficulty in this role: something that simultaneously 
made it hard to define clearly and specify exactly what the role 
implied in the sexual relation, and nonetheless drew attention 
to this point and made people attach much importance and 
value to what should or should not occur in that regard. All 
this constituted something of a blind spot and a point of 
overvaluation. The role of the boy was a focus of a good deal 
of uncertainty, combined with an intense interest. 

Aeschines, in Against Timarchus, makes use of a law that 
is very interesting in itself because it concerns the effects of 
civic and political disqualification that a man’s sexual miscon¬ 
duct—“prostitution” in the precise sense—could entail in that 
it would prohibit him from subsequently “becoming one of the 
nine archons or discharging the office of priest or acting as an 
advocate for the state.” An individual who had prostituted

himself was debarred from holding any magistracy in the city 
or abroad, be it elective or conferred by lot. He could not serve 
as a herald or ambassador, nor become a prosecutor of ambas¬ 
sadors or a paid slanderer.* Further, he could not address the
