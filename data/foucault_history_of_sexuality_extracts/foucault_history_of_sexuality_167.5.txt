education of women is important, seeing that they constitute 
half the free population, that of male children is more so, for 
it concerns future citizens who will participate in the govern¬ 
ment of the city. 2 We can see, therefore, that the specific 
nature of the boy’s position, the particular form of his depen¬ 
dence, and the manner in which he is to be treated, even in 
the space where the considerable power of the patriarch is 
exercised, were marked by the status that would be his in 
future years. 

The same held true up to a point in the game of sexual 
relations. Among the various legitimate “objects,” the boy 
occupied a special position. He was definitely not a forbidden 
object; in Athens, certain laws protected free children (from 
adults, who at least for a time did not have the right to go into 
the schools; from slaves, who incurred the death penalty if 
they tried corrupting them; and from their fathers or tutors, 
who were punished if they prostituted them); 3 but nothing 
prevented or prohibited an adolescent from being the openly 
recognized sexual partner of a man. Yet there was a sort of 
intrinsic difficulty in this role: something that simultaneously 
made it hard to define clearly and specify exactly what the role 
implied in the sexual relation, and nonetheless drew attention 
to this point and made people attach much importance and 
value to what should or should not occur in that regard. All 
this constituted something of a blind spot and a point of 
overvaluation. The role of the boy was a focus of a good deal 
of uncertainty, combined with an intense interest. 

Aeschines, in Against Timarchus, makes use of a law that 
is very interesting in itself because it concerns the effects of 
civic and political disqualification that a man’s sexual miscon¬ 
duct—“prostitution” in the precise sense—could entail in that 
it would prohibit him from subsequently “becoming one of the 
nine archons or discharging the office of priest or acting as an 
advocate for the state.” An individual who had prostituted

himself was debarred from holding any magistracy in the city

as a herald or ambassador, nor become a prosecutor of ambas¬
