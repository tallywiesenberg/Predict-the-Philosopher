it possible not only to establish the crime, but to compromise 
the adversary politically and in general. Perhaps Timarchus 
was not formally a professional prostitute, but he is definitely 
not one of those respectable men who make no secret of their 
taste for male loves and who maintain honorable relations 
with free boys, relations that are valuable to the young part¬ 
ner: Aeschines acknowledges that he is partial to this kind of 
love. He describes Timarchus as a man who in the course of 
his youth placed himself and showed himself to everyone, in 
the inferior and humiliating position of a pleasure object for 
others; he wanted this role, he sought it, took pleasure in it, 
and profited from it. And this is what Aeschines would have 
his audience see as morally and politically incompatible with 
civic responsibilities and the exercise of political power. A 
man who has been marked by this role which he was pleased 
to assume in his youth would not now be able to play, without 
provoking indignation, the role of a man who is over others 
in the city, who provides them with friends, counsels them in 
their decisions, leads them and represents them. What was 
hard for Athenians to accept—and this is the feeling that 
Aeschines tries to play upon in the speech against Timarchus 
—was not that they might be governed by someone who loved 
boys, or who as a youth was loved by a man; but that they 
might come under the authority of a leader who once iden¬ 
tified with the role of pleasure object for others. 

It is this feeling, moreover, that Aristophanes had appealed 
to so often in his comedies; the point of mockery and the thing 
that was meant to be scandalous were that these orators, these 
leaders who were followed and loved, these citizens who 
sought to seduce the people in order to rule over them, such 
as Cleon or Agyrrhius, were also individuals who had con¬ 
sented and still consented to play the role of passive, obliging

objects. And Aristophanes spoke ironically of an Athenian 
democracy where one’s chances of being heard in the assembly 
were greater the more one had a taste for pleasures of this 
sort . 7 In the same way and the same spirit, Diogenes made fun 
of Demosthenes and the morals he had while pretending to be 
the leader (demagogos) of the Athenian people . 8 When one 
played the role of subordinate partner in the game of pleasure 
relations, one could not be truly dominant in the game of civic
