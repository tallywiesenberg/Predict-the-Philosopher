and political activity. 

The extent to which these criticisms and satires may have 
been justified in reality matters little. There is at least one 
thing that they show clearly by their mere existence: namely, 
the difficulty caused, in this society that accepted sexual rela¬ 
tions between men, by the juxtaposition of an ethos of male 
superiority and a conception of all sexual intercourse in terms 
of the schema of penetration and male domination. The conse¬ 
quence of this was that on the one hand the “active” and 
dominant role was always assigned positive values, but on the 
other hand it was necessary to attribute to one of the partners 
in the sexual act the passive, dominated, and inferior position. 
And while this was no problem when it involved a woman or 
a slave, the case was altered when it involved a man. It is 
doubtless the existence of this difficulty that explains both the 
silence in which this relationship between adults was actually 
enveloped, and the noisy disqualification of those who broke 
this silence by declaring their acceptance of, or rather, their 
preference for this “subordinate” role. It was also in view of 
this difficulty that all the attention was concentrated on the 
relationship between men and boys, since in this case one of 
the two partners, owing to his youth and to the fact that he 
had not yet attained manly status, could be—for a period that 
everyone knew to be brief—an admissible object of pleasure. 
But while the boy, because of his peculiar charm, could be a 
prey that men might pursue without causing a scandal or a 
problem, one had to keep in mind that the day would come 
when he would have to be a man, to exercise powers and

responsibilities, so that obviously he could then no longer be 
an object of pleasure—but then, to what extent could he have 
been such an object? 

Hence the problem that we may call the “antinomy of the 
boy” in the Greek ethics of aphrodisia. On the one hand, 
young men were recognized as objects of pleasure—and even 
as the only honorable and legitimate objects among the possi¬ 
ble male partners of men: no one would ever reproach a man 
for loving a boy, for desiring and enjoying him, provided that 
the laws and proprieties were respected. But on the other 
hand, the boy, whose youth must be a training for manhood, 
could not and must not identify with that role. He could not 
of his own accord, in his own eyes, and for his own sake, be 
that object of pleasure, even though the man was quite natu¬ 
rally fond of appointing him as an object of pleasure. In short, 
to delight in and be a subject of pleasure with a boy did not 
cause a problem for the Greeks; but to be an object of pleasure 
and to acknowledge oneself as such constituted a major diffi¬ 
culty for the boy. The relationship that he was expected to 
establish with himself in order to become a free man, master 
of himself and capable of prevailing over others, was at vari¬ 
ance with a form of relationship in which he would be an 
object of pleasure for another. This noncoincidence was eth¬ 
ically necessary. 

Such a difference explains certain characteristic features of 
the Greeks’ reflection on the love of boys. 

In the first place, there was an oscillation—enigmatic for us 
-—concerning the natural or “unnatural” character of that 
type of love. On one side, it was held for granted that the 
attraction to boys was natural in just the same way as all 
movement that carried one in the direction of the beautiful 
was natural. And yet it is not unusual to find the assertion that 
relations between men, or more generally, between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex, is para physin, beside nature. Of 
course one can infer that these two views indicate two different 
attitudes, one favorable and the other hostile to that kind of

love. But the very possibility of these two opinions was proba¬ 
bly owing to the fact that while people deemed it quite natural 
that one might find pleasure with a boy, it was much harder 
to accept as natural that which made a boy an object of 
pleasure. So that one could take exception to the very act that 
was carried out between two male individuals on the grounds 
that it was para physin —because it feminized one of the part¬ 
ners, whereas the desire that one could have for beauty was 
nevertheless regarded as natural. The Cynics were not against 
the love of boys, even though they heaped sarcasm on all those 
boys whose passivity caused them to accept being estranged 
from their own nature, thus becoming “worse than they 
were.” 9 As for Plato, there is no reason to suppose that, having 
been a believer in male love as a youth, he later “got wise” to
