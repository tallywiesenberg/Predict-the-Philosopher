and political activity. 

The extent to which these criticisms and satires may have 
been justified in reality matters little. There is at least one 
thing that they show clearly by their mere existence: namely, 
the difficulty caused, in this society that accepted sexual rela¬ 
tions between men, by the juxtaposition of an ethos of male 
superiority and a conception of all sexual intercourse in terms 
of the schema of penetration and male domination. The conse¬ 
quence of this was that on the one hand the “active” and 
dominant role was always assigned positive values, but on the 
other hand it was necessary to attribute to one of the partners 
in the sexual act the passive, dominated, and inferior position. 
And while this was no problem when it involved a woman or 
a slave, the case was altered when it involved a man. It is 
doubtless the existence of this difficulty that explains both the 
silence in which this relationship between adults was actually 
enveloped, and the noisy disqualification of those who broke 
this silence by declaring their acceptance of, or rather, their 
preference for this “subordinate” role. It was also in view of 
this difficulty that all the attention was concentrated on the 
relationship between men and boys, since in this case one of 
the two partners, owing to his youth and to the fact that he 
had not yet attained manly status, could be—for a period that 
everyone knew to be brief—an admissible object of pleasure. 
But while the boy, because of his peculiar charm, could be a 
prey that men might pursue without causing a scandal or a 
problem, one had to keep in mind that the day would come 
when he would have to be a man, to exercise powers and

responsibilities, so that obviously he could then no longer be 
an object of pleasure—but then, to what extent could he have 
been such an object? 

Hence the problem that we may call the “antinomy of the 
boy” in the Greek ethics of aphrodisia. On the one hand, 
young men were recognized as objects of pleasure—and even 
as the only honorable and legitimate objects among the possi¬ 
ble male partners of men: no one would ever reproach a man 
for loving a boy, for desiring and enjoying him, provided that 
the laws and proprieties were respected. But on the other 
hand, the boy, whose youth must be a training for manhood,
