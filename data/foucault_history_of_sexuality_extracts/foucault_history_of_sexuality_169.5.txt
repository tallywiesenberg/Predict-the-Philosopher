could not and must not identify with that role. He could not 
of his own accord, in his own eyes, and for his own sake, be 
that object of pleasure, even though the man was quite natu¬ 
rally fond of appointing him as an object of pleasure. In short, 
to delight in and be a subject of pleasure with a boy did not 
cause a problem for the Greeks; but to be an object of pleasure 
and to acknowledge oneself as such constituted a major diffi¬ 
culty for the boy. The relationship that he was expected to 
establish with himself in order to become a free man, master 
of himself and capable of prevailing over others, was at vari¬ 
ance with a form of relationship in which he would be an 
object of pleasure for another. This noncoincidence was eth¬ 
ically necessary. 

Such a difference explains certain characteristic features of 
the Greeks’ reflection on the love of boys. 

In the first place, there was an oscillation—enigmatic for us 
-—concerning the natural or “unnatural” character of that 
type of love. On one side, it was held for granted that the 
attraction to boys was natural in just the same way as all 
movement that carried one in the direction of the beautiful 
was natural. And yet it is not unusual to find the assertion that 
relations between men, or more generally, between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex, is para physin, beside nature. Of 
course one can infer that these two views indicate two different 
attitudes, one favorable and the other hostile to that kind of

bly owing to the fact that while people deemed it quite natural 
that one might find pleasure with a boy, it was much harder 
to accept as natural that which made a boy an object of 
pleasure. So that one could take exception to the very act that 
was carried out between two male individuals on the grounds 
that it was para physin —because it feminized one of the part¬ 
ners, whereas the desire that one could have for beauty was 
nevertheless regarded as natural. The Cynics were not against 
the love of boys, even though they heaped sarcasm on all those 
boys whose passivity caused them to accept being estranged 
from their own nature, thus becoming “worse than they 
were.” 9 As for Plato, there is no reason to suppose that, having 
been a believer in male love as a youth, he later “got wise” to
