that the function of the power exerted in this instance was 
not that of interdiction, and that it involved four operations 
quite different from simple prohibition. 

1. Take the ancient prohibitions of consanguine marriages 
(as numerous and complex as they were) or the condemna¬ 
tion of adultery, with its inevitable frequency of occurrence; 
or on the other hand, the recent controls through which, 
since the nineteenth century, the sexuality of children has 
been subordinated and their “solitary habits” interfered 
with. It is clear that we are not dealing with one and the same 
power mechanism. Not only because in the one case it is a 
question of law and penality, and in the other, medicine and 
regimentation; but also because the tactics employed is not 
the same. On the surface, what appears in both cases is an 
effort at elimination that was always destined to fail and 
always constrained to begin again. But the prohibition of 
“incests” attempted to reach its objective through an asymp¬ 
totic decrease in the thing it condemned, whereas the control

of infantile sexuality hoped to reach it through a simulta¬ 
neous propagation of its own power and of the object on 
which it was brought to bear. It proceeded in accordance 
with a twofold increase extended indefinitely. Educators and 
doctors combatted children’s onanism like an epidemic that 
needed to be eradicated. What this actually entailed, 
throughout this whole secular campaign that mobilized the 
adult world around the sex of children, was using these 
tenuous pleasures as a prop, constituting them as secrets 
(that is, forcing them into hiding so as to make possible their 
discovery), tracing them back to their source, tracking them 
from their origins to their effects, searching out everything 
that might cause them or simply enable them to exist. Wher¬ 
ever there was the chance they might appear, devices of 
surveillance were installed; traps were laid for compelling 
admissions; inexhaustible and corrective discourses were im¬ 
posed; parents and teachers were alerted, and left with the 
suspicion that all children were guilty, and with the fear of 
being themselves at fault if their suspicions were not suffi¬ 
ciently strong; they were kept in readiness in the face of this 
recurrent danger; their conduct was prescribed and their 
pedagogy recodified; an entire medico-sexual regime took
