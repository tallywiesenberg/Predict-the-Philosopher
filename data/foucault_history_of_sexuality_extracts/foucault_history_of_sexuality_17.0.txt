that the function of the power exerted in this instance was 
not that of interdiction, and that it involved four operations 
quite different from simple prohibition. 

1. Take the ancient prohibitions of consanguine marriages 
(as numerous and complex as they were) or the condemna¬ 
tion of adultery, with its inevitable frequency of occurrence; 
or on the other hand, the recent controls through which, 
since the nineteenth century, the sexuality of children has 
been subordinated and their “solitary habits” interfered 
with. It is clear that we are not dealing with one and the same 
power mechanism. Not only because in the one case it is a 
question of law and penality, and in the other, medicine and 
regimentation; but also because the tactics employed is not 
the same. On the surface, what appears in both cases is an 
effort at elimination that was always destined to fail and 
always constrained to begin again. But the prohibition of 
“incests” attempted to reach its objective through an asymp¬ 
totic decrease in the thing it condemned, whereas the control

The History of Sexuality 


of infantile sexuality hoped to reach it through a simulta¬ 
neous propagation of its own power and of the object on 
which it was brought to bear. It proceeded in accordance 
with a twofold increase extended indefinitely. Educators and 
doctors combatted children’s onanism like an epidemic that 
needed to be eradicated. What this actually entailed, 
throughout this whole secular campaign that mobilized the 
adult world around the sex of children, was using these 
tenuous pleasures as a prop, constituting them as secrets 
(that is, forcing them into hiding so as to make possible their 
discovery), tracing them back to their source, tracking them 
from their origins to their effects, searching out everything 
that might cause them or simply enable them to exist. Wher¬ 
ever there was the chance they might appear, devices of 
surveillance were installed; traps were laid for compelling 
admissions; inexhaustible and corrective discourses were im¬ 
posed; parents and teachers were alerted, and left with the 
suspicion that all children were guilty, and with the fear of 
being themselves at fault if their suspicions were not suffi¬ 
ciently strong; they were kept in readiness in the face of this 
recurrent danger; their conduct was prescribed and their 
pedagogy recodified; an entire medico-sexual regime took 
hold of the family milieu. The child’s “vice” was not so much 
an enemy as a support; it may have been designated as the 
evil to be eliminated, but the extraordinary effort that went 
into the task that was bound to fail leads one to suspect that 
what was demanded of it was to persevere, to proliferate to 
the limits of the visible and the invisible, rather than to 
disappear for good. Always relying on this support, power 
advanced, multiplied its relays and its effects, while its target 
expanded, subdivided, and branched out, penetrating further 
into reality at the same pace. In appearance, we are dealing 
with a barrier system; but in fact, all around the child, indefi¬ 
nite lines of penetration were disposed. 

2. This new persecution of the peripheral sexualities en¬ 
tailed an incorporation of perversions and a new specification

of individuals. As defined by the ancient civil or canonical 
codes, sodomy was a category of forbidden acts; their perpe¬ 
trator was nothing more than the juridical subject of them. 
The nineteenth-century homosexual became a personage, a 
past, a case history, and a childhood, in addition to being a 
type of life, a life form, and a morphology, with an indiscreet 
anatomy and possibly a mysterious physiology. Nothing that 
went into his total composition was unaff ected by his sexual¬ 
ity. It was everywhere present in him: at the root of all his 
actions because it was their insidious and indefinitely active 
principle; written immodestly on his face and body because 
it was a secret that always gave itself away. It was consub- 
stantial with him, less as a habitual sin than as a singular 
nature. We must not forget that the psychological, psychiat¬ 
ric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from 
the moment it was characterized—Westphal’s famous article 
of 1870 on “contrary sexual sensations” can stand as its date 
of birth 1 —less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain 
quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the 
masculine and the feminine in oneself. Homosexuality ap¬ 
peared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was tran¬ 
sposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior 
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had 
been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a 
species.
