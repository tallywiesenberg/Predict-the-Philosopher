Their stability is also rather re¬ 
markable; the notable proliferation of codifications (concern¬ 
ing permitted or forbidden places, partners, and acts) 
occurred rather late in Christianity.On the other hand, it 
appears—at any rate this is the hypothesis I would like to 
explore here—that there is a whole rich and complex field of 
historicity in the way the individual is summoned to recognize 
himself as an ethical subject of sexual conduct.This will be a 
matter of seeing how that subjectivation was defined and 
transformed, from classical Greek thought up to the formula¬ 
tion of the Christian doctrine and pastoral ministry regarding 
the flesh.In this volume, I would like to take note of some general 
traits that characterized the way in which sexual behavior was 
considered by classical Greek thought as a domain of moral 
valuation and choice.I will start from the then common no¬ 
tion of “use of the pleasures ”—chresis aphrodision —and at¬ 
tempt to determine the modes of subjectivation to which it 
referred: the ethical substance, the types of subjection, the 
forms of elaboration of the self, and the moral teleology.
