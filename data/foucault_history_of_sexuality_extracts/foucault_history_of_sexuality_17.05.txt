Then, 
starting each time from a practice whose existence, status, and 
rules were native to Greek culture (the practice of the health 
regimen, that of household management, that of courtship), I 
will study the way in which medical and philosophical 
thought worked out this “use of the pleasures,” formulating 
several recurrent themes of austerity that would center on 
four great axes of experience: the relation to one’s body, the 
relation to one’s wife, the relation to boys, and the rela¬ 
tion to truth.PART ONE 


The Moral 
Pro b lema tization 
of Pleasures 





One would have a difficult time finding among the Greeks 
(or the Romans either, for that matter) anything resembling 
the notion of “sexuality” or “flesh.” I mean a notion that 
refers to a single entity and allows diverse phenomena to be 
grouped together, despite the apparently loose connections 
between them, as if they were of the same nature, derived from 
the same origin, or brought the same type of causal mech¬ 
anisms into play: behaviors, but also sensations, images, 
desires, instincts, passions.1 

Of course the Greeks had a whole stock of words available 
for designating different actions or acts that we call “sexual.” 
They had a vocabulary for referring to specific practices; they 
had vaguer terms that referred in a general way to what we 
call sexual “intercourse,” “union,” or “relations”: for exam¬ 
ple, synousia, homilia, plesiasmos, mixis, ocheia.But the blan¬ 
ket category that covered all these actions, acts, and practices 
is much more difficult to grasp.The Greeks were fond of using 
a nominalized adjective: ta aphrodisia, 2 which the Romans 
translated roughly as venerea.
