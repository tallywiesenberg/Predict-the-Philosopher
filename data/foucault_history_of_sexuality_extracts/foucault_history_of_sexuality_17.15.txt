Preliminary 
to studying the four types of stylization of sexual conduct that 
were developed in a dietetics concerned with the body, an 
economics concerned with marriage, an erotics concerned 
with the subject of boys, and a philosophy concerned with 
truth, I intend simply to bring out a few general traits that 
served as a framework for them, seeing that these traits were 
common to the different reflections on the aphrodisia.One can 
grant the familiar proposition that the Greeks of that epoch 
accepted certain sexual behaviors much more readily than the 
Christians of the Middle Ages or the Europeans of the modern 
period; one can also grant that laxity and misconduct in this 
regard provoked less scandal back then and made one liable 
to less recrimination, especially as there was no institution— 
whether pastoral or medical—that claimed the right to deter¬ 
mine what was permitted or forbidden, normal or abnormal, 
in this area; one can also grant that the Greeks attributed 
much less importance to all these questions than we do.But 
once all that is granted or assumed, one point still remains 
irreducible: they nonetheless concerned themselves with such 
matters, and there were Greek thinkers, moralists, philoso¬ 
phers, and doctors who believed that what the laws of the city 
prescribed or prohibited, what the general customs tolerated 
or rejected, could not suffice to regulate properly the sexual 
conduct of a man who cared about himself.The manner in 
which this kind of pleasure was enjoyed was considered by 
them to be an ethical problem.What I would like to define in the next few pages are just 
those general aspects which their preoccupation with these 
questions shared; that is, the general form of the moral inquiry 
that they pursued concerning the aphrodisia.
