And for this we 
will need to consult texts that are radically different from one 
another—essentially those of Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle.The Moral Problematizalion of Pleasures 


37 


I will attempt to restore, not the “doctrinal context” that 
might give each one its peculiar meaning and its differential 
value, but rather the “field of problematization” that they had 
in common and that made each of them possible.The object, 
therefore, will be to elicit, in its general features, the constitu¬ 
tion of the aphrodisia as a domain of moral concern.I will 
consider four notions that are often encountered in the reflec¬ 
tion on sexual ethics: the notion of aphrodisia, through which 
one can grasp what was recognized as the “ethical substance” 
in sexual behavior; the notion of “use,” of chresis, which 
allows one to perceive the type of subjection that the practice 
of pleasures had to undergo in order to be morally valorized; 
the notion of enkrateia, of mastery, that defines the attitude 
that was required with respect to oneself in order to make 
oneself into an ethical subject; and lastly, the notion of “mod¬ 
eration,” of sophrosyne, that characterized the ethical subject 
in his fulfillment.It should thus be possible to determine what 
structured the moral experience of sexual pleasures—its on¬ 
tology, its deontology, its ascetics, its teleology.
