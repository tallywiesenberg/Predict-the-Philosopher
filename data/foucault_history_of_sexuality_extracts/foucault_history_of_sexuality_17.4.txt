1.The aphrodisia are the acts, gestures, and contacts that 
produce a certain form of pleasure.When Saint Augustine in 
his Confessions recalls the friendships of his youth, the inten¬ 
sity of his affections, the pleasures of the days spent together, 
the conversations, the enthusiasms and good times, he won¬ 
ders if, underneath its seeming innocence, all that did not 
pertain to the flesh, to that “glue” which attaches us to the 
flesh.4 But when Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics wants to 
determine exactly which people deserve to be called “self- 
indulgent,” his definition is cautiously restrictive: self-indul¬ 
gence— akolasia —relates only to the pleasures of the body; 
and among these, the pleasures of sight, hearing, and smell 
must be excluded.5 It is not self-indulgent to “delight in” 
(charein) colors, shapes, or paintings, nor in theater or music; 
one can, without self-indulgence, delight in the scent of fruit, 
roses, or incense; and, he says in the Eudemian Ethics, 6 any¬ 
one who would become so intensely absorbed in looking at a 
statue or in listening to a song as to lose his appetite or taste 
for lovemaking could not be reproached for self-indulgence, 
any more than could someone who let himself be seduced by 
the Sirens.
