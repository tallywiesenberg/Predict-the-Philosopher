For there is pleasure that is liable to akolasia only 
where there is touch and contact: contact with the mouth, the 
tongue, and the throat (for the pleasures of food and drink), 
or contact with other parts of the body (for the pleasure of 
sex).Moreover, Aristotle remarks that it would be unjust to 
suspect self-indulgence in the case of certain pleasures ex¬ 
perienced on the surface of the body, such as the noble pleas¬ 
ures that are produced by massages and heat in the 
gymnasium: “for the contact characteristic of the self-indul¬

more important as this power has the ability to cloak itself in 
many forms other than sexual acts.There is no similar suspi¬ 
cion inhabiting the experience of the aphrodisia.To be sure, 
in the teaching and the exercise of moderation, it is recom¬ 
mended to be wary of sounds, images, and scents; but this is 
not because attachment to them would be only the masked 
form of a desire whose essence is sexual: it is because there are 
musical forms capable of weakening the soul with their 
rhythms, and because there are sights capable of affecting the 
soul like a venom, and because a particular scent, a particular 
image, is apt to call up the “memory of the thing desired.” 9 
And when philosophers are laughed at for claiming to love 
only the beautiful souls of boys, they are not suspected of 
harboring murky feelings of which they may not be conscious, 
but simply of waiting for the tete-a-tete in order to slip their 
hand under the tunic of their heart’s desire.
