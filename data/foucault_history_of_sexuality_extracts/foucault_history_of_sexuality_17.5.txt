hold of the family milieu. The child’s “vice” was not so much 
an enemy as a support; it may have been designated as the 
evil to be eliminated, but the extraordinary effort that went 
into the task that was bound to fail leads one to suspect that 
what was demanded of it was to persevere, to proliferate to 
the limits of the visible and the invisible, rather than to 
disappear for good. Always relying on this support, power 
advanced, multiplied its relays and its effects, while its target 
expanded, subdivided, and branched out, penetrating further 
into reality at the same pace. In appearance, we are dealing 
with a barrier system; but in fact, all around the child, indefi¬ 
nite lines of penetration were disposed.

of individuals. As defined by the ancient civil or canonical 
codes, sodomy was a category of forbidden acts; their perpe¬ 
trator was nothing more than the juridical subject of them. 
The nineteenth-century homosexual became a personage, a 
past, a case history, and a childhood, in addition to being a 
type of life, a life form, and a morphology, with an indiscreet 
anatomy and possibly a mysterious physiology. Nothing that 
went into his total composition was unaff ected by his sexual¬ 
ity. It was everywhere present in him: at the root of all his 
actions because it was their insidious and indefinitely active 
principle; written immodestly on his face and body because 
it was a secret that always gave itself away. It was consub- 
stantial with him, less as a habitual sin than as a singular 
nature. We must not forget that the psychological, psychiat¬ 
ric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from 
the moment it was characterized—Westphal’s famous article 
of 1870 on “contrary sexual sensations” can stand as its date 
of birth 1 —less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain 
quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the 
masculine and the feminine in oneself. Homosexuality ap¬ 
peared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was tran¬ 
sposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior 
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had 
been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a 
species.
