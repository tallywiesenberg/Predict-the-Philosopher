What of the form and variety of these acts?Greek natural 
history gives some descriptions, at least as concerns animals: 
Aristotle remarks that mating is not the same among all ani¬ 
mals and does not take place in the same manner."And in the 
part of Book VI of the History of Animals that deals more 
specifically with viviparous animals, he describes the different 
forms of copulation that can be observed: they vary according 
to the form and location of the organs, the position taken by 
the partners, and the duration of the act.But he also evokes 
the types of behavior that characterize the mating season: wild 

of the gaze is self-indulgent; rather, it is thought to make an opening through which 
the soul is reached.In this connection, see Xenophon’s Memorabilia.
