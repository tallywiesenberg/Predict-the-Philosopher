It is not that people were careful to avoid 
talking about these pleasurable acts; but when they were the 
subject of questioning, what was at issue was not the form they 
assumed, it was the activity they manifested.Their dynamics 
was much more important than their morphology.This dynamics was defined by the movement that linked the 
aphrodisia to the pleasure that was associated with them and 
to the desire to which they gave rise.The attraction exerted 
by pleasure and the force of the desire that was directed to¬ 
ward it constituted, together with the action of the aphrodisia 
itself, a solid unity.The dissociation—or partial dissociation 
at least—of this ensemble would later become one of the basic 
features of the ethics of the flesh and the notion of sexuality.
