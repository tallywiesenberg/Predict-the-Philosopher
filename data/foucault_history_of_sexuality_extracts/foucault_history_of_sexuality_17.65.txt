This dissociation was to be marked, on the one hand, by a 
certain “elision” of pleasure (a moral devaluation through the 
injunction given in the preaching by the Christian clergy 
against the pursuit of sensual pleasure as a goal of sexual 
practice; a theoretical devaluation shown by the extreme diffi¬ 
culty of finding a place for pleasure in the conception of sexu¬ 
ality); it would also be marked by an increasingly intense 
problematization of desire (in which the primordial sign of a 
fallen nature or the structure characteristic of the human 
condition would be visible).In the experience of the aphrodisia 
on the other hand, act, desire, and pleasure formed an ensem¬ 
ble whose elements were distinguishable certainly, but closely 
bound to one another.It was precisely their close linkage that 
constituted one of the essential characteristics of that form of

the performance of the act be associated with a pleasure, and 
it was this pleasure that gave rise to epithumia, to desire, in 
a movement that was naturally directed toward what “gives 
pleasure,” according to a principle that Aristotle cites: desire 
is always “desire for the agreeable thing” (he gar epithumia 
tou hedeos estin).13 It is true—Plato always comes back to the 
idea—that for the Greeks there could not be desire without 
privation, without the want of the thing desired and without 
a certain amount of suffering mixed in; but the appetite, Plato 
explains in the Philebus, can be aroused only by the represen¬ 
tation, the image or the memory of the thing that gives pleas¬ 
ure; he concludes that there can be no desire except in the soul, 
for while the body is affected by privation, it is the soul and 
only the soul that can, through memory, make present the 
thing that is to be desired and thereby arouse the epithumia .
