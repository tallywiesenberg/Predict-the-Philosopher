Thus, what seems in fact to have formed the object of moral 
reflection for the Greeks in matters of sexual conduct was not 
exactly the act itself (considered in its different modalities), or 
desire (viewed from the standpoint of its origin or its aim), or 
even pleasure (evaluated according to the different objects or 
practices that can cause it); it was more the dynamics that 
joined all three in a circular fashion (the desire that leads to 
the act, the act that is linked to pleasure, and the pleasure that 
occasions desire).The ethical question that was raised was 
not: which desires?which acts?which pleasures?but rather: 
with what force is one transported “by the pleasures and 
desires”?
