What 
differentiates men from one another, for medicine and moral 
philosophy alike, is not so much the type of objects toward 
which they are oriented, nor the mode of sexual practice they 
prefer; above all, it is the intensity of that practice.The divi¬ 
sion is between lesser and greater: moderation or excess.It is 
rather rare, when a notable personage is depicted, for his 
preference for one form of sexual practice or another to be 
pointed up.* On the other hand, it is always important for his 
moral characterization to note whether he has been able to 
show moderation in his involvement with women or boys, like 
Agesilaus, who carried moderation to the point that he refused 
to kiss the young man that he loved; or whether he surrend¬ 
ered, like Alcibiades or Arcesilaus, to the appetite for the 
pleasures that one can enjoy with both sexes.18 This point is 
supported by the famous passage of the first book of the Laws: 
it is true that Plato draws a sharp opposition in this passage 
between the relationship “according to nature” that joins man 
and woman for procreative ends, and relations “against na¬ 
ture” of male with male and female with female.
