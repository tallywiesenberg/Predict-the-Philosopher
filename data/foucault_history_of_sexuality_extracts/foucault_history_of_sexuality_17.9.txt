Xenophon does this in the Anabasis, in regard to a certain 
Episthenes.But when he draws a negative portrait of Menon, he does not reproach 
him for this kind of taste, but for misusing such pleasures: obtaining a command too 
young, or loving an overage boy while still being beardless himself .17 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

self-restraint with regard to pleasure” (akrateia hedones) is 
their source .20 And when, in the Timaeus, Plato declares that 
lust should be considered as the effect, not of a bad volition 
of the soul, but of a sickness of the body, this disorder is 
described in terms of a grand pathology of excess: the sperm, 
instead of remaining enclosed in the marrow and its bony 
casing, overflows and starts to stream through the whole body, 
so that the latter becomes like a tree whose vegetative power 
exceeds all limits; the individual is thus driven to distraction 
for a large part of his existence by “pleasures and pains in 
excess .” 21 This idea that immorality in the pleasures of sex is 
always connected with exaggeration, surplus, and excess is 
found again in the third book of the Nicomachean Ethics: 
Aristotle explains that for the natural desires that are common 
to everyone, the only offenses that one can commit are quan¬ 
titative in nature: they pertain to “the more” (to pleion); so 
that natural desire only consists in satisfying needs, “to eat or 
drink whatever offers itself till one is surfeited is to exceed the 
natural amount [ toi plethei ].” It is true that Aristotle also 
makes allowance for the particular pleasures of individuals.It 
happens that people commit different types of offenses, either 
by not taking their pleasure “where they should,” or by behav¬ 
ing “like the crowd,” or again, by not taking their pleasure “as 
they ought.” But, Aristotle adds, “self-indulgent individuals 
exceed [ hyperballousi ] in all these ways; they both delight in 
some things that they ought not to delight in, and if one ought 
to delight in some of the things they delight in, they do so 
more than one ought and than most men do.” What consti¬ 
tutes self-indulgence in this sphere is excess, “and that is 
culpable.” 22 * It appears, then, that the primary dividing 
line laid down by moral judgment in the area of sexual behav¬ 
ior was not prescribed by the nature of the act, with its possi¬ 
ble variations, but by the activity and its quantitative 
gradations.
