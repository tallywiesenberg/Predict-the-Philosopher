*It should be noted, however, that Aristotle gives his attention on several occasions 
to the question of the “disgraceful pleasures" that some individuals tend to seek.*’

The Use of Pleasure 


The practice of the pleasures was also related to another 
variable that might be labeled “role or polarity specific.” Cor¬ 
responding to the term aphrodisia was the verb aphrodisiazein.It refers to sexual activity in general: people thus spoke of the 
moment when animals reached an age at which they were 
capable of aphrodisiazein.24 It also denotes the accomplish¬ 
ment of a sexual act of any kind: thus, in Xenophon, Antis- 
thenes mentions the desire to aphrodisiazein, which he 
sometimes has.25 But the verb can also be employed in its 
active sense, in which case it relates specifically to the so-called 
“masculine” role in intercourse, and to the active function 
defined by penetration.
