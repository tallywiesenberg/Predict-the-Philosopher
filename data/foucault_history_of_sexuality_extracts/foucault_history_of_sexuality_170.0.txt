the extent that he condemned it as being a relationship “con¬ 
trary to nature.” It should be noted, rather, that at the begin¬ 
ning of the Lam, when he draws a contrast between relations 
with women as an element of nature and relations between 
men (or between women) as an effect of incontinence 
(akrasia), he is referring to the act of copulation itself (pro¬ 
vided for by nature for procreation) and he is thinking of 
institutions that are likely to promote or on the other hand 
pervert citizens’ morals. 10 Similarly, in the passage from Book 
VIII where he foresees the need—and the difficulty—of a law 
concerning sexual relations, the arguments he puts forward 
have to do with the harmfulness of “using” men and boys 
“like females” in sexual intercourse (mixis aphrodision): in the 
one seduced, how might a “courageous, manly disposition [to 
tes andreias ethos] be formed? And in the seducer, what would 
nurture “the offspring of the idea of a moderate man”? “Ev¬ 
eryone blames the softness of the one who gives in to the 
pleasures and is incapable of mastering them,” and “reproves 
the resemblance in image of the one who undertakes the imita¬ 
tion of the female.” 11 * 

*In the Phaedrus, the physical form of the relation where a man behaves like a 
"four-footed beast” is said to be “unnatural.””

The problem of considering the boy as an object of pleasure 
was also manifested by a noticeable reticence on several 
points. There was a reluctance to evoke directly and in so 
many words the role of the boy in sexual intercourse: some¬ 
times quite general expressions are employed, such as “to do 
the thing” (diaprattesthai to pragma); l} other times the 
“thing” is designated by the very impossibility of naming it; 14 
or again—and this is what says most about the problem posed 
by the relation—people resorted to metaphorical terms that 
were “agnostic” or political: “to yield,” to “submit” (hype- 
retein), “to render a service” (therapeuein, hypourgein ). 15 

But there was also a reluctance to concede that the boy 
might experience pleasure. This “denial” should be interpre¬ 
ted both as the affirmation that such a pleasure could not exist 
and as the prescription that it ought not to be experienced. 
Having to explain why love so often turns into hatred when 
it is mediated by physical relations, Socrates, in Xenophon’s
