Symposium, speaks of the unpleasant feelings that may arise 
in a youth because of his relationship (homilein) with an aging 
man. But he immediately adds as a general principle: “A 
youth does not share in the pleasure of the intercourse as a 
woman does, but looks on, sober, at another in love’s intoxica¬ 
tion.” 16 Between the man and the boy, there is not—there 
cannot and should not be—a community of pleasure. The 
author of the Problems admits the possibility only for a few 
individuals and only in the case of an anatomical irregularity. 
And no one was more severely criticized than boys who 
showed by their willingness to yield, by their many relation¬ 
ships, or by their dress, their makeup, their adornments or 
their perfumes, that they might enjoy playing that role. 

Which does not mean, however, that when the boy hap¬ 
pened to give in, he had to do it coldly somehow. On the 
contrary, he was supposed to yield only if he had feelings of 
admiration, gratitude, or affection for his lover, which made 
him want to please the latter. The verb charizesthai was com¬ 
monly employed in order to indicate the fact that the boy

that there was something other than a simple “surrender” by 
the beloved to the lover; the youth “granted his favors” 
through a movement that yielded to a desire and a demand on 
the part of the other, but was not of the same nature. It was 
a response; it was not the sharing of a sensation. The boy was 
not supposed to experience a physical pleasure; he was not 
even supposed quite to take pleasure in the man’s pleasure; he 
was supposed to feel pleased about giving pleasure to the 
other, provided he yielded when he should—that is, not too 
hastily, nor too reluctantly either. 

Sexual relations thus demanded particular behaviors on the 
part of both partners. A consequence of the fact that the boy 
could not identify with the part he had to play; he was sup¬ 
posed to refuse, resist, flee, escape. 18 He was also supposed to 
make his consent, if he finally gave it, subject to conditions 
relating to the man to whom he yielded (his merit, his status, 
his virtue) and to the benefit he could expect to gain from him 
(a benefit that was rather shameful if it was only a question 
of money, but honorable if it involved training for manhood,
