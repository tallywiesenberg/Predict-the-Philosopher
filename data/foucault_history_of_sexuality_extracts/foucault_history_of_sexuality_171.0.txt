social connections for the future, or a lasting friendship). And 
in fact it was benefits of this kind that the lover was supposed 
to be able to provide, in addition to the customary gifts, which 
depended more on status considerations (and whose impor¬ 
tance and value varied with the condition of the partners). So 
that the sexual act, in the relation between a man and a boy, 
needed to be taken up in a game of refusals, evasions, and 
escapes that tended to postpone it as long as possible, but also 
in a process of exchanges that determined the right time and 
the right conditions for it to take place. 

Thus, the boy was expected to give—out of kindness and 
hence not for his own pleasure—something that his partner 
sought with a view to the pleasure he would enjoy; but the 
partner could not rightfully ask for it without a matching offer 
of presents, services, promises, and commitments that were 
altogether different in nature from the “gift” that was made

to him. Which explains that tendency which was so visibly 
marked in Greek reflection on the love of boys: how was this 
relation to be integrated into a larger whole and enabled to 
transform itself into another type of relationship, a stable 
relationship where physical relations would no longer be im¬ 
portant and where the two partners would be able to share the 
same feelings and the same possessions? The love of boys 
could not be morally honorable unless it comprised (as a result 
of the reasonable gifts and services of the lover and the re¬ 
served compliance of the beloved) the elements that would 
form the basis of a transformation of this love into a definitive 
and socially valuable tie, that of philia. 

One would be quite mistaken to think that since the Greeks 
did not prohibit this kind of relationship, they did not worry 
about its implications. It “interested” them more than any 
other sexual relation, and there is every indication that they 
were anxious about it. But we can say that in a thinking such 
as ours, the relationship between two individuals of the same 
sex is questioned primarily from the viewpoint of the subject 
of desire: how can it be that in a man a desire forms whose 
object is another man? And we know very well that it is in a 
certain structuring of this desire (in its ambivalence, or in 
what it lacks) that the rudiments of an answer will be sought. 
The preoccupation of the Greeks, on the other hand, did not 
concern the desire that might incline an individual to this kind 
of relationship, nor did it concern the subject of this desire; 
their anxiety was focused on the object of pleasure, or more 
precisely, on that object insofar as he would have to become 
in turn the master in the pleasure that was enjoyed with others 
and in the power that was exercised over oneself. 

It was here, at this point of problematization (how to make 
the object of pleasure into a subject who was in control of his 
pleasures), that philosophical erotics, or in any case Socratic- 
Platonic reflection on love, was to take its point of departure. 




PART FIVE 

True Love 





Erotics, as a purposeful art of love (the love of boys in 
particular), will be our topic in this section as well. But this 
time it will be treated as a developmental context for the 
fourth of the great austerity themes that have run through the 
ethics of pleasure over the entire course of its history in the 
Western world. After the relation to the body and to health, 
after the relation to wives and to the institution of marriage, 
and after the relation to boys, to their freedom and their 
virility—three motifs in the problematization of sexual activ¬ 
ity—I would like now to consider the relation to truth. For it 
is one of the most remarkable aspects of Greek reflection on 
the love of boys that not only does it show how—for reasons 
we have seen—this love constituted a sensitive point that de¬ 
manded an elaboration of behavior and a rather delicate styli¬ 
zation of the use of the aphrodisia, but it was around this issue 
that the question of the relations between the use of pleasures 
and access to truth was developed, in the form of an inquiry 
into the nature of true love. 

In the Christian and modern cultures these same questions 
—of truth, of love, and of pleasure—were to be framed, rather, 
in terms of the constituent elements of the man-woman rela¬ 
tionship: the themes of virginity, of spiritual matrimony, of 
the soul-wife soon marked the shift from a basically masculine 
scene—occupied by the erastes and the eromenos —to one 
dominated by the figures of femininity and of the relationship
