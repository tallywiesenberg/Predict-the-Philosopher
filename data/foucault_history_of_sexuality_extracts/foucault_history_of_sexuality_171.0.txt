social connections for the future, or a lasting friendship). And 
in fact it was benefits of this kind that the lover was supposed 
to be able to provide, in addition to the customary gifts, which 
depended more on status considerations (and whose impor¬ 
tance and value varied with the condition of the partners). So 
that the sexual act, in the relation between a man and a boy, 
needed to be taken up in a game of refusals, evasions, and 
escapes that tended to postpone it as long as possible, but also 
in a process of exchanges that determined the right time and 
the right conditions for it to take place. 

Thus, the boy was expected to give—out of kindness and 
hence not for his own pleasure—something that his partner 
sought with a view to the pleasure he would enjoy; but the 
partner could not rightfully ask for it without a matching offer 
of presents, services, promises, and commitments that were 
altogether different in nature from the “gift” that was made

to him. Which explains that tendency which was so visibly 
marked in Greek reflection on the love of boys: how was this 
relation to be integrated into a larger whole and enabled to 
transform itself into another type of relationship, a stable 
relationship where physical relations would no longer be im¬ 
portant and where the two partners would be able to share the 
same feelings and the same possessions? The love of boys 
could not be morally honorable unless it comprised (as a result 
of the reasonable gifts and services of the lover and the re¬ 
served compliance of the beloved) the elements that would 
form the basis of a transformation of this love into a definitive 
and socially valuable tie, that of philia. 

One would be quite mistaken to think that since the Greeks 
did not prohibit this kind of relationship, they did not worry 
about its implications. It “interested” them more than any 
other sexual relation, and there is every indication that they 
were anxious about it. But we can say that in a thinking such 
as ours, the relationship between two individuals of the same 
sex is questioned primarily from the viewpoint of the subject 
of desire: how can it be that in a man a desire forms whose 
object is another man? And we know very well that it is in a 
certain structuring of this desire (in its ambivalence, or in 
what it lacks) that the rudiments of an answer will be sought.
