The preoccupation of the Greeks, on the other hand, did not 
concern the desire that might incline an individual to this kind 
of relationship, nor did it concern the subject of this desire; 
their anxiety was focused on the object of pleasure, or more 
precisely, on that object insofar as he would have to become 
in turn the master in the pleasure that was enjoyed with others 
and in the power that was exercised over oneself. 

It was here, at this point of problematization (how to make 
the object of pleasure into a subject who was in control of his 
pleasures), that philosophical erotics, or in any case Socratic- 
Platonic reflection on love, was to take its point of departure. 




PART FIVE 

True Love 





Erotics, as a purposeful art of love (the love of boys in 
particular), will be our topic in this section as well. But this 
time it will be treated as a developmental context for the 
fourth of the great austerity themes that have run through the 
ethics of pleasure over the entire course of its history in the 
Western world. After the relation to the body and to health, 
after the relation to wives and to the institution of marriage, 
and after the relation to boys, to their freedom and their 
virility—three motifs in the problematization of sexual activ¬ 
ity—I would like now to consider the relation to truth. For it 
is one of the most remarkable aspects of Greek reflection on 
the love of boys that not only does it show how—for reasons 
we have seen—this love constituted a sensitive point that de¬ 
manded an elaboration of behavior and a rather delicate styli¬ 
zation of the use of the aphrodisia, but it was around this issue 
that the question of the relations between the use of pleasures 
and access to truth was developed, in the form of an inquiry 
into the nature of true love. 

In the Christian and modern cultures these same questions 
—of truth, of love, and of pleasure—were to be framed, rather, 
in terms of the constituent elements of the man-woman rela¬ 
tionship: the themes of virginity, of spiritual matrimony, of 
the soul-wife soon marked the shift from a basically masculine 
scene—occupied by the erastes and the eromenos —to one 
dominated by the figures of femininity and of the relationship
