access, to knowledge would be linked to the theme of love for

The Use of Pleasure 


woman, for her virginity, her purity, her fall, and her redemp¬ 
tive power. With the Greeks, on the other hand, reflection on 
the reciprocal ties between access to truth and sexual austerity 
seems to have been developed primarily in connection with the 
love of boys. Of course we have to make allowance for the fact 
that little has survived of the things that may have been said 
and recommended, in the Pythagorean circles of the period, 
concerning the relations between purity and knowledge. We 
also have to allow for the fact that we do not have the treatises 
on love that were written by Antisthenes, Diogenes the Cynic, 
Aristotle, or Theophrastus. It would be unwise, therefore, to 
generalize the particular features of the Socratic-Platonic doc¬ 
trine, as if the latter provided a compendium of all the forms 
the philosophy of Eros may have taken in classical Greece. All 
the same, it did remain a pole of reflection for a very long time, 
as texts such as Plutarch’s dialogue, Lucian’s Affairs of the 
Heart, or the speeches of Maximus of Tyre show very well. 

As it appears in the Symposium or the Phaedrus in any case, 
and considering the references it makes to other ways of dis¬ 
coursing on love, we can see the distance that separates this 
doctrine from the ordinary erotics that posed questions con¬ 
cerning the reciprocal good behavior of the young man and his 
suitor, and concerning the way in which behavior could accord 
with honor. We can also see how, while being deeply rooted in 
the habitual themes of the ethics of pleasure, it broached 
questions that would later have a very great importance for the 
transformation of this ethics into a morality of renunciation 
and for the constitution of a hermeneutics of desire. 

An entire large section of the Symposium and of the Phae¬ 
drus is devoted to the “reproduction”—imitation or pastiche 
—of what was customarily said in speeches on love. The “ref¬
