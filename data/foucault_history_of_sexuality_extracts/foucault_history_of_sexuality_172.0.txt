between the two sexes.* Much later, Faust would be an exam¬ 
ple of the way in which the question of pleasure and that of 
access, to knowledge would be linked to the theme of love for

The Use of Pleasure 


woman, for her virginity, her purity, her fall, and her redemp¬ 
tive power. With the Greeks, on the other hand, reflection on 
the reciprocal ties between access to truth and sexual austerity 
seems to have been developed primarily in connection with the 
love of boys. Of course we have to make allowance for the fact 
that little has survived of the things that may have been said 
and recommended, in the Pythagorean circles of the period, 
concerning the relations between purity and knowledge. We 
also have to allow for the fact that we do not have the treatises 
on love that were written by Antisthenes, Diogenes the Cynic, 
Aristotle, or Theophrastus. It would be unwise, therefore, to 
generalize the particular features of the Socratic-Platonic doc¬ 
trine, as if the latter provided a compendium of all the forms 
the philosophy of Eros may have taken in classical Greece. All 
the same, it did remain a pole of reflection for a very long time, 
as texts such as Plutarch’s dialogue, Lucian’s Affairs of the 
Heart, or the speeches of Maximus of Tyre show very well. 

As it appears in the Symposium or the Phaedrus in any case, 
and considering the references it makes to other ways of dis¬ 
coursing on love, we can see the distance that separates this 
doctrine from the ordinary erotics that posed questions con¬ 
cerning the reciprocal good behavior of the young man and his 
suitor, and concerning the way in which behavior could accord 
with honor. We can also see how, while being deeply rooted in 
the habitual themes of the ethics of pleasure, it broached 
questions that would later have a very great importance for the 
transformation of this ethics into a morality of renunciation 
and for the constitution of a hermeneutics of desire. 

An entire large section of the Symposium and of the Phae¬ 
drus is devoted to the “reproduction”—imitation or pastiche 
—of what was customarily said in speeches on love. The “ref¬ 
erence speeches” of Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus, and 
Agathon in the Symposium; that of Lysias in the Phaedrus; 
and the first counter-speech by Socrates are of this type. They 
illuminate the background of the Platonic doctrine, the raw 
material that Plato elaborates and transforms when he re-

places the problematics of “courtship” and honor with that of 
truth and ascesis. In these reference speeches, one element is 
essential: through the praise of love, of its power and its divin¬ 
ity, the question of consent comes up again and again: should 
the young man yield? To whom? In what conditions and with 
what guarantees? And can the individual who loves him jus¬ 
tifiably hope to see him yield easily? A question characteristic 
of an erotics conceived as an art of give and take between the 
one who courts and the one who is courted. 

It is this question that appears in the form of an absolutely 
general and amusingly tautological principle in the first speech 
of the Symposium at Agathon’s house: “shame [aischyne] at 
what is disgraceful [aischrois] and ambition for what is 
noble”; 2 but Pausanias immediately takes up the principle in 
a more serious way, differentiating between two loves, the one 
“whose only aim is the satisfaction of its desires,” and the 
other which desires above all to test the soul. 3 We may also 
note that in the Phaedrus the first two speeches—both of 
which will be dismissed, the first becoming the object of an 
ironic recapitulation, and the second, that of a reparative 
palinode—pose, each in its own way, the question of “to 
whom should one yield?”; and that they answer the question 
by saying that one must yield to the person who loves. And 
all these first speeches appeal to a common thematics: that of 
transitory loves that disintegrate when the beloved comes of 
age, leaving him stranded; 4 that of dishonorable relations that 
place the boy under the domination of the lover, 5 compromise 
him in the eyes of everyone, and alienate him from his family 
or from honorable relations from which he could benefit; 6 that 
of the feelings of disgust and contempt the lover might have 
for the boy due to the satisfactions the latter grants him, or 
the feelings of hatred the young man might experience for the 
aging man who imposes disagreeable relations on him; 7 that 
of the feminine role the boy is led to assume, and the effects 
of physical and moral deterioration that this kind of relation
