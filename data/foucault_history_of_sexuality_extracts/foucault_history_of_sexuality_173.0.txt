The Use of Pleasure 


and services that the lover must impose on himself, obligations 
that he tries to escape by abandoning his erstwhile companion 
to shame and solitude. 9 All of that constituted the elementary 
problematics of the pleasures and their use in the love of boys. 
It was these difficulties that the customs, courtship practices, 
and regulated games of love attempted to overcome. 

One might think that Aristophanes’ speech in the Sympo¬ 
sium constituted an exception: in telling of the bisection of 
primeval human beings due to the wrath of the gods, their 
separation into two halves (males and females, or both halves 
being of the same sex, depending on whether the original 
individual was androgynous or entirely male or female), it 
seems to go far beyond the problems of the art of courtship. 
It raises the question of the nature of love; and it could pass 
for an amusing approach—ironically placed in the mouth of 
Aristophanes, the old adversary of Socrates—to the theses of 
Plato himself. Doesn’t it speak of lovers who are searching for 
their lost half, just as Plato’s souls remember and long for 
what used to be their homeland? However, restricting our¬ 
selves to the parts of the speech that concern male love, it is 
clear that Aristophanes also tends to answer the question of 
consent. And the thing that makes his speech and his irony 
unusual and a bit scandalous is that his answer is completely 
affirmative. Moreover, his mythical tale upsets the generally 
accepted principle of dissymmetry of age, feelings, and behav¬ 
ior between the lover and the beloved. He posits a symmetry 
and equality between the two, since he has them originate in 
the division of a single being; the same pleasure and the same 
desire attract the erastes and the eromenos to one another. A 
boy will naturally love men if he is half a male being: he will 
“take pleasure” in “lying beside males” and in “being ent¬ 
wined with them” (sympeplegmenoi ). 10 And far from revealing 
a feminine nature, this shows that he is the mere “tally” of a 
being that is entirely male. And Plato amuses himself by 
having Aristophanes reverse the reproach that the latter, in his 
comedies, had so often aimed at the politicians of Athens: “in

after years they are the only men who show any real manliness 
in public life.” 11 In their youth they gave themselves to men 
because they were looking for their male half; for the same 
reason, once they are adults they will pursue boys. “Loving 
boys” and “cherishing lovers” (to be paiderastes and phileras- 
tes) n are the two sides of the same being. Hence, to the tradi¬ 
tional question of consent, Aristophanes gives an answer that 
is direct, simple, and entirely affirmative, and he thereby 
abolishes the game of dissymmetries that structured the com¬ 
plex relations between man and boy: the whole question of 
love and right conduct thus becomes nothing more than the 
problem of finding one’s lost half. 

Now, Socratic-Platonic erotics is radically different: not 
only because of the solution it proposes, but also and especially 
because it tends to frame the question in very different terms. 
Knowing the nature of true love will no longer be a matter of 
answering the question: who must one love and under what 
conditions can love be honorable both for the beloved and for 
the lover? Or at least, all these questions will be subordinated 
to another, primary and fundamental question: what is love in 
its very being? 13 

In order to measure the Platonic elaboration and the dis¬ 
tance that separates it from the prevailing erotics, it may be 
useful to recall the way in which Xenophon replies to this 
same question. He stresses the traditional elements: the oppo¬ 
sition between the love that seeks only the pleasure of the lover 
and that which also manifests a concern for the beloved him¬ 
self; the necessity of transforming ephemeral love into a mu¬ 
tual, egalitarian, and lasting friendship. Inth t Symposium and 
the Memorabilia, Xenophon presents a Socrates who draws a 
strict dividing line between love of the soul and love of the 
body, disqualifies the love of the body in his own person, 
makes love of the soul the true love and seeks in friendship 
(philia) the principle that gives value to every relation (sy- 
nousia ). 14 It follows that to join love of the soul to love of the
