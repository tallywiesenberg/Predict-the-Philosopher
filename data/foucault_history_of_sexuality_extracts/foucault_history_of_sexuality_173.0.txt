The Use of Pleasure 


and services that the lover must impose on himself, obligations 
that he tries to escape by abandoning his erstwhile companion 
to shame and solitude. 9 All of that constituted the elementary 
problematics of the pleasures and their use in the love of boys. 
It was these difficulties that the customs, courtship practices, 
and regulated games of love attempted to overcome. 

One might think that Aristophanes’ speech in the Sympo¬ 
sium constituted an exception: in telling of the bisection of 
primeval human beings due to the wrath of the gods, their 
separation into two halves (males and females, or both halves 
being of the same sex, depending on whether the original 
individual was androgynous or entirely male or female), it 
seems to go far beyond the problems of the art of courtship. 
It raises the question of the nature of love; and it could pass 
for an amusing approach—ironically placed in the mouth of 
Aristophanes, the old adversary of Socrates—to the theses of 
Plato himself. Doesn’t it speak of lovers who are searching for 
their lost half, just as Plato’s souls remember and long for 
what used to be their homeland? However, restricting our¬ 
selves to the parts of the speech that concern male love, it is 
clear that Aristophanes also tends to answer the question of 
consent. And the thing that makes his speech and his irony 
unusual and a bit scandalous is that his answer is completely 
affirmative. Moreover, his mythical tale upsets the generally 
accepted principle of dissymmetry of age, feelings, and behav¬ 
ior between the lover and the beloved. He posits a symmetry 
and equality between the two, since he has them originate in 
the division of a single being; the same pleasure and the same 
desire attract the erastes and the eromenos to one another. A 
boy will naturally love men if he is half a male being: he will 
“take pleasure” in “lying beside males” and in “being ent¬ 
wined with them” (sympeplegmenoi ). 10 And far from revealing 
a feminine nature, this shows that he is the mere “tally” of a 
being that is entirely male. And Plato amuses himself by 
having Aristophanes reverse the reproach that the latter, in his 
comedies, had so often aimed at the politicians of Athens: “in
