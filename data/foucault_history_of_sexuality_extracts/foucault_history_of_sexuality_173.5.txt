True Love

after years they are the only men who show any real manliness 
in public life.” 11 In their youth they gave themselves to men 
because they were looking for their male half; for the same 
reason, once they are adults they will pursue boys. “Loving 
boys” and “cherishing lovers” (to be paiderastes and phileras- 
tes) n are the two sides of the same being. Hence, to the tradi¬ 
tional question of consent, Aristophanes gives an answer that 
is direct, simple, and entirely affirmative, and he thereby 
abolishes the game of dissymmetries that structured the com¬ 
plex relations between man and boy: the whole question of 
love and right conduct thus becomes nothing more than the 
problem of finding one’s lost half. 

Now, Socratic-Platonic erotics is radically different: not 
only because of the solution it proposes, but also and especially 
because it tends to frame the question in very different terms. 
Knowing the nature of true love will no longer be a matter of 
answering the question: who must one love and under what 
conditions can love be honorable both for the beloved and for 
the lover? Or at least, all these questions will be subordinated 
to another, primary and fundamental question: what is love in 
its very being? 13 

In order to measure the Platonic elaboration and the dis¬ 
tance that separates it from the prevailing erotics, it may be 
useful to recall the way in which Xenophon replies to this 
same question. He stresses the traditional elements: the oppo¬ 
sition between the love that seeks only the pleasure of the lover 
and that which also manifests a concern for the beloved him¬ 
self; the necessity of transforming ephemeral love into a mu¬ 
tual, egalitarian, and lasting friendship. Inth t Symposium and 
the Memorabilia, Xenophon presents a Socrates who draws a 
strict dividing line between love of the soul and love of the 
body, disqualifies the love of the body in his own person, 
makes love of the soul the true love and seeks in friendship 
(philia) the principle that gives value to every relation (sy- 
nousia ). 14 It follows that to join love of the soul to love of the
