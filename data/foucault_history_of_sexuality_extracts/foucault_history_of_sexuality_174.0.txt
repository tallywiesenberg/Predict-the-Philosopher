body is not sufficient; one must rid every attachment of its 
physical dimensions (when one loves “the body and the soul 
at the same time,” it is the first that will dominate, and the 
fading of youth causes friendship itself to wither away);' 3 one 
should follow the example of Socrates and shun all contact, 
forgo the kisses that are likely to hinder the soul, and even take 
care that one’s body doesn’t touch another’s, and doesn’t feel 
its “bite.” 16 In positive terms, every relationship must be based 
on the constituent elements of friendship: benefits and services 
rendered, efforts for the improvement of the boy one loves, 
mutual affection, a permanent bond established once and for 
all. 17 Does this mean that for Xenophon (or for the Socrates 
that Xenophon portrays) there should not be any eros between 
two men, but only a relationship of philia? This is in fact the 
ideal that Xenophon claims to recognize in the Sparta of 
Lycurgus. 18 According to him, Spartan men who were at¬ 
tracted to the bodies of boys were declared “vile,” whereas 
people praised and encouraged “honest” adults who loved 
nothing but the soul of youths and aspired only to become 
friends with them; so that in Sparta “lovers were no less 
restrained in their love for children than were fathers with 
respect to their sons, or brothers with respect to their broth¬ 
ers.” But in the Symposium, Xenophon gives a less schematic 
image of this division. He outlines a conception of eros and its 
pleasures that would have friendship itself as the goal. Friend¬ 
ship, insofar as it implies a life in commott, reciprocal atten¬ 
tion, kindness to one another, and shared feelings, is not made 
a substitute for love or something that would take over from 
it in due time. Xenophon makes it the very thing lovers should 
be enamored of: erontes tes philias, he says, employing a char¬ 
acteristic expression that makes it possible to save eros, to 
maintain its force, but without giving it a concrete content 
apart from the behavior that results from the mutual and 
lasting affection of friendship. 19 

Platonic erotics is constructed very differently, even if the 
starting point of reflection is in the familiar question of the

place to assign the aphrodisia in the love relation. For in fact 
Plato takes up these traditional questions only in order to 
show how, in the hasty replies that are given to them, the basic 
problem is overlooked. 

The first two speeches of the Phaedrus, the naive speech 
of Lysias and the facetious speech of Socrates, argue that a 
boy should not yield to the one who loves him. Such talk, 
Socrates remarks, cannot tell the truth: “False is the tale [ 
ouk esti etymos logos] which says that because the lover is 
mad and the non-lover sane the non-lover should be given 
the preference when one might have a lover.” 20 In contrary 
fashion, and out of a concern to praise love instead of offend¬ 
ing it, the beginning speeches of the Symposium assert that it 
is fine to yield provided one does so in the right way, to a 
noble lover, 21 that there is nothing indecent or shameful in it, 
and that under the law of love “where there is mutual con¬ 
sent there is what the law proclaims to be right.” 22 These 
speeches are more respectf ul of love, but that does not make 
them any more etymoi than those of Lysias and his ironic 
fault-finder in the Phaedrus. 

Counterposed to them, the words of Diotima, reported in 
the Symposium, and the great fable of the Phaedrus, nar¬ 
rated by Socrates himself, stand as discourses etymoi: true 
discourses, and related by their origin to the truth that they 
tell. What makes them such? How are they different from 
the panegyrics or disqualifications that preceded them? The 
difference is not in the fact that Diotima or Socrates are 
more rigorous or more austere than the other interlocutors; 
they do not oppose these other speeches because the latter 
are too accommodating, making too much allowance for the 
body and the pleasures in a love that should be directed only 
to souls. They set themselves apart because they do not pose 
the problem in the same way; they carry out a certain num¬ 
ber of basic transformations and displacements with regard 
to the game of questions that were traditional in discussions 
about love.

The Use of Pleasure 


1. From the question of amorous behavior to an inquiry into 
the nature of love. In the debate as it is formulated in the 
other speeches, love and the intense and forceful movement 
that takes hold of the lover are presupposed; this love “being 
granted,” 23 the main point of preoccupation is in knowing how
