body is not sufficient; one must rid every attachment of its 
physical dimensions (when one loves “the body and the soul 
at the same time,” it is the first that will dominate, and the 
fading of youth causes friendship itself to wither away);' 3 one 
should follow the example of Socrates and shun all contact, 
forgo the kisses that are likely to hinder the soul, and even take 
care that one’s body doesn’t touch another’s, and doesn’t feel 
its “bite.” 16 In positive terms, every relationship must be based 
on the constituent elements of friendship: benefits and services 
rendered, efforts for the improvement of the boy one loves, 
mutual affection, a permanent bond established once and for 
all. 17 Does this mean that for Xenophon (or for the Socrates 
that Xenophon portrays) there should not be any eros between 
two men, but only a relationship of philia? This is in fact the 
ideal that Xenophon claims to recognize in the Sparta of 
Lycurgus. 18 According to him, Spartan men who were at¬ 
tracted to the bodies of boys were declared “vile,” whereas 
people praised and encouraged “honest” adults who loved 
nothing but the soul of youths and aspired only to become 
friends with them; so that in Sparta “lovers were no less 
restrained in their love for children than were fathers with 
respect to their sons, or brothers with respect to their broth¬ 
ers.” But in the Symposium, Xenophon gives a less schematic 
image of this division. He outlines a conception of eros and its 
pleasures that would have friendship itself as the goal. Friend¬ 
ship, insofar as it implies a life in commott, reciprocal atten¬ 
tion, kindness to one another, and shared feelings, is not made 
a substitute for love or something that would take over from 
it in due time. Xenophon makes it the very thing lovers should 
be enamored of: erontes tes philias, he says, employing a char¬ 
acteristic expression that makes it possible to save eros, to 
maintain its force, but without giving it a concrete content 
apart from the behavior that results from the mutual and 
lasting affection of friendship. 19 

Platonic erotics is constructed very differently, even if the 
starting point of reflection is in the familiar question of the

Plato takes up these traditional questions only in order to
