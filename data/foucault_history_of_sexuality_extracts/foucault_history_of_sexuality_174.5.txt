show how, in the hasty replies that are given to them, the basic 
problem is overlooked. 

The first two speeches of the Phaedrus, the naive speech 
of Lysias and the facetious speech of Socrates, argue that a 
boy should not yield to the one who loves him. Such talk, 
Socrates remarks, cannot tell the truth: “False is the tale [ 
ouk esti etymos logos] which says that because the lover is 
mad and the non-lover sane the non-lover should be given 
the preference when one might have a lover.” 20 In contrary 
fashion, and out of a concern to praise love instead of offend¬ 
ing it, the beginning speeches of the Symposium assert that it 
is fine to yield provided one does so in the right way, to a 
noble lover, 21 that there is nothing indecent or shameful in it, 
and that under the law of love “where there is mutual con¬ 
sent there is what the law proclaims to be right.” 22 These 
speeches are more respectf ul of love, but that does not make 
them any more etymoi than those of Lysias and his ironic 
fault-finder in the Phaedrus. 

Counterposed to them, the words of Diotima, reported in 
the Symposium, and the great fable of the Phaedrus, nar¬ 
rated by Socrates himself, stand as discourses etymoi: true 
discourses, and related by their origin to the truth that they 
tell. What makes them such? How are they different from 
the panegyrics or disqualifications that preceded them? The 
difference is not in the fact that Diotima or Socrates are 
more rigorous or more austere than the other interlocutors; 
they do not oppose these other speeches because the latter 
are too accommodating, making too much allowance for the 
body and the pleasures in a love that should be directed only 
to souls. They set themselves apart because they do not pose 
the problem in the same way; they carry out a certain num¬ 
ber of basic transformations and displacements with regard 
to the game of questions that were traditional in discussions 
about love.

The Use of Pleasure 


1. From the question of amorous behavior to an inquiry into 
the nature of love. In the debate as it is formulated in the 
other speeches, love and the intense and forceful movement 
that takes hold of the lover are presupposed; this love “being 
granted,” 23 the main point of preoccupation is in knowing how
