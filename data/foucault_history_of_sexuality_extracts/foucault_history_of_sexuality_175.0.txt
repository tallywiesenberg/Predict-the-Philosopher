the two partners ought to conduct themselves; how, in what 
form, to what extent, with the help of what means of persua¬ 
sion or by giving what assurances of friendship, should the 
lover seek to attain “that to which he aspires”; and how, in 
what conditions, after what resistances and tests, should the 
beloved yield? A question of conduct, grounded in a preexist¬ 
ing love. Now, the subject of Diotima and Socrates’ inquiry 
is the very being of this love, its nature and its origin, that 
which makes it strong, and that which moves it so stubbornly 
or so madly toward its object: “What is the essential nature 
of Love, what are his characteristics, and then what are his 
works?” 24 An ontological inquiry and no longer a question of 
deontology. All the other interlocutors orient their speeches 
toward praise or criticism, toward the division between good 
and bad love, toward the delimitation of what one should and 
should not do; in the customary thematics with its search for 
appropriateness and its elaboration of an art of courtship, the 
primary object of reflection is conduct or the game of recipro¬ 
cal conducts. Plato puts this question aside, at least provision¬ 
ally, and, going beyond the division of good and bad, he raises 
the question of what it means to love.* 

Now, to state the question in this way implies, first of all, 
a displacement of the very object of discourse. Diotima re¬ 
proaches Socrates—and in fact all the authors of the preceding 
encomiums—for having looked to the “beloved” object (ton 
eromenon) for the principle of what needed to be said about 
love; they thus let themselves be blinded by the charm, beauty, 
and perfection of the beloved boy, and they mistakenly at¬ 
tributed his merits to love itself; the latter will manifest its 

‘After Phaedrus’ speeches, Socrates points out that there has to be in the mind of 
the speaker “knowledge of the truth about the subject of the speech.”" 



True Love

characteristic truth only if that truth is sought in its nature 
and not in its object. So it is necessary to leave off thinking 
about the beloved and redirect one’s inquiry to the one who 
loves (to eron), questioning him in his own condition. 26 The 
same thing will be done in the Phaedrus when, replying to the 
first two counter-panegyrics, Socrates makes his long detour 
via the theory of souls. But as a result of this displacement, 
the discourse on love will have to face the risk of being nothing 
more than an “encomium” (in the composite form of praise 
addressed both to love and to the beloved); it will have to 
speak—as in the Symposium —of the “intermediate” nature of 
love, the deficiency that characterizes it (since it does not 
possess the beautiful things that it desires), the parentage of 
poverty and contrivance, of ignorance and knowledge from 
which it is born; it will also have to speak, as in the Sympo¬ 
sium, of the way in which forgetfulness and remembrance of 
the supracelestial vision are mixed in love, and of the long 
road of suffering that will lead it finally to its goal. 

2. From the question of the boy's honor to that of love of truth. 
To say, as Diotima does, that it is better to turn one’s thoughts 
from the beloved object to the loving principle does not mean 
that the question of the object is no longer posed: on the 
contrary, the whole development that follows that basic for¬ 
mulation is devoted to determining what is loved when there 
is love. But as soon as one undertakes to speak of love in a 
discourse that aims to define its nature instead of praising that 
which one loves, the question of the object will be posed in 
different terms. 

In the traditional debate, the starting point for inquiry was 
on the side of the love object itself: given what the person 
whom one loved was, and what he was supposed to be—the 
beauty not only of his body but of his soul, the education that 
he. needed, the free, noble, manly, and courageous character 
he must acquire—what form of love was honorable, for him 
and for the lover? It was respect for the beloved, for his real

nature, that ought to give its own form and its sober style to 
whatever one might ask of him. In the Platonic inquiry, on the 
other hand, it is reflection on the nature of love itself that 
ought to lead to a true determination of its object. Beyond the 
different beautiful objects that the amorous individual may 
become attached to, Diotima shows Socrates that love seeks 
to beget spiritual children, and to contemplate “absolute 
beauty” in its true nature, in its unalloyed purity, and in the 
“oneness of its form.” And in the Phaedrus, it is Socrates 
himself who shows how the soul, if it has a strong enough 
memory of what it has seen beyond the heavens, if it is ener¬ 
getically driven, and if it does not allow impure appetites to
