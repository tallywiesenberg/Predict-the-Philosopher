more than an “encomium” (in the composite form of praise 
addressed both to love and to the beloved); it will have to 
speak—as in the Symposium —of the “intermediate” nature of 
love, the deficiency that characterizes it (since it does not 
possess the beautiful things that it desires), the parentage of 
poverty and contrivance, of ignorance and knowledge from 
which it is born; it will also have to speak, as in the Sympo¬ 
sium, of the way in which forgetfulness and remembrance of 
the supracelestial vision are mixed in love, and of the long 
road of suffering that will lead it finally to its goal. 

2. From the question of the boy's honor to that of love of truth. 
To say, as Diotima does, that it is better to turn one’s thoughts 
from the beloved object to the loving principle does not mean 
that the question of the object is no longer posed: on the 
contrary, the whole development that follows that basic for¬ 
mulation is devoted to determining what is loved when there 
is love. But as soon as one undertakes to speak of love in a 
discourse that aims to define its nature instead of praising that 
which one loves, the question of the object will be posed in 
different terms. 

In the traditional debate, the starting point for inquiry was 
on the side of the love object itself: given what the person 
whom one loved was, and what he was supposed to be—the 
beauty not only of his body but of his soul, the education that 
he. needed, the free, noble, manly, and courageous character 
he must acquire—what form of love was honorable, for him 
and for the lover? It was respect for the beloved, for his real

nature, that ought to give its own form and its sober style to 
whatever one might ask of him. In the Platonic inquiry, on the 
other hand, it is reflection on the nature of love itself that 
ought to lead to a true determination of its object. Beyond the 
different beautiful objects that the amorous individual may 
become attached to, Diotima shows Socrates that love seeks 
to beget spiritual children, and to contemplate “absolute 
beauty” in its true nature, in its unalloyed purity, and in the 
“oneness of its form.” And in the Phaedrus, it is Socrates 
himself who shows how the soul, if it has a strong enough 
memory of what it has seen beyond the heavens, if it is ener¬ 
getically driven, and if it does not allow impure appetites to
