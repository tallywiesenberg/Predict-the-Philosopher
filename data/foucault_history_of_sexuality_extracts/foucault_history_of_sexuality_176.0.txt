rob it of its momentum, will attach itself to the beloved object 
only insofar as the latter reflects and imitates beauty itself. 

One does find in Plato the theme that love should be di¬ 
rected to the soul of boys rather than to their bodies. But he 
was not the first or the only one to say this. It was a theme 
that ran through the traditional discussions on love, with 
consequences that varied in their rigor. Attributing the theme 
to Socrates, Xenophon gives it a radical form. What is peculiar 
to Plato is not the dichotomy, but the way in which he esta¬ 
blishes the inferiority of love for bodies. He bases this notion 
not on the dignity of the boy who is loved, but on that which, 
in the lover himself, determines the nature and form of his love 
(his desire for immortality, his yearning for the beautiful in its 
purity, the recollection of what he has seen beyond the heav¬ 
ens). Moreover (and both the Symposium and the Phaedrus 
are quite explicit on this point), he does not trace a clear, 
definitive, and uncrossable dividing line between the bad love 
of the body and the glorious love of the soul; however de¬ 
valued and inferior the relation to the body compared with 
that motion toward beauty, and however dangerous it can 
sometimes be since it cannot deflect and stop that motion, it 
is not excluded out of hand or condemned for all time. From 
one beautiful body to other beautiful bodies, according to the 
famous formula of the Symposium, and on to the beauty that

is found in “occupations,” “rules of conduct,” “the sciences,” 
the motion is continuous, until one gazes at last upon “the vast 
ocean of beauty.” 27 And the same holds for the Phaedrus. 
While it praises the courage and perfection of souls who have 
not yielded, it does not promise punishment for those who, 
leading a life devoted to honor rather than to philosophy, let 
themselves be taken by surprise, so that, carried away by their 
passion, they chance to “commit the thing.” No doubt, at the 
moment when their souls leave their bodies, their lives here 
below having run their course, they will find themselves with¬ 
out wings (unlike what happens to those who have remained 
“masters of themselves”). So they will not be compelled to 
voyage in the underworld; the two lovers will accompany one 
another on the voyage beneath the heavens, until they in turn 
receive wings, “because of their love.” 28 For Plato, it is not 
exclusion of the body that characterizes true love in a funda¬
