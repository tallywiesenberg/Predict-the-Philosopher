rob it of its momentum, will attach itself to the beloved object 
only insofar as the latter reflects and imitates beauty itself. 

One does find in Plato the theme that love should be di¬ 
rected to the soul of boys rather than to their bodies. But he 
was not the first or the only one to say this. It was a theme 
that ran through the traditional discussions on love, with 
consequences that varied in their rigor. Attributing the theme 
to Socrates, Xenophon gives it a radical form. What is peculiar 
to Plato is not the dichotomy, but the way in which he esta¬ 
blishes the inferiority of love for bodies. He bases this notion 
not on the dignity of the boy who is loved, but on that which, 
in the lover himself, determines the nature and form of his love 
(his desire for immortality, his yearning for the beautiful in its 
purity, the recollection of what he has seen beyond the heav¬ 
ens). Moreover (and both the Symposium and the Phaedrus 
are quite explicit on this point), he does not trace a clear, 
definitive, and uncrossable dividing line between the bad love 
of the body and the glorious love of the soul; however de¬ 
valued and inferior the relation to the body compared with 
that motion toward beauty, and however dangerous it can 
sometimes be since it cannot deflect and stop that motion, it 
is not excluded out of hand or condemned for all time. From 
one beautiful body to other beautiful bodies, according to the 
famous formula of the Symposium, and on to the beauty that

is found in “occupations,” “rules of conduct,” “the sciences,” 
the motion is continuous, until one gazes at last upon “the vast 
ocean of beauty.” 27 And the same holds for the Phaedrus. 
While it praises the courage and perfection of souls who have 
not yielded, it does not promise punishment for those who, 
leading a life devoted to honor rather than to philosophy, let 
themselves be taken by surprise, so that, carried away by their 
passion, they chance to “commit the thing.” No doubt, at the 
moment when their souls leave their bodies, their lives here 
below having run their course, they will find themselves with¬ 
out wings (unlike what happens to those who have remained 
“masters of themselves”). So they will not be compelled to 
voyage in the underworld; the two lovers will accompany one 
another on the voyage beneath the heavens, until they in turn 
receive wings, “because of their love.” 28 For Plato, it is not 
exclusion of the body that characterizes true love in a funda¬ 
mental way; it is rather that, beyond the appearances of the 
object, love is a relation to truth. 

3. From the question of the dissymmetry of partners to that 
of the convergence of love. According to accepted conven¬ 
tions, it was understood that the Eros came from the lover; as 
for the beloved, he could not be an active subject of love on 
the same basis as the erastes. Doubtless a corresponding at¬ 
tachment, an Anteros, was expected of him. But the nature of 
this response was problematic: it could not be exactly symmet¬ 
rical to that which gave rise to it; more than the lover’s desire 
and pleasure, it was his benevolence, his good turns, his tender 
care, and his example that the boy was supposed to recipro¬ 
cate, and it was necessary to await the time when the tran¬ 
sports of love would cease and age would calm the passions 
and so remove the dangers before the two friends could 
become bound to one another by a relationship of exact 
reciprocity. 

But if Eros was a relation to truth, the two lovers could only 
be rejoined provided that the beloved too had been moved in

the direction of truth by the force of the same Eros. In Pla¬ 
tonic erotics, the beloved cannot settle into the position of 
object in relation to the other’s love, simply waiting to receive, 
by the terms of the exchange to which he is entitled (since he 
is loved), the counsel he needs and the knowledge to which he 
aspires. It is right that he should actually become a subject in 
this love relation. In fact, this is the reason for the reversal, 
toward the end of the third speech of the Phaedrus, that 
changes the focus of the discussion from the lover to the one 
who is loved. Socrates has described the journey, the fervor, 
and the suffering of the one who loves, and the hard struggle 
he has had to conduct in order to gain control of his team. 
Now he turns his attention to the loved one: the young boy’s 
companions have perhaps made him think that it is not good 
to yield to a lover; nevertheless he begins to accept the com¬ 
pany of his lover; the latter’s presence excites him to distrac¬ 
tion; he in his turn feels uplifted by the rising wave of desire, 
wings and plumage start to grow in his soul. 29 Of course, he 
still does not know the true nature of that which he longs for, 
and he finds no words with which to name it; but he “throws
