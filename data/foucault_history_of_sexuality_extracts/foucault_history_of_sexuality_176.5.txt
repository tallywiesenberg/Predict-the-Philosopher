mental way; it is rather that, beyond the appearances of the 
object, love is a relation to truth. 

3. From the question of the dissymmetry of partners to that 
of the convergence of love. According to accepted conven¬ 
tions, it was understood that the Eros came from the lover; as 
for the beloved, he could not be an active subject of love on 
the same basis as the erastes. Doubtless a corresponding at¬ 
tachment, an Anteros, was expected of him. But the nature of 
this response was problematic: it could not be exactly symmet¬ 
rical to that which gave rise to it; more than the lover’s desire 
and pleasure, it was his benevolence, his good turns, his tender 
care, and his example that the boy was supposed to recipro¬ 
cate, and it was necessary to await the time when the tran¬ 
sports of love would cease and age would calm the passions 
and so remove the dangers before the two friends could 
become bound to one another by a relationship of exact 
reciprocity. 

But if Eros was a relation to truth, the two lovers could only 
be rejoined provided that the beloved too had been moved in

the direction of truth by the force of the same Eros. In Pla¬ 
tonic erotics, the beloved cannot settle into the position of 
object in relation to the other’s love, simply waiting to receive, 
by the terms of the exchange to which he is entitled (since he 
is loved), the counsel he needs and the knowledge to which he 
aspires. It is right that he should actually become a subject in 
this love relation. In fact, this is the reason for the reversal, 
toward the end of the third speech of the Phaedrus, that 
changes the focus of the discussion from the lover to the one 
who is loved. Socrates has described the journey, the fervor, 
and the suffering of the one who loves, and the hard struggle 
he has had to conduct in order to gain control of his team. 
Now he turns his attention to the loved one: the young boy’s 
companions have perhaps made him think that it is not good 
to yield to a lover; nevertheless he begins to accept the com¬ 
pany of his lover; the latter’s presence excites him to distrac¬ 
tion; he in his turn feels uplifted by the rising wave of desire, 
wings and plumage start to grow in his soul. 29 Of course, he 
still does not know the true nature of that which he longs for, 
and he finds no words with which to name it; but he “throws
