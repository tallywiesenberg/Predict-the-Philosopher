his arms” around his lover and “gives him kisses.” 30 This 
moment is important: unlike what occurs in the art of court¬ 
ship, the “dialectic of love” in this case calls for two move¬ 
ments exactly alike on the part of the two lovers; the love is 
the same for both of them, since it is the motion that carries 
them toward truth. 

4. From the virtue of the loved boy to the master's love and 
wisdom. In the art of courtship, it fell to the lover to do the 
wooing; and even though he was expected to keep control of 
himself, it was clear that the compelling force of his love 
r/sked overcoming him in spite of himself. The solid point of 
resistance was the boy’s honor, his dignity, the reasonable 
obstinacy with which he might refuse. But from the moment 
when Eros appeals to truth, it is the one who is the more 
advanced on the road of love, the one who is more truly 



True Love

enamored of truth, who will best be able to guide the other and 
help him to keep from degrading himself in all the base pleas¬ 
ures. The one who is better versed in love will also be the 
master of truth; and it will be his role to teach the loved one 
how to triumph over his desires and become “stronger than 
himself.” In the love relation, and as a consequence of that 
relation to truth which now structures it, a new figure makes 
its appearance: that of the master, coming to take the place of 
the lover; moreover, this personage, through the complete 
mastery that he exercises over himself, will turn the game 
upside down, reverse the roles, establish the principle of a 
renunciation of the aphrodisia, and become, for all young men 
who are eager for truth, an object of love. 

This is doubtless the meaning that should be given to the 
description, in the last pages of the Symposium, of the rela¬ 
tions that Socrates maintains not only with Alcibiades, but 
also with Charmides, the son of Glaucon; with Euthydemus, 
the son of Diodes; and with many others in addition. 31 The 
distribution of roles is completely reversed: it is the young 
boys—those who are beautiful, with many suitors—who are 
enamored of Socrates; they dog his footsteps, they try to se¬ 
duce him, they would like very much to grant him their favors 
—that is, for him to communicate the treasure of his wisdom. 
They are in the position of erastes, and he, the old man with 
the ugly body, is in the position of eromenos. But what they 
are not aware of, and what Alcibiades discovers in the course 
of the famous “test,” is that Socrates is loved by them only to 
the extent that he is able to resist their seduction; which does 
not mean that he feels no love or desire for them, but that he 
is moved by the force of true love, and that he knows how 
truly to love the truth that must be loved. Diotima had said 
this before: it was he who was wisest of all on the subject of 
love. Henceforth the master’s wisdom (and no longer the boy’s 
honor) would mark both the object of true love and the princi¬ 
ple that kept one from “yielding.” 

The Socrates that appears in this passage is invested with

The Use of Pleasure 


powers that are characteristic of the traditional figure of the 
theios aner: physical endurance, the ability to make oneself 
indifferent to sensations, and the power to absent oneself from 
the body and to concentrate all the soul’s energy on oneself. 32 
But it should be understood that these powers are operative 
here in the quite particular game of Eros; they ensure the 
domination that Socrates is able to exercise over himself in the 
game; and hence they qualify him as the highest object of love 
to which young men might appeal, but at the same time, as 
the only one who can guide their love all the way to truth. Into 
the lover’s game where different dominations confronted one 
another (that of the lover seeking to get control of the beloved, 
that of the beloved seeking to escape, and seeking, by means 
of his resistance, to enslave the lover), Socrates introduces 
another type of domination: that which is exercised by the 
master of truth and for which he is qualified by the dominion 
he exercises over himself. 

Platonic erotics can thus be considered from three view¬ 
points. First, it is a way of responding to an inherent diffi¬ 
culty, for Greek culture, in relationships between men and 
boys: namely, the question of what status to give the latter as 
objects of pleasure. From this angle, Plato’s answer seems 
only more complex and more elaborate than those that 
might have been put forward in the various “debates” on 
love, or—by “Socrates”—in the texts of Xenophon. Actu¬ 
ally, Plato resolves the difficulty of the object of pleasure by 
bringing the question of the loved individual back to the na¬
