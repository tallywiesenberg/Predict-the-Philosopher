the ugly body, is in the position of eromenos. But what they 
are not aware of, and what Alcibiades discovers in the course 
of the famous “test,” is that Socrates is loved by them only to 
the extent that he is able to resist their seduction; which does 
not mean that he feels no love or desire for them, but that he 
is moved by the force of true love, and that he knows how 
truly to love the truth that must be loved. Diotima had said 
this before: it was he who was wisest of all on the subject of 
love. Henceforth the master’s wisdom (and no longer the boy’s 
honor) would mark both the object of true love and the princi¬ 
ple that kept one from “yielding.” 

The Socrates that appears in this passage is invested with

The Use of Pleasure 


powers that are characteristic of the traditional figure of the 
theios aner: physical endurance, the ability to make oneself 
indifferent to sensations, and the power to absent oneself from 
the body and to concentrate all the soul’s energy on oneself. 32 
But it should be understood that these powers are operative 
here in the quite particular game of Eros; they ensure the 
domination that Socrates is able to exercise over himself in the 
game; and hence they qualify him as the highest object of love 
to which young men might appeal, but at the same time, as 
the only one who can guide their love all the way to truth. Into 
the lover’s game where different dominations confronted one 
another (that of the lover seeking to get control of the beloved, 
that of the beloved seeking to escape, and seeking, by means 
of his resistance, to enslave the lover), Socrates introduces 
another type of domination: that which is exercised by the 
master of truth and for which he is qualified by the dominion 
he exercises over himself. 

Platonic erotics can thus be considered from three view¬ 
points. First, it is a way of responding to an inherent diffi¬ 
culty, for Greek culture, in relationships between men and 
boys: namely, the question of what status to give the latter as 
objects of pleasure. From this angle, Plato’s answer seems 
only more complex and more elaborate than those that 
might have been put forward in the various “debates” on 
love, or—by “Socrates”—in the texts of Xenophon. Actu¬ 
ally, Plato resolves the difficulty of the object of pleasure by 
bringing the question of the loved individual back to the na¬
