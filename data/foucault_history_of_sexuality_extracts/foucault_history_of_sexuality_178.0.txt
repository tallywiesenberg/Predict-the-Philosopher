ture of love itself; by structuring the love relation as a rela¬ 
tion to truth; by doubling it and placing it in the one who is 
loved as well as in the one who is in love; and by reversing 
the role of the loved young man, making him a lover of the 
master of truth. In this sense, one can say that it meets the 
challenge that was issued by Aristophanes’ fable: it gives the 
latter a true content. It shows how it is indeed the same love 
which, in the same movement, can make a man both paide- 
rastes and philerastes. The dissymmetries, the disparities, the

resistances, and the evasions that organized the always diffi¬ 
cult relations between the erastes and the eromenos —the ac¬ 
tive subject and the pursued object—in the practice of love 
no longer have any justification; or rather, they can develop 
according to a completely different movement, by taking a 
completely different form, and by imposing a quite different 
game: that of a process in which the master of truth teaches 
the boy the meaning of wisdom. 

But it becomes apparent that Platonic erotics—and this is 
the other side of it—thereby introduces the question of truth 
into the love relation as a fundamental question. And this is 
in an altogether different form from that of the logos to which 
it is necessary to submit one’s appetites in the use of pleasures. 
The lover’s task, the accomplishment of which will in fact 
enable him to reach his goal, is to recognize the true nature 
of the love that has seized him. And here the answer to the 
challenge of Aristophanes transforms the answer the latter 
gave: it is not the other half of himself that the individual seeks 
in the other person; it is the truth to which his soul is related. 
Hence the ethical work he will have to do will be to discover 
and hold fast, without ever letting go, to that relation to truth 
which was the hidden medium of his love. And one thus sees 
how Platonic reflection tends to detach itself from a common 
problematization that revolved around the object and the sta¬ 
tus that ought to be given to him, in order to open a line of 
inquiry concerning love, which will revolve around the subject 
and the truth he is capable of. 

Socratic erotics, in the form that Plato gives it, does deal 
with questions that were customary in discussions on love. 
But it does not undertake to define proper conduct, where 
the sufficiently long resistance of the beloved would counter¬ 
balance the sufficiently valuable services of the lover. It tries 
to determine the self-movement, the kind of effort and work 
upon oneself, which will enable the lover to elicit and estab¬ 
lish his relation to true being. Instead of attempting once 
and for all to draw the line separating that which is honor-

The Use of Pleasure 


able from that which brings disgrace, it endeavors to de¬ 
scribe the progress of desire—with its difficulties, its ups and 
downs, and its setbacks—that leads to the point where it 
reencounters its own nature. The Symposium and the Phae- 
drus indicate a transition from an erotics structured in terms 
of “courtship” practice and recognition of the other’s free¬ 
dom, to an erotics centered on an ascesis of the subject and 
a common access to truth. The inquiry is thereby displaced: 
in reflection on the chresis aphrodision, it dealt with pleasure 
and its dynamics, the just practice and the right distribution 
of which were to be ensured through self-mastery. In the 
Platonic reflection on love, the inquiry concerns the desire 
that must be led to its true object (which is truth) by recog¬ 
nizing it for what it truly is. The life of moderation, of so- 
phrosyne, as it is described in the Laws, is a life “that is mild 
in every way, with gentle pains and gentle pleasures, a life 
characterized by desires that are mild [eremaiai hedonai, 
malakai epithumiai] and loves that are not mad [erotes ouk 
emmaneis ]”; 33 this statement speaks of an economy of pleas¬ 
ures ensured by the control that is exercised by oneself over 
oneself. To. the soul whose voyage and amorous strivings are 
described by the Phaedrus, it is also recommended, if she is 
to receive her reward beyond the heavens, to practice “an 
orderly regimen” (tetagmene diaite) that is possible because 
she is “mistress of herself’ and she is “heedful of measure,” 
she has “subjected the power of evil” and “liberated the 
power of virtue.” 34 But the struggle she has been able to sus¬ 
tain against the violence of her appetites, she would not have 
been able to conduct it without a twofold relation to truth: a 
relation to her own desire questioned in its being, and a rela¬ 
tion to the object of her desire recognized as a true being. 

Thus, we see where ground is broken for a future inquiry 
into desiring man. Which does not mean that Platonic erotics 
has suddenly and permanently taken leave of the ethics of
