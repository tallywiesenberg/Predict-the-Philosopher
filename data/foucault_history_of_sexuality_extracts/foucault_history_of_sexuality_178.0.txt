ture of love itself; by structuring the love relation as a rela¬ 
tion to truth; by doubling it and placing it in the one who is 
loved as well as in the one who is in love; and by reversing 
the role of the loved young man, making him a lover of the 
master of truth. In this sense, one can say that it meets the 
challenge that was issued by Aristophanes’ fable: it gives the 
latter a true content. It shows how it is indeed the same love 
which, in the same movement, can make a man both paide- 
rastes and philerastes. The dissymmetries, the disparities, the

resistances, and the evasions that organized the always diffi¬ 
cult relations between the erastes and the eromenos —the ac¬ 
tive subject and the pursued object—in the practice of love 
no longer have any justification; or rather, they can develop 
according to a completely different movement, by taking a 
completely different form, and by imposing a quite different 
game: that of a process in which the master of truth teaches 
the boy the meaning of wisdom. 

But it becomes apparent that Platonic erotics—and this is 
the other side of it—thereby introduces the question of truth 
into the love relation as a fundamental question. And this is 
in an altogether different form from that of the logos to which 
it is necessary to submit one’s appetites in the use of pleasures. 
The lover’s task, the accomplishment of which will in fact 
enable him to reach his goal, is to recognize the true nature 
of the love that has seized him. And here the answer to the 
challenge of Aristophanes transforms the answer the latter 
gave: it is not the other half of himself that the individual seeks 
in the other person; it is the truth to which his soul is related. 
Hence the ethical work he will have to do will be to discover 
and hold fast, without ever letting go, to that relation to truth 
which was the hidden medium of his love. And one thus sees 
how Platonic reflection tends to detach itself from a common 
problematization that revolved around the object and the sta¬ 
tus that ought to be given to him, in order to open a line of 
inquiry concerning love, which will revolve around the subject 
and the truth he is capable of. 

Socratic erotics, in the form that Plato gives it, does deal 
with questions that were customary in discussions on love. 
But it does not undertake to define proper conduct, where
