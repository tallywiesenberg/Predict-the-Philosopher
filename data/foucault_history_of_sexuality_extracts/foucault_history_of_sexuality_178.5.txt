the sufficiently long resistance of the beloved would counter¬ 
balance the sufficiently valuable services of the lover. It tries 
to determine the self-movement, the kind of effort and work 
upon oneself, which will enable the lover to elicit and estab¬ 
lish his relation to true being. Instead of attempting once 
and for all to draw the line separating that which is honor-

The Use of Pleasure 


able from that which brings disgrace, it endeavors to de¬ 
scribe the progress of desire—with its difficulties, its ups and 
downs, and its setbacks—that leads to the point where it 
reencounters its own nature. The Symposium and the Phae- 
drus indicate a transition from an erotics structured in terms 
of “courtship” practice and recognition of the other’s free¬ 
dom, to an erotics centered on an ascesis of the subject and 
a common access to truth. The inquiry is thereby displaced: 
in reflection on the chresis aphrodision, it dealt with pleasure 
and its dynamics, the just practice and the right distribution 
of which were to be ensured through self-mastery. In the 
Platonic reflection on love, the inquiry concerns the desire 
that must be led to its true object (which is truth) by recog¬ 
nizing it for what it truly is. The life of moderation, of so- 
phrosyne, as it is described in the Laws, is a life “that is mild 
in every way, with gentle pains and gentle pleasures, a life 
characterized by desires that are mild [eremaiai hedonai, 
malakai epithumiai] and loves that are not mad [erotes ouk 
emmaneis ]”; 33 this statement speaks of an economy of pleas¬ 
ures ensured by the control that is exercised by oneself over 
oneself. To. the soul whose voyage and amorous strivings are 
described by the Phaedrus, it is also recommended, if she is 
to receive her reward beyond the heavens, to practice “an 
orderly regimen” (tetagmene diaite) that is possible because 
she is “mistress of herself’ and she is “heedful of measure,” 
she has “subjected the power of evil” and “liberated the 
power of virtue.” 34 But the struggle she has been able to sus¬ 
tain against the violence of her appetites, she would not have 
been able to conduct it without a twofold relation to truth: a 
relation to her own desire questioned in its being, and a rela¬ 
tion to the object of her desire recognized as a true being. 

Thus, we see where ground is broken for a future inquiry 
into desiring man. Which does not mean that Platonic erotics 
has suddenly and permanently taken leave of the ethics of
