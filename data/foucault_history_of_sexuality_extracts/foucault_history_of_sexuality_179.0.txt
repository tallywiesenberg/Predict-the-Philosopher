pleasures and their use. We shall see on the contrary that the 
latter continued to develop and transform itself. But the tradi- 



True Love

tion of thought that stems from Plato was to play an important 
role when, much later, the problematization of sexual behav¬ 
ior would be reworked in terms of the concupiscent soul and 
the deciphering of its arcana. 

This philosophical reflection concerning boys suggests a 
historical paradox. To this male love, and more precisely to 
this love of young boys and adolescents—a love that was later 
to be so severely condemned for such a long time—the Greeks 
granted a legitimacy, which we are fond of seeing as proof of 
the freedom they granted themselves in this domain. And yet 
it was in connection with this love, much more than with 
health (which also preoccupied them) and much more than 
with women and marriage (the orderliness of which they 
nevertheless sought to maintain), that they spoke of the need 
to practice the strictest austerities. To be sure, except in a few 
instances, they did not condemn it or prohibit it. And yet it 
is in the reflection on love of boys that one sees the principle 
of “indefinite abstention” formulated; the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion, which Socrates exemplifies by his faultless resistance of 
temptation; and the theme that this renunciation has a high 
spiritual value by itself. In a way that may be surprising at 
first, one sees the formation, in Greek culture and in connec¬ 
tion with the love of boys, of some of the major elements of 
a sexual ethics that will renounce that love by appealing to the 
above principle: the requirement of a symmetry and reciproc¬ 
ity in the love relationship; the necessity of a long and arduous 
struggle with oneself; the gradual purification of a love that is 
addressed only to being per se, in its truth; and man’s inquiry 
into himself as a subject of desire. 

One would be missing the crucial point if one imagined that 
the love of boys gave rise to its own interdiction, or that an 
ambiguity peculiar to philosophy accepted its reality only by 
demanding its supercession. One should keep in mind that this 
“asceticism” was not a means of disqualifying the love of boys; 
on the contrary, it was a means of stylizing it and hence, by 
giving it shape and form, of valorizing it. The fact remains,

The Use of Pleasure 


however, that within this asceticism total abstention was pos¬ 
ited as a standard and privilege was given to the question of 
desire, so that elements were introduced that could not easily 
be accommodated in an ethics organized around a search for 
the right use of pleasures. 






Thus, in the field of practices that they singled out for 
special attention (regimen, household management, the 
“courting” of young men) and in the context of the discourses 
that tended to elaborate these practices, the Greeks questioned 
themselves about sexual behavior as an ethical problem, and 
they sought to define the form of moderation that it required. 

This does not mean that the Greeks in general concerned 
themselves with sexual pleasure only from these three points 
of view. One would find in the literature that they have left us 
much evidence of other themes and preoccupations. But re¬ 
stricting oneself, as I have tried to do here, to the prescriptive 
discourses by which they attempted to reflect on and regulate 
their sexual conduct, these three focuses of problematization 
appear to have been the most important ones by far. Around 
them, the Greeks developed arts of living, of conducting them¬ 
selves, and of “using pleasures” according to austere and de¬ 
manding principles. 

At first glance, one can have the impression that these three 
different forms of reflection bear a close resemblance to the 
forms of austerity that will be found later, in the Western, 
Christian societies. In any case, one may be tempted to correct 
the still rather commonly accepted notion of an opposition 
between a pagan thought that “tolerated” the practice of “sex¬ 
ual freedom” and the gloomy and restrictive moralities that 
succeeded it. In fact, though, it is important to recognize that 
the principle of a rigorous and diligently practiced sexual 
moderation is a precept that does not date either from Chris¬ 
tian times, obviously, or from late antiquity, or even from the 
rigorist movements—such as were associated with the Stoics,
