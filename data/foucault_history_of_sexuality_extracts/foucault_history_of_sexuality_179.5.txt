The Use of Pleasure 


however, that within this asceticism total abstention was pos¬ 
ited as a standard and privilege was given to the question of 
desire, so that elements were introduced that could not easily 
be accommodated in an ethics organized around a search for 
the right use of pleasures. 






Thus, in the field of practices that they singled out for 
special attention (regimen, household management, the 
“courting” of young men) and in the context of the discourses 
that tended to elaborate these practices, the Greeks questioned 
themselves about sexual behavior as an ethical problem, and 
they sought to define the form of moderation that it required. 

This does not mean that the Greeks in general concerned 
themselves with sexual pleasure only from these three points 
of view. One would find in the literature that they have left us 
much evidence of other themes and preoccupations. But re¬ 
stricting oneself, as I have tried to do here, to the prescriptive 
discourses by which they attempted to reflect on and regulate 
their sexual conduct, these three focuses of problematization 
appear to have been the most important ones by far. Around 
them, the Greeks developed arts of living, of conducting them¬ 
selves, and of “using pleasures” according to austere and de¬ 
manding principles. 

At first glance, one can have the impression that these three 
different forms of reflection bear a close resemblance to the 
forms of austerity that will be found later, in the Western, 
Christian societies. In any case, one may be tempted to correct 
the still rather commonly accepted notion of an opposition 
between a pagan thought that “tolerated” the practice of “sex¬ 
ual freedom” and the gloomy and restrictive moralities that 
succeeded it. In fact, though, it is important to recognize that 
the principle of a rigorous and diligently practiced sexual 
moderation is a precept that does not date either from Chris¬ 
tian times, obviously, or from late antiquity, or even from the 
rigorist movements—such as were associated with the Stoics,
