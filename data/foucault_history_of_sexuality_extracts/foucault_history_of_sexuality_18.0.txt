So too were all those minor perverts whom nineteenth- 
century psychiatrists entomologized by giving them strange 
baptismal names: there were KrafFt-Ebing’s zoophiles and 
zooerasts, Rohleder’s auto-monosexualists; and later, mixo- 
scopophiles, gynecomasts, presbyophiles, sexoesthetic in¬ 
verts, and dyspareunist women. These fine names for heresies 
referred to a nature that was overlooked by the law, but not 
so neglectful of itself that it did not go on producing more 
species, even where there was no order to fit them into. The

The History of Sexuality 


machinery of power that focused on this whole alien strain 
did not aim to suppress it, but rather to give it an analytical, 
visible, and permanent reality: it was implanted in bodies, 
slipped in beneath modes of conduct, made into a principle 
of classification and intelligibility, established as a raison 
d'etre and a natural order of disorder. Not the exclusion of 
these thousand aberrant sexualities, but the specification, the 
regional solidification of each one of them. The strategy 
behind this dissemination was to strew reality with them and 
incorporate them into the individual. 

3. More than the old taboos, this form of power demanded 
constant, attentive, and curious presences for its exercise; it 
presupposed proximities; it proceeded through examination 
and insistent observation; it required an exchange of dis¬ 
courses, through questions that extorted admissions, and 
confidences that went beyond the questions that were asked. 
It implied a physical proximity and an interplay of intense 
sensations. The medicalization of the sexually peculiar was 
both the effect and the instrument of this. Imbedded in bod¬ 
ies, becoming deeply characteristic of individuals, the oddi¬ 
ties of sex relied on a technology of health and pathology. 
And conversely, since sexuality was a medical and medicaliz- 
able object, one had to try and detect it—as a lesion, a 
dysfunction, or a symptom—in the depths of the organism, 
or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of 
behavior. The power which thus took charge of sexuality set 
about contacting bodies, caressing them with its eyes, inten¬ 
sifying areas, electrifying surfaces, dramatizing troubled mo¬ 
ments. It wrapped the sexual body in its embrace. There was
