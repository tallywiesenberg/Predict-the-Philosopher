So too were all those minor perverts whom nineteenth- 
century psychiatrists entomologized by giving them strange 
baptismal names: there were KrafFt-Ebing’s zoophiles and 
zooerasts, Rohleder’s auto-monosexualists; and later, mixo- 
scopophiles, gynecomasts, presbyophiles, sexoesthetic in¬ 
verts, and dyspareunist women. These fine names for heresies 
referred to a nature that was overlooked by the law, but not 
so neglectful of itself that it did not go on producing more 
species, even where there was no order to fit them into. The

The History of Sexuality 


machinery of power that focused on this whole alien strain 
did not aim to suppress it, but rather to give it an analytical, 
visible, and permanent reality: it was implanted in bodies, 
slipped in beneath modes of conduct, made into a principle 
of classification and intelligibility, established as a raison 
d'etre and a natural order of disorder. Not the exclusion of 
these thousand aberrant sexualities, but the specification, the 
regional solidification of each one of them. The strategy 
behind this dissemination was to strew reality with them and 
incorporate them into the individual. 

3. More than the old taboos, this form of power demanded 
constant, attentive, and curious presences for its exercise; it 
presupposed proximities; it proceeded through examination 
and insistent observation; it required an exchange of dis¬ 
courses, through questions that extorted admissions, and 
confidences that went beyond the questions that were asked. 
It implied a physical proximity and an interplay of intense 
sensations. The medicalization of the sexually peculiar was 
both the effect and the instrument of this. Imbedded in bod¬ 
ies, becoming deeply characteristic of individuals, the oddi¬ 
ties of sex relied on a technology of health and pathology. 
And conversely, since sexuality was a medical and medicaliz- 
able object, one had to try and detect it—as a lesion, a 
dysfunction, or a symptom—in the depths of the organism, 
or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of 
behavior. The power which thus took charge of sexuality set 
about contacting bodies, caressing them with its eyes, inten¬ 
sifying areas, electrifying surfaces, dramatizing troubled mo¬ 
ments. It wrapped the sexual body in its embrace. There was 
undoubtedly an increase in effectiveness and an extension of 
the domain controlled; but also a sensualization of power and 
a gain of pleasure. This produced a twofold effect: an impetus 
was given to power through its very exercise; an emotion 
rewarded the overseeing control and carried it further; the 
intensity of the confession renewed the questioner’s curios¬ 
ity; the pleasure discovered fed back to the power that encir-

cled it. But so many pressing questions singularized the 
pleasures felt by the one who had to reply. They were fixed 
by a gaze, isolated and animated by the attention they re¬ 
ceived. Power operated as a mechanism of attraction; it drew 
out those peculiarities over which it kept watch. Pleasure 
spread to the power that harried it; power anchored the 
pleasure it uncovered. 

The medical examination, the psychiatric investigation, 
the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the 
over-all and apparent objective of saying no to all wayward 
or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function 
as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power. 
The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions, 
monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to 
light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at 
having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty 
it. The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is 
pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleas¬ 
ure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting. Capture and 
seduction, confrontation and mutual reinforcement: parents 
and children, adults and adolescents, educator and students, 
doctors and patients, the psychiatrist with his hysteric and 
his perverts, all have played this game continually since the 
nineteenth century. These attractions, these evasions, these 
circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes, 
not boundaries not to be crossed, but perpetual spirals of 
power and pleasure. 

4. Whence those devices of sexual saturation so character¬ 
istic of the space and the social rituals of the nineteenth 
century. People often say that modern society has attempted 
to reduce sexuality to the couple—the heterosexual and, in¬ 
sofar as possible, legitimate couple. There are equal grounds
