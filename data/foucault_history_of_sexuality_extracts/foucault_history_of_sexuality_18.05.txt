But more generally, it fell between what 
might be called the “active actors” in the drama of pleasures, 
and the “passive actors”: on one side, those who were the 
subjects of sexual activity (and who were expected to carry it 
out in a measured and opportune manner); and on the other, 
those who were the object-partners, the supporting players 
with whom it was carried out.The first were men, naturally, 
but more specifically they were adult free men; the second 
included women of course, but women made up only one 
element of a much larger group that was sometimes referred 
to as a way of designating the objects of possible pleasure: 
“women, boys, slaves.” In the text known as the Hippocratic 
Oath, the doctor pledges to refrain from erga aphrodisia in 
every house he enters, with any person whatsoever, whether 
a woman, a free man, or a slave.31 

Hence the second major variable that engaged moral valua¬ 
tion, in addition to the “quantity of activity” criterion, was the 
question of remaining in one’s role or abandoning it, being the 
subject of the activity or its object, joining those who under¬ 
went it—even if one was a man—or remaining with those 
who actively performed it.For a man, excess and passivity 
were the two main forms of immorality in the practice of the 
aphrodisia.2.
