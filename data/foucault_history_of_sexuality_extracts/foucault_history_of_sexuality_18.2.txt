suffering (in contrast to the pleasures of sight and hearing); it 
depended on the body and its necessities and it was aimed at 
restoring the organism to its state prior to need.37 But there 
was also the fact that this conditioned, subordinate, and in¬ 
ferior pleasure was extremely acute; as Plato explains at the 
beginning of the Laws, if nature arranged for men and women 
to be attracted to one another, it was in order that procreation 
might be possible and the survival of the species might be 
ensured.38 Now, this purpose was so important and it was so 
essential that humans produce descendants, that nature at¬ 
tached an extremely intense pleasure to the act of procreation.Just as animals are reminded of the need to nourish them¬ 
selves, thus assuring their individual survival, by the natural 
pleasure that is associated with eating and drinking, so the 
necessity of begetting offspring, of leaving a progeny behind, 
is constantly recalled by the pleasure and the desire that ac¬ 
company the mating of the sexes.The Laws thus refers to the 
existence of three basic appetites, relating to food, drink, and 
reproduction.
