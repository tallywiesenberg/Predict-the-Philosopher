One understands why, in these conditions, sexual activ¬ 
ity required a moral discrimination that was, as we have seen, 
more dynamic than morphological.If it was necessary, as 
Plato said, to bridle it with the three strongest restraints: fear, 
law, and true reason; if it was necessary, as Aristotle thought, 
for desire to obey reason the way a child obeyed his tutor; if 
Aristippus himself advised that, while it was all right to “use” 
pleasures, one had to be careful not to be carried away by 
them 42 —the reason was not that sexual activity was a vice, nor 
that it might deviate from a canonical model; it was because 
sexual activity was associated with a force, an energeia, that 
was itself liable to be excessive.In the Christian doctrine of 
the flesh, the excessive force of pleasure had its principle in the 
Fall and in the weakness that had marked human nature ever 
since.For classical Greek thought, this force was potentially 
excessive by nature, and the moral question was how to con¬ 
front this force, how to control it and regulate its economy in 
a suitable way.The fact that sexual activity appeared in the form of a play 
of forces established by nature, but subject to abuse, related 
it to eating and the moral problems the latter tended to pose.
