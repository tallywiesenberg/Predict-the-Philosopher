This association between the ethics of sex and the ethics of the 
table was a constant factor in ancient culture.One could find 
countless examples of it.When, in the first book of the 
Memorabilia, he wants to show how useful Socrates was to his 
disciples, by his example and his observations, Xenophon sets 
forth the precepts and conduct of his master “concerning 
eating and drinking and the pleasures of love.” 43 The inter¬ 
locutors of the Republic, when they deal with the education 
of guardians, come to agree that moderation (sophrosyne) 
demands the threefold mastery of the pleasures of drink, sex, 
and food (potoi, aphrodisia, edodai ).44 And Aristotle follows

suit: in the Nicomachean Ethics, the three examples he gives 
of “common pleasures” are those of eating, drinking, and, for 
youths and vigorous men, the “pleasures of the bed.” 45 In 
these three forms of pleasure, he recognizes the same type of 
danger: that of exceeding what is necessary; he even identifies 
a physiological principle that they hold in common, noting 
pleasures of contact and touch in all three (according to him, 
food and drink do not cause their particular pleasure except 
by coming in contact with the tongue and especially the 
throat).46 When he speaks in the Symposium, the doctor Eryx- 
imachus claims for his art the prerogative of advising on the 
manner in which one must make use of the pleasures of the 
bed and the table; according to him, it is doctors who ought 
to say how to enjoy rich food without making oneself sick; it 
also rests with them to prescribe, to those who practice physi¬ 
cal love—Eros Pandemos—how to have an orgasm without 
any resulting ill effects.
