To 
what principles does he refer in order to moderate, limit, 
regulate that activity?What sort of validity might these princi¬ 
ples have that would enable a man to justify his having to obey 
them?Or, in other words, what is the mode of subjection that 
is implied in this moral problematization of sexual conduct?The goal of moral reflection on the aphrodisia was much 
less to establish a systematic code that would determine the 
canonical form of sexual acts, trace out the boundary of the 
prohibitions, and assign practices to one side or the other of 
a dividing line, than to work out the conditions and modalities 
of a “use”; that is, to define a style for what the Greeks called 
chresis aphrodision, the use of pleasures.The common expres¬ 
sion chresis aphrodision related, in a general way, to sexual 
activity (for example, people would speak of times of the year 
or the age in one’s life when it was good to chresthai aphrodisi- 
ois).'
