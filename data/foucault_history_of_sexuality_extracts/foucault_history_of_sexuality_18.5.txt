undoubtedly an increase in effectiveness and an extension of 
the domain controlled; but also a sensualization of power and 
a gain of pleasure. This produced a twofold effect: an impetus 
was given to power through its very exercise; an emotion 
rewarded the overseeing control and carried it further; the 
intensity of the confession renewed the questioner’s curios¬ 
ity; the pleasure discovered fed back to the power that encir-

cled it. But so many pressing questions singularized the 
pleasures felt by the one who had to reply. They were fixed 
by a gaze, isolated and animated by the attention they re¬ 
ceived. Power operated as a mechanism of attraction; it drew 
out those peculiarities over which it kept watch. Pleasure 
spread to the power that harried it; power anchored the 
pleasure it uncovered. 

The medical examination, the psychiatric investigation, 
the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the 
over-all and apparent objective of saying no to all wayward 
or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function 
as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power. 
The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions, 
monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to 
light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at 
having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty 
it. The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is 
pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleas¬ 
ure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting. Capture and 
seduction, confrontation and mutual reinforcement: parents 
and children, adults and adolescents, educator and students, 
doctors and patients, the psychiatrist with his hysteric and 
his perverts, all have played this game continually since the 
nineteenth century. These attractions, these evasions, these 
circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes, 
not boundaries not to be crossed, but perpetual spirals of 
power and pleasure. 

4. Whence those devices of sexual saturation so character¬ 
istic of the space and the social rituals of the nineteenth 
century. People often say that modern society has attempted 
to reduce sexuality to the couple—the heterosexual and, in¬ 
sofar as possible, legitimate couple. There are equal grounds
