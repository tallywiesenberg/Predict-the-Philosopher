The scandalous gesture of Dioge¬ 
nes is well known: when he needed to satisfy his sexual appe¬ 
tite, he would relieve himself in the marketplace.5 Like many 
of the Cynics’ provocations, this one had a double meaning.It owed its impact to the public character of the act, of course, 
which went against every convention in Greece; it was cus¬ 
tomary to assert the need for privacy as a reason for making 
love only at night, and the care one took not to let oneself be 
seen engaging in this kind of activity was regarded as a sign 
that the practice of aphrodisia was not something that hon¬ 
ored the most noble qualities of mankind.It was against this 
rule of privacy that Diogenes directed his “performance” criti¬ 
cism.Diogenes Laertius reports that in fact he was in the habit 
of “doing everything in public, the works of Demeter and 
Aphrodite alike,” reasoning as follows: “If breakfast be not 
absurd, neither is it absurd to breakfast in the market-place.” 6

simplest food that might gratify his stomach (it seems that he 
tried eating raw meat), he likewise found in masturbation the 
most direct means of appeasing his sexual appetite.
