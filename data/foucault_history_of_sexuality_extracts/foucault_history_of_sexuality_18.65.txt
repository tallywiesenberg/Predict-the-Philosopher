He even 
regretted that it was not possible to satisfy hunger and thirst 
in so simple a manner: “Would to heaven that it were enough 
to rub one’s stomach in order to allay one’s hunger.” 

In this, Diogenes was only pushing to its logical extreme 
one of the great precepts of the chresis aphrodision.He was 
reducing to a minimum the behavior that Antisthenes had 
already advocated in Xenophon’s Symposium: “If I ever feel 
a natural desire to have sex with women, I am so well satisfied 
with whatever chance puts in my way that those to whom I 
make my advances are more than glad to welcome me because 
they have no one else to consort with them.In a word, all these 
items appeal to me as being so conducive to enjoyment that 
I could not pray for greater pleasure in performing any one 
of them, but could pray rather for less—so much more plea¬ 
surable do I regard some of them than is good for one.” 7 
Antisthenes’ regimen is not very far removed in principle 
(even if the practical consequences are quite different) from 
several precepts or examples that Socrates, according to Xeno¬ 
phon, gave to his disciples.For if he recommended that those 
who were insufficiently fortified against the pleasures of love 
flee from the sight of beautiful boys, and go into exile if neces¬ 
sary, he did not in any case advocate a total, definitive, and 
unconditional abstention.The Socratic lesson, at least as 
Xenophon presents it, was that people should “limit them¬ 
selves to such indulgence as the soul would reject unless the 
need of the body were pressing, and such as would do no harm 
when the need was there.” 8 

But in this need-regulated use of the aphrodisia, the objec¬ 
tive was not to reduce pleasure to nothing; on the contrary, 
what was wanted was to maintain it and to do so through the
