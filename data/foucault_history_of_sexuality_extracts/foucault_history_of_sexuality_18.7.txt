Everyone knew that pleasure was 
dulled if it offered no satisfaction to the keenness of a desire: 
“To my friends, meat and drink bring sweet and simple enjoy¬ 
ment [hedeia ...apolausis apragmon]," 1 says Virtue in Prodi- 
cus’ speech as reported by Socrates, “for they wait till they 
crave them.’’ 9 And in a discussion with Euthydemus, Socrates 
remarks that “hunger or thirst or desire [aphrodision epi- 
thumia] or lack of sleep are the sole causes of pleasure in 
eating and drinking and sexual indulgence, and in resting or 
sleeping, after a time of waiting and resistance until the mo¬ 
ment comes when these will give the greatest possible satisfac¬ 
tion [hos eni hedista]."10 But if pleasure must be sustained 
through desire, this did not mean that, conversely, desires 
must be increased by recourse to pleasures that were not of a 
natural kind.
