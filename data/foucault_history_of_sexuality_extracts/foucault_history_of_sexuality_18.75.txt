It is fatigue, says Prodicus, and not continuous 
idleness, that ought to make one feel like sleeping; and if it was 
proper to satisfy sexual desires when they appeared, it was not 
good to create desires that went beyond needs.Need ought to 
serve as a guiding principle in this strategy, which clearly 
could never take the form of a precise codification or a law 
applicable to everyone alike in every circumstance.The strat¬ 
egy made possible an equilibrium in the dynamics of pleasure 
and desire: it kept this dynamics from “running away,” from 
becoming excessive, by setting the satisfaction of a need as its 
internal limit; and it prevented this natural force from revolt¬ 
ing, from usurping a place that was not its own, because it 
provided only for what was necessary to the body and was 
intended by nature, and nothing more.At the same time it enabled one to avoid immoderation, 
which was, strictly speaking, a behavior that did not have its 
basis in nature.It was for this reason that it could assume two 
forms against which the ethical regimen of pleasures had to 
struggle.
