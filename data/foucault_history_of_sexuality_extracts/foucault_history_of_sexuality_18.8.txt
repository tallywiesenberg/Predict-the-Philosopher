“used men as women” 12 in order to find new pleasures in the 
aphrodisia.Understood in this way, moderation could not 
take the form of an obedience to a system of laws or a codifica¬ 
tion of behaviors; nor could it serve as a principle for nullify¬ 
ing pleasures; it was an art, a practice of pleasures that was 
capable of self-limitation through the “use” of those pleasures 
that were based on need: “Self-control alone,” says Socrates, 
“causes them to endure the sufferings I have named, and 
therefore she alone causes them to experience any pleasure 
worth mentioning in such enjoyments.” 13 And this is how 
Socrates himself experienced them in everyday life, according 
to Xenophon: “He ate just sufficient food to make eating a 
pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found 
appetite the best sauce; and any kind of drink he found pleas¬ 
ant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.” 14
