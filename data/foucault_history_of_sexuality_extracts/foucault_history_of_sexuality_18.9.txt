Doctors thought 
that it was not good to begin the practice of pleasures too 
young; they also thought that it could be harmful if one ex¬ 
tended it to an advanced age; it had its season in life.In 
general, the latter was limited to a period characterized not 
only as the span during which procreation was possible, but 
also that in which the offspring would be healthy, well formed, 
and robust.* There was also the scale of the year, with its 
seasons: as we shall see in Part Two, dietary regimens attached 
great importance to the correlation between sexual activity 
and climatic variation, between cold and heat, humidity and 
dryness.It was also recommended to choose the right time of 
day: one of Plutarch’s “table talks” deals with this problem, 
and proposes a solution that appears to have been traditional; 
dietary reasons, but also reasons of decency and religious 
considerations, argued for the evening, for this was the time 
most favorable to the body, the moment when darkness blot¬ 
ted out unseemly images, and when it was possible to insert 
the space of a night between that activity and the next morn¬ 
ing’s religious observances.17 The choice of moment—of the 
kairos —ought to depend on other activities as well.
