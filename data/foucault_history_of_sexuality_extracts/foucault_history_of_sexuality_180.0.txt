The Use of Pleasure 


the fourth century, one finds very clearly formulated the idea 
that sexual activity is sufficiently hazardous and costly in 
itself, and sufficiently linked to the loss of the vital substance, 
to require a meticulous economy that would discourage un¬ 
necessary indulgence. One also finds the model of a matrimo¬ 
nial relationship that would demand a similar abstention from 
all “extramarital” pleasure by either spouse. Furthermore, 
one finds the theme of the man’s renunciation of all physical 
relations with a boy. A general principle of moderation, a 
suspicion that sexual pleasure might be an evil, the schema of 
a strict monogamous fidelity, the ideal of an absolute chastity: 
obviously it was not according to such a model that the Greeks 
lived; but isn’t it the case that the philosophical, moral, and 
medical thought that formed in their midst formulated some 
of the basic principles that later ethics—and particularly those 
found in the Christian societies—seem to have only had to 
revive? We cannot stop there, however; the prescriptions may 
be formally alike, but this actually shows only the poverty and 
monotony of interdictions. The way in which sexual activity 
was constituted, recognized, and organized as a moral issue is 
not identical from the mere fact that what was allowed or 
prohibited, recommended or discouraged is identical. 

We have seen how sexual behavior was constituted, in 
Greek thought, as a domain of ethical practice in the form of 
the aphrodisia, of pleasurable acts situated in an agonistic field 
of forces difficult to control. In order to take the form of a 
conduct that was rationally and morally admissible, these acts 
required a strategy of moderation and timing, of quantity and 
opportunity; and this strategy aimed at an exact self-mastery 
—as its culmination and consummation—whereby the subject 
would be “stronger than himself’ even in the power that he 
exercised over others. Now, the requirement of austerity that 
was implied by the constitution of this self-disciplined subject 
was not presented in the form of a universal law, which each 
and every individual would have to obey, but rather as a 
principle of stylization of conduct for those who wished to give

their existence the most graceful and accomplished form pos¬ 
sible. If one wanted to assign an origin to those few great 
themes that shaped our sexual morality (the idea that pleasure 
belongs to the dangerous domain of evil, the obligation to 
practice monogamous fidelity, the exclusion of partners of the 
same sex), not only would it be a mistake to attribute them to 
that fiction called “Judeo-Christian” morality, it would be a 
bigger mistake to look behind them for the timeless operation 
of prohibition, or the permanent form of law. The sexual 
austerity that was prematurely recommended by Greek phi¬ 
losophy is not rooted in the timelessness of a law that would 
take the historically diverse forms of repression, one after the 
other. It belongs to a history that is more decisive for compre¬ 
hending the transformations of moral experience than the 
history of codes: a history of “ethics,” understood as the elabo¬ 
ration of a form of relation to self that enables an individual 
to fashion himself into a subject of ethical conduct. 

Further, each of the three great arts of self-conduct, the 
three major techniques of the self, that were developed in 
Greek thought—dietetics, economics, and erotics—proposed, 
if not a particular sexual ethics, then at least a singular modu¬ 
lation of sexual conduct. In this elaboration of the demands 
of austerity, not only did the Greeks not seek to define a code 
of conducts binding everyone, neither did they seek to orga¬ 
nize sexual behavior as a domain governed in all its aspects by 
one and the same set of principles. 

In dietetics, one finds a form of moderation defined by the 
measured and timely use of the aphrodisia; the practice of this 
moderation called for an attention centered mainly on the 
question of “the right time” and on the correlation between 
the variable states of the body and the changing proprieties of 
the seasons. And at the core of this preoccupation there was 
manifested a fear of violence, a dread of exhaustion, and a 
twofold anxiety about the survival of the individual and the 
maintenance of the species. In economics, one finds a form of 
moderation defined not by the mutual faithfulness of marriage
