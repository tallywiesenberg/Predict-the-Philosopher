The Use of Pleasure 


the fourth century, one finds very clearly formulated the idea 
that sexual activity is sufficiently hazardous and costly in 
itself, and sufficiently linked to the loss of the vital substance, 
to require a meticulous economy that would discourage un¬ 
necessary indulgence. One also finds the model of a matrimo¬ 
nial relationship that would demand a similar abstention from 
all “extramarital” pleasure by either spouse. Furthermore, 
one finds the theme of the man’s renunciation of all physical 
relations with a boy. A general principle of moderation, a 
suspicion that sexual pleasure might be an evil, the schema of 
a strict monogamous fidelity, the ideal of an absolute chastity: 
obviously it was not according to such a model that the Greeks 
lived; but isn’t it the case that the philosophical, moral, and 
medical thought that formed in their midst formulated some 
of the basic principles that later ethics—and particularly those 
found in the Christian societies—seem to have only had to 
revive? We cannot stop there, however; the prescriptions may 
be formally alike, but this actually shows only the poverty and 
monotony of interdictions. The way in which sexual activity 
was constituted, recognized, and organized as a moral issue is 
not identical from the mere fact that what was allowed or 
prohibited, recommended or discouraged is identical. 

We have seen how sexual behavior was constituted, in 
Greek thought, as a domain of ethical practice in the form of 
the aphrodisia, of pleasurable acts situated in an agonistic field 
of forces difficult to control. In order to take the form of a 
conduct that was rationally and morally admissible, these acts 
required a strategy of moderation and timing, of quantity and 
opportunity; and this strategy aimed at an exact self-mastery 
—as its culmination and consummation—whereby the subject 
would be “stronger than himself’ even in the power that he 
exercised over others. Now, the requirement of austerity that 
was implied by the constitution of this self-disciplined subject 
was not presented in the form of a universal law, which each 
and every individual would have to obey, but rather as a 
principle of stylization of conduct for those who wished to give
