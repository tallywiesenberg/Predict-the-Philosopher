partners, but by a certain privilege, which the husband 
upholds on behalf of the lawf ul wife over whom he exercises 
his authority; the temporal objective in this case is not to seize 
the opportune moment, but to maintain, throughout life, a 
certain hierarchical structure appropriate to the household; it 
is with a view to ensuring this permanence that the man must 
fear all excess and practice self-control in the control he exer¬ 
cises over others. Lastly, the moderation that is required by 
erotics is of another type still, for even though it does not call 
for pure and simple abstention, we have seen that it tends in 
that direction and that it carries with it the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion of all physical relations with boys. This erotics is linked 
to a perception of time that is very different from that found 
in connection with the body and with marriage: it experiences 
a fleeting time that leads ineluctably to an end that is near. As 
for the concern that animates it, it is that of the respect that 
is owing to the virility of the adolescent and to his future status 
as a free man. It is no longer simply the problem of a man’s 
becoming the master of his pleasure; it is a problem of know¬ 
ing how one can make allowance for the other’s freedom in the 
mastery that one exercises over oneself and in the true love 
that one bears for him. And finally, it is in this reflection 
concerning the love of boys that Platonic erotics raises the 
question of the complex relations between love, the renuncia¬ 
tion of pleasures, and access to truth. 

It may be useful to recall something that K. J. Dover has 
written: “The Greeks neither inherited nor developed a belief 
that a divine power had revealed to mankind a code of laws 
for the regulation of sexual behavior; they had no religious 
institution possessed of the authority to enforce sexual prohi¬ 
bitions. Confronted by cultures older and richer and more 
elaborate than theirs, cultures which nonetheless differed 
greatly from each other, the Greeks felt free to select, adapt, 
develop and—above all—innovate.” 1 For them, reflection on 
sexual behavior as a moral domain was not a means of inter¬ 
nalizing, justifying, or formalizing general interdictions im-

posed on everyone; rather, it was a means of developing—for 
the smallest minority of the population, made up of free, adult 
males—an aesthetics of existence, the purposeful art of a free¬ 
dom perceived as a power game. Their sexual ethics, from 
which our own derives in part, rested on a very harsh system 
of inequalities and constraints (particularly in connection with 
women and slaves); but it was problematized in thought as the 
relationship, for a free man, between the exercise of his free¬ 
dom, the forms of his power, and his access to truth. 

Taking a very schematic, bird’s-eye view of the history of 
this ethics and its transformations over a long period of time, 
one notes first of all a shift of emphasis. It is clear that in 
classical Greek thought it was the relationship with boys that 
constituted the most delicate point, and the most active focus 
of reflection and elaboration; it was here that the problemati- 
zation called for the most subtle forms of austerity. Now, 
surveying the course of a very slow evolution, we can see this 
focus move elsewhere: it is around women that, little by little, 
the problems come to be centered. This does not mean that the 
love of boys will no longer be practiced, nor that it will cease 
to be expressed, nor that people will no longer raise questions 
about it. But it is women and the relation to women that will 
be stressed in moral reflection on sexual pleasures, whether in 
the form of the theme of virginity, of the importance assumed 
by marital conduct, or of the value attributed to relations of 
symmetry and reciprocity between husband and wife. And we 
can see a new shift of the focus of problematization (this time 
from women to the body) in the interest that was shown, 
starting in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in the 
sexuality of children, and, generally speaking, in the relation¬ 
ships between sexual behavior, normality, and health. 

But at the same time as these shifts, a certain unification 
occurred between the elements that were distributed among 
the different “arts” of using the pleasures. There was a doctri¬ 
nal unification—brought about in part by Saint Augustine— 
that made it possible to conceptualize, as parts of the same
