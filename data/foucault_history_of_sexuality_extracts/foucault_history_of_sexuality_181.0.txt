The Use of Pleasure 


partners, but by a certain privilege, which the husband 
upholds on behalf of the lawf ul wife over whom he exercises 
his authority; the temporal objective in this case is not to seize 
the opportune moment, but to maintain, throughout life, a 
certain hierarchical structure appropriate to the household; it 
is with a view to ensuring this permanence that the man must 
fear all excess and practice self-control in the control he exer¬ 
cises over others. Lastly, the moderation that is required by 
erotics is of another type still, for even though it does not call 
for pure and simple abstention, we have seen that it tends in 
that direction and that it carries with it the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion of all physical relations with boys. This erotics is linked 
to a perception of time that is very different from that found 
in connection with the body and with marriage: it experiences 
a fleeting time that leads ineluctably to an end that is near. As 
for the concern that animates it, it is that of the respect that 
is owing to the virility of the adolescent and to his future status 
as a free man. It is no longer simply the problem of a man’s 
becoming the master of his pleasure; it is a problem of know¬ 
ing how one can make allowance for the other’s freedom in the 
mastery that one exercises over oneself and in the true love 
that one bears for him. And finally, it is in this reflection 
concerning the love of boys that Platonic erotics raises the 
question of the complex relations between love, the renuncia¬ 
tion of pleasures, and access to truth. 

It may be useful to recall something that K. J. Dover has 
written: “The Greeks neither inherited nor developed a belief 
that a divine power had revealed to mankind a code of laws 
for the regulation of sexual behavior; they had no religious 
institution possessed of the authority to enforce sexual prohi¬ 
bitions. Confronted by cultures older and richer and more 
elaborate than theirs, cultures which nonetheless differed 
greatly from each other, the Greeks felt free to select, adapt, 
develop and—above all—innovate.” 1 For them, reflection on 
sexual behavior as a moral domain was not a means of inter¬ 
nalizing, justifying, or formalizing general interdictions im-
