posed on everyone; rather, it was a means of developing—for 
the smallest minority of the population, made up of free, adult 
males—an aesthetics of existence, the purposeful art of a free¬ 
dom perceived as a power game. Their sexual ethics, from 
which our own derives in part, rested on a very harsh system 
of inequalities and constraints (particularly in connection with 
women and slaves); but it was problematized in thought as the 
relationship, for a free man, between the exercise of his free¬ 
dom, the forms of his power, and his access to truth. 

Taking a very schematic, bird’s-eye view of the history of 
this ethics and its transformations over a long period of time, 
one notes first of all a shift of emphasis. It is clear that in 
classical Greek thought it was the relationship with boys that 
constituted the most delicate point, and the most active focus 
of reflection and elaboration; it was here that the problemati- 
zation called for the most subtle forms of austerity. Now, 
surveying the course of a very slow evolution, we can see this 
focus move elsewhere: it is around women that, little by little, 
the problems come to be centered. This does not mean that the 
love of boys will no longer be practiced, nor that it will cease 
to be expressed, nor that people will no longer raise questions 
about it. But it is women and the relation to women that will 
be stressed in moral reflection on sexual pleasures, whether in 
the form of the theme of virginity, of the importance assumed 
by marital conduct, or of the value attributed to relations of 
symmetry and reciprocity between husband and wife. And we 
can see a new shift of the focus of problematization (this time 
from women to the body) in the interest that was shown, 
starting in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in the 
sexuality of children, and, generally speaking, in the relation¬ 
ships between sexual behavior, normality, and health. 

But at the same time as these shifts, a certain unification 
occurred between the elements that were distributed among 
the different “arts” of using the pleasures. There was a doctri¬ 
nal unification—brought about in part by Saint Augustine— 
that made it possible to conceptualize, as parts of the same
