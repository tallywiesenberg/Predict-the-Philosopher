institution of marriage, and the conditions of access to truth. 
But there was also a “practical” unification that recentered the 
different arts of existence around the decipherment of the self, 
purification procedures, and struggles against concupiscence. 
So that what was now at the core of the problematization of 
sexual conduct was no longer pleasure and the aesthetics of its 
use, but desire and its purifying hermeneutics. 

This change was the result of a whole series of transforma¬ 
tions. We have evidence of the beginnings of these transforma¬ 
tions, even before the development of Christianity, in the 
reflection of the moralists, philosophers, and doctors of the 
first two centuries of our era.
