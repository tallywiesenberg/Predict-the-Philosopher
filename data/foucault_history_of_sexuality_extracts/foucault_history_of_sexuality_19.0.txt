for saying that it has, if not created, at least outfitted and 
made to proliferate, groups with multiple elements and a 
circulating sexuality: a distribution of points of power, hier¬ 
archized and placed opposite to one another; “pursued”

The History of Sexuality 


pleasures, that is, both sought after and searched out; com- 
partmental sexualities that are tolerated or encouraged; 
proximities that serve as surveillance procedures, and func¬ 
tion as mechanisms of intensification; contacts that operate 
as inductors. This is the way things worked in the case of the 
family, or rather the household, with parents, children, and 
in some instances, servants. Was the nineteenth-century fam¬ 
ily really a monogamic and conjugal cell? Perhaps to a cer¬ 
tain extent. But it was also a network of pleasures and powers 
linked together at multiple points and according to trans¬ 
formable relationships. The separation of grown-ups and 
children, the polarity established between the parents’ bed¬ 
room and that of the children (it became routine in the 
course of the century when working-class housing construc¬ 
tion was undertaken), the relative segregation of boys and 
girls, the strict instructions as to the care of nursing infants 
(maternal breast-feeding, hygiene), the attention focused on 
infantile sexuality, the supposed dangers of masturbation, 
the importance attached to puberty, the methods of surveil¬ 
lance suggested to parents, the exhortations, secrets, and 
fears, the presence—both valued and feared—of servants: all 
this made the family, even when brought down to its smallest 
dimensions, a complicated network, saturated with multiple, 
fragmentary, and mobile sexualities. To reduce them to the 
conjugal relationship, and then to project the latter, in the 
form of a forbidden desire, onto the children, cannot account 
for this apparatus which, in relation to these sexualities, was 
less a principle of inhibition than an inciting and multiplying 
mechanism. Educational or psychiatric institutions, with 
their large populations, their hierarchies, their spatial ar¬ 
rangements, their surveillance systems, constituted, along¬ 
side the family, another way of distributing the interplay of 
powers and pleasures; but they too delineated areas of ex¬ 
treme sexual saturation, with privileged spaces or rituals 
such as the classroom, the dormitory, the visit, and the con¬ 
sultation. The forms of a nonconjugal, nonmonogamous sex¬ 
uality were drawn there and established. 



The Repressive Hypothesis

Nineteenth-century “bourgeois” society—and it is doubt¬ 
less still with us—was a society of blatant and fragmented 
perversion. And this was not by way of hypocrisy, for noth¬ 
ing was more manifest and more prolix, or more manifestly 
taken over by discourses and institutions. Not because, hav¬ 
ing tried to erect too rigid or too general a barrier against 
sexuality, society succeeded only in giving rise to a whole 
perverse outbreak and a long pathology of the sexual instinct. 
At issue, rather, is the type of power it brought to bear on 
the body and on sex. In point of fact, this power had neither 
the form of the law, nor the effects of the taboo. On the 
contrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities. It 
did not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various 
forms of sexuality, pursuing them according to lines of indefi¬ 
nite penetration. It did not exclude sexuality, but included it 
in the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It did 
not seek to avoid it; it attracted its varieties by means of 
spirals in which pleasure and power reinforced one another. 
It did not set up a barrier; it provided places of maximum 
saturation. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic. 
Modern society is perverse, not in spite of its puritanism or 
as if from a backlash provoked by its hypocrisy; it is in actual 
fact, and directly, perverse. 

In actual fact. The manifold sexualities—those which ap¬ 
pear with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the 
child), those which become fixated on particular tastes or 
practices (the sexuality of the invert, the gerontophile, the 
fetishist), those which, in a diffuse manner, invest relation¬ 
ships (the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher and stu¬ 
dent, psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt 
spaces (the sexuality of the home, the school, the prison)— 
all form the correlate of exact procedures of power. We must 
not imagine that all these things that were formerly tolerated 
attracted notice and received a pejorative designation when 
the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of 
sexuality that was capable of reproducing labor power and 
the form of the family. These polymorphous conducts were
