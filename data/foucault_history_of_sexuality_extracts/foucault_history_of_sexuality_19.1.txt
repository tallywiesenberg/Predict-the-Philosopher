It 
seems, on the other hand, that in the classical ethics, with the 
exception of a few precepts that applied to everyone, standards 
of sexual morality were always tailored to one’s way of life, 
which was itself determined by the status one had inherited 
and the purposes one had chosen.The same Demosthenes of 
the Erotic Essay addresses Epicrates in order to “counsel him 
on the means of rendering his life still more worthy of es¬ 
teem”; he does not want to see the young man make decisions 
that are not based on “the right advice on the conduct of life”; 
and this good advice is not given in order to review the general 
principles of behavior, but to point up the legitimate difference 
that exists among moral criteria: “we do not reproach men of 
humble and insignificant natural gifts even when they commit 
a dishonorable act”; on the other hand, if they are someone 
like Epicrates himself, who has “attained distinction, even a 
bit of negligence in some matter of high honor brings dis¬ 
grace.” 21 It was a generally accepted principle of government 
that the more one was in the public eye, the more authority 
one had or wanted to have over others, and the more one 
sought to make one’s life into a brilliant work whose reputa¬ 
tion would spread far and last long—the more necessary it was 
to adopt and maintain, freely and deliberately, rigorous stan¬ 
dards of sexual conduct.Such was the counsel given by Simo¬ 
nides to Hiero concerning “meat and drink and sleep and 
love”: these were pleasures that all creatures alike seemed to 
enjoy, whereas the love of honor and praise was peculiar to 
humans, and it was that love which enabled one to endure 
dangers and privations.22 And this was also the manner in

which Agesilaus conducted himself, again according to Xeno¬ 
phon, with regard to the pleasures “that prove too strong for 
many men”; indeed, he thought that “a ruler’s superiority 
over ordinary men should be shown not by weakness but by 
endurance.” 23 

Moderation was quite regularly represented among the 
qualities that belonged—or at least should belong—not just to 
anyone but particularly to those who had rank, status, and 
responsibility in the city.When the Socrates of the Memora¬ 
bilia describes for Critobulus the gentleman whose friendship 
is worth seeking, he places moderation on the list of qualities 
that characterize a man worthy of social esteem—a list that 
includes being ready to render a service to a friend, being 
disposed to return kindnesses received, and being accom¬ 
modating in business matters.
