24 In order to show the advan¬ 
tages of moderation to his disciple Aristippus, who “was 
rather intemperate in such matters,” Socrates, still according 
to Xenophon, asks the question: if he had to educate two 
youths, one of whom would go on to lead an ordinary life and 
the other would be destined to command, which of the two 
would he teach to “control his passions” so that they would 
not hinder him from doing what he would have to do?25 Else¬ 
where in the Memorabilia, Socrates submits that since people 
prefer to have slaves who are not intemperate, all the more 
when it comes to choosing a leader, “should we choose one 
whom we know to be the slave of the belly, or of wine, or lust, 
or sleep?” 26 It is true that Plato would give the entire state the 
virtue of moderation; but he does not mean by this that all 
would be equally self-controlled: sophrosyne would character¬ 
ize the city in which those who ought to be ruled would obey, 
and those who were destined to rule would in fact rule: hence 
there would be a multitude of “appetites and pleasures and 
pains” in children, women, and slaves, as well as in the inferior 
majority; “but those desires that are simple and measured and 
directed by reasoning with intelligence and right belief” would 
be found “in but few people who are the best by nature and

the best educated.” In the moderate state, the passions of the 
unprincipled multitude would be controlled by “the desires 
and the knowledge of the fewer and the better.” 27 

We are a long way from a form of austerity that would tend 
to govern all individuals in the same way, from the proudest 
to the most humble, under a universal law whose application 
alone would be subject to modulation by means of casuistry.On the contrary, here everything was a matter of adjustment, 
circumstance, and personal position.The few great common 
laws—of the city, religion, nature—remained present, but it 
was as if they traced a very wide circle in the distance, inside 
of which practical thought had to define what could rightfully 
be done.And for this there was no need of anything resem¬ 
bling a text that would have the force of law, but rather, of 
a techne or “practice,” a savoir-faire that by taking general 
principles into account would guide action in its time, accord¬ 
ing to its context, and in view of its ends.
