The evolution that occurred— 
quite slowly at that—between paganism and Christianity did 
not consist in a gradual interiorization of rules, acts, and 
transgressions; rather, it carried out a restructuration of the 
forms of self-relationship and a transformation of the practices 
and techniques on which this relationship was based.Classical language had a term for designating this form of 
relationship with oneself, this “attitude” which was necessary 
to the ethics of pleasures and which was manifested through 
the proper use one made of them: enkrateia.As a matter of 
fact, for a long time the word remained rather close to 
sophrosyne: one often finds them employed together or alter-

The Use of Pleasure 


natively, with very similar meanings.When Xenophon speaks 
of moderation—which, together with piety, wisdom, courage, 
and justice, was among the five virtues he usually recognized 
—he employs the words sophrosyne and enkrateia inter¬ 
changeably.'Plato refers to this proximity of the two words 
when Socrates, questioned by Callicles concerning what he 
meant by “ruling himself” (auton heauton archein), replies 
that it consists in “being temperate, master of himself [so- 
phrona onta kai enkrate auton heautou ], ruling the pleasures 
and appetites within him [archein ton hedonon kai epithumi- 
o/i].” 2 And when, in the Republic, he considers the four cardi¬ 
nal virtues in turn—wisdom, courage, justice, and moderation 
(sophrosyne) —he defines the latter by enkrateia: “Moderation 
[soph rosy ne\ is a certain orderliness and mastery [kosmos kai 
enkrateia ] over certain pleasures and appetites.” 3 * 

We may note, however, that while the meanings of these 
two words are very close, they stop short of being exact syno¬ 
nyms.
