The opposite of sophrosyne is the immod¬ 
eration (akolasia) that is expressed by deliberately choosing 
bad principles, following them of one’s own accord, surrender¬ 
ing even to the weakest desires, and taking pleasure in bad 
conduct: the immoderate individual is shameless and incorri¬ 
gible.Enkrateia, with its opposite, akrasia, is located on the 
axis of struggle, resistance, and combat; it is self-control, ten¬ 
sion, “continence”; enkrateia rules over pleasures and desires, 
but has to struggle to maintain control.Unlike the “moder¬ 
ate” man, the “continent” one experiences pleasures that are 
not in accord with reason, but he no longer allows himself to 
be carried away by them, and his merit will be greater in 
proportion as his desires are strong.As an opposite, akrasia 
is not, like immoderation, a deliberate choosing of bad princi¬ 
ples; it invites comparison, rather, with those cities that have 
good laws but are incapable of enforcing them; the incontinent 
individual lets himself be overcome in spite of himself, and 
despite the reasonable principles he embraces, either because 
he does not have the strength to put them into practice or 
because he has not given them sufficient thought: this explains 
why the incontinent person can come to his senses and achieve 
self-mastery.7 Thus, enkrateia can be regarded as the prerequi¬ 
site of sophrosyne, as the form of effort and control that the 
individual must apply to himself in order to become moderate 
(sophron).
