As we have seen, the aphrodisia 
were made not only possible but desirable by an interplay of 
forces whose origin and finality were natural, but whose po¬ 
tential, by the fact that they had their own energy, was for 
revolt and excess.These forces could not be used in the moder¬ 
ate way that was fitting unless one was capable of opposing, 
resisting, and subduing them.Of course, if it was necessary to 
confront them, this was because they were inferior appetites 
that humans happen to share—like hunger and thirst—with 
the animals; 10 but this natural inferiority would not of itself be 
a reason for having to combat them, if there was not the 
danger that, winning out over all else, they would extend their 
rule over the whole individual, eventually reducing him to 
slavery.In other words, it was not their intrinsic nature, their 
disqualification on principle, that necessitated this “polemi¬ 
cal” attitude toward oneself, but their possible ascendancy and 
dominion.Ethical conduct in matters of pleasure was contin¬ 
gent on a battle for power.
