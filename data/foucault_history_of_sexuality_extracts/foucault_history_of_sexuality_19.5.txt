The Repressive Hypothesis 


47 


Nineteenth-century “bourgeois” society—and it is doubt¬ 
less still with us—was a society of blatant and fragmented 
perversion. And this was not by way of hypocrisy, for noth¬ 
ing was more manifest and more prolix, or more manifestly 
taken over by discourses and institutions. Not because, hav¬ 
ing tried to erect too rigid or too general a barrier against 
sexuality, society succeeded only in giving rise to a whole 
perverse outbreak and a long pathology of the sexual instinct. 
At issue, rather, is the type of power it brought to bear on 
the body and on sex. In point of fact, this power had neither 
the form of the law, nor the effects of the taboo. On the 
contrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities. It 
did not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various 
forms of sexuality, pursuing them according to lines of indefi¬ 
nite penetration. It did not exclude sexuality, but included it 
in the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It did 
not seek to avoid it; it attracted its varieties by means of 
spirals in which pleasure and power reinforced one another. 
It did not set up a barrier; it provided places of maximum 
saturation. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic. 
Modern society is perverse, not in spite of its puritanism or 
as if from a backlash provoked by its hypocrisy; it is in actual 
fact, and directly, perverse. 

In actual fact. The manifold sexualities—those which ap¬ 
pear with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the 
child), those which become fixated on particular tastes or 
practices (the sexuality of the invert, the gerontophile, the 
fetishist), those which, in a diffuse manner, invest relation¬ 
ships (the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher and stu¬ 
dent, psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt 
spaces (the sexuality of the home, the school, the prison)— 
all form the correlate of exact procedures of power. We must 
not imagine that all these things that were formerly tolerated 
attracted notice and received a pejorative designation when 
the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of 
sexuality that was capable of reproducing labor power and 
the form of the family. These polymorphous conducts were
