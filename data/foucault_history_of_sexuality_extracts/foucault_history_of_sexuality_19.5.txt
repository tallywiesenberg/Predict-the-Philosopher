This perception of the hedonai and 
epithumiai as a formidable enemy force, and the correlative 
constitution of oneself as a vigilant adversary who confronts 
them, struggles against them, and tries to subdue them, is 
revealed in a whole series of expressions traditionally em¬ 
ployed to characterize moderation and immoderation: setting 
oneself against the pleasures and desires, not giving in to them, 
resisting their assaults, or on the contrary, letting oneself be 
overcome by them, 11 defeating them or being defeated by

them, 12 being armed or equipped against them.13 It is also 
revealed in metaphors such as that of the battle that has to be 
fought against armed adversaries, or that of the acropolis-soul 
assaulted by a hostile band and needing a solid garrison for its 
defense, or that of hornets that set upon reasonable and mod¬ 
erate desires, killing them or driving them out unless one 
manages to rid oneself of these attackers.14 It is expressed, too, 
by such themes as that of the untamed forces of desire that 
invade the soul during its slumber if it has not had the fore¬ 
sight to take the necessary precautions.15 The relationship to 
desires and pleasures is conceived as a pugnacious one: a man 
must take the position and role of the adversary with respect 
to them, either according to the model of the fighting soldier 
or the model of the wrestler in a match.One should keep in 
mind that the Athenian of the Laws, when he speaks of the 
need to restrain the three basic appetites, invokes the aid of 
“the Muses and the gods of contests [theoi agonioi ].” 16 The 
long tradition of spiritual combat, which was to take so many 
diverse forms, was already clearly delineated in classical 
Greek thought.
