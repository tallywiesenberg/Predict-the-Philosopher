Such a “polemical” attitude with respect to oneself 
tended toward a result that was quite naturally expressed as 
victory—a victory much more impressive, says the Laws, than 
those won in wrestling and running contests.20 This victory 
was sometimes characterized by the complete extirpation or 
expulsion of desires.21 * But much more often, it was defined 
by the setting up of a solid and stable state of rule of the self 
over the self; the intensity of the desires and pleasures did not 
disappear, but the moderate subject controlled it well enough 
so as never to give way to violence.The famous test of Socra¬ 
tes, in which he proves capable of resisting seduction by Al- 
cibiades, does not show him “purified” of all desire for boys: 
it reveals his ability to resist whenever and however he 
chooses.Such a test would meet with disapproval from Chris¬ 
tians because it would testify to the abiding presence—for 
them immoral—of desire.
