But long before them, Bion the 
Borysthenite made light of it, declaring that if Socrates felt 
desire for Alcibiades, he was foolish to abstain, and if he felt 
none, his conduct was entirely unremarkable.23 Similarly, in 
Aristotle’s analysis, enkrateia, defined as mastery and victory, 
presupposes the presence of desires, and is all the more valu¬ 
able as it manages to control those that are violent.24 Soph ro¬ 
sy ne itself, although defined by Aristotle as a state of virtue, did 
not imply the suppression of desires but rather their control: 
Aristotle places it in an intermediary position between a self-

In the domain of pleasures, virtue was not conceived as a 
state of integrity, but as a relationship of domination, a rela¬

whether in Plato, Xenophon, Diogenes, Antiphon, or Aris¬ 
totle—to define moderation: “rule the desires and the pleas¬ 
ures,” “exercise power over them,” “govern them” (kratein, 
archein).
