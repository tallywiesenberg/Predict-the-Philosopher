There is an aphorism that captures this general con¬ 
ception of pleasure; interestingly, it is attributed to Aristippus, 
who had a rather different theory of pleasure from that of 
Socrates: “It is not abstinence from pleasures that is best, but 
mastery over them without ever being worsted” (to kratein kai 
me hettasthai hedonon ariston, ou to me chresthai ).26 In other 
words, to form oneself as a virtuous and moderate subject in 
the use he makes of pleasures, the individual has to construct 
a relationship with the self that is of the “domination-submis¬ 
sion,” “command-obedience,” “mastery-docility” type (and 
not, as will be the case in Christian spirituality, a relationship 
of the “elucidation-renunciation,” “decipherment-purifica¬ 
tion” type).This is what could be called the “heautocratic” 
structure of the subject in the ethical practice of the pleasures.4.The development of this heautocratic form was pat¬ 
terned after several models: for example, in Plato there is the 
model of the team with its driver, and in Aristotle, that of the 
child with the adult (our desiring faculty ought to comply with 
the prescriptions of reason “as the child should live according 
to the direction of his tutor”).
