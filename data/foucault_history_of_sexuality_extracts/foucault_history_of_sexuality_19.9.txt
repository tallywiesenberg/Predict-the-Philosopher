28 The model of 
civic life is also called on in order to define the moderate 
attitude.It is a familiar theme in Plato that desires can be 
likened to a low-born populace that will grow agitated and 
rebellious unless it is kept in check; 29 but the strict correlation 
between the individual and the city, which is the mainstay of 
Plato’s thinking in the Republic, enables him to elaborate on 
the “civic” model of moderation and its opposite, page after 
page.There, the ethics of pleasure is of the same order of 
reality as the political structure: “If the individual is like the 
city, the same structure must prevail in him”; and he will be 
self-indulgent when he lacks the power structure, the arc he, 
that would allow him to defeat, to rule over (kratein) the 
inferior powers; then “his soul must be full of servitude and 
lack freedom”; the soul’s “best parts” will be enslaved and “a 
small part, the most wicked and mad, is master.” 30 At the end 
of the next to last book of the Republic, after having set up 
the model of the city, Plato acknowledges that the philosopher 
will have little chance of encountering a state so perfect in this 
world or of serving his function within it; but he goes on to 
say that, nevertheless, the “paradigm” of the city is laid up in 
heaven for him who wants to contemplate it; looking upon it, 
the philosopher will be able to “set up the government of his 
soul” (heauton kratoikizein): “It makes no difference whether

it exists anywhere or will exist.He would take part in the 
public affairs of that city only, not of any other.” 31 Individual 
virtue needed to be structured like a city.5 .
