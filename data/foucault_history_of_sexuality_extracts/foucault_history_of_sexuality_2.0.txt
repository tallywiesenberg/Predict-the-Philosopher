posed its triple edict of taboo, nonexistence, and silence. 

But have we not liberated ourselves from those two long 
centuries in which the history of sexuality must be seen first 
of all as the chronicle of an increasing repression? Only to 
a slight extent, we are told. Perhaps some progress was made 
by Freud; but with such circumspection, such medical pru¬ 
dence, a scientific guarantee of innocuousness, and so many 
precautions in order to contain everything, with no fear of 
“overflow,” in that safest and most discrete of spaces, be¬ 
tween the couch and discourse: yet another round of whis¬ 
pering on a bed. And could things have been otherwise? We 
are informed that if repression has indeed been the funda¬ 
mental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since 
the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able 
to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: noth¬ 
ing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, 
an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within real¬ 
ity, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power 
will be required. For the least glimmer of truth is conditioned 
by politics. Hence, one cannot hope to obtain the desired 
results simply from a medical practice, nor from a theoretical 
discourse, however rigorously pursued. Thus, one denounces 
Freud’s conformism, the normalizing functions of psychoa¬ 
nalysis, the obvious timidity underlying Reich’s vehemence, 
and all the effects of integration ensured by the “science” of 
sex and the barely equivocal practices of sexology. 

This discourse on modern sexual repression holds up well, 
owing no doubt to how easy it is to uphold. A solemn histori¬ 
cal and political guarantee protects it. By placing the advent 
of the age of repression in the seventeenth century, after 
hundreds of years of open spaces and free expression, one 
adjusts it to coincide with the development of capitalism: it 
becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order. The minor 
chronicle of sex and its trials is transposed into the ceremoni¬ 
ous history of the modes of production; its trifling aspect 
fades from view. A principle of explanation emerges after the

fact: if sex is so rigorously repressed, this is because it is 
incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative.
