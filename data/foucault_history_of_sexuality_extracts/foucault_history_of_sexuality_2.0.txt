posed its triple edict of taboo, nonexistence, and silence. 

But have we not liberated ourselves from those two long 
centuries in which the history of sexuality must be seen first 
of all as the chronicle of an increasing repression? Only to 
a slight extent, we are told. Perhaps some progress was made 
by Freud; but with such circumspection, such medical pru¬ 
dence, a scientific guarantee of innocuousness, and so many 
precautions in order to contain everything, with no fear of 
“overflow,” in that safest and most discrete of spaces, be¬ 
tween the couch and discourse: yet another round of whis¬ 
pering on a bed. And could things have been otherwise? We 
are informed that if repression has indeed been the funda¬ 
mental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since 
the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able 
to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: noth¬ 
ing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions, 
an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within real¬ 
ity, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power 
will be required. For the least glimmer of truth is conditioned 
by politics. Hence, one cannot hope to obtain the desired 
results simply from a medical practice, nor from a theoretical 
discourse, however rigorously pursued. Thus, one denounces 
Freud’s conformism, the normalizing functions of psychoa¬ 
nalysis, the obvious timidity underlying Reich’s vehemence, 
and all the effects of integration ensured by the “science” of 
sex and the barely equivocal practices of sexology. 

This discourse on modern sexual repression holds up well, 
owing no doubt to how easy it is to uphold. A solemn histori¬ 
cal and political guarantee protects it. By placing the advent 
of the age of repression in the seventeenth century, after 
hundreds of years of open spaces and free expression, one 
adjusts it to coincide with the development of capitalism: it 
becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order. The minor 
chronicle of sex and its trials is transposed into the ceremoni¬ 
ous history of the modes of production; its trifling aspect 
fades from view. A principle of explanation emerges after the

fact: if sex is so rigorously repressed, this is because it is 
incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative. 
At a time when labor capacity was being systematically ex¬ 
ploited, how could this capacity be allowed to dissipate itself 
in pleasurable pursuits, except in those—reduced to a mini¬ 
mum—that enabled it to reproduce itself? Sex and its effects 
are perhaps not so easily deciphered; on the other hand, their 
repression, thus reconstructed, is easily analyzed. And the 
sexual cause—the demand for sexual freedom, but also for 
the knowledge to be gained from sex and the right to speak 
about it—becomes legitimately associated with the honor of 
a political cause: sex too is placed on the agenda for the 
future. A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many 
precautions in order to give the history of sex such an impres¬ 
sive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness: 
as if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such 
a discourse could be formulated or accepted. 

But there may be another reason that makes it so gratify¬ 
ing for us to define the relationship between sex and power 
in terms of repression: something that one might call the 
speaker’s benefit. If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to 
prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact 
that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliber¬ 
ate transgression. A person who holds forth in such language 
places himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power; 
he upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the com¬ 
ing freedom. This explains the solemnity with which one 
speaks of sex nowadays. When they had to allude to it, the 
first demographers and psychiatrists of the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury thought it advisable to excuse themselves for asking 
their readers to dwell on matters so trivial and base. But for 
decades now, we have found it difficult to speak on the 
subject without striking a different pose: we are conscious of 
defying established power, our tone of voice shows that we 
know we are being subversive, and we ardently conjure away 
the present and appeal to the future, whose day will be

hastened by the contribution we believe we are making. 
Something that smacks of revolt, of promised freedom, of the 
coming age of a different law, slips easily into this discourse 
on sexual oppression. Some of the ancient functions of 
prophecy are reactivated therein. Tomorrow sex will be good 
again. Because this repression is affirmed, one can discreetly
