.For a long time I hesitated to introduce the loath¬ 
some picture into this study.” 9 What is essential is not in all 
these scruples, in the “moralism” they betray, or in the hy¬ 
pocrisy one can suspect them of, but in the recognized neces¬ 
sity of overcoming this hesitation.One had to speak of sex; 
one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not 
determined by the division between licit and illicit, even if the 
speaker maintained the distinction for himself (which is what 
these solemn and preliminary declarations were intended to 
show): one had to speak of it as of a thing to be not simply 
condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems 
of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to 
function according to an optimum.Sex was not something 
one simply judged; it was a thing one administered.It was 
in the nature of a public potential; it called for management 
procedures; it had to be taken charge of by analytical dis¬ 
courses.
