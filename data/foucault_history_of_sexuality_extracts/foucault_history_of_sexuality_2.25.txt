The History of Sexuality 


ried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive 
practices—of those notorious “deadly secrets” which 
demographers on the eve of the Revolution knew were al¬ 
ready familiar to the inhabitants of the countryside.Of course, it had long been asserted that a country had to 
be populated if it hoped to be rich and powerful; but this was 
the first time that a society had affirmed, in a constant way, 
that its future and its fortune were tied not only to the 
number and the uprightness of its citizens, to their marriage 
rules and family organization, but to the manner in which 
each individual made use of his sex.Things went from ritual 
lamenting over the unfruitful debauchery of the rich, bache¬ 
lors, and libertines to a discourse in which the sexual conduct 
of the population was taken both as an object of analysis and 
as a target of intervention; there was a progression from the 
crudely populationist arguments of the mercantilist epoch to 
the much more subtle and calculated attempts at regulation 
that tended to favor or discourage—according to the objec¬ 
tives and exigencies of the moment—an increasing birthrate.Through the political economy of population there was 
formed a whole grid of observations regarding sex.There 
emerged the analysis of the modes of sexual conduct, their 
determinations and their effects, at the boundary line of the 
biological and the economic domains.
