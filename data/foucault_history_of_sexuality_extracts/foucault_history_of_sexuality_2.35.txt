It 
is often said that the classical period consigned it to an 
obscurity from which it scarcely emerged before the Three 
Essays or the beneficent anxieties of Little Hans.It is true 
that a longstanding “freedom” of language between children 
and adults, or pupils and teachers, may have disappeared.No seventeenth-century pedagogue would have publicly ad¬ 
vised his disciple, as did Erasmus in his Dialogues, on the 
choice of a good prostitute.And the boisterous laughter that 
had accompanied the precocious sexuality of children for so 
long—and in all social classes, it seems—was gradually 
stifled.But this was not a plain and simple imposition of 
silence.
