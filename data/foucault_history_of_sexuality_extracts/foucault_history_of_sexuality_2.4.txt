Rather, it was a new regime of discourses.Not any 
less was said about it; on the contrary.But things were said 
in a different way; it was different people who said them, 
from different points of view, and in order to obtain different 
results.Silence itself—the things one declines to say, or is 
forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between 
diff erent speakers—is less the absolute limit of discourse, the 
other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, 
than an element that functions alongside the things said, with 
them and in relation to them within over-all strategies.There 
is no binary division to be made between what one says and 
what one does not say; we must try to determine the different 
ways of not saying such things, how those who can and those 
who cannot speak of them are distributed, which type of 
discourse is authorized, or which form of discretion is re¬ 
quired in either case.
