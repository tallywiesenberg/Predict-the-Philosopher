At a time when labor capacity was being systematically ex¬ 
ploited, how could this capacity be allowed to dissipate itself 
in pleasurable pursuits, except in those—reduced to a mini¬ 
mum—that enabled it to reproduce itself? Sex and its effects 
are perhaps not so easily deciphered; on the other hand, their 
repression, thus reconstructed, is easily analyzed. And the 
sexual cause—the demand for sexual freedom, but also for 
the knowledge to be gained from sex and the right to speak 
about it—becomes legitimately associated with the honor of 
a political cause: sex too is placed on the agenda for the 
future. A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many 
precautions in order to give the history of sex such an impres¬ 
sive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness: 
as if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such 
a discourse could be formulated or accepted. 

But there may be another reason that makes it so gratify¬ 
ing for us to define the relationship between sex and power 
in terms of repression: something that one might call the 
speaker’s benefit. If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to 
prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact 
that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliber¬ 
ate transgression. A person who holds forth in such language 
places himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power; 
he upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the com¬ 
ing freedom. This explains the solemnity with which one 
speaks of sex nowadays. When they had to allude to it, the 
first demographers and psychiatrists of the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury thought it advisable to excuse themselves for asking 
their readers to dwell on matters so trivial and base. But for 
decades now, we have found it difficult to speak on the 
subject without striking a different pose: we are conscious of 
defying established power, our tone of voice shows that we 
know we are being subversive, and we ardently conjure away 
the present and appeal to the future, whose day will be

hastened by the contribution we believe we are making. 
Something that smacks of revolt, of promised freedom, of the 
coming age of a different law, slips easily into this discourse 
on sexual oppression. Some of the ancient functions of 
prophecy are reactivated therein. Tomorrow sex will be good 
again. Because this repression is affirmed, one can discreetly
