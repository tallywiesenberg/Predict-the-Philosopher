The organizers took it permanently into account.All who held a measure of authority were placed in a state 
of perpetual alert, which the fixtures, the precautions taken, 
the interplay of punishments and responsibilities, never 
ceased to reiterate.The space for classes, the shape of the 
tables, the planning of the recreation lessons, the distribution 
of the dormitories (with or without partitions, with or with¬ 
out curtains), the rules for monitoring bedtime and sleep 
periods—all this referred, in the most prolix manner, to the 
sexuality of children.12 What one might call the internal 
discourse of the institution—the one it employed to address 
itself, and which circulated among those who made it func¬ 
tion—was largely based on the assumption that this sexuality 
existed, that it was precocious, active, and ever present.But 
this was not all: the sex of the schoolboy became in the course 
of the eighteenth century—and quite apart from that of 
adolescents in general—a public problem.
