In order to show the success of the sex 
education given the students, Basedow had invited all the 
dignitaries that Germany could muster (Goethe was one of 
the few to decline the invitation).Before the assembled pub¬ 
lic, one of the professors, a certain Wolke, asked the students 
selected questions concerning the mysteries of sex, birth, and 
procreation.He had them comment on engravings that de¬ 
picted a pregnant woman, a couple, and a cradle.The replies 
were enlightened, offered without shame or embarrassment.No unseemly laughter intervened to disturb them—except 
f rom the very ranks of an adult audience more childish than 
the children themselves, and whom Wolke severely repri¬ 
manded.
