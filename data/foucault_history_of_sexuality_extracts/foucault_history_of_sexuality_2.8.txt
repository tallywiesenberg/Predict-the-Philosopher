The History of Sexuality 


about children’s sex, inducing educators, physicians, ad¬ 
ministrators, and parents to speak of it, or speaking to them 
about it, causing children themselves to talk about it, and 
enclosing them in a web of discourses which sometimes ad¬ 
dress them, sometimes speak about them, or impose canoni¬ 
cal bits of knowledge on them, or use them as a basis for 
constructing a science that is beyond their grasp—all this 
together enables us to link an intensification of the interven¬ 
tions of power to a multiplication of discourse.The sex of 
children and adolescents has become, since the eighteenth 
century, an important area of contention around which innu¬ 
merable institutional devices and discursive strategies have 
been deployed.It may well be true that adults and children 
themselves were deprived of a certain way of speaking about 
sex, a mode that was disallowed as being too direct, crude, 
or coarse.But this was only the counterpart of other dis¬ 
courses, and perhaps the condition necessary in order for 
them to function, discourses that were interlocking, hier¬ 
archized, and all highly articulated around a cluster of power 
relations.One could mention many other centers which in the eigh¬ 
teenth or nineteenth century began to produce discourses on 
sex.
