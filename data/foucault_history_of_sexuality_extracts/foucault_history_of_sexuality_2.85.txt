First there was medicine, via the “nervous disorders”; 
next psychiatry, when it set out to discover the etiology of 
mental illnesses, focusing its gaze first on “excess,” then 
onanism, then frustration, then “frauds against procrea¬

perversions as its own province; criminal justice, too, which

or in the ditch by the road leading to Saint-Nicolas, they
