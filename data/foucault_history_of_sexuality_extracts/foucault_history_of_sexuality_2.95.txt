One can be fairly certain that during this same period the 
Lapcourt schoolmaster was instructing the little villagers to 
mind their language and not talk about all these things aloud.But this was undoubtedly one of the conditions enabling the 
institutions of knowledge and power to overlay this everyday 
bit of theater with their solemn discourse.So it was that our 
society—and it was doubtless the first in history to take such 
measures—assembled around these timeless gestures, these 
barely furtive pleasures between simple-minded adults and 
alert children, a whole machinery for speechifying, analyz¬ 
ing, and investigating.Between the licentious Englishman, who earnestly re¬ 
corded for his own purposes the singular episodes of his 
secret life, and his contemporary, this village halfwit who 
would give a few pennies to the little girls for favors the older 
ones refused him, there was without doubt a profound con¬ 
nection: in any case, from one extreme to the other, sex 
became something to say, and to say exhaustively in accord¬ 
ance with deployments that were varied, but all, in their own 
way, compelling.Whether in the form of a subtle confession 
in confidence or an authoritarian interrogation, sex—be it 
refined or rustic—had to be put into words.
