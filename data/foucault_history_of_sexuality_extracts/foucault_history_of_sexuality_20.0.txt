Speaking in reference to the accusations 
brought against Socrates, Xenophon takes care to distinguish 
his teaching from that of the philosophers—or “self-styled 
lovers of wisdom”—for whom once man has learned what it 
is to be just or moderate (sophron), he can become unjust or 
dissolute.Like Socrates, Xenophon objects to this theory: if 
one does not exercise one’s body, one cannot sustain the func¬ 
tions of the body (ta tou somatos erga); similarly, if one does 
not exercise the soul, one cannot sustain the functions of the 
soul, so that one will not be able to “do what one ought to do 
nor avoid what one ought not to do.” 33 It is for this reason that 
Xenophon thinks that Socrates cannot be held accountable for 
Alcibiades’ misbehavior: the latter was not a victim of the 
teaching he received, but rather, after all his successes with 
men, women, and a whole populace made him a champion, he 
acted like many athletes: once victory was won, he thought he 
could “neglect his training” (amelein tes askeseos ).34 

Plato returns often to this Socratic principle of askesis.He 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

represents Socrates showing Alcibiades or Callicles that they 
have no right to involve themselves with the affairs of the city 
or to govern others if they have not first learned what is 
necessary and trained accordingly: “And then, when we have 
practiced it [i askesantes ] together this way, then finally, if you 
think we ought to, we’ll undertake political business.” 35 And 
he associates this requirement of practice with the need to 
attend to oneself.This epimeleia heautou, care of the self, 
which was a precondition that had to be met before one was 
qualified to attend to the affairs of others or lead them, in¬ 
cluded not only the need to know (to know the things one does 
not know, to know that one is ignorant, to know one’s own 
nature), but to attend effectively to the self, and to exercise and 
transform oneself.
