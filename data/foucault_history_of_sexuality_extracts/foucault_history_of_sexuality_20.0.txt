The History of Sexuality 


actually extracted from people’s bodies and from their pleas¬ 
ures; or rather, they were solidified in them; they were drawn 
out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by mul¬ 
tifarious power devices. The growth of perversions is not a 
moralizing theme that obssessed the scrupulous minds of the 
Victorians. It is the real product of the encroachment of a 
type of power on bodies and their pleasures. It is possible that 
the West has not been capable of inventing any new pleas¬ 
ures, and it has doubtless not discovered any original vices. 
But it has defined new rules for the game of powers and 
pleasures. The frozen countenance of the perversions is a 
fixture of this game. 

Directly. This implantation of multiple perversions is not 
a mockery of sexuality taking revenge on a power that has 
thrust on it an excessively repressive law. Neither are we 
dealing with paradoxical forms of pleasure that turn back on 
power and invest it in the form of a “pleasure to be endured.” 
The implantation of perversions is an instrument-effect: it is 
through the isolation, intensification, and consolidation of 
peripheral sexualities that the relations of power to sex and 
pleasure branched out and multiplied, measured the body, 
and penetrated modes of conduct. And accompanying this 
encroachment of powers, scattered sexualities rigidified, be¬ 
came stuck to an age, a place, a type of practice. A prolifera¬ 
tion of sexualities through the extension of power; an optimi¬ 
zation of the power to which each of these local sexualities 
gave a surface of intervention: this concatenation, particu¬ 
larly since the nineteenth century, has been ensured and 
relayed by the countless economic interests which, with the 
help of medicine, psychiatry, prostitution, and pornography, 
have tapped into both this analytical multiplication of pleas¬ 
ure and this optimization of the power that controls it. Pleas¬ 
ure and power do not cancel or turn back against 
one another; they seek out, overlap, and reinforce one an¬ 
other. They are linked together by complex mechanisms and 
devices of excitation and incitement. 



The Repressive Hypothesis

We must therefore abandon the hypothesis that modern 
industrial societies ushered in an age of increased sexual 
repression. We have not only witnessed a visible explosion of 
unorthodox sexualities; but—and this is the important point 
—a deployment quite different from the law, even if it is 
locally dependent on procedures of prohibition, has ensured, 
through a network of interconnecting mechanisms, the pro¬ 
liferation of specific pleasures and the multiplication of dis¬ 
parate sexualities. It is said that no society has been more 
prudish; never have the agencies of power taken such care to 
feign ignorance of the thing they prohibited, as if they were 
determined to have nothing to do with it. But it is the oppo¬ 
site that has become apparent, at least after a general review 
of the facts: never have there existed more centers of power; 
never more attention manifested and verbalized; never more 
circular contacts and linkages; never more sites where the 
intensity of pleasures and the persistency of power catch 
hold, only to spread elsewhere. 




PART THREE 

Scientia Sexualis 




I suppose that the first two points will be granted me; I 
imagine that people will accept my saying that, for two cen¬ 
turies now, the discourse on sex has been multiplied rather 
than rarefied; and that if it has carried with it taboos and 
prohibitions, it has also, in a more fundamental way, ensured 
the solidification and implantation of an entire sexual mo¬ 
saic. Yet the impression remains that all this has by and large 
played only a defensive role. By speaking about it so much, 
by discovering it multiplied, partitioned off, and specified 
precisely where one had placed it, what one was seeking 
essentially was simply to conceal sex: a screen-discourse, a 
dispersion-avoidance. Until Freud at least, the discourse on 
sex—the discourse of scholars and theoreticians—never 
ceased to hide the thing it was speaking about. We could take 
all these things that were said, the painstaking precautions 
and detailed analyses, as so many procedures meant to evade 
the unbearable, too hazardous truth of sex. And the mere 
fact that one claimed to be speaking about it from the rarefied 
and neutral viewpoint of a science is in itself significant. This
