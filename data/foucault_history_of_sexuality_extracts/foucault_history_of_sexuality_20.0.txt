The History of Sexuality 


actually extracted from people’s bodies and from their pleas¬ 
ures; or rather, they were solidified in them; they were drawn 
out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by mul¬ 
tifarious power devices. The growth of perversions is not a 
moralizing theme that obssessed the scrupulous minds of the 
Victorians. It is the real product of the encroachment of a 
type of power on bodies and their pleasures. It is possible that 
the West has not been capable of inventing any new pleas¬ 
ures, and it has doubtless not discovered any original vices. 
But it has defined new rules for the game of powers and 
pleasures. The frozen countenance of the perversions is a 
fixture of this game. 

Directly. This implantation of multiple perversions is not 
a mockery of sexuality taking revenge on a power that has 
thrust on it an excessively repressive law. Neither are we 
dealing with paradoxical forms of pleasure that turn back on 
power and invest it in the form of a “pleasure to be endured.” 
The implantation of perversions is an instrument-effect: it is 
through the isolation, intensification, and consolidation of 
peripheral sexualities that the relations of power to sex and 
pleasure branched out and multiplied, measured the body, 
and penetrated modes of conduct. And accompanying this 
encroachment of powers, scattered sexualities rigidified, be¬ 
came stuck to an age, a place, a type of practice. A prolifera¬ 
tion of sexualities through the extension of power; an optimi¬ 
zation of the power to which each of these local sexualities 
gave a surface of intervention: this concatenation, particu¬ 
larly since the nineteenth century, has been ensured and 
relayed by the countless economic interests which, with the 
help of medicine, psychiatry, prostitution, and pornography, 
have tapped into both this analytical multiplication of pleas¬ 
ure and this optimization of the power that controls it. Pleas¬ 
ure and power do not cancel or turn back against 
one another; they seek out, overlap, and reinforce one an¬ 
other. They are linked together by complex mechanisms and 
devices of excitation and incitement.
