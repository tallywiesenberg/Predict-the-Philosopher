40 Similarly, 
Plato proposes subjecting young people to tests of courage that 
would expose them to simulated dangers; this would be a 
means of training and improving them, and a means of gaug¬ 
ing their merit at the same time: just as one leads “colts into 
noise and tumult to see if they are fearful, so we must expose 
our young to fears and pleasures to test them, much more 
thoroughly than one tests gold in fire, and see whether a 
guardian is hard to bewitch and behaves well in all circum¬ 
stances as a good guardian of himself and of the cultural 
education he has received.” 41 In the Laws, Plato goes so far 
as to imagine a drug that has not yet been invented: it would 
make everything look frightening to anyone who ingested it, 
and it could be used for trying one’s courage: either in private 
“out of a sense of shame at being seen before he was in what 
he considered good condition,” or in a group and even in 
public “in the company of many fellow drinkers,” to show 
that one was able to overcome “the power of the necessary 
transformation effected by the drink.” 42 In the same way, 
banquets could be planned and accepted as tests of self-con¬ 
trol, so to speak, based on this artificial and ideal model.Aristotle expresses this circularity of ethical apprenticeship 
and learnable virtue in a simple phrase: “By abstaining from 
pleasures we become temperate and it is when we have become 
so that we are most able to abstain from them.” 43 

As for the other reason that may explain the absence of a 
specific art for exercising the soul, it has to do with the fact 
that self -mastery and the mastery of others were regarded as 
having the same form; since one was expected to govern one¬ 
self in the same manner as one governed one’s household and 
played one’s role in the city, it followed that the development 
of personal virtues, of enkrateia in particular, was not essen¬ 
tially different from the development that enabled one to rise 
above other citizens to a position of leadership.The same 
apprenticeship ought to make a man both capable of virtue

and capable of exercising power.Governing oneself, managing 
one’s estate, and participating in the administration of the 
city were three practices of the same type.Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus shows the continuity and isomorphism between 
these three “arts,” as well as the chronological sequence by 
which they were to be practiced in the life of an individual.
