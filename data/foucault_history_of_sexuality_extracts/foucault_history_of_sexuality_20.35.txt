It was not 
distinct from the practice of virtue itself; it was the rehearsal 
that anticipated that practice.Further, it made use of the same 
exercises as those that molded the citizen: the master of him¬ 
self and the master of others received the same training.It 
would not be long before this ascetics would begin to have an 
independent status, or at least a partial and relative autonomy.In two ways: there was to be a differentiation between the 
exercises that enabled one to govern oneself and the learning 
of what was necessary in order to govern others; there was also 
to be a differentiation between the exercises themselves and 
the virtue, moderation, and temperance for which they were 
meant to serve as training: their procedures (trials, examina¬ 
tions, self-control) tended to form a particular technique that 
was more complex than the mere rehearsal of the moral be¬ 
havior they anticipated.The time would come when the art 
of the self would assume its own shape, distinct from the 
ethical conduct that was its objective.
