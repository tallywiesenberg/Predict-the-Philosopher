But in classical Greek 
thought, the “ascetics” that enabled one to make oneself into 
an ethical subject was an integral part—down to its very form 
—of the practice of a virtuous life, which was also the life of 
a “free” man in the full, positive and political sense of the 
word.4 


Freedom and 
Truth 


1.“Tell me, Euthydemus, do you think that freedom is a 
noble and splendid possession both for individuals and for 
communities?” “Yes, I think it is, in the highest degree.” 
“Then do you think that the man is free who is ruled by bodily 
pleasures and is unable to do what is best because of them?” 
“By no means.” 1 

Sophrosyne was a state that could be approached through 
the exercise of self-mastery and through restraint in the prac¬ 
tice of pleasures; it was characterized as a freedom.If it was 
so important to govern desires and pleasures, if the use one 
made of them constituted such a crucial ethical problem, this 
was not because the Greeks hoped to preserve or regain an 
original innocence; nor was it in general—except of course in 
the Pythagorean tradition—because they wanted to maintain 
a purity;* it was because they wanted to be free and to be able 
to remain so.This could be regarded as further proof, if such 
were needed, that freedom in classical Greek thought was not 
considered simply as the independence of the city as a whole, 
while the citizens themselves would be only constituent ele- 

•Obviously I am not suggesting that the theme of purity was absent from the Greek 
ethics of pleasures in the classical period.
