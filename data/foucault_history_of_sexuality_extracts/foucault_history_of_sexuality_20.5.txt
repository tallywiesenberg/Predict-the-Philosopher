The 
organization of the city, the nature of its laws, the forms of 
education, and the manner in which the leaders conducted 
themselves obviously were important factors for the behavior 
of citizens; but conversely, the freedom of individuals, under¬ 
stood as the mastery they were capable of exercising over 
themselves, was indispensable to the entire state.Consider this 
passage from Aristotle’s Politics: “A state is good in virtue of 
the goodness of the citizens who have a share in the govern¬ 
ment.In our state all the citizens have a share in the govern¬ 
ment.We have therefore to consider how a man can become 
a good man.True, it is possible for all to be good collectively, 
without each being good individually.
