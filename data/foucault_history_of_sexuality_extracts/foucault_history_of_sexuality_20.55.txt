But the better thing is 
that each individual citizen should be good.The goodness of 
all is necessarily involved in the goodness of each.” 2 The indi¬ 
vidual’s attitude toward himself, the way in which he ensured 
his own freedom with regard to himself, and the form of 
supremacy he maintained over himself were a contributing 
element to the well-being and good order of the city.This individual freedom should not, however, be under¬ 
stood as the independence of a free will.Its polar opposite was 
not a natural determinism, nor was it the will of an all-power¬ 
ful agency: it was an enslavement—the enslavement of the self 
by oneself.To be free in relation to pleasures was to be free 
of their authority; it was not to be their slave.
