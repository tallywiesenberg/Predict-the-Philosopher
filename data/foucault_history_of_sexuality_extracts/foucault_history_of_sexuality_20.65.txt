.And what sort of slavery do you believe to be the worst?” 
“Slavery to the worst masters, I think.” “The worst slavery, 
therefore, is the slavery endured by the incontinent....” 
“Socrates, I think you mean that he who is at the mercy of the 
bodily pleasures has no concern whatever with virtue in any 
form.” “Yes, Euthydemus; for how can an incontinent man be 
any better than the dullest beast?” 4 

But this freedom was more than a nonenslavement, more 
than an emancipation that would make the individual inde¬ 
pendent of any exterior or interior constraint; in its full, posi¬ 
tive form, it was a power that one brought to bear on oneself 
in the power that one exercised over others.
