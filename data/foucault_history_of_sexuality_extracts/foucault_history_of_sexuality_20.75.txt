The 
most kingly man was king of himself (basilikos, basileuon 
heautou ).6 

Hence the importance given in the ethics of pleasures to two 
exemplary moral figures.On the one hand, there was the 
vicious tyrant; he was incapable of mastering his own passions 
and was therefore always prone to abuse his power and to do 
violence (hubrizein) to his subjects.He provoked disturbances 
in his state and caused the citizens to rebel against him.The 
sexual abuses of the despot, when he undertook to dishonor 
the citizensâ€™ children (boys or girls), were often invoked as an 
initial justification for plots aimed at overthrowing tyrannies 
and restoring liberty: this was the case with Pisistratus at 
Athens, Periander in Ambracia, and others mentioned by 
Aristotle in Book V of the Politics .
