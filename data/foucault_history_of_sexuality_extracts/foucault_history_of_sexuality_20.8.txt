7 Opposite the tyrant, there 
was the positive image of the leader who was capable of exer¬ 
cising a strict control over himself in the authority he exer¬ 
cised over others.His self-rule moderated his rule over others.A case in point is Xenophon’s Cyrus, who was in a better 
position than anyone else to abuse power, but who let it be 
known in his court that he had mastered his emotions: “He 
secured at court great correctness of conduct on the part of 
his subordinates, who gave precedence to their superiors; and 
thus he also secured from them a great degree of respect and 
politeness toward one another.” 8 Similarly, when Isocrates’ 
Nicocles praises the moderation and marital fidelity that he 
himself practices, he refers to the demands of his political 
office: how can a man expect to obtain the obedience of others 
if he is unable to subdue his own desires?9 It is in terms of 
prudence that Aristotle advises the absolute ruler not to suc¬ 
cumb to any debauchery; he ought to take into consideration

The Use of Pleasure 


the attachment of gentlemen for their honor; for this reason, 
it would be imprudent for him to subject them to the humilia¬ 
tion of corporal punishment; for the same reason, he ought to 
refrain from “outrage of the young.” “When he indulges him¬ 
self with the young, he is doing so not in the license of power 
but because he is generally in love.In all such cases, too, he 
should atone for the dishonors which he appears to inflict by 
the gift of still greater honors.” 10 And we may recall that this 
was the question that was debated by Socrates and Callicles: 
should those who rule others be thought of as “rulers or 
ruled” (archontas e archomenous) as concerns themselves?— 
this self-rule being defined by the fact of being sophron and 
enkrates; that is, “ruling the pleasures and appetites that are 
in himself.” 11 

The day would come when the paradigm most often used 
for illustrating sexual virtue would be that of the woman, or 
girl, who defended herself from the assaults of a man who had 
every advantage over her; the safeguarding of purity and vir¬ 
ginity, and faithfulness to commitments and vows, were to 
constitute the standard test of virtue.
