In this ethics of men made for men, the 
development of the self as an ethical subject consisted in set¬ 
ting up a structure of virility that related oneself to oneself.It 
was by being a man with respect to oneself that one would be 
able to control and master the manly activity that one directed 
toward others in sexual practice.What one must aim for in the 
agonistic contest with oneself and in the struggle to control the 
desires was the point where the relationship with oneself 
would become isomorphic with the relationship of domi¬ 
nation, hierarchy, and authority that one expected, as a man, 
a free man, to establish over his inferiors; and it was this prior 
condition of “ethical virility” that provided one with the right 
sense of proportion for the exercise of “sexual virility,” ac¬ 
cording to a model of “social virility.” In the use of male 
pleasures, one had to be virile with regard to oneself, just as 
one was masculine in one’s social role.In the full meaning of 
the word, moderation was a man’s virtue.This does not mean of course that women were not expected 
to be moderate, that they were not capable of enkrateia, or 
that the virtue of sophrosyne was unknown to them.
