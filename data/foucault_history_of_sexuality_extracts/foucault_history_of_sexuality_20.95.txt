But where 
women were concerned, this virtue was always referred in 
some way to virility.An institutional reference, since modera¬ 
tion was imposed on them by their condition of dependence 
in relation to their families, their husbands, and their procrea¬ 
tive function, which ensured the perpetuation of the family 
name, the transmission of wealth, and the survival of the city.But there was also a structural reference, since in order for a 
woman to be moderate, she had to establish a relationship of 
superiority and domination over herself that was virile by 
definition.It is significant that Socrates, in Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus, after hearing Ischomachus praise the merits of 
the wife he has himself educated, declares (not without first 
invoking the goddess of austere matrimony): “By Hera, Is¬ 
chomachus, you display your wife’s masculine understanding

[andrike dianoia ].” To which, in order to introduce the lesson 
in fastidious deportment he has given his wife, Ischomachus 
gives a reply that reveals the two essential elements of this 
virtuous virility of women—strength of character and depen¬ 
dence on the man: “There are other instances of her high¬ 
mindedness [megalophron ] that I am willing to relate to you, 
instances of her obeying me quickly in some matter after 
hearing it only once.” 12 

We know that Aristotle explicitly rejected the Socratic ar¬ 
gument for a basic unity of virtue, which implied that this was 
identical in men and women.And yet, he does not describe 
feminine virtues that would be exclusively feminine; those he 
attributes to women are defined with reference to one essential 
virtue, which achieves its full and complete form in men.
