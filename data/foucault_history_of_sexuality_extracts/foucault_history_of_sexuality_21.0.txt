And 
he sees the reason for this in the fact that the relation between 
men and women is “political”; it is the relation of ruler to 
ruled.For the relation to be in good order, both partners must 
have a share in the same virtues; but each will possess them 
in his own way.The one who rules—i.e., the man—“possesses 
moral goodness in its full and perfect form,” whereas the 
ruled, including women, need only have “moral goodness to 
the extent required of them.” As concerns the man, therefore, 
moderation and courage are a full and complete “ruling” 
virtue; as for the moderation or courage of the woman, they 
are “serving” virtues; in other words, the man stands both as 
a complete and finished model of these virtues and as the 
principle motivating their practice.13 

That moderation is given an essentially masculine structure 
has another consequence, which is symmetrical and opposite 
to the one just discussed: immoderation derives from a passiv¬ 
ity that relates it to femininity.To be immoderate was to be 
in a state of nonresistance with regard to the force of pleasures, 
and in a position of weakness and submission; it meant being 
incapable of that virile stance with respect to oneself that 
enabled one to be stronger than oneself.
