was in fact a science made up of evasions since, given its 
inability or refusal to speak of sex itself, it concerned itself 
primarily with aberrations, perversions, exceptional oddities, 
pathological abatements, and morbid aggravations. It was by 
the same token a science subordinated in the main to the 
imperatives of a morality whose divisions it reiterated under 
the guise of the medical norm. Claiming to speak the truth, 
it stirred up people’s fears; to the least oscillations of sexual¬ 
ity, it ascribed an imaginary dynasty of evils destined to be 
passed on for generations; it declared the furtive customs of 
the timid, and the most solitary of petty manias, dangerous

for the whole society; strange pleasures, it warned, would 
eventually result in nothing short of death: that of individu¬

run to the rescue of law and public opinion, more servile with 
respect to the powers of order than amenable to the require¬ 
ments of truth. Involuntarily naive in the best of cases, more 
often intentionally mendacious, in complicity with what it 
denounced, haughty and coquettish, it established an entire 
pornography of the morbid, which was characteristic of the 
fin desiecle society. In France, doctors like Gamier, Pouillet, 
and Ladoucette were its unglorified scribes and Rollinat its 
poet. But beyond these troubled pleasures, it assumed other 
powers; it set itself up as the supreme authority in matters 
of hygienic necessity, taking up the old fears of venereal 
affliction and combining them with the new themes of asep¬ 
sis, and the great evolutionist myths with the recent institu¬ 
tions of public health; it claimed to ensure the physical vigor 
and the moral cleanliness of the social body; it promised to 
eliminate defective individuals, degenerate and bastardized 
populations. In the name of a biological and historical ur¬ 
gency, it justified the racisms of the state, which at the time 
were on the horizon. It grounded them in “truth.” 

When we compare these discourses on human sexuality 
with what was known at the time about the physiology of
