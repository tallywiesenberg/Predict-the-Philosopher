was in fact a science made up of evasions since, given its 
inability or refusal to speak of sex itself, it concerned itself 
primarily with aberrations, perversions, exceptional oddities, 
pathological abatements, and morbid aggravations. It was by 
the same token a science subordinated in the main to the 
imperatives of a morality whose divisions it reiterated under 
the guise of the medical norm. Claiming to speak the truth, 
it stirred up people’s fears; to the least oscillations of sexual¬ 
ity, it ascribed an imaginary dynasty of evils destined to be 
passed on for generations; it declared the furtive customs of 
the timid, and the most solitary of petty manias, dangerous

for the whole society; strange pleasures, it warned, would 
eventually result in nothing short of death: that of individu¬ 
als, generations, the species itself. 

It thus became associated with an insistent and indiscreet 
medical practice, glibly proclaiming its aversions, quick to 
run to the rescue of law and public opinion, more servile with 
respect to the powers of order than amenable to the require¬ 
ments of truth. Involuntarily naive in the best of cases, more 
often intentionally mendacious, in complicity with what it 
denounced, haughty and coquettish, it established an entire 
pornography of the morbid, which was characteristic of the 
fin desiecle society. In France, doctors like Gamier, Pouillet, 
and Ladoucette were its unglorified scribes and Rollinat its 
poet. But beyond these troubled pleasures, it assumed other 
powers; it set itself up as the supreme authority in matters 
of hygienic necessity, taking up the old fears of venereal 
affliction and combining them with the new themes of asep¬ 
sis, and the great evolutionist myths with the recent institu¬ 
tions of public health; it claimed to ensure the physical vigor 
and the moral cleanliness of the social body; it promised to 
eliminate defective individuals, degenerate and bastardized 
populations. In the name of a biological and historical ur¬ 
gency, it justified the racisms of the state, which at the time 
were on the horizon. It grounded them in “truth.” 

When we compare these discourses on human sexuality 
with what was known at the time about the physiology of 
animal and plant reproduction, we are struck by the incon¬ 
gruity. Their feeble content from the standpoint of elemen¬ 
tary rationality, not to mention scientificity, earns them a 
place apart in the history of knowledge. They form a 
strangely muddled zone. Throughout the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very 
distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction, 
which developed continuously according to a general scien¬ 
tific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite 
different rules of formation. From one to the other, there was

no real exchange, no reciprocal structuration; the role of the 
first with respect to the second was scarcely more than as a 
distant and quite fictitious guarantee: a blanket guarantee 
under cover of which moral obstacles, economic or political 
options, and traditional fears could be recast in a scientific- 
sounding vocabulary. It is as if a fundamental resistance 
blocked the development of a rationally formed discourse 
concerning human sex, its correlations, and its effects. A 
disparity of this sort would indicate that the aim of such a 
discourse was not to state the truth but to prevent its very 
emergence. Underlying the difference between the physiol¬ 
ogy of reproduction and the medical theories of sexuality, we 
would have to see something other and something more than 
an uneven scientific development or a disparity in the forms 
of rationality; the one would partake of that immense will to 
knowledge which has sustained the establishment of scien¬ 
tific discourse in the West, whereas the other would derive 
from a stubborn will to nonknowledge. 

This much is undeniable: the learned discourse on sex that 
was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with 
age-old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a 
refusal to see and to understand; but further—and this is the 
crucial point—a refusal concerning the very thing that was 
brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solic¬ 
ited. For there can be no misunderstanding that is not based 
on a fundamental relation to truth. Evading this truth, bar¬ 
ring access to it, masking it: these were so many local tactics 
which, as if by superimposition and through a last-minute 
detour, gave a paradoxical form to a fundamental petition to 
know. Choosing not to recognize was yet another vagary of
