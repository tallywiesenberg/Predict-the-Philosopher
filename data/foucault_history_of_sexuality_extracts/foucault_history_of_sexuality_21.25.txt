similar viewpoint, Xenophon shows that the man of modera¬ 
tion is also the man of dialectics—competent to command and 
discuss, capable of being the best—for, as Socrates explains

voyage of souls and the birth of love, fills in the details.This 
text is doubtless the first description in ancient literature of 
what will later be known as “spiritual combat.” Here one is 
far from the impassiveness and the feats of endurance and 
abstinence of the sort that Socrates was able to display accord¬ 
ing to Alcibiades of the Symposium, for the Phaedrus presents 
a whole drama of the soul struggling with itself and against 
the violence of its desires.These different elements were des¬ 
tined to have a long career in the history of spirituality: the 
distress that takes hold of the soul, so alien that the latter 
cannot even give it a name; the anxiety that keeps the soul on 
the alert; the mysterious seething; the suffering and pleasure 
that alternate and intermix; the movement that transports 
one’s being; the struggle between opposing powers; the lapses, 
the wounds, the pains, the reward and the final appeasement.
