But it is important to note 
that this relation to truth never took the form of a decipher¬ 
ment of the self by the self, never that of a hermeneutics of 
desire.It was a factor constituting the mode of being of the 
moderate subject; it was not equivalent to an obligation for the 
subject to speak truthfully concerning himself; it never opened 
up the soul as a domain of potential knowledge where barely 
discernible traces of desire needed to be read and interpreted.The relation to truth was a structural, instrumental, and onto¬ 
logical condition for establishing the individual as a moderate 
subject leading a life of moderation; it was not an epistemolog¬ 
ical condition enabling the individual to recognize himself in 
his singularity as a desiring subject and to purify himself of the 
desire that was thus brought to light.4.Now, while this relation to truth, constitutive of the 
moderate subject, did not lead to a hermeneutics of desire, it 
did on the other hand open onto an aesthetics of existence.
