animal and plant reproduction, we are struck by the incon¬ 
gruity. Their feeble content from the standpoint of elemen¬ 
tary rationality, not to mention scientificity, earns them a 
place apart in the history of knowledge. They form a 
strangely muddled zone. Throughout the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very 
distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction, 
which developed continuously according to a general scien¬ 
tific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite 
different rules of formation. From one to the other, there was

no real exchange, no reciprocal structuration; the role of the 
first with respect to the second was scarcely more than as a 
distant and quite fictitious guarantee: a blanket guarantee 
under cover of which moral obstacles, economic or political 
options, and traditional fears could be recast in a scientific- 
sounding vocabulary. It is as if a fundamental resistance 
blocked the development of a rationally formed discourse 
concerning human sex, its correlations, and its effects. A 
disparity of this sort would indicate that the aim of such a 
discourse was not to state the truth but to prevent its very 
emergence. Underlying the difference between the physiol¬ 
ogy of reproduction and the medical theories of sexuality, we 
would have to see something other and something more than 
an uneven scientific development or a disparity in the forms 
of rationality; the one would partake of that immense will to 
knowledge which has sustained the establishment of scien¬ 
tific discourse in the West, whereas the other would derive 
from a stubborn will to nonknowledge. 

This much is undeniable: the learned discourse on sex that 
was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with 
age-old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a 
refusal to see and to understand; but further—and this is the 
crucial point—a refusal concerning the very thing that was 
brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solic¬ 
ited. For there can be no misunderstanding that is not based 
on a fundamental relation to truth. Evading this truth, bar¬ 
ring access to it, masking it: these were so many local tactics 
which, as if by superimposition and through a last-minute 
detour, gave a paradoxical form to a fundamental petition to 
know. Choosing not to recognize was yet another vagary of
