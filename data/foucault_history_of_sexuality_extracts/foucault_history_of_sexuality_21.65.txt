“Tell me this, however, is excessive pleasure compatible with 
moderation?” “How can it be since it drives one to frenzy?” 
“Or with the other virtues?” “In no way.” “Well then, is it 
compatible with violence and lack of restraint [hubris, 
akolasia]T' “Very much so.” “Can you think of a greater and 
sharper pleasure than the sexual?” “No, nor a madder one.” 
“But the right kind of love [ho orthos eros ] is to love a well- 
behaved and beautiful person with moderation and restraint?”

“Certainly.” “The right kind of love has nothing frenzied or 
licentious about it?” “Nothing.” 24 

We may also recall Xenophon’s idealized description of 
Cyrus’ court, which presented a vision of beauty for its own 
enjoyment, due to the perfect dominion that each individual 
exercised over himself; the ruler publicly exhibited a mastery 
and a restraint that spread to everyone, issuing out from them, 
according to the rank they held, in the form of a moderate 
conduct, a respect for oneself and for others, a caref ul supervi¬ 
sion of the soul and the body, and a frugal economy of acts, 
so that no involuntary and violent movement disturbed the 
beautiful order that seemed to be present in everyone’s mind: 
“Among them you would never have detected any one raising 
his voice in anger or giving vent to his delight in boisterous 
laughter; but on seeing them you would have judged that they 
were in truth making a noble life their aim.” 25 The individual 
fulfilled himself as an ethical subject by shaping a precisely 
measured conduct that was plainly visible to all and deserving 
to be long remembered.The foregoing is only a rough sketch for preliminary pur¬ 
poses; a few general traits that characterized the way in which, 
in classical Greek thought, sexual practice was conceptualized 
and made into an ethical domain.The elements of this domain 
—the “ethical substance”—were formed by the aphrodisia; 
that is, by acts intended by nature, associated by nature with 
an intense pleasure, and naturally motivated by a force that 
was always liable to excess and rebellion.The principle ac¬ 
cording to which this activity was meant to be regulated, the 
“mode of subjection,” was not defined by a universal legisla¬ 
tion determining permitted and forbidden acts; but rather by 
a savoir-faire, an art that prescribed the modalities of a use 
that depended on different variables (need, time, status).
