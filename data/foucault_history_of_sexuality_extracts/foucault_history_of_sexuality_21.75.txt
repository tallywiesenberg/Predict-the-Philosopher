Subjection was to take the form not of a savoir-faire, but of a 
recognition of the law and an obedience to pastoral authority.Hence the ethical subject was to be characterized not so much 
by the perf ect rule of the self by the self in the exercise of a virile 
type of activity, as by self-renunciation and a purity whose 
model was to be sought in virginity.This being the case, one can 
understand the significance that was attached, in Christian 
morality, to two opposite yet complementary practices: a 
codification of sexual acts that would become more and more 
specific, and the development of a hermeneutics of desire to¬ 
gether with procedures of self-decipherment.Putting it schematically, we could say that classical antiq¬ 
uity’s moral reflection concerning the pleasures was not di¬ 
rected toward a codification of acts, nor toward a hermeneutics 
of the subject, but toward a stylization of attitudes and an 
aesthetics of existence.A stylization, because the rarefaction of 
sexual activity presented itself as a sort of open-ended require¬ 
ment.
