They were quite willing to grant that a married 
man might go in search of sexual pleasures outside of marÂ¬ 
riage, and yet their moralists conceived the principle of a 
matrimonial life in which the husband would have relations 
only with his own wife.They never imagined that sexual 
pleasure was in itself an evil or that it could be counted among 
the natural stigmata of a transgression; and yet their doctors 
worried over the relationship between sexual activity and 
health, and they developed an entire theory concerning the 
dangers of sexual practice.Let us begin by considering this last point.First of all, it 
should be noted that f or the most part their reflection was not 
concerned with analyzing the different pathological effects of 
sexual activity; nor did they seek to organize this behavior as 
a domain in which normal behavior might be distinguished 
from abnormal and pathological practices.These themes were 
not totally absent of course.
