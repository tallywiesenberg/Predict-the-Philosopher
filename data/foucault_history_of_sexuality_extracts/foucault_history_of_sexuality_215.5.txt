PART ONE 

Dreaming of 
One’s Pleasures 




I will begin by analyzing a rather singular text. It is a 
“practical” work dealing with everyday life, not a work of 
moral reflection or prescription. Of all the texts that have 
survived from this period, it is the only one that presents 
anything like a systematic exposition of the different forms of 
sexual acts. By and large it does not make direct and explicit 
moral judgments concerning those acts, but it does reveal 
schemas of valuation that were generally accepted. And one 
notes that the latter are quite close to the general principles 
that, already in the classical epoch, organized the ethical expe¬ 
rience of the aphrodisia. The book by Artemidorus thus con¬ 
stitutes a point of reference. It testifies to a perenniality and 
exemplifies a common way of thinking. For this very reason, 
it will allow us to measure what may have been uncommon 
and in part new in the work of philosophical and medical 
reflection on pleasure and sexual conduct that was undertaken 
in the same period.
