The Method of 
Artemidorus 


The Interpretation of Dreams by Artemidorus is the only 
text that remains, in full, of a literature that was abundant in 
antiquity: the literature of oneirocriticism. Artemidorus, writ¬ 
ing in the second century a.d., himself cites several works that 
were in use in his day: those of Nicostratus of Ephesus, Panya- 
sis of Halicarnassus, Apollodorus of Telmessus, Phoebus of 
Antioch, Dionysius of Heliopolis, and the naturalist Alexan¬ 
der of Myndus. 1 He makes favorable mention of Aristander of 
Telmessus, and he refers to the three books of the treatise by 
Geminus of Tyre, to the five books of Demetrius of Phalerum, 
and to the twenty-two books of Artemon of Miletus. 2 

Addressing the man to whom his work is dedicated, a cer¬ 
tain Cassius Maximus (possibly Maximus of Tyre, or his fa¬ 
ther, 3 who he says urged him “not to surrender my wisdom 
to silence”), Artemidorus declares that he “has not done any¬ 
thing else” but employ himself “always, day and night,” in the 
interpretation of dreams. 4 An emphatic statement of the sort 
that was rather customary in this kind of presentation? Per¬ 
haps. In any case Artemidorus did something quite different 
from compiling the most famous examples of prophetic 
dreams that were confirmed by reality. He undertook to write 
a work of method, and this in two senses: it was meant to be 
a manual for use in daily practice; it was also meant to be a 
theoretical treatise on the validity of interpretive procedures.

Dreaming of One's Pleasures

One should bear in mind that the analysis of dreams was 
one of the techniques of existence. Since images encountered 
in dreams, or some of them at least, were thought to be signs 
of reality or messages of the future, a high value was set on 
their decipherment; a reasonable life could scarcely dispense 
with the task. This was a very old popular tradition; it was also
