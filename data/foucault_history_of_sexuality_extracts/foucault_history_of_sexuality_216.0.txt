The Method of 
Artemidorus 


The Interpretation of Dreams by Artemidorus is the only 
text that remains, in full, of a literature that was abundant in 
antiquity: the literature of oneirocriticism. Artemidorus, writ¬ 
ing in the second century a.d., himself cites several works that 
were in use in his day: those of Nicostratus of Ephesus, Panya- 
sis of Halicarnassus, Apollodorus of Telmessus, Phoebus of 
Antioch, Dionysius of Heliopolis, and the naturalist Alexan¬ 
der of Myndus. 1 He makes favorable mention of Aristander of 
Telmessus, and he refers to the three books of the treatise by 
Geminus of Tyre, to the five books of Demetrius of Phalerum, 
and to the twenty-two books of Artemon of Miletus. 2 

Addressing the man to whom his work is dedicated, a cer¬ 
tain Cassius Maximus (possibly Maximus of Tyre, or his fa¬ 
ther, 3 who he says urged him “not to surrender my wisdom 
to silence”), Artemidorus declares that he “has not done any¬ 
thing else” but employ himself “always, day and night,” in the 
interpretation of dreams. 4 An emphatic statement of the sort 
that was rather customary in this kind of presentation? Per¬ 
haps. In any case Artemidorus did something quite different 
from compiling the most famous examples of prophetic 
dreams that were confirmed by reality. He undertook to write 
a work of method, and this in two senses: it was meant to be 
a manual for use in daily practice; it was also meant to be a 
theoretical treatise on the validity of interpretive procedures.

Dreaming of One's Pleasures

One should bear in mind that the analysis of dreams was 
one of the techniques of existence. Since images encountered 
in dreams, or some of them at least, were thought to be signs 
of reality or messages of the future, a high value was set on 
their decipherment; a reasonable life could scarcely dispense 
with the task. This was a very old popular tradition; it was also 
an accepted custom in cultured milieus. If it was necessary to 
consult the countless professionals of nocturnal images, it was 
also good to be able to interpret their signs oneself. There are 
innumerable testimonies showing the importance accorded 
the analysis of dreams as a life practice, one that was indis¬ 
pensable not only in dramatic circumstances but also in the 
everyday course of events. This was because in dreams the 
gods gave advice, guidance, and sometimes explicit com¬ 
mands. Moreover, even when the dream only announced an 
event without prescribing anything, even when one believed 
that the concatenation of future occurrences was inevitable, it 
was still good to have foreknowledge of things that were 
bound to happen, so that one might prepare for them. “Provi¬ 
dence,” says Achilles Tatius in The Adventures of Leucippe 
and Clitophon, “sometimes foreshows the future to men in 
dreams, not so that they may be able to avoid the sufferings 
fated for them, for they can never get the better of destiny, but 
in order that they may bear them with the more patience when 
those sufferings come; for when disasters come all together 
and unexpectedly, they strike the spirit with so severe and 
sudden a blow that they overwhelm it; while if they are an¬ 
ticipated, the mind, by dwelling on them beforehand, is able 
little by little to turn the edge of sorrow.” 5 Later, Synesius will 
express a completely traditional point of view when he re¬ 
marks that our dreams constitute an oracle who “dwells with 
us,” who accompanies us “if we go abroad; she is with us on 
the field of battle, she is at our side in the life of the city; she 
labors with us in the fields and barters with us in the market¬ 
place”; dreams are to be regarded as “a prophet who is always 
ready, a tireless and silent adviser.” Hence we should all make

The Care of the Self 


an effort to interpret our dreams, whoever we may be, “men 
and women, old and young, rich and poor, private citizens and 
public officials, inhabitants of the city and of the country, 
artisans and orators,” without regard “either to sex or age, to 
fortune or profession.” 6 It was in this spirit that Artemidorus 
wrote The Interpretation of Dreams. 

Artemidorus is mainly concerned to show the reader pre¬ 
cisely how to go about it: How does one contrive to break 
down a dream into constituent parts and establish its diagnos¬ 
tic meaning? How does one manage also to take this whole
