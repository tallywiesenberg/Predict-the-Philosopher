into account in the decipherment of each of its parts? The 
comparison that Artemidorus makes with the divinatory tech¬ 
niques of sacrificers is significant: they, too, “know how each 
individual sign fits into the whole,” and yet they “base their 
judgments as much on the total sum of the signs as on each 
individual sign.” 7 His book is thus a treatise on how to inter¬ 
pret. Almost entirely centered not on the prophetic marvels of 
dreams but on the techne that enables one to make them speak 
correctly, the work is addressed to several types of readers. 
Artemidorus wishes to supply an instrument for the use of 
professionals and technicians of analysis. This is the vision 
with which he hopes to inspire his son, the addressee of the 
fourth and fifth books: “what has been written here, as long 
as it remains with you alone, will make you a more excellent 
interpreter of dreams than anyone.” 8 He also intends to help 
those who, discouraged by the erroneous methods they have 
tried, may be tempted to give up this valuable practice. His 
book will serve as a salutary treatment— therapeia soteriddes 
—of those errors. 9 But he thinks, too, of the general reader 
who needs basic instruction. 10 In any case, he offers the book 
as a manual for living, a tool that can be used over the course 
of one’s existence and adapted to life’s changing circum¬ 
stances: “just as there is an order and sequence in actual 
events” so he has made an effort to “set down everything in 
an orderly fashion.” 

This “handbook-for-daily-living” aspect is quite noticeable 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures

when one compares Artemidorus’ text with the Tales of Aris¬ 
tides, an anxious valetudinarian who spent years harkening to 
the god that sent him dreams through all the extraordinary 
ups and downs of his illness and the countless treatments he 
undertook. One notes that in Artemidorus there is almost no 
place for religious enchantments; unlike many other texts of 
this kind, his work does not depend on cult therapeutics, even 
if, using a traditional formula, he evokes Apollo of Daldis, 
“my own native god,” who encouraged him and, appearing at 
his bedside, “all but commanded me to compose this work.” 11 
Moreover, he is careful to remark on the difference between 
his work and that of such oneirocritics as Geminus of Tyre, 
Demetrius of Phalerum, and Artemon of Miletus, who con¬ 
veyed prescriptions and cures given by Serapis. 12 The typical 
dreamer whom Artemidorus addresses is not a worried devo¬ 
tee who attends to injunctions given from above. He is an 
“ordinary” individual: generally a man (the dreams of women 
are noted as an aside, as possible variants in cases where the 
sex of the subject happens to change the meaning of the 
dream); a man who has a family, possessions, quite often a 
trade (he runs a business; he has a shop). He is apt to have 
servants and slaves (but the case is considered in which he has 
none). And, besides his health, his chief anxieties concern the 
life and death of his entourage, his enrichment, his impover¬ 
ishment, the marriage of his children, the functions he may be 
called upon to exercise in the city. In short, an average clien¬ 
tele. Artemidorus’ text is revelatory of a type of preoccupa¬ 
tions characteristic of ordinary people. 

But the work also has a theoretical interest at stake, which 
Artemidorus speaks of in the dedication to Cassius: he aims 
to refute the adversaries of oneiromancy. He wishes to con¬ 
vince the skeptics who do not believe in all those forms of 
divination by which one attempts to decipher the signs that 
foretell the future. Artemidorus will seek to establish these 
certitudes not so much by a plain exposition of his findings as

The Care of the Self 


by a carefully considered procedure of inquiry and a discus¬ 
sion of method. 

He does not mean to dispense with earlier texts; he has 
taken pains to read them, but not in order to recopy them, as 
many writers do; what interests him in the “already said” is 
not established authority but rather the breadth and variety of 
experience to be found there. And he has not searched for this 
experience in a few great authors, but has insisted on going to 
those places where it is formed. As he says in the dedication 
to Cassius Maximus, and later repeats, Artemidorus takes 
pride in the breadth of his inquiry. Not only has he compared 
innumerable works, he has patiently frequented the market 
stalls kept by dream readers and soothsayers at the crossroads 
of the Mediterranean world. “I, on the other hand, have not 
only taken special pains to procure every book on the interpre¬ 
tation of dreams, but have consorted for many years with the 
much-despised diviners of the marketplace. People who as¬ 
sume a holier-than-thou countenance and who arch their eye¬
