into account in the decipherment of each of its parts? The 
comparison that Artemidorus makes with the divinatory tech¬ 
niques of sacrificers is significant: they, too, “know how each 
individual sign fits into the whole,” and yet they “base their 
judgments as much on the total sum of the signs as on each 
individual sign.” 7 His book is thus a treatise on how to inter¬ 
pret. Almost entirely centered not on the prophetic marvels of 
dreams but on the techne that enables one to make them speak 
correctly, the work is addressed to several types of readers. 
Artemidorus wishes to supply an instrument for the use of 
professionals and technicians of analysis. This is the vision 
with which he hopes to inspire his son, the addressee of the 
fourth and fifth books: “what has been written here, as long 
as it remains with you alone, will make you a more excellent 
interpreter of dreams than anyone.” 8 He also intends to help 
those who, discouraged by the erroneous methods they have 
tried, may be tempted to give up this valuable practice. His 
book will serve as a salutary treatment— therapeia soteriddes 
—of those errors. 9 But he thinks, too, of the general reader 
who needs basic instruction. 10 In any case, he offers the book 
as a manual for living, a tool that can be used over the course 
of one’s existence and adapted to life’s changing circum¬ 
stances: “just as there is an order and sequence in actual 
events” so he has made an effort to “set down everything in 
an orderly fashion.” 

This “handbook-for-daily-living” aspect is quite noticeable 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures

when one compares Artemidorus’ text with the Tales of Aris¬ 
tides, an anxious valetudinarian who spent years harkening to 
the god that sent him dreams through all the extraordinary 
ups and downs of his illness and the countless treatments he 
undertook. One notes that in Artemidorus there is almost no 
place for religious enchantments; unlike many other texts of 
this kind, his work does not depend on cult therapeutics, even 
if, using a traditional formula, he evokes Apollo of Daldis, 
“my own native god,” who encouraged him and, appearing at 
his bedside, “all but commanded me to compose this work.” 11 
Moreover, he is careful to remark on the difference between 
his work and that of such oneirocritics as Geminus of Tyre, 
Demetrius of Phalerum, and Artemon of Miletus, who con¬ 
veyed prescriptions and cures given by Serapis. 12 The typical
