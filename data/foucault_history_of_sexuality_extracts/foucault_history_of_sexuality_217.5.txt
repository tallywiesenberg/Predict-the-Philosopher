dreamer whom Artemidorus addresses is not a worried devo¬ 
tee who attends to injunctions given from above. He is an 
“ordinary” individual: generally a man (the dreams of women 
are noted as an aside, as possible variants in cases where the 
sex of the subject happens to change the meaning of the 
dream); a man who has a family, possessions, quite often a 
trade (he runs a business; he has a shop). He is apt to have 
servants and slaves (but the case is considered in which he has 
none). And, besides his health, his chief anxieties concern the 
life and death of his entourage, his enrichment, his impover¬ 
ishment, the marriage of his children, the functions he may be 
called upon to exercise in the city. In short, an average clien¬ 
tele. Artemidorus’ text is revelatory of a type of preoccupa¬ 
tions characteristic of ordinary people. 

But the work also has a theoretical interest at stake, which 
Artemidorus speaks of in the dedication to Cassius: he aims 
to refute the adversaries of oneiromancy. He wishes to con¬ 
vince the skeptics who do not believe in all those forms of 
divination by which one attempts to decipher the signs that 
foretell the future. Artemidorus will seek to establish these 
certitudes not so much by a plain exposition of his findings as

sion of method. 

He does not mean to dispense with earlier texts; he has 
taken pains to read them, but not in order to recopy them, as 
many writers do; what interests him in the “already said” is 
not established authority but rather the breadth and variety of 
experience to be found there. And he has not searched for this 
experience in a few great authors, but has insisted on going to 
those places where it is formed. As he says in the dedication 
to Cassius Maximus, and later repeats, Artemidorus takes 
pride in the breadth of his inquiry. Not only has he compared 
innumerable works, he has patiently frequented the market 
stalls kept by dream readers and soothsayers at the crossroads 
of the Mediterranean world. “I, on the other hand, have not 
only taken special pains to procure every book on the interpre¬ 
tation of dreams, but have consorted for many years with the 
much-despised diviners of the marketplace. People who as¬ 
sume a holier-than-thou countenance and who arch their eye¬
