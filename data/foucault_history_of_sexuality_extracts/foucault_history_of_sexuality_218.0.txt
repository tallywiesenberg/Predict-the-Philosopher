brows in a superior way dismiss them as beggars, charlatans, 
and buffoons, but I have ignored their disparagement. Rather, 
in the different cities of Greece and at the great religious 
gatherings in that country, in Asia, in Italy and in the largest 
and most populous of the islands, I have patiently listened to 
old dreams and their consequences. For there was no other 
possible way in which to get practice in these matters.” 13 With 
regard to all that he has brought back, Artemidorus does not 
intend to impart it in the form of raw data; rather, he will 
submit it to “experience” (peira), which is for him the “guid¬ 
ing principle” and “witness” of everything he says. 14 What he 
means by this is that he will verify the information to which 
he refers by matching it against other sources, by comparing 
it with his own practice, and by subjecting it to argument and 
demonstration. In this way, nothing will be said “in the air,” 
nor by resorting to “mere conjecture.” One recognizes the 
methods of inquiry, the notions—e.g., the notions of historia

and peira —and the forms of testing and “verification” that 
characterized the gathering of knowledge carried out in natu¬ 
ral history and medicine during this period, under the more 
or less direct influence of skeptical thought.* Artemidorus’ 
text offers the considerable advantage of presenting a careful 
reflection on a vast body of traditional njaterial. 

There is no question of looking in such a document for the 
formulations of an austere morality or the emergence of new 
standards of sexual conduct. What it does offer are indica¬ 
tions concerning current modes of valuation and generally 
accepted attitudes. Philosophical reflection is certainly not 
absent from the text, and one finds in it rather clear refer¬ 
ences to contemporary problems and debates; but these ref¬ 
erences concern the procedures of decipherment and the 
method of analysis, not value judgments and moral contents. 
The material on which the interpretations bear, the oneiric 
scenes they treat, as auguries, and the situations and events 
they announce, belong to a common and traditional land¬ 
scape. One can thus expect this text by Artemidorus to pro¬ 
vide evidence of a rather widespread moral tradition, which 
was doubtless rather deeply rooted in the past. But once 
again it must be kept in mind that while the text abounds in 
detail, while it presents in connection with dreams a catalog
