brows in a superior way dismiss them as beggars, charlatans, 
and buffoons, but I have ignored their disparagement. Rather, 
in the different cities of Greece and at the great religious 
gatherings in that country, in Asia, in Italy and in the largest 
and most populous of the islands, I have patiently listened to 
old dreams and their consequences. For there was no other 
possible way in which to get practice in these matters.” 13 With 
regard to all that he has brought back, Artemidorus does not 
intend to impart it in the form of raw data; rather, he will 
submit it to “experience” (peira), which is for him the “guid¬ 
ing principle” and “witness” of everything he says. 14 What he 
means by this is that he will verify the information to which 
he refers by matching it against other sources, by comparing 
it with his own practice, and by subjecting it to argument and 
demonstration. In this way, nothing will be said “in the air,” 
nor by resorting to “mere conjecture.” One recognizes the 
methods of inquiry, the notions—e.g., the notions of historia

and peira —and the forms of testing and “verification” that 
characterized the gathering of knowledge carried out in natu¬ 
ral history and medicine during this period, under the more 
or less direct influence of skeptical thought.* Artemidorus’ 
text offers the considerable advantage of presenting a careful 
reflection on a vast body of traditional njaterial. 

There is no question of looking in such a document for the 
formulations of an austere morality or the emergence of new 
standards of sexual conduct. What it does offer are indica¬ 
tions concerning current modes of valuation and generally 
accepted attitudes. Philosophical reflection is certainly not 
absent from the text, and one finds in it rather clear refer¬ 
ences to contemporary problems and debates; but these ref¬ 
erences concern the procedures of decipherment and the 
method of analysis, not value judgments and moral contents. 
The material on which the interpretations bear, the oneiric 
scenes they treat, as auguries, and the situations and events 
they announce, belong to a common and traditional land¬ 
scape. One can thus expect this text by Artemidorus to pro¬ 
vide evidence of a rather widespread moral tradition, which 
was doubtless rather deeply rooted in the past. But once 
again it must be kept in mind that while the text abounds in 
detail, while it presents in connection with dreams a catalog 
of different possible acts and relations, and is more system¬ 
atic in this regard than any other work from the same pe¬ 
riod, it is not in any sense a treatise on morality, which 
would be primarily concerned with formulating judgments 
abotit those acts and relations. It is only indirectly, through 
the decipherment of the dreams, that one can discern the 
valuations brought to bear on the scenes and acts repre¬ 
sented in the text. The ethical principles are not affirmed for 
their own sake; one can recognize them only through the 


*R. J. White, in his introduction to the English edition of Artemidorus, points to 
several traces of the empiricist and skeptical influence on Artemidorus. A. H. M. 
Kessels, however, asserts that Artemidorus was only a practitioner, who just inter¬ 
preted the dream that he had before him on a particular day. 15

actual progression of the analysis, by interpreting the inter¬ 
pretations. This suggests that we should dwell for a moment 
on the procedures of decipherment that Artemidorus brings 
into play. We will then be able to decipher the ethics under¬ 
lying his analysis of sexual dreams. 

1. Artemidorus draws a distinction between two forms of 
nocturnal visions. First, there are the enypnia, dreams that 
express the present affects of the individual and “run their 
course in proximity to the mind.” One is in love, one desires 
the presence of the beloved, one dreams that the latter is 
there; or one goes without food, one feels hungry, one 
dreams of eating; or again, “a man who has stuffed himself 
with food dreams that he is vomiting or choking”; 16 a man 
who fears his enemies dreams that he is surrounded by them. 
This kind of dream has a simple diagnostic value. It is 
grounded in the current state of affairs (from present to pre¬ 
sent); it shows the sleeping subject his own state; it conveys 
that which is deficiency or excess in relation to the body, and 
that which is fear or desire in relation to the mind. 

The dream experiences called oneiroi are different. Their 
nature and function are readily discovered by Artemidorus in 
the three “etymologies” he submits. The oneiros is that which 
to on eirei, “tells what is real.” It tells what is, what is already 
inscribed in time’s unfolding and will come true as an event
