would be primarily concerned with formulating judgments 
abotit those acts and relations. It is only indirectly, through 
the decipherment of the dreams, that one can discern the 
valuations brought to bear on the scenes and acts repre¬

their own sake; one can recognize them only through the 


*R. J. White, in his introduction to the English edition of Artemidorus, points to 
several traces of the empiricist and skeptical influence on Artemidorus. A. H. M. 
Kessels, however, asserts that Artemidorus was only a practitioner, who just inter¬ 
preted the dream that he had before him on a particular day. 15

actual progression of the analysis, by interpreting the inter¬ 
pretations. This suggests that we should dwell for a moment 
on the procedures of decipherment that Artemidorus brings 
into play. We will then be able to decipher the ethics under¬ 
lying his analysis of sexual dreams. 

1. Artemidorus draws a distinction between two forms of 
nocturnal visions. First, there are the enypnia, dreams that 
express the present affects of the individual and “run their 
course in proximity to the mind.” One is in love, one desires 
the presence of the beloved, one dreams that the latter is 
there; or one goes without food, one feels hungry, one 
dreams of eating; or again, “a man who has stuffed himself 
with food dreams that he is vomiting or choking”; 16 a man 
who fears his enemies dreams that he is surrounded by them. 
This kind of dream has a simple diagnostic value. It is 
grounded in the current state of affairs (from present to pre¬ 
sent); it shows the sleeping subject his own state; it conveys 
that which is deficiency or excess in relation to the body, and 
that which is fear or desire in relation to the mind. 

The dream experiences called oneiroi are different. Their 
nature and function are readily discovered by Artemidorus in 
the three “etymologies” he submits. The oneiros is that which 
to on eirei, “tells what is real.” It tells what is, what is already 
inscribed in time’s unfolding and will come true as an event
