in the not-too-distant future. It is also that which acts on the 
soul and excites it— oneirai. The dream alters the soul, it 
fashions and shapes it; it leads it into dispositions and induces 
movements in it corresponding to what is shown. Further, one 
recognizes in this word oneiros the name of the beggar of 
Ithaca, Irus, who carried the messages that were entrusted to 
him. 17 Term by term, then, enypnion and oneiros are opposed 
to each other: the first speaks of the individual, the second of 
events in the world; one originates in the states of the body and 
the mind, the other anticipates the unwinding of the temporal 
chain; one manifests the action of the too-little and the too-

much in the domain of appetites and aversions, the other alerts 
the soul and at the same time shapes it. On the one hand, the 
dreams of desire tell the soul’s reality in its present state. On 
the other hand, the dreams of being tell the future of the event 
in the order of the world. 

A second cleavage brings another form of distinction to 
each of the two categories of “nocturnal visions.” There is that 
which reveals itself clearly and transparently, requiring no 
decipherment or interpretation, and that which displays itself 
only figuratively, in images telling something different from 
their first appearance. In state dreams, desire can be manifes¬ 
ted by the easily recognizable presence of its object (one sees 
in a dream the woman one desires); but it can also be manifes¬ 
ted by another image exhibiting a more or less distant relation¬ 
ship with the object in question. An analogous difference 
obtains in event dreams. Some of them directly designate, by 
showing its actual appearance, that which already exists in the 
future mode: one sees in a dream the sinking of a ship on 
which one will later suffer shipwreck; one sees oneself struck 
by the weapon by which one will be wounded the next day. 
These are the so-called theorematic dreams. But, in other 
cases, the relation between image and event is indirect: the 
image of the ship that breaks apart on the rocks may signify 
not a shipwreck, or even a misfortune, but, for a slave who has 
this dream, his emancipation in the near future. These are the 
“allegorical” dreams. 

Now, the margin that exists between these two distinctions 
poses a practical problem for the interpreter. Given a particu¬
