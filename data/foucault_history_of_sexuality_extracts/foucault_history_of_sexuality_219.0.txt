in the not-too-distant future. It is also that which acts on the 
soul and excites it— oneirai. The dream alters the soul, it 
fashions and shapes it; it leads it into dispositions and induces 
movements in it corresponding to what is shown. Further, one 
recognizes in this word oneiros the name of the beggar of 
Ithaca, Irus, who carried the messages that were entrusted to 
him. 17 Term by term, then, enypnion and oneiros are opposed 
to each other: the first speaks of the individual, the second of 
events in the world; one originates in the states of the body and 
the mind, the other anticipates the unwinding of the temporal 
chain; one manifests the action of the too-little and the too-

much in the domain of appetites and aversions, the other alerts 
the soul and at the same time shapes it. On the one hand, the 
dreams of desire tell the soul’s reality in its present state. On 
the other hand, the dreams of being tell the future of the event 
in the order of the world. 

A second cleavage brings another form of distinction to 
each of the two categories of “nocturnal visions.” There is that 
which reveals itself clearly and transparently, requiring no 
decipherment or interpretation, and that which displays itself 
only figuratively, in images telling something different from 
their first appearance. In state dreams, desire can be manifes¬ 
ted by the easily recognizable presence of its object (one sees 
in a dream the woman one desires); but it can also be manifes¬ 
ted by another image exhibiting a more or less distant relation¬ 
ship with the object in question. An analogous difference 
obtains in event dreams. Some of them directly designate, by 
showing its actual appearance, that which already exists in the 
future mode: one sees in a dream the sinking of a ship on 
which one will later suffer shipwreck; one sees oneself struck 
by the weapon by which one will be wounded the next day. 
These are the so-called theorematic dreams. But, in other 
cases, the relation between image and event is indirect: the 
image of the ship that breaks apart on the rocks may signify 
not a shipwreck, or even a misfortune, but, for a slave who has 
this dream, his emancipation in the near future. These are the 
“allegorical” dreams. 

Now, the margin that exists between these two distinctions 
poses a practical problem for the interpreter. Given a particu¬ 
lar vision in sleep, how is one to know whether one is dealing 
with a state dream or an event dream? How does one deter¬ 
mine whether the image announces directly what it shows, or 
whether one must suppose that it stands for something else? 
Referring to this difficulty in the first pages of Book IV, Ar- 
temidorus emphasizes the importance of considering the indi¬ 
vidual who has the dream. It is quite certain, he explains, that 
state dreams will not appear to “virtuous” persons, for they

have been able to subdue their irrational movements, hence 
their passions, their desires or fears; they also know how to 
keep their bodies balanced between deficiency and excess; for 
them, consequently, there are no disturbances, hence none of 
those “dreams” (enypnia) that are always to be understood as 
manifestations of affects. Moreover, it was a very frequent 
theme of moralists that virtue is marked by the disappearance 
of dreams that translate the appetites and involuntary move¬ 
ments of the mind and the body. “The sleeper’s visions,” said 
Seneca, “are as turbulent as his day.” 18 Plutarch cited Zeno in 
affirming that it is a sign of progress when a person no longer 
dreams that he derives pleasure from indecent actions. And he 
alluded to those individuals who have enough strength in their 
waking hours to combat and resist their passions, but who at 
night, “throwing off opinions and laws,” cease to feel any 
shame: then there awakens what is immoral and licentious 
within them. 19 

For Artemidorus, in any case, when state dreams occur 
they can take two forms. In most people, desire and aversion 
are manifested directly and without concealment; but in a man 
who knows how to interpret his own dreams, they are manifes¬ 
ted only through signs. This is because his mind “plays tricks 
on him in a rather ingenious way.” Thus a man with no 
experience in dream interpretation will see in a dream the 
woman he desires or the longed-for death of his master. The 
mistrustful or clever mind of the expert will, so to say, refuse 
to make manifest the state of desire in which he finds himself: 
it will resort to trickery, so that instead of simply seeing the 
woman he desires, the dreamer will see the image of something 
that signifies her: “a horse, a mirror, a ship, the sea, an animal 
that is female, a piece of feminine apparel.” As an example, 
Artemidorus cites a painter from Corinth, an expert inter¬
