lar vision in sleep, how is one to know whether one is dealing 
with a state dream or an event dream? How does one deter¬ 
mine whether the image announces directly what it shows, or 
whether one must suppose that it stands for something else? 
Referring to this difficulty in the first pages of Book IV, Ar- 
temidorus emphasizes the importance of considering the indi¬ 
vidual who has the dream. It is quite certain, he explains, that 
state dreams will not appear to “virtuous” persons, for they

have been able to subdue their irrational movements, hence 
their passions, their desires or fears; they also know how to 
keep their bodies balanced between deficiency and excess; for 
them, consequently, there are no disturbances, hence none of 
those “dreams” (enypnia) that are always to be understood as 
manifestations of affects. Moreover, it was a very frequent 
theme of moralists that virtue is marked by the disappearance 
of dreams that translate the appetites and involuntary move¬ 
ments of the mind and the body. “The sleeper’s visions,” said 
Seneca, “are as turbulent as his day.” 18 Plutarch cited Zeno in 
affirming that it is a sign of progress when a person no longer 
dreams that he derives pleasure from indecent actions. And he 
alluded to those individuals who have enough strength in their 
waking hours to combat and resist their passions, but who at 
night, “throwing off opinions and laws,” cease to feel any 
shame: then there awakens what is immoral and licentious 
within them. 19 

For Artemidorus, in any case, when state dreams occur 
they can take two forms. In most people, desire and aversion 
are manifested directly and without concealment; but in a man 
who knows how to interpret his own dreams, they are manifes¬ 
ted only through signs. This is because his mind “plays tricks 
on him in a rather ingenious way.” Thus a man with no 
experience in dream interpretation will see in a dream the 
woman he desires or the longed-for death of his master. The 
mistrustful or clever mind of the expert will, so to say, refuse 
to make manifest the state of desire in which he finds himself: 
it will resort to trickery, so that instead of simply seeing the 
woman he desires, the dreamer will see the image of something 
that signifies her: “a horse, a mirror, a ship, the sea, an animal 
that is female, a piece of feminine apparel.” As an example, 
Artemidorus cites a painter from Corinth, an expert inter¬
