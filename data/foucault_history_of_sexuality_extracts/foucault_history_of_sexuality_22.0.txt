The author of the treatise on Ancient Medicine, far from 
considering regimen as an adjacent practice associated with 
the medical art—one of its applications or extensions—attrib¬ 
utes the birth of medicine to a primordial and essential preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen.1 According to him, mankind set itself 
apart from animal life by means of sort of dietary disjunction.In the beginning, the story goes, men did eat the same kind 
of food as animals: meat and raw plants.This type of nourish¬ 
ment was apt to toughen the most vigorous individuals, but 
it was hard on the weaker ones; in a word, people died young 
or old.Consequently, men sought a diet that was better suited 
“to their nature”: it was this regimen that still characterized 
the present way of life.
