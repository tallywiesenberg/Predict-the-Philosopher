the will to truth. Let Charcot’s Salpetriere serve as an exam¬ 
ple in this regard: it was an enormous apparatus for observa¬ 
tion, with its examinations, interrogations, and experiments, 
but it was also a machinery for incitement, with its public 
presentations, its theater of ritual crises, carefully staged 
with the help of ether or amyl nitrate, its interplay of dia-

logues, palpations, laying on of hands, postures which the 
doctors elicited or obliterated with a gesture or a word, its 
hierarchy of personnel who kept watch, organized, pro¬ 
voked, monitored, and reported, and who accumulated an 
immense pyramid of observations and dossiers. It is in the 
context of this continuous incitement to discourse and to 
truth that the real mechanisms of misunderstanding (mecon- 
naissance) operated: thus Charcot’s gesture interrupting a 
public consultation where it began to be too manifestly a 
question of “that”; and the more frequent practice of delet¬ 
ing from the succession of dossiers what had been said and 
demonstrated by the patients regarding sex, but also what 
had been seen, provoked, solicited by the doctors themselves, 
things that were almost entirely omitted from the published 
observations. 1 The important thing, in this affair, is not that 
these men shut their eyes or stopped their ears, or that they 
were mistaken; it is rather that they constructed around and 
apropos of sex an immense apparatus for producing truth, 
even if this truth was to be masked at the last moment. The 
essential point is that sex was not only a matter of sensation 
and pleasure, of law and taboo, but also of truth and false¬ 
hood, that the truth of sex became something fundamental, 
useful, or dangerous, precious or formidable: in short, that 
sex was constituted as a problem of truth. What needs to be 
situated, therefore, is not the threshold of a new rationality 
whose discovery was marked by Freud—or someone else— 
but the progressive formation (and also the transformations) 

'Cf., for example, Desire Bourneville, Iconographiephotographique de la Salpetriere 
(1878-1881), pp. 110 ff. The unpublished documents dealing with the lessons of 
Charcot, which can still be found at the Salpetriere, are again more explicit on this 
point than the published texts. The interplay of incitement and elision is clearly 
evident in them. A handwritten note gives an account of the session of November 
25, 1877. The subject exhibits hysterical spasms; Charcot suspends an attack by 
placing first his hand, then the end of a baton, on the woman’s ovaries. He with¬ 
draws the baton, and there is a fresh attack, which he accelerates by administering 
inhalations of amyl nitrate. The afflicted woman then cries out for the sex-baton in 
words that are devoid of any metaphor; “G. is taken away and her delirium 
continues.”

of that “interplay of truth and sex” which was bequeathed 
to us by the nineteenth century, and which we may have 
modified, but, lacking evidence to the contrary, have not rid 
ourselves of. Misunderstandings, avoidances, and evasions 
were only possible, and only had their effects, against the 
background of this strange endeavor: to tell the truth of sex. 
An endeavor that does not date from the nineteenth century, 
even if it was then that a nascent science lent it a singular 
form. It was the basis of all the aberrant, naive, and cunning 
discourses where knowledge of sex seems to have strayed for 
such a long time. 

Historically, there have been two great procedures for 
producing the truth of sex. 

On the one hand, the societies—and they are numerous: 
China, Japan, India, Rome, the Arabo-Moslem societies— 
which endowed themselves with an ars erotica. In the erotic 
art, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a 
practice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not con¬ 
sidered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and 
the forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but 
first and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as 
pleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific qual¬ 
ity, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul. 
Moreover, this knowledge must be deflected back into the 
sexual practice itself, in order to shape it as though from 
within and amplify its effects. In this way, there is formed a 
knowledge that must remain secret, not because of an ele¬ 
ment of infamy that might attach to its object, but because 
of the need to hold it in the greatest reserve, since, according 
to tradition, it would lose its effectiveness and its virtue by 
being divulged. Consequently, the relationship to the master 
who holds the secrets is of paramount importance; only he, 
working alone, can transmit this art in an esoteric manner 
and as the culmination of an initiation in which hejguides the 
disciple’s progress with unfailing skill and severity. The
