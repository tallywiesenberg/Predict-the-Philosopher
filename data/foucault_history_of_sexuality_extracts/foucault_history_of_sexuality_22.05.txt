But with this milder diet, illness had 
become less immediately fatal, and it was realized that the 
food healthy people ate was not suited to people who were ill: 
they needed other nourishment.Medicine thus came into 
being as an appropriate “diet” for the sick, emerging from a 
search for the specific regimen for their condition.In this tale 
of genesis, it is dietetics that appears to be initial; it gives rise 
to medicine as one of its particular applications.99

The Use of Pleasure 


Plato—being rather suspicious of dietetic practice, or at 
least fearful of the excesses he associates with it, for political 
and ethical reasons we shall consider below—thinks, on the 
contrary, that the concern with regimen was born of a change 
in medical practices: 2 in the beginning, the god Asclepius 
taught men how to cure illnesses and heal wounds by means 
of drastic and effective remedies.According to Plato, Homer 
provides evidence of this practice of simple treatments in the 
account he gives of the cures of Menelaus and Eurypylus 
beneath the walls of Troy: the blood of the wounded was 
sucked, emollients were poured over their wounds, and they 
were made to drink wine sprinkled with barley meal and 
grated cheese.
