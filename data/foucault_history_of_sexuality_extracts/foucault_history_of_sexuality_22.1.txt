* It was later, when men had forsaken the 
rough, healthy life of former times, that one would attempt to 
follow illnesses “step by step” and, by means of a protracted 
regimen, to sustain those who were in bad health precisely 
because, no longer living as they should, they were victims of 
lasting sicknesses.According to this genesis, dietetics came 
into existence as a kind of medicine for soft times; it was 
designed for mismanaged lives that sought to prolong them¬ 
selves.But it is clear that if, for Plato, dietetics was not an 
original art, this was not because regimen (diaite) was unim¬ 
portant; the reason people did not concern themselves with 
dietetics in the time of Asclepius or his first successors was 
that the “regimen” that men actually followed, the manner in 
which they nourished themselves and exercised their bodies, 
was in accord with nature.4 Viewed from this perspective, 
dietetics did represent one modality in medicine, but it did not 
become an extension of the art of healing until the day when 
regimen as a way of life became separated from nature; and 
while it always constituted a necessary accompaniment of 
medicine, this was simply because one could not treat a person 
without rectifying the lifestyle that made him sick in the first 
place.5 

’Actually the details given by Plato are not exactly those that one finds in the 
Iliad.
