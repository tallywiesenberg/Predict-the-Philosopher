Dietetics 


101 


In any case, whether dietetic knowledge was considered an 
original art or seen as a later derivation, it is clear that “diet” 
itself—regimen—was a fundamental category through which 
human behavior could be conceptualized.It characterized the 
way in which one managed one’s existence, and it enabled a 
set of rules to be affixed to conduct; it was a mode of prob- 
lematization of behavior that was indexed to a nature which 
had to be preserved and to which it was right to conform.Regimen was a whole art of living.1.The area that a properly designed regimen ought to 
cover was defined by a list that became almost conventional 
as time went on.
