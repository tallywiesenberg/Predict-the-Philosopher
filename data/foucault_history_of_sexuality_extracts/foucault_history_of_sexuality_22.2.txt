It is the list found in Book VI of the Epidem¬ 
ics; it included “exercises \ponoi\ foods [sitia], drinks \pota ], 
sleep [hypnoi], and sexual relations [aphrodisia ]"—everything 
that needed to be “measured.” 6 Among the exercises, those 
that were natural (walking, strolling) were distinguished from 
those that were violent (foot races, wrestling); and it was 
determined which ones ought to be practiced and with what 
intensity, depending on the time of day, the season of the year, 
the age of the subject, the food he had consumed.Exercises 
might be combined with baths—hot or cold, and also depend¬ 
ing on season, age, activities, and meals already eaten or to be 
prepared.The alimentary regimen—food and drink—had to 
take into consideration the nature and quantity of what one 
ingested, the general condition of the body, the climate, and 
the activities one engaged in.Evacuations—purges and vomit¬ 
ing—served to correct alimentary practice and its excesses.Sleep, too, comprised different components, which could be 
made to vary according to the regimen: the time allotted to it, 
the hours one chose, the quality of the bed, its hardness, its 
warmth.
