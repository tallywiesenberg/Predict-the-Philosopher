In the different areas where it was required, regimen 
needed to establish a measure: “even a pig would know,” says 
one of the interlocutors in the Platonic dialogue The Lovers: 
“in everything connected with the body,” what is useful is 
“the right measure,” and not what is large or small in quan¬ 
tity.7 Now, this measure is to be understood as referring not 
only to the corporal realm but to the moral realm as well.The 
Pythagoreans, who doubtless played an important part in the 
development of dietetics, strongly emphasized the correlation 
between the care given the body and the concern for preserv¬ 
ing the purity and harmony of the soul.While it is true that 
they expected medicine to purge the body and music to cleanse 
the soul, they also credited song and instruments with benefi¬ 
cial effects on the equilibrium of the organism.8 The many 
alimentary taboos they set for themselves had cultural and 
religious significance; and the criticism they directed against 
every abuse connected with eating, drinking, exercises, and 
sexual activities had both the authority of a moral precept and 
the utility of sound advice for health.
