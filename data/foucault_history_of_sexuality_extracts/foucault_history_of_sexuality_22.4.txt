This was because the one implied the other, but also 
because the resolve to follow a measured and reasonable regi¬ 
men and the diligence one manifested in the actual task were 
themselves evidence of an indispensable moral fortitude.Xenophon’s Socrates calls attention to this correlation when 
he advises young people to exercise their bodies regularly by 
practicing gymnastics.He sees this as a means of ensuring that 
they will be able to defend themselves better in warfare, to 
avoid earning a coward’s reputation as a soldier, to best serve 
their native land, and to obtain high rewards (and hence to 
bequeath wealth and status to their descendants).He believes 
the practice will provide protection against illnesses and infir¬ 
mities of the body; but he also points up the good effects of 
gymnastics that accrue, he says, where one would least expect 
to see them: in the mind, for an unhealthy body causes forget¬ 
fulness, loss of courage, bad temper, and madness, so that in 
the end the knowledge one has acquired may even be dis¬ 
lodged from the soul.10 

But it was also the case that the severity of a physical 
regimen, with the determination that was required in order to 
keep to it, called for an essential moral firmness, which made 
its observance possible.
