Moreover, as Plato saw it, this was the 
real justification for these practices by which one sought to 
acquire strength, beauty, and physical health.Not only will 
the judicious man, says Socrates in Book IX of the Republic, 
“not abandon his body to the irrational pleasure of the beast”; 
not only will he not “turn himself that way”; he will do more: 
“It is not even health he aims at, nor does he consider it 
important that he should be strong, healthy, or beautiful, 
unless he acquires moderation as a result.” The physical regi- 

and stouter, then thinner and leaner; and by his expression, his soul always showed 
the same character [to homoion ethos].” It seems that Pythagoras also gave advice 
on regimen to athletes.’

The Use of Pleasure 


men ought to accord with the principle of a general aesthetics 
of existence in which the equilibrium of the body was one of 
the conditions of the proper hierarchy of the soul: “He will 
cultivate harmony in his body for the sake of consonance in 
his soul”—which will enable him to conduct himself like a 
true musician (mousikos).11 Physical regimen must not, there¬ 
fore, be too intensely cultivated for its own sake.The possibility of a danger in the very practice of “diet” was 
readily acknowledged.For if the aim of regimen was to pre¬ 
vent excesses, one might exaggerate the importance one lent 
to it and the autonomy one permitted it to assume.
