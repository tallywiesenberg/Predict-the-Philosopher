This risk 
was generally perceived as having two forms.There was the 
danger of what might be called “athletic” excess; this was due 
to repeated workouts that overdeveloped the body and ended 
by making the soul sluggish, enveloped as it was within a 
too-powerful musculature; on several occasions Plato finds 
fault with this athletic forcing, declaring that he would want 
nothing of the sort for the young people of his city.* 

But there was also the danger of what could be called 
“valetudinary” excess; that is, the constant vigilance that one 
applied to one’s body, one’s health, to the least ailment.The 
best example of this excess was furnished, according to Plato, 
by an individual held to be one of the founders of dietetics, 
Herodicus the trainer; entirely taken up in the effort to avoid 
breaking the least rule of the regimen he had imposed on 
himself, he “trained” away for years, while living the life of 
a dying man.This attitude drew two reproaches from Plato.
