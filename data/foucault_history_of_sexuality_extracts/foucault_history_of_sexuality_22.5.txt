draws the baton, and there is a fresh attack, which he accelerates by administering 
inhalations of amyl nitrate. The afflicted woman then cries out for the sex-baton in 
words that are devoid of any metaphor; “G. is taken away and her delirium 
continues.”

of that “interplay of truth and sex” which was bequeathed 
to us by the nineteenth century, and which we may have 
modified, but, lacking evidence to the contrary, have not rid 
ourselves of. Misunderstandings, avoidances, and evasions 
were only possible, and only had their effects, against the 
background of this strange endeavor: to tell the truth of sex. 
An endeavor that does not date from the nineteenth century, 
even if it was then that a nascent science lent it a singular 
form. It was the basis of all the aberrant, naive, and cunning 
discourses where knowledge of sex seems to have strayed for 
such a long time. 

Historically, there have been two great procedures for 
producing the truth of sex. 

On the one hand, the societies—and they are numerous: 
China, Japan, India, Rome, the Arabo-Moslem societies— 
which endowed themselves with an ars erotica. In the erotic 
art, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a 
practice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not con¬ 
sidered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and 
the forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but 
first and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as 
pleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific qual¬ 
ity, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul. 
Moreover, this knowledge must be deflected back into the 
sexual practice itself, in order to shape it as though from 
within and amplify its effects. In this way, there is formed a 
knowledge that must remain secret, not because of an ele¬ 
ment of infamy that might attach to its object, but because 
of the need to hold it in the greatest reserve, since, according 
to tradition, it would lose its effectiveness and its virtue by 
being divulged. Consequently, the relationship to the master 
who holds the secrets is of paramount importance; only he, 
working alone, can transmit this art in an esoteric manner 
and as the culmination of an initiation in which hejguides the 
disciple’s progress with unfailing skill and severity. The
