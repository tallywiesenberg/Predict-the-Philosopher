The distrust of excessive regimens shows that the pur¬ 
pose of diet was not to extend life as far as possible in time nor as 
high as possible in performance, but rather to make it useful 
and happy within the limits that had been set for it.Nor was 
diet supposed to determine the conditions of existence once and 
for all.A regimen was not good if it only permitted one to live in 
one place, with one type of food, and if it did not allow one to be 
open to any change.The usefulness of a regimen lay precisely in 
the possibility it gave individuals to face different situations.It 
is in these terms that Plato contrasts the regimen of athletes, 
which is so strict that they cannot depart from it without 
becoming “seriously and violently ill,” with the regimen he 
would like to see adopted for his warriors.
