Without going into the history of the dispute be¬ 
tween medicine and gymnastics over the issue of their respec¬ 
tive competence to determine the proper regimen, we must 
keep in mind that diet was not thought of as an unquestioning 
obedience to the authority of another; it was intended to be a 
deliberate practice on the part of an individual, involving 
himself and his body.In order to follow the right regimen, it 
was of course necessary to listen to those who knew, but this 
relationship was supposed to take the form of persuasion.If 
it was to be reasonable, properly adjusting itself to time and 
circumstances, the diet of the body had also to be a matter of 
thought, deliberation, and prudence.Whereas medications 
and operations acted upon the body, and the body submitted 
to that action, regimen addressed itself to the soul, and incul¬ 
cated principles in the soul.Thus, in the Laws, Plato distin¬ 
guishes between two kinds of doctors: those who are good for 
slaves (they are usually slaves themselves) and who confine 
themselves to giving prescriptions without offering any expla¬ 
nation; and the freeborn doctors who attend to free men.
