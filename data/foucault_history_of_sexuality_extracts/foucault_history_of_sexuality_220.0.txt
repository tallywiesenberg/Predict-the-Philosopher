preter no doubt, who saw the roof of his house collapse in a

Dreaming of One's Pleasures

a state dream: the man wished for the death of his master— 
who is still living, Artemidorus notes in passing. 20 

As concerns the oneiroi, how does one recognize those that 
are transparent and “theorematic” in contrast to those that 
predict allegorically an event different from what they show? 
If one leaves aside the unusual images that obviously call for 
an interpretation, those that foretell an event are immediately 
confirmed by reality: the event follows them without delay. 
The theorematic dream opens directly onto the thing it an¬ 
nounces, not giving interpretation any possible purchase, nor 
allowing it the necessary time interval. Allegorical dreams are 
easily recognized, therefore, by the fact that they are not 
followed by a direct realization, which means that one should 
sei^e the occasion to interpret them. It should be added that 
virtuous individuals—who do not have enypnia but only onei¬ 
roi —ordinarily experience only the clear visions of theore¬ 
matic dreams. Artemidorus does not need to explain this 
privilege: it was traditional to suppose that the gods spoke 
directly to souls that were pure. Recall what Plato said in the 
Republic: “When he has quieted both spirit and appetites, he 
arouses his third part in which wisdom resides and thus takes 
his rest; you know that it is then that he best grasps reality.” 21 
And in the novel by Chariton of Aphrodisias, at the moment 
when Callirhoe is finally near the end of her trials, and when 
her long struggle to preserve her virtue is about to be re¬ 
warded, she has a “theorematic” dream that anticipates the 
conclusion of the story and constitutes both a presage and a 
promise on the part of the goddess protecting her: “When 
night came, she saw herself in a dream, once more a girl in 
Syracuse, entering the sacred precinct of Aphrodite and re¬ 
turning from it; now she was looking at Chaereas and observ¬ 
ing her wedding day; the whole city was decked with garlands 
and she herself was being escorted by her father and mother 
to the home of the groom.” 22

The Care of the Self 


We can construct a table of the relationships established by 
Artemidorus between the types of dreams, their ways of signi¬ 
fying, and the subject’s modes of being, as follows:
