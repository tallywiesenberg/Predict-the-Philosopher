It is the last entry in the table—allegorical event dreams of 
the sort that ordinary people have—that defines the domain 
of oneirocriticism. It is here that interpretation is possible, 
since such visions are not transparent but make use of one 
image to convey another. And it is here that interpretation is 
useful, since it enables one to prepare for an event that is not 
immediate. 

2. Decipherment of the oneiric allegory is carried out by 
means of analogy. Artemidorus returns to this point several 
times: the art of oneirocriticism is based on the law of resem¬ 
blance; it operates through the “juxtaposition of similari¬ 
ties.” 23 Artemidorus brings this analogy into play on two 
levels. First, there is the natural analogy between the dream 
image and the elements of the future that it foretells. Ar¬ 
temidorus employs various means to detect this resemblance: 
qualitative identity (to dream of a malaise may signify a future 
“bad state” of health or fortune; to dream of mud signifies that 
the body will be congested with harmful substances); identity 
of words (a ram signifies authority because of the word associ¬ 
ation krios-kreion ); 24 symbolic affinity (to dream of a lion is

a sign of victory for an athlete; to dream of tempests is a sign 
of misfortune); existence of a belief, a popular saying, a mytho¬ 
logical theme (a bear indicates a woman because of Callisto 
the Arcadian); 25 also membership in the same category of 
existence: thus marriage and death may represent each other 
in a dream, since both are regarded as a telos, an end (goal or 
term) for a man’s life; 26 and similarity of practices (“if a sick 
man dreams that he is marrying a maiden, it portends his 
death, for the same things that happen to a bridegroom hap¬ 
pen to a dead man”). 27 

There is also an analogy of value. And this is an essential 
point in that oneirocriticism has the function of determining 
whether the events that will take place are favorable or not. The 
whole domain of the dream’s signified is marked, in Ar- 
temidorus’ text, by the binary division between the good and 
the bad, the auspicious and the inauspicious, the fortunate and 
the unfortunate. The question then is this: How does the action 
that is represented in a dream make use of its own value to 
announce the event that will take place? The general principle 
is simple. A dream bears a favorable forecast if the action it 
represents is itself good. But how is this value to be measured? 
Artemidorus suggests six criteria. Is the represented action in 
conformity with nature? Is it in conformity with law? Is it in 
conformity with custom? Is it in conformity with the techne — 
that is, with the rules and practices that allow an action to 
achieve its ends? Is it in conformity with time (i.e., is it carried 
out at the right time and in the right circumstances)? Lastly, 
what of its name (does it have a name that is itself auspicious)? 
“It is a basic principle that everything that appears in accord¬ 
ance with nature, law, custom, craft, names, or time is good, 
but everything that is contrary to them is bad and inauspi¬ 
cious.” 28 Artemidorus goes on to say, however, that this princi¬ 
ple is not universal and that it involves exceptions. There can be 
a kind of reversal of values. Certain dreams that are “good in 
regard to their interior” may be “bad in regard to their exte¬ 
rior”: the action imagined in the dream is favorable (thus, to 
dream that one has dinner with a god is in itself positive), but

the event prefigured is negative (for if the god is Cronos, bound 
in chains by his sons, the image signifies that one will go to 
prison). 29 Inversely, other dreams are “bad in regard to their 
interior” and “good in regard to their exterior”: a slave dreams 
that he is fighting in a war; this is a presage of his emancipation, 
for a soldier cannot be a slave. There is a considerable margin of 
variation, therefore, around the positive or negative signs and 
signifieds. What is involved is not an uncertainty that cannot be 
overcome, but a complex domain which demands that one take 
account of every aspect of the image in the dream and the
