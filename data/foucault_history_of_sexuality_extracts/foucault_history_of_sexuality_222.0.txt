circumstances of the dreamer. 

Before proceeding to the analysis of sexual dreams as it was 
practiced by Artemidorus, this rather long detour was neces¬ 
sary in order to understand the mechanics of the interpreta¬ 
tions and to determine how the moral valuations of sexual acts 
emerge in the divination of the dreams that represent them. 
It would be unwise in fact to use this text as a direct commen¬ 
tary on the value and legitimacy of sexual acts. Artemidorus 
does not say whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, 
to commit a particular act, but whether it is good or bad, 
favorable or ominous, to dream that one commits it. The 
principles that can be isolated do not therefore relate to the 
acts themselves but to their author, or rather to the sexual 
actor insofar as he represents, in the oneiric scene, the author 
of the dream and so enacts a presage of the good or evil that 
will befall him. The two main principles of oneirocriticism— 
namely, that the dream “tells what is real” and that it does so 
in the form of analogy—function here in the following way: 
the dream tells the event, the good fortune or misfortune, the 
prosperity or sorrow, that will characterize the subject’s mode 
of being in reality, and it tells it through a relationship of 
analogy with the mode of being—good or bad, favorable or 
unfavorable—of the subject as an actor on the sexual stage of 
the dream. One must not look in this text for a code specifying 
what should and should not be done; what it reveals instead 
is an ethics of the subject, one that was still common in the 
time of Artemidorus.

The Analysis 


Artemidorus devotes four chapters to sexual dreams—not 
counting the many scattered notations. 1 He organizes his anal¬ 
ysis around the distinction between three types of acts: those 
in conformity with the law (kata nomon), those contrary to 
the law (para nomon), and those contrary to nature (para 
physin). This division is far from being clear: none of these 
terms is defined. One does not see how the categories intercon¬ 
nect, or whether the category of “contrary to nature” should 
be understood as a subdivision of acts “contrary to the law.” 
Certain acts appear under two headings at once. We should 
not assume a rigorous classification that would assign every 
possible sexual act to the domain of the lawful, the unlawful, 
or the unnatural. Nevertheless, considered in detail, these
