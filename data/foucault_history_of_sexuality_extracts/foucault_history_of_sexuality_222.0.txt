circumstances of the dreamer. 

Before proceeding to the analysis of sexual dreams as it was 
practiced by Artemidorus, this rather long detour was neces¬ 
sary in order to understand the mechanics of the interpreta¬ 
tions and to determine how the moral valuations of sexual acts 
emerge in the divination of the dreams that represent them. 
It would be unwise in fact to use this text as a direct commen¬ 
tary on the value and legitimacy of sexual acts. Artemidorus 
does not say whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, 
to commit a particular act, but whether it is good or bad, 
favorable or ominous, to dream that one commits it. The 
principles that can be isolated do not therefore relate to the 
acts themselves but to their author, or rather to the sexual 
actor insofar as he represents, in the oneiric scene, the author 
of the dream and so enacts a presage of the good or evil that 
will befall him. The two main principles of oneirocriticism— 
namely, that the dream “tells what is real” and that it does so 
in the form of analogy—function here in the following way: 
the dream tells the event, the good fortune or misfortune, the 
prosperity or sorrow, that will characterize the subject’s mode 
of being in reality, and it tells it through a relationship of 
analogy with the mode of being—good or bad, favorable or 
unfavorable—of the subject as an actor on the sexual stage of 
the dream. One must not look in this text for a code specifying 
what should and should not be done; what it reveals instead 
is an ethics of the subject, one that was still common in the 
time of Artemidorus.

The Analysis 


Artemidorus devotes four chapters to sexual dreams—not 
counting the many scattered notations. 1 He organizes his anal¬ 
ysis around the distinction between three types of acts: those 
in conformity with the law (kata nomon), those contrary to 
the law (para nomon), and those contrary to nature (para 
physin). This division is far from being clear: none of these 
terms is defined. One does not see how the categories intercon¬ 
nect, or whether the category of “contrary to nature” should 
be understood as a subdivision of acts “contrary to the law.” 
Certain acts appear under two headings at once. We should 
not assume a rigorous classification that would assign every 
possible sexual act to the domain of the lawful, the unlawful, 
or the unnatural. Nevertheless, considered in detail, these 
groupings do have a certain intelligibility. 

1. Let us consider first the acts that are “in conformity 
with the law.” In retrospect, this chapter appears to mix to¬ 
gether things that are quite different: adultery and marriage, 
frequenting of prostitutes, resorting to household slaves, a 
servant’s masturbation. But in fact—leaving aside for now 
the meaning that should be given to this notion of conform¬ 
ity with the law—a passage from the chapter makes the pro¬ 
gression of the analysis rather clear. Artemidorus states as a 
general rule that women in dreams are “symbols of things 
that will happen to the dreamer, so that the character and

disposition of the woman determine what will happen to 
him.” 2 It needs to be understood, then, that for Artemidorus 
what determines the predictive meaning of a dream, and 
hence in a certain way the moral value of the act dreamed 
of, is the condition of the partner, and not the form of the 
act itself. Condition should be taken here in the broad sense: 
it is the social status of the “other”; it is the fact that he is 
married or not, is free or a slave, that he is young or old, 
rich or poor; it is his profession, it is the place where one 
meets him; it is the position he holds in relation to the 
dreamer (spouse, mistress, slave, young protege, etc.). One is 
thus able to see, beneath its apparent confusion, how the text 
unfolds: it follows the order of possible partners, according 
to their status, their connection to the dreamer, and the 
place where the dreamer encounters them. 

The first three figures evoked by the text reproduce the 
traditional series of the three categories of women to which 
one can have access: the wife, the mistress, and the prostitute. 
To dream of sexual intercourse with one’s own wife is a favor¬ 
able sign, because the wife is in a relationship of natural anal¬ 
ogy to the dreamer’s craft or profession. As with the latter, one 
engages with her in a recognized and legitimate activity; one 
benefits from her as from a prosperous occupation; the plea¬ 
sure that one derives from intercourse with her foretells the 
pleasure one will derive from the profits of one’s trade. There 
is no difference in this regard between the wife and the mis¬
