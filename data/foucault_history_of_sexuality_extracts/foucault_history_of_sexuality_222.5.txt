groupings do have a certain intelligibility. 

1. Let us consider first the acts that are “in conformity 
with the law.” In retrospect, this chapter appears to mix to¬ 
gether things that are quite different: adultery and marriage, 
frequenting of prostitutes, resorting to household slaves, a 
servant’s masturbation. But in fact—leaving aside for now 
the meaning that should be given to this notion of conform¬ 
ity with the law—a passage from the chapter makes the pro¬ 
gression of the analysis rather clear. Artemidorus states as a 
general rule that women in dreams are “symbols of things 
that will happen to the dreamer, so that the character and

disposition of the woman determine what will happen to 
him.” 2 It needs to be understood, then, that for Artemidorus 
what determines the predictive meaning of a dream, and 
hence in a certain way the moral value of the act dreamed 
of, is the condition of the partner, and not the form of the 
act itself. Condition should be taken here in the broad sense: 
it is the social status of the “other”; it is the fact that he is 
married or not, is free or a slave, that he is young or old, 
rich or poor; it is his profession, it is the place where one 
meets him; it is the position he holds in relation to the 
dreamer (spouse, mistress, slave, young protege, etc.). One is 
thus able to see, beneath its apparent confusion, how the text 
unfolds: it follows the order of possible partners, according 
to their status, their connection to the dreamer, and the 
place where the dreamer encounters them. 

The first three figures evoked by the text reproduce the 
traditional series of the three categories of women to which 
one can have access: the wife, the mistress, and the prostitute. 
To dream of sexual intercourse with one’s own wife is a favor¬ 
able sign, because the wife is in a relationship of natural anal¬ 
ogy to the dreamer’s craft or profession. As with the latter, one 
engages with her in a recognized and legitimate activity; one 
benefits from her as from a prosperous occupation; the plea¬ 
sure that one derives from intercourse with her foretells the 
pleasure one will derive from the profits of one’s trade. There 
is no difference in this regard between the wife and the mis¬
