tress. The case of prostitutes is different. Here the analysis set 
forth by Artemidorus is rather curious: in themselves women, 
as objects from which one derives pleasure, have a positive 
value; and prostitutes—whom the traditional vocabulary 
sometimes calls “workers”—are there to furnish these pleas¬ 
ures, and they “give themselves without refusing anything.” 
There is, however, “a little disgrace” in frequenting such 
women—disgrace and also expense—which no doubt detracts 
a little from the value of the event forecast by the dream that 
represents them. But more than anything else, it is the place

of prostitution that introduces a negative value—for two rea¬ 
sons, one of which is linguistic in nature. If the brothel is 
designated by a word signifying shop or workshop (ergaste- 
rion), which has favorable implications, it is also called, like 
a cemetery, “a place for everyone,” “a common place.” The 
other reason touches on a point that is also frequently cited 
in the sexual ethics of the philosophers and physicians: the 
useless discharge of sperm, its waste, without the benefit of the 
offspring the woman can provide. Two reasons why going to 
prostitutes can, in a dream, portend death. 

To the conventional triad of wife, mistress, prostitute, Ar- 
temidorus adds the unknown women one encounters. In this 
case the dream’s value for the future depends on the social 
“value” of the woman it represents: Is she rich, well dressed, 
well provided with jewelry, and does she give herself willingly? 
If so, then the dream promises something beneficial. If she is 
old, ugly, poor, if she does not freely consent, the dream is 
inauspicious. 

The household provides another category of sexual part¬ 
ners: servants and slaves. Here one is in the domain of direct 
possession. It is not by analogy that slaves signify wealth; they 
are an integral part of it. It stands to reason, then, that the 
pleasure one enjoys in a dream with this type of personage 
indicates that one will “derive pleasure from one’s possessions, 
which will grow greater and more valuable.” One exercises a 
right; one reaps benefits from one’s property. Consequently, 
these are favorable dreams, which realize a status and a legiti¬ 
macy. The sex of the partner makes little difference of course; 
girl or boy, what matters is that one is dealing with a slave. 
On the other hand, Artemidorus does bring out an important 
distinction concerning the position of the dreamer in the sex¬ 
ual act. Is he active or passive? To place oneself “beneath” 
one’s servant in a dream, thus overturning the social hierar¬ 
chy, is ominous; it is a sign that one will suffer harm from this 
inferior or incur his contempt. And, confirming that it is 
indeed a question here, not of an offense against nature, but

The Care of the Self 


of an attack on social hierarchies and a threat against the 
proper ratio of forces, Artemidorus notes the similarly nega¬ 
tive value of dreams in which the dreamer is possessed by an 
enemy, or by his own brother, whether older or younger (the 
equality is broken). 

Next comes the group comprising friends and acquaint¬ 
ances. It is auspicious to dream that one has sexual intercourse 
with a woman whom one knows if she is not married and if 
she is rich, because a woman who offers herself gives not only 
her body but also things “pertaining to the body,” the things 
that she carries with her (clothes, jewelry, and generally 
speaking all the material goods she possesses). The dream is 
inauspicious, on the other hand, if she is a married woman, for 
she is under the authority of her husband. The law bars access 
to her and punishes adulterers, and the dreamer in this case 
must expect future punishment of the same type. And what 
if one dreams of having sex with a man? If the dreamer is a 
woman (this is one of the rare passages in the text where 
women’s dreams are taken into account), the dream is favor¬ 
able in every case, for it accords with the natural and social 
roles of women. If, however, it is a man who dreams of being 
possessed by another man, the distinguishing factor that ena¬ 
bles one to decide whether the dream has a positive or a 
negative value is the relative status of the two partners: the 
dream is good if one is possessed by a man older and richer 
than oneself (it is a promise of gifts); it is bad if the active 
partner is younger and poorer, or just poorer: clearly a sign 
of future expenditures. 

A last set of dreams in conformity with the law relates to 
masturbation. These dreams are very closely associated with 
the theme of slavery, because what is involved is a service that 
one renders oneself (hands are like servants who do the bid¬
