tress. The case of prostitutes is different. Here the analysis set 
forth by Artemidorus is rather curious: in themselves women, 
as objects from which one derives pleasure, have a positive 
value; and prostitutes—whom the traditional vocabulary 
sometimes calls “workers”—are there to furnish these pleas¬ 
ures, and they “give themselves without refusing anything.” 
There is, however, “a little disgrace” in frequenting such 
women—disgrace and also expense—which no doubt detracts 
a little from the value of the event forecast by the dream that 
represents them. But more than anything else, it is the place

of prostitution that introduces a negative value—for two rea¬ 
sons, one of which is linguistic in nature. If the brothel is 
designated by a word signifying shop or workshop (ergaste- 
rion), which has favorable implications, it is also called, like 
a cemetery, “a place for everyone,” “a common place.” The 
other reason touches on a point that is also frequently cited 
in the sexual ethics of the philosophers and physicians: the 
useless discharge of sperm, its waste, without the benefit of the 
offspring the woman can provide. Two reasons why going to 
prostitutes can, in a dream, portend death. 

To the conventional triad of wife, mistress, prostitute, Ar- 
temidorus adds the unknown women one encounters. In this 
case the dream’s value for the future depends on the social 
“value” of the woman it represents: Is she rich, well dressed, 
well provided with jewelry, and does she give herself willingly? 
If so, then the dream promises something beneficial. If she is 
old, ugly, poor, if she does not freely consent, the dream is 
inauspicious. 

The household provides another category of sexual part¬ 
ners: servants and slaves. Here one is in the domain of direct 
possession. It is not by analogy that slaves signify wealth; they 
are an integral part of it. It stands to reason, then, that the 
pleasure one enjoys in a dream with this type of personage 
indicates that one will “derive pleasure from one’s possessions, 
which will grow greater and more valuable.” One exercises a 
right; one reaps benefits from one’s property. Consequently, 
these are favorable dreams, which realize a status and a legiti¬ 
macy. The sex of the partner makes little difference of course; 
girl or boy, what matters is that one is dealing with a slave.
