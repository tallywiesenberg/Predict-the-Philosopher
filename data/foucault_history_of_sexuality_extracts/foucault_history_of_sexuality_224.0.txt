ding of their master, the penis) and because the word that 
means “to bind to a post,” used in connection with the whip¬ 
ping of slaves, also means “to have an erection.” A slave who 
had dreamed he had masturbated his owner was in real life

sentenced by him to a whipping. One sees the wide range of 
things that are “in conformity with the law.” The category 
encompasses marital acts and sexual relations with a mistress 
as well as intercourse, active or passive, with another man, and 
masturbation. 

2. The domain that Artemidorus regards as “contrary to 
the law” is, however, largely constituted by incest. 3 More¬ 
over, incest is understood in the very strict sense of sexual 
relations between parents and children. As for incest with 
brothers and sisters, it is assimilated into the category of 
father-daughter intercourse if it occurs between a brother 
and his sister. Between brothers, however, Artemidorus 
can’t seem to decide whether to place it in the category of 
kata nomon or in that of para nomon. In any case, he speaks 
of it under both rubrics. 

When a father dreams that he has sex with his daughter 
or his son, the signification is almost always unfavorable. 
This may be for immediate physical reasons: if the child is 
very young, the physical injury resulting from such an act is 
a sign pointing to his or her death (if the child is less than 
five years old) or sickness (if more than five years old but 
less than ten). If the child is older, the dream is still bad, 
because it brings into play impossible or disastrous relations. 
To take sexual pleasure in one’s own son, to “spend” one’s 
semen inside him, is a useless act, a wasteful expenditure by 
which nothing can be gained, and which therefore portends 
a considerable loss of money. To have intercourse with him 
when he is fully grown, seeing that a father and a son cannot 
coexist without conflict in a household where both wish to 
exercise authority, is necessarily a bad omen. This kind of 
dream is good in a single case: when the father undertakes a 
journey with his son and so has a joint project to carry out 
with him. But if, in dreams like this, the father is in a passive 
position (whether the dreamer is the son or the father), the 
indications are ominous: the order of hierarchies, the poles

of domination and activity, are overturned. The sexual “pos¬ 
session” of the father by the son augurs hostility and con¬ 
flict.* To dream that one has sexual relations with one’s own 
daughter is not much better for the father. Either this “ex¬ 
penditure” in the body of a girl who one day will marry, and 
thus convey the father’s seed to another man, portends a 
substantial loss of money; or this intercourse, if the girl is 
already married, indicates that she will leave her husband, 
that she will return home, and that it will be necessary to 
provide for her. The dream is auspicious only in the case 
where, the father being poor, the daughter may return 
wealthy and therefore capable of providing for her father. 5 

In a way that may seem strange to us, incest with one’s 
mother (always envisaged by Artemidorus as incest of mother 
with son and never of mother with daughter) is often a bearer 
of favorable omens. Should one conclude, based on the Ar- 
temidorean principle of a correlation between predictive value 
and moral value, that mother-son incest is not fundamentally 
reprehensible? Or should one see this as one of the exceptions, 
provided for by Artemidorus, to the general principle that he 
puts forward? There is no question that Artemidorus consid¬ 
ers mother-son incest to be morally wrong. But it is note¬ 
worthy that he assigns it a predictive value that is often 
favorable, making the mother into a kind of model and matrix, 
as it were, of a large number of social relations and forms of 
activity. The mother is a man’s trade; to have intercourse with 
her thus signifies success and prosperity in one’s profession. 
The mother is one’s native land; whoever dreams of sexual 
relations with her can look forward to returning home if he 
is in exile, or he can expect success in political life. The mother 
is also the fertile ground from which one came: if a man is 
involved in a lawsuit when he has an incest dream, this means 


‘Note, however, that in an interpretation given in Book IV, to penetrate one’s son 
with a feeling of pleasure is a sign that he will live; to do so with a feeling of 
suffering is a sign that he will die. Artemidorus remarks that in this case it is the 
specific character of the pleasure that determines the meaning.*
