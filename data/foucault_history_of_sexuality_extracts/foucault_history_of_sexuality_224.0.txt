means “to bind to a post,” used in connection with the whip¬

sentenced by him to a whipping. One sees the wide range of 
things that are “in conformity with the law.” The category 
encompasses marital acts and sexual relations with a mistress 
as well as intercourse, active or passive, with another man, and 
masturbation. 

2. The domain that Artemidorus regards as “contrary to 
the law” is, however, largely constituted by incest. 3 More¬ 
over, incest is understood in the very strict sense of sexual 
relations between parents and children. As for incest with 
brothers and sisters, it is assimilated into the category of 
father-daughter intercourse if it occurs between a brother 
and his sister. Between brothers, however, Artemidorus 
can’t seem to decide whether to place it in the category of 
kata nomon or in that of para nomon. In any case, he speaks 
of it under both rubrics. 

When a father dreams that he has sex with his daughter 
or his son, the signification is almost always unfavorable. 
This may be for immediate physical reasons: if the child is 
very young, the physical injury resulting from such an act is 
a sign pointing to his or her death (if the child is less than 
five years old) or sickness (if more than five years old but 
less than ten). If the child is older, the dream is still bad, 
because it brings into play impossible or disastrous relations. 
To take sexual pleasure in one’s own son, to “spend” one’s 
semen inside him, is a useless act, a wasteful expenditure by 
which nothing can be gained, and which therefore portends 
a considerable loss of money. To have intercourse with him 
when he is fully grown, seeing that a father and a son cannot 
coexist without conflict in a household where both wish to 
exercise authority, is necessarily a bad omen. This kind of 
dream is good in a single case: when the father undertakes a 
journey with his son and so has a joint project to carry out 
with him. But if, in dreams like this, the father is in a passive 
position (whether the dreamer is the son or the father), the 
indications are ominous: the order of hierarchies, the poles
