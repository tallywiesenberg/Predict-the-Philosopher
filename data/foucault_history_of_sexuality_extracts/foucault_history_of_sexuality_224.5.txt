The Care of the Self 


of domination and activity, are overturned. The sexual “pos¬ 
session” of the father by the son augurs hostility and con¬ 
flict.* To dream that one has sexual relations with one’s own 
daughter is not much better for the father. Either this “ex¬ 
penditure” in the body of a girl who one day will marry, and 
thus convey the father’s seed to another man, portends a 
substantial loss of money; or this intercourse, if the girl is 
already married, indicates that she will leave her husband, 
that she will return home, and that it will be necessary to 
provide for her. The dream is auspicious only in the case 
where, the father being poor, the daughter may return 
wealthy and therefore capable of providing for her father. 5 

In a way that may seem strange to us, incest with one’s 
mother (always envisaged by Artemidorus as incest of mother 
with son and never of mother with daughter) is often a bearer 
of favorable omens. Should one conclude, based on the Ar- 
temidorean principle of a correlation between predictive value 
and moral value, that mother-son incest is not fundamentally 
reprehensible? Or should one see this as one of the exceptions, 
provided for by Artemidorus, to the general principle that he 
puts forward? There is no question that Artemidorus consid¬ 
ers mother-son incest to be morally wrong. But it is note¬ 
worthy that he assigns it a predictive value that is often 
favorable, making the mother into a kind of model and matrix, 
as it were, of a large number of social relations and forms of 
activity. The mother is a man’s trade; to have intercourse with 
her thus signifies success and prosperity in one’s profession. 
The mother is one’s native land; whoever dreams of sexual 
relations with her can look forward to returning home if he 
is in exile, or he can expect success in political life. The mother 
is also the fertile ground from which one came: if a man is 
involved in a lawsuit when he has an incest dream, this means 


‘Note, however, that in an interpretation given in Book IV, to penetrate one’s son 
with a feeling of pleasure is a sign that he will live; to do so with a feeling of 
suffering is a sign that he will die. Artemidorus remarks that in this case it is the 
specific character of the pleasure that determines the meaning.*
