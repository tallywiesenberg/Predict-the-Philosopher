Dreaming of One’s Pleasures

that he will win possession of the disputed property; if he is 
a farmer, he will have a rich harvest. But a dream of this sort 
represents a danger for sick men: to penetrate into this Mother 
Earth means that one will die. 

3. Acts “contrary to nature” occasion two successive de¬ 
velopments in Artemidorus. The first concerns deviations 
from the position set by nature (and this development is ap¬ 
pended to the interpretation of incest dreams). The second 
concerns relations in which it is the partner who by his own 
“nature” defines the unnatural character of the act. 6 

Artemidorus submits as a principle that nature has estab¬ 
lished a definite form of sexual act for each species, one and 
only one natural position from which animals do not deviate: 
“For example, some animals mount from behind, such as the 
horse, ass, goat, bull, stag, and the other four-footed animals. 
Others join their mouths first, such as the adder, the dove, and 
the weasel. . . . Others have no contact at all, but the females 
gather up the sperm that has been squeezed out by the males, 
as, for example, fish.” Similarly, humans have received a very 
specific mode of union from nature: the face-to-face position, 
with the man extended full length on top of the woman. In this 
form, sexual intercourse is an act of complete possession. Pro¬ 
vided that she “obeys” and is “willing,” the man is master “of 
the whole body of his mate.” All the other positions “have 
been discovered by yielding to wantonness and licentious¬ 
ness.” These unnatural relations always contain a portent of 
defective social relations (bad relationships, hostility) or a 
prediction of a worsening of one’s economic situation (one is 
uncomfortable, financially “embarrassed”). 

Among these “variants” of the sexual act, Artemidorus 
gives special attention to oral eroticism. His disapproval— 
and here he expresses an attitude frequently attested in an¬ 
tiquity 7 —is vehement: an “awful act,” a “moral wrong” 
whose representation in a dream can take on a positive value 
only if it refers to the professional activity of the dreamer (if
