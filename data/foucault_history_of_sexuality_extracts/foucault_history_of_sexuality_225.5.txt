Being a wasteful discharge of semen, this practice in a dream 
foretells a useless expenditure. As a custom not in harmony 
with nature, and one which makes it no longer possible to 
kiss or to share a meal, it portends a rift, enmity, and some¬ 
times death. 

But there are other ways to deviate from nature in sexual 
relations, by the very nature of one’s partners. Artemidorus 
lists five possibilities: relations with gods, with animals, or 
with corpses; relations with oneself; and relations between 
women. The presence of these last two categories among the 
acts defying nature is more enigmatic than that of the others. 
Sexual intercourse with oneself is not to be understood as 
masturbation; the latter is mentioned among the acts that are 
“in conformity with the law.’’ What is meant here by unnatu¬ 
ral relations with oneself is penetration of the penis into one’s 
own body, or kissing one’s own sex organ, or taking the sex 
organ into one’s mouth. The first type of dream foretells pov¬ 
erty, indigence, and suffering; the second promises the birth 
of children, if one does not yet have any, or their return, if they 
are absent; the last signifies that the children will die, that one 
will be deprived of women and mistresses (for one does not 
need women when one can gratify oneself), or that one will 
be reduced to extreme poverty. 

As for sexual relations between women, one might wonder 
why they appear in the category of “unnatural” acts, whereas 
relations between men are distributed under other rubrics 
(and essentially under that of acts in conformity with the law). 
The reason for this is no doubt in the form of intercourse 
Artemidorus has in mind, which is penetration. By some artifi¬ 
cial means or other, a woman contrives to usurp the role of 
the man, wrongfully takes his position, and possesses another 
woman. Between two men, penetration, the manly act par 
excellence, is not a transgression of nature (even if it can be 
considered as shameful or unseemly for one of the two to 
undergo it). By contrast, between two women a similar act,
