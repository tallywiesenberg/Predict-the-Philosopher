which is performed in defiance of what they both are and by 
resorting to subterfuge, is every bit as unnatural as human 
intercourse with a god or an animal. To dream of these acts 
signifies that the woman will engage in futile activities, that 
she will be separated from her husband, or that she will be¬ 
come a widow. Intercourse between two women can also sig¬ 
nify the communication or knowledge of feminine “secrets.”

Dream and Act 


Two traits should be noted because they mark the entire 
analysis of the sexual dream in Artemidorus. First, the 
dreamer is always present in his own dream. The sexual im¬ 
ages that Artemidorus deciphers never constitute a pure and 
simple phantasmagoria of which the dreamer would be the 
spectator and which would unfold before his eyes indepen¬ 
dently of him. He always takes part, and he does so as the 
leading actor. What he sees is himself in his sexual activity: 
there is an exact correspondence between the subject dream¬ 
ing of an act and the subject of the act as it is seen in the 
dream. Second, we may remark that in terms of his work as 
a whole, Artemidorus seldom treats sexual acts and plea¬ 
sures as signified or presaged elements; it is relatively excep¬ 
tional for an image given in a dream to forecast a sexual act 
or a deprivation of pleasure. 1 On the other hand, these acts 
and pleasures are grouped together, in the three chapters 
studied here, as components of the dream and as predictive 
elements. Artemidorus almost always has them figure on the 
side of the “signifiers,” and almost never on the side of the 
“signified.” They are images and not meanings, representa¬ 
tion and not represented event. Artemidorus’ interpretation 
will therefore place itself on a line traced between the actor 
of the sexual act and the dreamer of the dream, going in this 
way from subject to subject; and, starting from the sexual act 
and the role of the subject as he represents himself in his

Dreaming of One’s Pleasures

dream, the work of interpretation will have as its object to 
decipher what is going to happen to the dreamer once he has 
returned to waking life. 

It is apparent at a glance that Artemidorus’ interpretation 
quite regularly discovers a social signification in sexual 
dreams. True, it sometimes happens that these dreams fore¬ 
cast an abrupt change in the state of one’s health—an illness 
or a recovery—and it happens, too, that they are signs of 
death. But in a much greater proportion, they refer to such 
events as success or failure in business, enrichment or im¬ 
poverishment, a family’s prosperity or reverse of fortune, an 
advantageous or disadvantageous undertaking, favorable mar¬ 
riages or ill-fated alliances, disputes, rivalries, reconciliations, 
good or bad luck in a public career, exile, condemnation. 
Sexual dreams foretell the dreamer’s destiny in social life; the 
actor that he is on the sexual stage of the dream anticipates 
the role that he will play in the theater of family life, profes¬ 
sional endeavor, and civic affairs. 

There are, to begin with, two reasons for this. One is entirely 
general in nature; it concerns a feature of language Ar¬ 
temidorus puts to frequent use. There exists in Greek—and in 
many other languages as well, to varying degrees—a very 
pronounced ambiguity between the sexual meaning and the 
economic meaning of certain terms. Thus, the word soma, 
which designates the body, also refers to riches and posses¬ 
sions; whence the possible equivalence between the “posses¬ 
sion” of a body and the possession of wealth. 2 Ousia is 
substance and fortune; it is also semen and sperm: the loss of 
the latter may mean expenditure of the former. 3 The term 
blabe, “damage,” may refer to economic setbacks, losses of 
money, but also to the fact that one is the victim of an act of 
violence and that one is a passive object in a sexual act. 4 * 
Artemidorus also plays on the polysemy of the vocabulary of 

‘See also Book IV, where it is said that to dream that one becomes a bridge signifies 
that one will be a prostitute: “If a woman or a handsome youth dream they turn into 
a bridge, they will become prostitutes and allow many to go over them.” \ rich man 
who had this same dream found himself in a situation in which he was “regarded 
contemptuously and was, in a certain sense, trampled under foot.”*
