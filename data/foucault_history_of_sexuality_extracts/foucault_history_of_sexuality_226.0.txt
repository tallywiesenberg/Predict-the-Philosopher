which is performed in defiance of what they both are and by 
resorting to subterfuge, is every bit as unnatural as human 
intercourse with a god or an animal. To dream of these acts 
signifies that the woman will engage in futile activities, that 
she will be separated from her husband, or that she will be¬ 
come a widow. Intercourse between two women can also sig¬ 
nify the communication or knowledge of feminine “secrets.”

Dream and Act 


Two traits should be noted because they mark the entire 
analysis of the sexual dream in Artemidorus. First, the 
dreamer is always present in his own dream. The sexual im¬ 
ages that Artemidorus deciphers never constitute a pure and 
simple phantasmagoria of which the dreamer would be the 
spectator and which would unfold before his eyes indepen¬ 
dently of him. He always takes part, and he does so as the 
leading actor. What he sees is himself in his sexual activity: 
there is an exact correspondence between the subject dream¬ 
ing of an act and the subject of the act as it is seen in the 
dream. Second, we may remark that in terms of his work as 
a whole, Artemidorus seldom treats sexual acts and plea¬ 
sures as signified or presaged elements; it is relatively excep¬ 
tional for an image given in a dream to forecast a sexual act 
or a deprivation of pleasure. 1 On the other hand, these acts 
and pleasures are grouped together, in the three chapters 
studied here, as components of the dream and as predictive 
elements. Artemidorus almost always has them figure on the 
side of the “signifiers,” and almost never on the side of the 
“signified.” They are images and not meanings, representa¬ 
tion and not represented event. Artemidorus’ interpretation 
will therefore place itself on a line traced between the actor 
of the sexual act and the dreamer of the dream, going in this 
way from subject to subject; and, starting from the sexual act 
and the role of the subject as he represents himself in his
