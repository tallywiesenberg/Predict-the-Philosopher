dream, the work of interpretation will have as its object to 
decipher what is going to happen to the dreamer once he has 
returned to waking life. 

It is apparent at a glance that Artemidorus’ interpretation 
quite regularly discovers a social signification in sexual 
dreams. True, it sometimes happens that these dreams fore¬ 
cast an abrupt change in the state of one’s health—an illness 
or a recovery—and it happens, too, that they are signs of 
death. But in a much greater proportion, they refer to such 
events as success or failure in business, enrichment or im¬ 
poverishment, a family’s prosperity or reverse of fortune, an 
advantageous or disadvantageous undertaking, favorable mar¬ 
riages or ill-fated alliances, disputes, rivalries, reconciliations, 
good or bad luck in a public career, exile, condemnation. 
Sexual dreams foretell the dreamer’s destiny in social life; the 
actor that he is on the sexual stage of the dream anticipates 
the role that he will play in the theater of family life, profes¬ 
sional endeavor, and civic affairs. 

There are, to begin with, two reasons for this. One is entirely 
general in nature; it concerns a feature of language Ar¬ 
temidorus puts to frequent use. There exists in Greek—and in 
many other languages as well, to varying degrees—a very 
pronounced ambiguity between the sexual meaning and the 
economic meaning of certain terms. Thus, the word soma, 
which designates the body, also refers to riches and posses¬ 
sions; whence the possible equivalence between the “posses¬ 
sion” of a body and the possession of wealth. 2 Ousia is 
substance and fortune; it is also semen and sperm: the loss of 
the latter may mean expenditure of the former. 3 The term 
blabe, “damage,” may refer to economic setbacks, losses of 
money, but also to the fact that one is the victim of an act of 
violence and that one is a passive object in a sexual act. 4 * 
Artemidorus also plays on the polysemy of the vocabulary of 

‘See also Book IV, where it is said that to dream that one becomes a bridge signifies 
that one will be a prostitute: “If a woman or a handsome youth dream they turn into 
a bridge, they will become prostitutes and allow many to go over them.” \ rich man 
who had this same dream found himself in a situation in which he was “regarded 
contemptuously and was, in a certain sense, trampled under foot.”*
