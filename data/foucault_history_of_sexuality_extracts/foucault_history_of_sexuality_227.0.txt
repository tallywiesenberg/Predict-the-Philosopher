The Care of the Self 


debt: words signifying that one is bound to pay and one seeks 
to get free of the debt may also mean that one is pressed by 
a sexual need and that by satisfying it one is free of it. The 
word anagkaion, which is employed to designate the male 
organ, is at the intersection of these significations. 6 

Another reason has to do with the particular form and 
intended purpose of Artemidorus’ work: a man’s book that is 
addressed mainly to men in order to help them lead their lives 
as men. One must remember in fact that the interpretation of 
dreams is not regarded as a matter of pure and simple curios¬ 
ity; it is an activity that is useful for managing one’s existence 
and for preparing oneself for events that are going to occur. 
Since the nights tell the things of which the days will be made, 
it is good—if one is properly to live out his existence as a man, 
a master of a household, a father of a family—to be able to 
decipher the dreams that arise in one’s life. This is the perspec¬ 
tive of Artemidorus’ books: they are a guide that will aid the 
responsible man, the master of his house, to conduct himself 
in daily life according to the signs that may prefigure that life. 
Hence it is the fabric of this familial, economic, and social life 
that he strives to rediscover in the images of dreams. 

But that is not all: the interpretive practice at work in 
Artemidorus’ discourse shows that the sexual dream itself is 
perceived, formalized, analyzed as a social scene. If it foretells 
“good things and bad” in the domain of occupation, patri¬ 
mony, family, political career, status, friendships, and patron¬ 
age, this is because the sexual acts that the dream depicts are 
made up of the same elements as that domain. By following 
the analytic procedures Artemidorus uses, one sees clearly 
that the interpretation of aphrodisia dreams in terms of suc¬ 
cess or failure, social good fortune or misfortune, presupposes 
a sort of consubstantiality between the two domains. This is 
apparent on two levels: that of the elements of the dream that 
are taken up as materials for the analysis and that of the 
principles that make it possible to attribute a meaning (a 
predictive “value”) to those elements.
