1. What elements does Artemidorus single out for his 
analysis? 

The personages first of all. Concerning the dreamer himself, 
Artemidorus takes no account of his recent or distant past, for 
example, or of his state of mind, or generally of his passions 
either. What interests Artemidorus are the dreamer’s social 
attributes: the age group to which he belongs, whether or not 
he engages in business, whether he has political responsibili¬ 
ties, whether he is trying to get his children married, whether 
he is threatened by ruin or by the hostility of those close to 
him, and so forth. It is also as “personages” that the partners 
represented are considered. The oneiric world of Ar- 
temidorus’ dreamer is peopled by individuals who have few 
physical traits and who do not appear to have many affective 
or erotic ties to the dreamer himself. They figure as little more 
than social profiles: young people, old people (at any rate they 
are younger or older than the dreamer), rich people, or poor 
people; they are individuals who bring riches or ask for pres¬ 
ents; they are relatives who flatter or humiliate; they are su¬ 
periors to whom one had best yield or inferiors by whom one 
can rightfully profit; they are people from the household or 
from the outside; they are free men, women under a husband’s 
control, slaves, or professional prostitutes. 

As for what transpires between these personages and the 
dreamer, Artemidorus’ restraint is nothing short of remark¬ 
able. No caresses, no complicated combinations, no phantas¬ 
magoria; just a few simple variations around one basic form 
—penetration. It is the latter that seems to constitute the very 
essence of sexual practice, the only form, in any case, that 
deserves attention and yields meaning in the analysis of 
dreams. Much more than the body itself, with its different 
parts, much more than pleasure, with its qualities and intensi¬ 
ties, the act of penetration appears as a qualifier of sexual acts, 
with its few variants of position and especially its two poles 
of activity and passivity. What Artemidorus wants to know, 
the question that he asks constantly concerning the dreams he

studies, is who penetrates whom. Is the dreaming subject 
(nearly always a man) active or passive? Is he the one who 
penetrates, dominates, enjoys? Is he the one who submits or
