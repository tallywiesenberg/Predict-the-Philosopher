is possessed? Whether it is a matter of relations with a son or 
with a father, with a mother or with a slave, the question 
comes back almost without fail (unless it is already implicitly 
answered): How did the penetration take place? Or more ex¬ 
actly: What was the position of the subject in regard to this 
penetration? All sexual dreams, even “lesbian” ones, are ex¬ 
amined from this viewpoint and from this viewpoint alone. 

Now, this act of penetration—the core of sexual activity, 
the raw material of interpretation, and the source of meaning 
for the dream—is directly perceived within a social scenogra- 
phy. Artemidorus sees the sexual act first and foremost as a 
game of superiority and inferiority: penetration places the two 
partners in a relationship of domination and submission. It is 
victory on one side, defeat on the other; it is a right that is 
exercised for one of the partners, a necessity that is imposed 
on the other. It is a status that one asserts, or a condition to 
which one is subjected. It is an advantage from which one 
benefits, or an acceptance of a situation from which others are 
allowed to benefit. Which brings us to the other aspect of the 
sexual act. Artemidorus also sees it as an “economic” game 
of expenditure and profit: profit, the pleasure that one takes, 
the agreeable sensations that one experiences; expenditure, the 
energy necessary for the act, the loss of semen—that precious 
vital substance—and the fatigue that ensues. Much more than 
all the variables that might come from the different possible 
actions, or the different sensations accompanying them, and 
much more than all the possible scenes that the dream might 
present, it is these elements relating to penetration as a “strate¬ 
gic” game of expenditure and benefit that are taken up by 
Artemidorus and used to develop his analysis. 

These elements may well appear, from our vantage point, 
meager, schematic, sexually “colorless”; but it should be 
noted that they saturate the analysis from the start with so¬ 
cially marked elements. Artemidorus’ analysis brings in per- 



Dreaming of One’s Pleasures

sonages that have been lifted fresh from a social scene, all of 
whose characteristics they still display; and it distributes them 
around an essential act that is located at one and the same time 
on the plane of physical conjunctions, on that of social rela¬ 
tions of superiority and inferiority, and on that of economic 
activities of expenditure and profit. 

2. How—on the basis of these elements, taken up in this 
fashion and made pertinent for the analysis—will Arte- 
midorus establish the “value” of the sexual dream? And what 
is meant by this is not only the type of event that is forecast 
allegorically, but above all—the crucial aspect for practical 
analysis—its “quality,” that is, its auspicious or inauspicious 
character for the dreamer. Recall that one of the fundamental 
principles of the method is that the predictive quality of a 
dream (the favorable or unfavorable character of the event 
foretold) depends on the value of the foretelling image (the 
good or bad character of the act represented in a dream). Now, 
by following the analysis through a series of examples, we 
have been able to see that a sexual act with a “positive value” 
from Artemidorus’ point of view is not always and not exactly 
a sexual act that is permitted by law, honored by opinion, and 
accepted by custom. There are major coincidences, of course: 
to dream that one has intercourse with one’s own spouse or 
mistress is good. But there are divergences, and important 
ones: the favorable value of a dream of incest with one’s 
mother is the most striking example of these. We need then 
to ask: What is this other way of qualifying sexual acts? What 
are these other criteria that enable one to say that the acts are 
“good” in a dream and for the dreamer, whereas they would 
be culpable in reality? It seems in fact that what constitutes 
the “value” of a dreamed-of sexual act is the relationship that 
is established between the sexual role and the social role of the 
dreamer. More precisely, we can say that Artemidorus finds 
“favorable” and propitious a dream in which the dreamer 
pursues his sexual activity with his partner according to a 
schema that conforms to what his relationship with the same

partner should be in social, not sexual, life. It is this adjust¬ 
ment to the “waking” social relation that qualifies the oneiric 
sexual relation. 

In order to be “good,” the sexual act that one dreams needs 
to obey a general rule of “isomorphism.” And, speaking 
schematically still, one may add that this rule takes two forms: 
“analogy of position” and “economic adequation.” According 
to the first of these principles, a sexual act will be good to the
