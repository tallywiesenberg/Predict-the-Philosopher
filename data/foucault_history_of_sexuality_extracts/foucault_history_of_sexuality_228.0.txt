is possessed? Whether it is a matter of relations with a son or 
with a father, with a mother or with a slave, the question 
comes back almost without fail (unless it is already implicitly 
answered): How did the penetration take place? Or more ex¬ 
actly: What was the position of the subject in regard to this 
penetration? All sexual dreams, even “lesbian” ones, are ex¬ 
amined from this viewpoint and from this viewpoint alone. 

Now, this act of penetration—the core of sexual activity, 
the raw material of interpretation, and the source of meaning 
for the dream—is directly perceived within a social scenogra- 
phy. Artemidorus sees the sexual act first and foremost as a 
game of superiority and inferiority: penetration places the two 
partners in a relationship of domination and submission. It is 
victory on one side, defeat on the other; it is a right that is 
exercised for one of the partners, a necessity that is imposed 
on the other. It is a status that one asserts, or a condition to 
which one is subjected. It is an advantage from which one 
benefits, or an acceptance of a situation from which others are 
allowed to benefit. Which brings us to the other aspect of the 
sexual act. Artemidorus also sees it as an “economic” game 
of expenditure and profit: profit, the pleasure that one takes, 
the agreeable sensations that one experiences; expenditure, the 
energy necessary for the act, the loss of semen—that precious 
vital substance—and the fatigue that ensues. Much more than 
all the variables that might come from the different possible 
actions, or the different sensations accompanying them, and 
much more than all the possible scenes that the dream might 
present, it is these elements relating to penetration as a “strate¬ 
gic” game of expenditure and benefit that are taken up by 
Artemidorus and used to develop his analysis. 

These elements may well appear, from our vantage point, 
meager, schematic, sexually “colorless”; but it should be 
noted that they saturate the analysis from the start with so¬ 
cially marked elements. Artemidorus’ analysis brings in per-
