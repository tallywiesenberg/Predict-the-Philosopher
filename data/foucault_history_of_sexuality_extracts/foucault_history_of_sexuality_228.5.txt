activities of expenditure and profit. 

2. How—on the basis of these elements, taken up in this 
fashion and made pertinent for the analysis—will Arte- 
midorus establish the “value” of the sexual dream? And what 
is meant by this is not only the type of event that is forecast 
allegorically, but above all—the crucial aspect for practical 
analysis—its “quality,” that is, its auspicious or inauspicious 
character for the dreamer. Recall that one of the fundamental 
principles of the method is that the predictive quality of a 
dream (the favorable or unfavorable character of the event 
foretold) depends on the value of the foretelling image (the 
good or bad character of the act represented in a dream). Now, 
by following the analysis through a series of examples, we 
have been able to see that a sexual act with a “positive value” 
from Artemidorus’ point of view is not always and not exactly 
a sexual act that is permitted by law, honored by opinion, and 
accepted by custom. There are major coincidences, of course: 
to dream that one has intercourse with one’s own spouse or 
mistress is good. But there are divergences, and important 
ones: the favorable value of a dream of incest with one’s 
mother is the most striking example of these. We need then 
to ask: What is this other way of qualifying sexual acts? What 
are these other criteria that enable one to say that the acts are 
“good” in a dream and for the dreamer, whereas they would 
be culpable in reality? It seems in fact that what constitutes 
the “value” of a dreamed-of sexual act is the relationship that 
is established between the sexual role and the social role of the 
dreamer. More precisely, we can say that Artemidorus finds 
“favorable” and propitious a dream in which the dreamer 
pursues his sexual activity with his partner according to a 
schema that conforms to what his relationship with the same

partner should be in social, not sexual, life. It is this adjust¬ 
ment to the “waking” social relation that qualifies the oneiric 
sexual relation. 

In order to be “good,” the sexual act that one dreams needs 
to obey a general rule of “isomorphism.” And, speaking 
schematically still, one may add that this rule takes two forms: 
“analogy of position” and “economic adequation.” According 
to the first of these principles, a sexual act will be good to the
