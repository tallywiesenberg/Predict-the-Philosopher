extent that the subject who dreams occupies in his sexual 
activity with his partner a position that matches the one he 
occupies in real life with this same partner (or a partner of the 
same type). Thus, to be “active” with one’s slave (whatever 
the sex of the latter), or to be active with a prostitute (male 
or female), or to be active with a boy who is young and poor, 
is good; but it will be “good” to be passive with an individual 
older than oneself, richer than oneself, and so on. It is by 
virtue of this rule of isomorphism that the dream of incest with 
one’s mother is laden with so many positive values. In such 
dreams the subject is indeed seen in a position of activity with 
respect to a mother who gave birth to and nurtured him, and 
whom he ought to cultivate, honor, serve, maintain, and en¬ 
rich in return, like a piece of land, a native country, a city. But 
for the sexual act in a dream to have a positive value, it must 
also obey a principle of “economic adequation.” The “cost” 
and the “benefit” this activity entails must be properly regu¬ 
lated: in quantity (much expense for little pleasure is not good) 
and in direction as well (not to spend uselessly on those in¬ 
dividuals, male or female, who are not in a position to repay, 
offer compensation, or be useful in return). It is this principle 
that makes it good to dream of sexual intercourse with slaves: 
one profits from one’s possessions; that which one has pur¬ 
chased for the benefit of labor yields the benefit of pleasure 
besides. It is also what gives multiple significations to dreams 
in which a father has intercourse with his daughter. Depend¬ 
ing on whether she is married or not, whether the father 
himself is a widower or not, whether the son-in-law is richer 
or poorer than the father-in-law, the dream will signify either

an expenditure for the dowry, or help coming from the daugh¬ 
ter, or an obligation to provide for her after her divorce. 

We can summarize all this by saying that the guiding thread 
of Artemidorus’ interpretation, insofar as it is concerned with 
the predictive value of sexual dreams, implies the breaking 
down and ordering of such dreams into elements (personages 
or acts) that are, by nature, social elements; and that it indi¬ 
cates a certain way of qualifying sexual acts in terms of the 
manner in which the dreaming subject maintains, as the sub¬ 
ject of the dreamed-of act, his position as a social subject. In 
the dream scene, the sexual actor (who is always the dreamer 
and is almost always an adult male) must, if his dream is to 
be good, maintain his role as a social actor (even if the act 
happens to be reprehensible in reality). Let us not forget that 
all the sexual dreams that Artemidorus analyzes are consid¬ 
ered by him to belong to the category of oneiros: hence they 
tell “what will be”; and it so happens in this case that what 
“will be,” and what is “told” in the dream, is the position of 
the dreamer as a subject of activity—active or passive, domi¬ 
nant or dominated, winner or loser, “on top” or “on the 
bottom,” profit-taker or spender, deriving benefits or ex¬ 
periencing losses, finding himself in an advantageous position 
or suffering damages. The sexual dream uses the little drama 
of penetration and passivity, pleasure and expenditure, to tell 
the subject’s mode of being, as destiny has arranged it. 

By way of confirmation, one might refer to a passage from 
The Interpretation of Dreams which shows unmistakably the 
connection between that which constitutes the individual as 
an active subject in the sexual relation and that which situates 
him in the field of social activities. I am thinking of the text, 
in another section of the book, that is devoted to the meaning 
of the different parts of the body in dreams. The male organ 
—the one called anagkaion (the “necessary” part, whose 
needs compel us and by whose force others are compelled)— 
is expressive of a whole cluster of relations and activities that 
determine the individual’s standing in the city and in the 
world. Among these are the individual’s wealth, speech, sta-

tus, political life, freedom, and even his name. “The penis 
corresponds to one’s parents, on the one hand, because it is 
itself the cause of children. It signifies a wife or mistress, since 
it is made for sexual intercourse. It indicates brothers and all 
blood relatives, since the interrelationship of the entire house 
depends upon the penis. It is a symbol of strength and physical 
vigor, because it is itself the cause of these qualities. That is 
why some people call the penis ‘one’s manhood.’ It corre¬ 
sponds to speech and education because the penis is very 
fertile . . . the penis is also a sign of wealth and possessions 
because it alternately expands and contracts and because it is 
able to produce and to eliminate. ... It indicates poverty, 
servitude, and bonds, because it is also called ‘constraining’ 
and is a symbol of necessity. It also indicates the respect that
