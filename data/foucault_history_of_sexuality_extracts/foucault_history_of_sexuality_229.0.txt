extent that the subject who dreams occupies in his sexual 
activity with his partner a position that matches the one he 
occupies in real life with this same partner (or a partner of the 
same type). Thus, to be “active” with one’s slave (whatever 
the sex of the latter), or to be active with a prostitute (male 
or female), or to be active with a boy who is young and poor, 
is good; but it will be “good” to be passive with an individual 
older than oneself, richer than oneself, and so on. It is by 
virtue of this rule of isomorphism that the dream of incest with 
one’s mother is laden with so many positive values. In such 
dreams the subject is indeed seen in a position of activity with 
respect to a mother who gave birth to and nurtured him, and 
whom he ought to cultivate, honor, serve, maintain, and en¬ 
rich in return, like a piece of land, a native country, a city. But 
for the sexual act in a dream to have a positive value, it must 
also obey a principle of “economic adequation.” The “cost” 
and the “benefit” this activity entails must be properly regu¬ 
lated: in quantity (much expense for little pleasure is not good) 
and in direction as well (not to spend uselessly on those in¬ 
dividuals, male or female, who are not in a position to repay, 
offer compensation, or be useful in return). It is this principle 
that makes it good to dream of sexual intercourse with slaves: 
one profits from one’s possessions; that which one has pur¬ 
chased for the benefit of labor yields the benefit of pleasure 
besides. It is also what gives multiple significations to dreams 
in which a father has intercourse with his daughter. Depend¬ 
ing on whether she is married or not, whether the father 
himself is a widower or not, whether the son-in-law is richer 
or poorer than the father-in-law, the dream will signify either

an expenditure for the dowry, or help coming from the daugh¬

We can summarize all this by saying that the guiding thread 
of Artemidorus’ interpretation, insofar as it is concerned with 
the predictive value of sexual dreams, implies the breaking 
down and ordering of such dreams into elements (personages 
or acts) that are, by nature, social elements; and that it indi¬ 
cates a certain way of qualifying sexual acts in terms of the 
manner in which the dreaming subject maintains, as the sub¬ 
ject of the dreamed-of act, his position as a social subject. In 
the dream scene, the sexual actor (who is always the dreamer
