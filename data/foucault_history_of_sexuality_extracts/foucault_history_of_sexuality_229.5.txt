be good, maintain his role as a social actor (even if the act 
happens to be reprehensible in reality). Let us not forget that 
all the sexual dreams that Artemidorus analyzes are consid¬ 
ered by him to belong to the category of oneiros: hence they 
tell “what will be”; and it so happens in this case that what 
“will be,” and what is “told” in the dream, is the position of 
the dreamer as a subject of activity—active or passive, domi¬ 
nant or dominated, winner or loser, “on top” or “on the 
bottom,” profit-taker or spender, deriving benefits or ex¬ 
periencing losses, finding himself in an advantageous position 
or suffering damages. The sexual dream uses the little drama 
of penetration and passivity, pleasure and expenditure, to tell 
the subject’s mode of being, as destiny has arranged it. 

By way of confirmation, one might refer to a passage from 
The Interpretation of Dreams which shows unmistakably the 
connection between that which constitutes the individual as 
an active subject in the sexual relation and that which situates 
him in the field of social activities. I am thinking of the text, 
in another section of the book, that is devoted to the meaning 
of the different parts of the body in dreams. The male organ 
—the one called anagkaion (the “necessary” part, whose 
needs compel us and by whose force others are compelled)— 
is expressive of a whole cluster of relations and activities that 
determine the individual’s standing in the city and in the 
world. Among these are the individual’s wealth, speech, sta-

corresponds to one’s parents, on the one hand, because it is 
itself the cause of children. It signifies a wife or mistress, since 
it is made for sexual intercourse. It indicates brothers and all 
blood relatives, since the interrelationship of the entire house 
depends upon the penis. It is a symbol of strength and physical 
vigor, because it is itself the cause of these qualities. That is 
why some people call the penis ‘one’s manhood.’ It corre¬ 
sponds to speech and education because the penis is very 
fertile . . . the penis is also a sign of wealth and possessions 
because it alternately expands and contracts and because it is 
able to produce and to eliminate. ... It indicates poverty, 
servitude, and bonds, because it is also called ‘constraining’ 
and is a symbol of necessity. It also indicates the respect that
