The History of Sexuality 


effects of this masterful art, which are considerably more 
generous than the spareness of its prescriptions would lead 
one to imagine, are said to transfigure the one fortunate 
enough to receive its privileges: an absolute mastery of the 
body, a singular bliss, obliviousness to time and limits, the 
elixir of life, the exile of death and its threats. 

On the face of it at least, our civilization possesses no ars 
erotica. In return, it is undoubtedly the only civilization to 
practice a scientia sexualis; or rather, the only civilization to 
have developed over the centuries procedures for telling the 
truth of sex which are geared to a form of knowledge-power 
strictly opposed to the art of initiations and the masterful 
secret: I have in mind the confession. 

Since the Middle Ages at least, Western societies have 
established the confession as one of the main rituals we rely 
on for the production of truth: the codification of the sacra¬ 
ment of penance by the Lateran Council in 1215, with the 
resulting development of confessional techniques, the declin¬ 
ing importance of accusatory procedures in criminal justice, 
the abandonment of tests of guilt (sworn statements, duels, 
judgments of God) and the development of methods of inter¬ 
rogation and inquest, the increased participation of the royal 
administration in the prosecution of infractions, at the ex¬ 
pense of proceedings leading to private settlements, the set¬ 
ting up of tribunals of Inquisition: all this helped to give the 
confession a central role in the order of civil and religious 
powers. The evolution of the word avowal and of the legal 
function it designated is itself emblematic of this develop¬ 
ment: from being a guarantee of the status, identity, and 
value granted to one person by another, it came to signify 
someone’s acknowledgment of his own actions and thoughts. 
For a long time, the individual was vouched for by the refer¬ 
ence of others and the demonstration of his ties to the com¬ 
monweal (family, allegiance, protection); then he was 
authenticated by the discourse of truth he was able or obliged 
to pronounce concerning himself. The truthful confession

was inscribed at the heart of the procedures of individualiza¬ 
tion by power. 

In any case, next to the testing rituals, next to the testi¬ 
mony of witnesses, and the learned methods of observation 
and demonstration, the confession became one of the West’s 
most highly valued techniques for producing truth. We have 
since become a singularly confessing society. The confession 
has spread its effects far and wide. It plays a part in justice, 
medicine, education, family relationships, and love relations, 
in the most ordinary affairs of everyday life, and in the most 
solemn rites; one confesses one’s crimes, one’s sins, one’s 
thoughts and desires, one’s illnesses and troubles; one goes 
about telling, with the greatest precision, whatever is most 
difficult to tell. One confesses in public and in private, to 
one’s parents, one’s educators, one’s doctor, to those one 
loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things 
it would be impossible to tell to anyone else, the things people 
write books about. One confesses—or is forced to confess. 
When it is not spontaneous or dictated by some internal 
imperative, the confession is wrung from a person by vio¬ 
lence or threat; it is driven from its hiding place in the soul, 
or extracted from the body. Since the Middle Ages, torture 
has accompanied it like a shadow, and supported it when it 
could go no further: the dark twins. 2 The most defenseless 
tenderness and the bloodiest of powers have a similar need 
of confession. Western man has become a confessing animal. 

Whence a metamorphosis in literature: we have passed 
from a pleasure to be recounted and heard, centering on the 
heroic or marvelous narration of “trials” of bravery or saint¬ 
hood, to a literature ordered according to the infinite task of 
extracting from the depths of oneself, in between the words, 
a truth which the very form of the confession holds out like 
a shimmering mirage. Whence too this new way of philo¬ 
sophizing: seeking the fundamental relation to the true, not 

’Greek law had already coupled torture and confession, at least where slaves were 
concerned, and Imperial Roman law had widened the practice.
