4 The author considers the two fundamental ele¬ 
ments of regimen to be alimentation and exercise; the latter 
causes expenditures that food and drink serve to compensate.The second part of the text discusses the practice of dietetics 
from the standpoint of the properties and effects of the ele¬ 
ments that go into the regimen.After some remarks on places 
—high or low, dry or wet, exposed to such and such a wind 
—the author undertakes a review of foods (barley or wheat, 
considered in terms of the fineness of grinding, the time at 
which the dough was kneaded, the quantity of water that was 
mixed with the flour; meats, differentiated in terms of their 
varied origins; fruits and vegetables, evaluated according to 
their different varieties), then baths (hot, cold, taken before or 
after meals), vomitings, sleep, natural exercises (like those of 
hearing, voice, thought, or walking) and violent exercises 
(such as running, arm motions, wrestling, and punchball, per¬ 
formed in the dust or with an oiled body).In this enumeration 
of the elements of regimen, sexual activity (lagneie) is barely 
mentioned—between baths and oilings on one side, and vomit¬ 
ings on the other—and such mention as it does get is only 
owing to its three effects.Two of these are qualitative: a warm¬ 
ing due to the violence of the exercise (ponos), and to the 
elimination of a humid element; but also a moistening because 
the exercise has caused some of the flesh-parts to melt.
