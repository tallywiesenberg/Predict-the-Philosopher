He stresses the 
need to take account of the differences among things, individu¬ 
als, places, and times; 6 the almanac is thus not to be read as 
a set of imperative recipes but as strategic principles that one 
must know how to adapt to circumstances.In short, whereas 
the second part of the text dealt more with the elements of 
regimen in themselves, with a view to their intrinsic properties 
(and the aphrodisia are mentioned only in passing), the third 
part, in its beginning, is especially concerned with situational 
variables.The year is divided into four seasons, of course.But these 
in turn are subdivided into shorter periods of a few weeks or 
even a few days.This is because the peculiar characteristics of 
each season often develop in stages; and further, it is always 
risky to alter one’s regimen abruptly; like excesses, sudden 
changes have harmful consequences—“ ‘Little by little’ [to 
kata mikron] is a safe rule, especially in cases of change from 
one thing to another.” Which means that “in each season the 
various items of regimen should be changed gradually [kata 
mikron]."
