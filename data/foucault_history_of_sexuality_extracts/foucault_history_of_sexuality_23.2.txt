1 Thus, the winter regimen should be subdivided as 
the season itself demands, into a period of forty-four days that 
extend from the setting of the Pleiades to the solstice, then into 
an exactly equivalent period followed by a relaxation of the 
regimen.Spring begins with a period of thirty-two days, from 
the rising of Arcturus and the arrival of the swallows to the 
equinox; within this time span, the season should be divided 
into six periods of eight days.Then comes the summer season, 
which comprises two phases: from the rising of the Pleiades 
to the solstice, and from the solstice to the equinox.From that 
time to the setting of the Pleiades, one should spend forty- 
eight hours preparing for the “winter regimen.” 

The author does not provide a complete regimen for these 
small subdivisions.Rather, he defines, more or less in detail, 
an overall strategy that depends on the qualities that are char¬ 
acteristic of each of these times of the year.
