based on a principle of compensation, if not opposition or 
resistance: the cold of one season should be counterbalanced 
by a warming regimen lest the body become chilled; inversely, 
extreme heat calls for a soothing, cooling regimen.But it 
should also obey the principle of imitation and conformity: a 
mild season that progresses gradually needs a mild and gradu¬ 
ated regimen; in the period when plants prepare for their 
growth, humans should do likewise, preparing to develop their 
bodies; similarly, just as trees harden and brace themselves 
against the harsh days of winter, men should toughen them¬ 
selves by not fleeing the cold but by exposing themselves to it 
“courageously.” 8 

This is the general context in which the aphrodisia are to 
be regulated, taking account of the effects they may have on 
the interaction of heat and cold, of dryness and moisture, 
according to the general notions that one finds in the second 
part of the text.Recommendations concerning them are 
placed for the most part between alimentary prescriptions and 
advice on exercises and evacuations.Winter, from the setting 
of the Pleiades to the spring equinox, is a season in which 
regimen should have a drying and warming effect, considering 
the coldness and wetness of the season: hence, roasted rather 
than boiled meats, whole-wheat bread, small portions of dry 
vegetables, slightly diluted wine, but in small amounts; nu¬ 
merous exercises of every sort (running, wrestling, walking); 
baths that should be cold after running workouts, which al¬ 
ways heat up the body, and hot after all the other exercises; 
more frequent sexual relations, especially for older men whose 
bodies tend to become chilled; emetics three times per month 
for those with moist constitutions, two times per month for 
those who are dry.9 During the spring period, when the air is 
warmer and dryer, and when one must prepare for the growth 
of the body, one should eat as many boiled meats as roasted, 
together with moist vegetables; take baths; decrease the quan¬ 
tity of sexual relations and emetics; vomit only two times per 
month, then even less frequently, so that the body will main-

tain “a pure flesh.” After the rising of the Pleiades, with the 
coming of summer, dryness is what regimen must fight 
against: drink light wines, white and diluted; eat barley cakes, 
boiled or raw vegetables, if they can be eaten without over¬ 
heating the body; abstain from emetics and reduce sexual 
activity to a minimum (toisi de aphrodisioisin hos hekista); 
exercise less; avoid running, which dessicates the body, as well 
as walking in the sun, giving preference instead to wrestling 
in the dust.
