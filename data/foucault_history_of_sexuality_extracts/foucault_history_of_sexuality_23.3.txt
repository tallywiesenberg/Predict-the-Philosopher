10 As one gets nearer to the rising of Arcturus and 
the autumn equinox, the regimen must be made milder and 
more moist; nothing specific is said about sexual regimen.Diodes’ Regimen is much less developed than that of Hip¬ 
pocrates.However, it is quite detailed in its treatment of daily 
routine, which takes up a large part of the text: from the 
massages that should immediately follow getting up from bed, 
in order to reduce the stiffness of the body, to the positions to 
take in bed when it is time to lie down (“neither too extended 
nor too bent,” and never on one’s back), all the important 
moments of the day are examined, with the baths, the rub- 
downs, the oilings, the evacuations, the walks, and the foods 
that ought to accompany them."The question of sexual pleas¬ 
ures and their modulation is considered only in connection 
with seasonal variations, and only after some general princi¬ 
ples of balance are called to mind: “It is a very important point 
for health that our body’s potency not be diminished by an¬ 
other potency.” But the author restricts himself to brief 
generalities: first, no one should “make frequent and continual 
use of sexual intercourse”; the latter is more suitable for “cold, 
moist, atrabilious, and flatulent persons,” and least suitable 
for thin ones; there are periods in life when it is more harmful, 
as in the case of old people or for those who are “in the period 
that extends from childhood to adolescence.” 12 As for the 
presumably later text, taken to be a letter from Diodes to 
King Antigonus, the economy of pleasures it sets forth is very 
close in its general outline to that of Hippocrates: at winter 
solstice, which is the time when one is most susceptible to

catarrh, sexual practice should not be restricted.During the 
time of the Pleiades’ ascent, a period in which bitter bile is 
dominant in the body, one must indulge in sexual acts with a 
good deal of moderation.
