One should even forgo them com¬ 
pletely at summer solstice time, when black bile takes over in 
the organism; and it is necessary to abstain from sexual activ¬ 
ity, as well as from any vomiting, till the autumn equinox.13 * 

Several aspects of this regimen of pleasures merit our atten¬ 
tion.First, there is the limited space given to the problem of 
sexual relations compared with that accorded to exercises, and 
especially to food.As far as the thinking on dietetics was 
concerned, the question of foods—considered in terms of their 
peculiar qualities, and of the circumstances in which they were 
consumed (whether the seasons of the year or the particular 
state of the organism)—was a good deal more important than 
sexual activity.In addition, it should be noted that the preoc¬ 
cupation with regimen was never focused on the form of the 
acts: nothing was said about the types of sexual relations, 
nothing about the “natural” position or about unseemly prac¬ 
tices, nothing about masturbation, nor anything about the 
questions—which would later become so important—of coi¬ 
tus interruptus and methods of contraception.!
