was inscribed at the heart of the procedures of individualiza¬ 
tion by power. 

In any case, next to the testing rituals, next to the testi¬ 
mony of witnesses, and the learned methods of observation 
and demonstration, the confession became one of the West’s 
most highly valued techniques for producing truth. We have 
since become a singularly confessing society. The confession 
has spread its effects far and wide. It plays a part in justice, 
medicine, education, family relationships, and love relations, 
in the most ordinary affairs of everyday life, and in the most 
solemn rites; one confesses one’s crimes, one’s sins, one’s 
thoughts and desires, one’s illnesses and troubles; one goes 
about telling, with the greatest precision, whatever is most 
difficult to tell. One confesses in public and in private, to 
one’s parents, one’s educators, one’s doctor, to those one 
loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things 
it would be impossible to tell to anyone else, the things people 
write books about. One confesses—or is forced to confess. 
When it is not spontaneous or dictated by some internal 
imperative, the confession is wrung from a person by vio¬ 
lence or threat; it is driven from its hiding place in the soul, 
or extracted from the body. Since the Middle Ages, torture 
has accompanied it like a shadow, and supported it when it 
could go no further: the dark twins. 2 The most defenseless 
tenderness and the bloodiest of powers have a similar need 
of confession. Western man has become a confessing animal. 

Whence a metamorphosis in literature: we have passed 
from a pleasure to be recounted and heard, centering on the 
heroic or marvelous narration of “trials” of bravery or saint¬ 
hood, to a literature ordered according to the infinite task of 
extracting from the depths of oneself, in between the words, 
a truth which the very form of the confession holds out like 
a shimmering mirage. Whence too this new way of philo¬ 
sophizing: seeking the fundamental relation to the true, not 

’Greek law had already coupled torture and confession, at least where slaves were 
concerned, and Imperial Roman law had widened the practice.
