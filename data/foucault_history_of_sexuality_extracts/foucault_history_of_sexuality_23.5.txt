Hence they 
also altered the relationship between this equilibrium and the 
interaction of these elements in the outside world: heating or 
drying, which might be good for a cold, moist body, would be 
less so if the season and the climate were themselves hot and 
dry.It was not the function of regimen to prescribe quantities 
and determine rhythms: given relations that could only be 
defined in terms of their general characteristics, the role of 
regimen was to negotiate qualitative changes and make such 
readjustments as were necessitated by circumstances.We may 
note in passing that the author of the Aristotelian Problems 
seems to have been the only one to draw from one of the 
best-known principles of this qualitative psychology (namely, 
that women are generally cold and moist while men are hot 
and dry) the inference that the active season for sexual rela¬ 
tions was not the same for both sexes: summer was when 
women were most disposed to sexual intercourse, whereas 
men felt the strongest inclination in winter.15 

Thus, dietetics problematized sexual practice not as a set of 
acts to be differentiated according to their forms and accord¬ 
ing to the value of each of them, but as an “activity” the whole 
of which should be given free rein or curtailed depending on 
chronological considerations.A point that allows us to draw 
a parallel between this regimen and certain regulations found 
later, in the Christian pastoral ministry.
