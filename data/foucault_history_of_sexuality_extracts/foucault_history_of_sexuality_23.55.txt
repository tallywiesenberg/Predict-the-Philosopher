There too, in fact, 
some of the criteria used for delimiting sexual activity are

temporal in nature.But those criteria are not only more pre¬ 
cise; they operate in a completely different way: they deter¬ 
mine times when sexual practice is permitted and other times 
when it is forbidden; and this strict partition is established in 
reference to different variables: the liturgical year, menstrual 
cycles, the period of pregnancy, or the time subsequent to 
childbirth.* In the ancient medical regimens, on the other 
hand, the variations were gradual; and instead of being orga¬ 
nized according to the binary form of permitted and forbid¬ 
den, they suggest a constant oscillation between more and less.The sexual act was not considered as a licit or an illicit practice 
according to the temporal boundaries within which it was 
inscribed: situated at the point of intersection between the 
individual and the world, temperament and climate, the quali¬ 
ties of the body and those of the seasons, it was viewed as an 
activity that could be more or less pernicious in its conse¬ 
quences and should therefore be subjected to a more or less 
restrictive economy.It was a practice that demanded reflec¬ 
tion and prudence.
