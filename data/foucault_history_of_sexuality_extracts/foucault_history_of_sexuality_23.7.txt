Granted there were constitutions 
for which sexual activity was beneficial on the whole: this was 
the case for those suffering from an abundance of phlegm— 
for intercourse facilitated the elimination of fluids which 
would otherwise become corrupt, giving rise to that humor— 
or for those whose digestion was bad, whose body consumed 
itself, and whose belly was cold and dry.1 But for others, 
whose bodies and heads were congested with humors, its 
effects were largely detrimental.2 

Yet, despite this neutral valuation, this contextual ambiva¬ 
lence, sexual activity was the object of a rather constant suspi¬ 
cion.Diogenes Laertius reports a phrase by Pythagoras in 
which the general requirements of a seasonal regimen are

The Use of Pleasure 


directly associated with a need for continuous rarefaction and 
a conviction that the aphrodisia are intrinsically harmful: 
“Keep to the winter for sexual pleasures, in summer abstain; 
they are less harmful in autumn and spring, but they are 
always harmful and not conducive to health.” And he goes on 
to cite this response from Pythagoras to the person who asked 
him when the best time was for making love: “When you want 
to lose what strength you have.” 3 But the Pythagoreans were 
not the only ones by any means to manifest this sort of appre¬ 
hension; the rule of “as little as possible” and the pursuit of 
the “lesser evil” are also invoked in texts whose aims are 
purely medical or hygienic: Diodes’ Regimen proposes to 
establish the conditions in which the use of pleasures would 
cause “the least harm” (hekista enochlei); and the Aristotelian 
Problems, where the effects of the sexual act are compared to 
those of pulling a plant from the ground, which always dam¬ 
ages the roots, advises one to have relations only in case of a 
pressing need.4 In this dietetics, whose business it was to deter¬ 
mine when it was beneficial and when it was harmful to prac¬ 
tice the pleasures, one perceives the emergence of a general 
tendency toward a restrictive economy.
