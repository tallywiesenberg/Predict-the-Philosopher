difficult to tell. One confesses in public and in private, to 
one’s parents, one’s educators, one’s doctor, to those one 
loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things 
it would be impossible to tell to anyone else, the things people 
write books about. One confesses—or is forced to confess.
