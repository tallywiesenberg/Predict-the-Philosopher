This distrust is apparent in the idea that several of the most 
important organs are affected by sexual activity and may suffer 
from its abuses.Aristotle remarks that the brain is the first 
organ to feel the consequences of the sexual act, for it is the 
“coldest part” of the whole body; by withdrawing a “pure 
natural heat” from the organism, the emission of semen in¬ 
duces a general cooling effect.5 Diodes places the gall bladder, 
kidneys, lungs, eyes, and spinal cord among the organs that 
are particularly exposed to the effects of pleasure’s excesses.6 
According to the Problems, it is especially the eyes and the 
loins that are affected, either because they contribute to the act 
more than the other organs, or because the excessive heat 
produces a liquefaction within them.7 

These manifold organic correlations explain the various 
pathological consequences that were associated with sexual
