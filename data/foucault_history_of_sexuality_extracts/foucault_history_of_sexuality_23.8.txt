It should be remarked that one finds little mention 
—in the case of men at least*—of the troubles that might be 
caused by total abstinence.Illnesses due to a poor distribution 
of sexual activity were much more often illnesses of excess.Such as the famous “dorsal phthisis” defined by Hippocrates 
in the treatise Diseases and redescribed with the same etiology 
over a very long span of Western medicine: it was a disease 
that “attacks young married people in particular” and “people 
fond of sexual intercourse” (philolagnoi); its point of origin 
was the marrow (considered to be the part of the body where 
the sperm is located, as we shall see); it gave a tingling sensa¬ 
tion that descended the length of the spinal column; the sperm 
discharged spontaneously during sleep, in the urine and the 
stools; the patient became sterile.When the disease was ac¬ 
companied by breathing difficulties and headaches, he could 
die from it.A regimen of softening food and evacuation might 
bring about a cure, but only after a whole year of abstention 
from wine, exercise, and aphrodisia .
