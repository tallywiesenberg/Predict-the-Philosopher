Several 
related themes converged on this practice no doubt: that of a 
ritual abstention which, in contests and battles alike, formed 
one of the conditions for success; that of a moral victory which 
the athlete needed to win over himself if he wished to be capable 
and worthy of assuring his superiority over others; but also that 
of an economy necessary for his body in order to conserve 
strength, which the sexual act would waste on the outside.Whereas women needed sexual relations so that the discharge 
necessary to their organism might occur in a regular manner, 
men could—in certain cases at least—retain all their semen; far 
from causing them harm, strict abstinence on their part would 
preserve their force in its entirety, accumulate it, concentrate it, 
and carry it finally to a higher level.Hence a paradox resides in this preoccupation with a regi¬ 
men by which one sought both an equitable distribution of an 
activity that could not in itself be regarded as a vice, and a 
restrictive economy in which “less” seemed almost always 
preferable to “more.” While it was natural that the body 
produce a vigorous substance having the capacity to procre¬ 
ate, the very act that roused the organism and cast it out into 
the world actually risked being as dangerous in its effects as 
it was harmonious with nature in its principle.The whole 
body, with its most important or most fragile organs, risked 
paying a high price for an expenditure that nature had 
nonetheless willed; and to retain that substance which sought 
by its own power to escape, could be a means of charging the 
body with its most intense energy.2.
