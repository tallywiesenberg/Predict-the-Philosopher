it was granted that nature had organized the union of the sexes 
in order to provide people with a lineage and to ensure the 
survival of the species; and also granted that, for the same 
reason, she had associated the sexual relation with such a keen 
pleasure, this lineage was recognized as being fragile, at least 
in terms of its quality and worth.It was dangerous for the 
individual to take his pleasure at random; but if he procreated 
at random and no matter how, the future of his family would 
be placed in jeopardy.In the Laws, Plato solemnly under¬ 
scores the importance of the precautions that had to be taken 
for this purpose that concerned parents and the city as a 
whole.There were measures to be taken at the time of the first 
sexual act between the two partners on the occasion of mar¬ 
riage: all the values and all the dangers traditionally associated 
with inaugural acts were present here: on that day and night, 
it was necessary to refrain from any misdeed with respect to 
the matter at hand, “for the beginning, which among human 
beings is established as a god, is the saviour of all things—if 
She receives the proper honor from each of those who make 
use of Her.” But it was also necessary to be cautious each day 
during the whole life of the marriage: indeed, no one knew 
“what day or night” the deity would assist in a conception; 
hence “throughout the whole year and all one’s life,” espe¬ 
cially during the period of procreation, one must “be careful 
and avoid doing anything that voluntarily brings on sickness 
or involves insolence or injustice.
