is inspired by high rank: for it is called ‘reverence’ and respect. 
... If the penis is doubled, it signifies that everything will be 
doubled, with the exception of a wife or a mistress; these will 
be lost. For it is impossible to use two penises at the same time. 
I know of a slave who dreamt that he had three penises. He 
was set free and, in place of one name, he had three, since he 
received in addition the two names of the master who had 
freed him. But this happened only once. One must not base 
one’s interpretation on rare instances but rather on the more 
normal cases.” 7 

The penis thus appears at the intersection of all these games 
of mastery: self-mastery, since its demands are likely to en¬ 
slave us if we allow ourselves to be coerced by it; superiority 
over sexual partners, since it is by means of the penis that the 
penetration is carried out; status and privileges, since it sig¬

The landscape evoked in the chapters in Artemidorus that 
deal with sexual dreams was a familiar one in antiquity. It is 
easy to rediscover there aspects of manners and customs that 
could be confirmed by many other—earlier or contemporane¬

It is a world in which marriage is valued highly enough to be 
regarded as the best possible framework for sexual pleasures. 
In this world the married man can also have his mistress, avail 
himself of his servants (boys or girls), and frequent prostitutes. 
In this world, finally, sexual relations between men appear to 
be taken for granted—that is, provided that certain differences 
of age and status are respected. 

We may also note the presence of several elements of a code. 
But it must be admitted that they are both few in number and 
rather nebulous—a few major prohibitions that are manifested 
in the form of intense repulsions: fellatio, sexual relations 
between women, and, above all, the usurping of the male role 
by a woman; a very restrictive definition of incest, conceived 
of essentially as intercourse between parents and children; and 
a reference to a standard, natural form of sexual act. But there
