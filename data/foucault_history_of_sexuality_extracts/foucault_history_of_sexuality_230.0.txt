is inspired by high rank: for it is called ‘reverence’ and respect. 
... If the penis is doubled, it signifies that everything will be 
doubled, with the exception of a wife or a mistress; these will 
be lost. For it is impossible to use two penises at the same time. 
I know of a slave who dreamt that he had three penises. He 
was set free and, in place of one name, he had three, since he 
received in addition the two names of the master who had 
freed him. But this happened only once. One must not base 
one’s interpretation on rare instances but rather on the more 
normal cases.” 7 

The penis thus appears at the intersection of all these games 
of mastery: self-mastery, since its demands are likely to en¬ 
slave us if we allow ourselves to be coerced by it; superiority 
over sexual partners, since it is by means of the penis that the 
penetration is carried out; status and privileges, since it sig¬ 
nifies the whole field of kinship and social activity. 

The landscape evoked in the chapters in Artemidorus that 
deal with sexual dreams was a familiar one in antiquity. It is 
easy to rediscover there aspects of manners and customs that 
could be confirmed by many other—earlier or contemporane¬ 
ous—testimonies. One is in a world very strongly marked by 
the central position of the male personage and by the impor-

tance accorded to the masculine role in sexual relationships. 
It is a world in which marriage is valued highly enough to be 
regarded as the best possible framework for sexual pleasures. 
In this world the married man can also have his mistress, avail 
himself of his servants (boys or girls), and frequent prostitutes. 
In this world, finally, sexual relations between men appear to 
be taken for granted—that is, provided that certain differences 
of age and status are respected. 

We may also note the presence of several elements of a code. 
But it must be admitted that they are both few in number and 
rather nebulous—a few major prohibitions that are manifested 
in the form of intense repulsions: fellatio, sexual relations 
between women, and, above all, the usurping of the male role 
by a woman; a very restrictive definition of incest, conceived 
of essentially as intercourse between parents and children; and 
a reference to a standard, natural form of sexual act. But there 
is nothing in Artemidorus’ text that refers to a permanent and 
complete grid of classifications among permitted and prohib¬ 
ited acts; nothing that draws a clear and definitive line of 
division between what is natural and what is “contrary to 
nature.” Moreover, it seems that these code elements are not 
—at least not in dreams having a predictive function—what 
plays the most important and decisive role in determining the 
“quality” of a sexual act. 

On the other hand, one does perceive, in the very way the 
interpretation proceeds, a different way of thinking about sex¬ 
ual acts and different principles for evaluating them: not with 
a view to the act and its regular or irregular form, but with 
a view to the actor, his way of being, his particular situation, 
his relation to others, and the position he occupies with re¬ 
spect to them. The main question appears to bear much less 
on the acts’ conformity with a natural structure or with a 
positive regulation, than on what might be called the subject’s 
“style of activity” and on the relation he establishes between 
sexual activity and the other aspects of his familial, social, and 
economic existence. The movement of analysis and the proce¬ 
dures of valuation do not go from the act to a domain such

as sexuality or the flesh, a domain whose divine, civil, or 
natural laws would delineate the permitted forms; they go 
from the subject as a sexual actor to the other areas of life in 
which he pursues his activity. And it is in the relationship 
between these different forms of activity that the principles of 
evaluation of a sexual behavior are essentially, but not exclu¬ 
sively, situated. 

Here one easily recognizes the principal characteristics of 
the ethical experience of the aphrodisia in the form in which 
it had appeared in the texts of the classical age. And, precisely 
insofar as it does not formulate an ethic, but uses for dream 
interpretation a way of perceiving and judging sexual pleasure 
that is contemporaneous with it, Artemidorus’ book testifies 
to the endurance and solidity of that form of experience. 

If we turn, however, to texts whose object is to reflect on 
the sexual practices themselves and to give advice on behavior 
and precepts for living, with reference to them, we can note
