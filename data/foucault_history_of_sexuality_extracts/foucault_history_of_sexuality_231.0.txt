a certain number of modifications in comparison with the 
doctrines of austerity formulated in the philosophy of the 
fourth century. Breaks, radical changes, emergence of a new 
form of experience of pleasure? No, this was clearly not the 
case. And yet there are noticeable inflections: a closer atten¬ 
tion, an increased anxiety concerning sexual conduct, a 
greater importance accorded to marriage and its demands, 
and less value given to the love of boys: in short, a more 
rigorous style. But in these themes that develop, become ac¬ 
centuated, and gather strength, one can discern a different 
type of modification: it concerns the way in which ethical 
thought defines the relation of the subject to his sexual ac¬ 
tivity. 



PART TWO 

The Cultivation 
of the Self 




A mistrust of the pleasures, an emphasis on the conse¬ 
quences of their abuse for the body and the soul, a valorization 
of marriage and marital obligations, a disaffection with regard 
to the spiritual meanings imputed to the love of boys: a whole 
attitude of severity was manifested in the thinking of philoso¬ 
phers and physicians in the course of the first two centuries. 
It is visible in the texts of Soranus and Rufus of Ephesus, in 
Musonius or Seneca, in Plutarch as well as in Epictetus or 
Marcus Aurelius. Moreover, it is a fact that the Christian 
authors borrowed extensively—with and without acknowl¬ 
edgment—from this body of ethical thought. And most his¬ 
torians today recognize the existence, strength, and 
intensification of these themes of sexual austerity in a society 
known by its contemporaries, and, more often than not, re¬ 
proached, for its immorality and dissolute ways. Let us leave 
aside the question of knowing whether this blame was jus¬ 
tified. Considering only those texts that talk about the “ques¬ 
tion of pleasure,” and considering the place they give to it, it 
seems in fact that it had become more insistent. More pre¬ 
cisely, there was greater apprehension concerning the sexual 
pleasures, more attention given to the relation that one might 
have with them. In a word, there was a more intense prob- 
lematization of the aphrodisia, a problematization whose par¬ 
ticular forms and motifs we must try to reconstruct. 

One can appeal to various explanations in order to account

The Care of the Self 


for this new accentuation. One can relate it to certain efforts 
on the part of political power to raise moral standards in a 
more or less authoritarian way. These efforts were especially 
forceful and explicit under the principate of Augustus; and in 
that instance it is true that legislative measures protecting 
marriage, favoring the family, regulating concubinage, and 
condemning adultery were accompanied by a movement of 
ideas—perhaps not entirely artificial—that opposed the cur¬ 
rent laxity while preaching a return to the rigor of the old 
customs. We cannot be satisfied with this reference, however; 
it would doubtless be incorrect to see in these measures and 
these ideas the beginning of a centuries-long evolution that 
would lead to a regime in which sexual freedom would be 
more strictly limited by institutions and laws, whether civil or 
religious. These political strivings were in fact too sporadic; 
they had objectives that were too limited; and they had too few 
general and lasting effects to account for the tendency toward 
austerity so often evinced in moral reflection over the entire 
course of the first two centuries. Furthermore, it is remarkable 
that, with rare exceptions,* this desire for rigor expressed by 
the moralists did not take the form of a demand for interven¬ 
tion on the part of public authority. One would not find in the 
writings of the philosophers any proposal for a general and 
coercive legislation of sexual behaviors. They urge individuals 
to be more austere if they wish to lead a life different from that 
of “the throngs”; they do not try to determine which measures 
or punishments might constrain everyone in a uniform man¬ 
ner. Moreover, if we are authorized to speak of an increased 
austerity, this is not because more rigorous prohibitions were 
recommended: after all, the medical regimens of the first and 
second centuries are, generally speaking, not much more re¬ 
strictive than that of Diodes; the conjugal fidelity exalted by 
the Stoics is not more rigorous than that of Nicocles, who 
boasted of not having sexual relations with any woman other 

♦For example, Dio Chrysostom envisages certain measures that would have to be 
taken in order to make virtue prevail, but this is in the context of the problems posed 
by poverty . 1
