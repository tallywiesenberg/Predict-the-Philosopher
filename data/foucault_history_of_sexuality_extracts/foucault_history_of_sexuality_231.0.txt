a certain number of modifications in comparison with the 
doctrines of austerity formulated in the philosophy of the 
fourth century. Breaks, radical changes, emergence of a new 
form of experience of pleasure? No, this was clearly not the 
case. And yet there are noticeable inflections: a closer atten¬ 
tion, an increased anxiety concerning sexual conduct, a 
greater importance accorded to marriage and its demands, 
and less value given to the love of boys: in short, a more 
rigorous style. But in these themes that develop, become ac¬ 
centuated, and gather strength, one can discern a different 
type of modification: it concerns the way in which ethical 
thought defines the relation of the subject to his sexual ac¬ 
tivity. 



PART TWO 

The Cultivation 
of the Self 




A mistrust of the pleasures, an emphasis on the conse¬ 
quences of their abuse for the body and the soul, a valorization 
of marriage and marital obligations, a disaffection with regard 
to the spiritual meanings imputed to the love of boys: a whole 
attitude of severity was manifested in the thinking of philoso¬ 
phers and physicians in the course of the first two centuries. 
It is visible in the texts of Soranus and Rufus of Ephesus, in 
Musonius or Seneca, in Plutarch as well as in Epictetus or 
Marcus Aurelius. Moreover, it is a fact that the Christian 
authors borrowed extensively—with and without acknowl¬ 
edgment—from this body of ethical thought. And most his¬ 
torians today recognize the existence, strength, and 
intensification of these themes of sexual austerity in a society 
known by its contemporaries, and, more often than not, re¬ 
proached, for its immorality and dissolute ways. Let us leave 
aside the question of knowing whether this blame was jus¬ 
tified. Considering only those texts that talk about the “ques¬ 
tion of pleasure,” and considering the place they give to it, it 
seems in fact that it had become more insistent. More pre¬ 
cisely, there was greater apprehension concerning the sexual 
pleasures, more attention given to the relation that one might 
have with them. In a word, there was a more intense prob- 
lematization of the aphrodisia, a problematization whose par¬ 
ticular forms and motifs we must try to reconstruct. 

One can appeal to various explanations in order to account
