The Care of the Self 


for this new accentuation. One can relate it to certain efforts 
on the part of political power to raise moral standards in a 
more or less authoritarian way. These efforts were especially 
forceful and explicit under the principate of Augustus; and in 
that instance it is true that legislative measures protecting 
marriage, favoring the family, regulating concubinage, and 
condemning adultery were accompanied by a movement of 
ideas—perhaps not entirely artificial—that opposed the cur¬ 
rent laxity while preaching a return to the rigor of the old 
customs. We cannot be satisfied with this reference, however; 
it would doubtless be incorrect to see in these measures and 
these ideas the beginning of a centuries-long evolution that 
would lead to a regime in which sexual freedom would be 
more strictly limited by institutions and laws, whether civil or 
religious. These political strivings were in fact too sporadic; 
they had objectives that were too limited; and they had too few 
general and lasting effects to account for the tendency toward 
austerity so often evinced in moral reflection over the entire 
course of the first two centuries. Furthermore, it is remarkable 
that, with rare exceptions,* this desire for rigor expressed by 
the moralists did not take the form of a demand for interven¬ 
tion on the part of public authority. One would not find in the 
writings of the philosophers any proposal for a general and 
coercive legislation of sexual behaviors. They urge individuals 
to be more austere if they wish to lead a life different from that 
of “the throngs”; they do not try to determine which measures 
or punishments might constrain everyone in a uniform man¬ 
ner. Moreover, if we are authorized to speak of an increased 
austerity, this is not because more rigorous prohibitions were 
recommended: after all, the medical regimens of the first and 
second centuries are, generally speaking, not much more re¬ 
strictive than that of Diodes; the conjugal fidelity exalted by 
the Stoics is not more rigorous than that of Nicocles, who 
boasted of not having sexual relations with any woman other 

♦For example, Dio Chrysostom envisages certain measures that would have to be 
taken in order to make virtue prevail, but this is in the context of the problems posed 
by poverty . 1
