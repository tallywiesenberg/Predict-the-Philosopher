than his own wife; and Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, is 
on the whole more indulgent with regard to boys than is the 
strict legislator of the Laws. Rather, what stands out in the 
texts of the first centuries—more than new interdictions con¬ 
cerning sexual acts—is the insistence on the attention that 
should be brought to bear on oneself; it is the modality, scope, 
constancy, and exactitude of the required vigilance; it is the 
anxiety concerning all the disturbances of the body and the 
mind, which must be prevented by means of an austere regi¬ 
men; it is the importance attributed to self-respect, not just 
insofar as one’s status is concerned, but as concerns one’s 
rational nature—a self-respect that is exercised by depriving 
oneself of pleasure or by confining one’s indulgence to mar¬ 
riage or procreation. In short, and as a first approximation, 
this added emphasis on sexual austerity in moral reflection 
takes the form, not of a tightening of the code that defined 
prohibited acts, but of an intensification of the relation to 
oneself by which one constituted oneself as the subject of one’s 
acts. 2 And the motivations of this more severe ethics cannot 
be examined without taking such a form into account. 

One may think at this point of a phenomenon that is often 
alluded to: the growth, in the Hellenistic and Roman world, 
of an “individualism” that is said to have accorded more and 
more importance to the “private” aspects of existence, to the 
values of personal conduct, and to the interest that people 
focused on themselves. Thus, it was not a strengthening of 
public authority that accounted for the development of that 
rigorous ethics, but rather a weakening of the political and 
social framework within which the lives of individuals used to 
unfold. Being less firmly attached to the cities, more isolated 
from one another, and more reliant on themselves, they 
sought in philosophy rules of conduct that were more per¬ 
sonal. Not everything is false in a schema of this sort. But we 
may wonder about the reality of that individualistic upsurge 
and the social and political process that would have detached 
individuals from their traditional affiliations. Civic and politi¬ 
cal activity may have, to some degree, changed its form; it

nonetheless remained an important part of life for the upper 
classes. Broadly speaking, the ancient societies remained soci¬ 
eties of promiscuity, where existence was led “in public.” 
They were also societies in which everyone was situated within 
strong systems of local relationships, family ties, economic 
dependences, and relations of patronage and friendship. Fur¬ 
ther, it should be noted that the doctrines that were most 
attached to austerity of conduct—and the Stoics can be placed 
at the head of the list—were also those which insisted the most 
on the need to fulfill one’s obligations to mankind, to one’s 
fellow-citizens, and to one’s family, and which were quickest 
to denounce an attitude of laxity and self-satisfaction in prac¬ 
tices of social withdrawal. 

But a more general question needs to be asked concerning 
this “individualism” that is so frequently invoked, in different 
epochs, to explain very diverse phenomena. Quite often with 
such categories, entirely different realities are lumped to¬ 
gether. Three things in fact need to be distinguished here: (1) 
the individualistic attitude, characterized by the absolute 
value attributed to the individual in his singularity and by the 
degree of independence conceded to him vis-a-vis the group to 
which he belongs and the institutions to which he is answer- 
able; (2) the positive valuation of private life, that is, the 
importance granted to family relationships, to the forms of 
domestic activity, and to the domain of patrimonial interests; 
(3) the intensity of the relations to self, that is, of the forms 
in which one is called upon to take oneself as an object of 
knowledge and a field of action, so as to transform, correct, 
and purify oneself, and find salvation. These attitudes can be 
interconnected, no doubt. Thus it can happen that individual¬ 
ism entails an intensification of the values of private life, or 
that the importance accorded to the relations to self is as¬ 
sociated with an exaltation of individual singularity. But these 
connections are neither constant nor necessary. One could 
find societies or social groups—military aristocracies are a 
probable example of these—in which the individual is invited 
to assert his self-worth by means of actions that set him apart
