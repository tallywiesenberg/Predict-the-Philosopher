than his own wife; and Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, is 
on the whole more indulgent with regard to boys than is the 
strict legislator of the Laws. Rather, what stands out in the 
texts of the first centuries—more than new interdictions con¬ 
cerning sexual acts—is the insistence on the attention that 
should be brought to bear on oneself; it is the modality, scope, 
constancy, and exactitude of the required vigilance; it is the 
anxiety concerning all the disturbances of the body and the 
mind, which must be prevented by means of an austere regi¬ 
men; it is the importance attributed to self-respect, not just 
insofar as one’s status is concerned, but as concerns one’s 
rational nature—a self-respect that is exercised by depriving 
oneself of pleasure or by confining one’s indulgence to mar¬ 
riage or procreation. In short, and as a first approximation, 
this added emphasis on sexual austerity in moral reflection 
takes the form, not of a tightening of the code that defined 
prohibited acts, but of an intensification of the relation to 
oneself by which one constituted oneself as the subject of one’s 
acts. 2 And the motivations of this more severe ethics cannot 
be examined without taking such a form into account. 

One may think at this point of a phenomenon that is often 
alluded to: the growth, in the Hellenistic and Roman world, 
of an “individualism” that is said to have accorded more and 
more importance to the “private” aspects of existence, to the 
values of personal conduct, and to the interest that people 
focused on themselves. Thus, it was not a strengthening of 
public authority that accounted for the development of that 
rigorous ethics, but rather a weakening of the political and 
social framework within which the lives of individuals used to 
unfold. Being less firmly attached to the cities, more isolated 
from one another, and more reliant on themselves, they 
sought in philosophy rules of conduct that were more per¬ 
sonal. Not everything is false in a schema of this sort. But we 
may wonder about the reality of that individualistic upsurge 
and the social and political process that would have detached 
individuals from their traditional affiliations. Civic and politi¬ 
cal activity may have, to some degree, changed its form; it
