The Care of the Self 


nonetheless remained an important part of life for the upper 
classes. Broadly speaking, the ancient societies remained soci¬ 
eties of promiscuity, where existence was led “in public.” 
They were also societies in which everyone was situated within 
strong systems of local relationships, family ties, economic 
dependences, and relations of patronage and friendship. Fur¬ 
ther, it should be noted that the doctrines that were most 
attached to austerity of conduct—and the Stoics can be placed 
at the head of the list—were also those which insisted the most 
on the need to fulfill one’s obligations to mankind, to one’s 
fellow-citizens, and to one’s family, and which were quickest 
to denounce an attitude of laxity and self-satisfaction in prac¬ 
tices of social withdrawal. 

But a more general question needs to be asked concerning 
this “individualism” that is so frequently invoked, in different 
epochs, to explain very diverse phenomena. Quite often with 
such categories, entirely different realities are lumped to¬ 
gether. Three things in fact need to be distinguished here: (1) 
the individualistic attitude, characterized by the absolute 
value attributed to the individual in his singularity and by the 
degree of independence conceded to him vis-a-vis the group to 
which he belongs and the institutions to which he is answer- 
able; (2) the positive valuation of private life, that is, the 
importance granted to family relationships, to the forms of 
domestic activity, and to the domain of patrimonial interests; 
(3) the intensity of the relations to self, that is, of the forms 
in which one is called upon to take oneself as an object of 
knowledge and a field of action, so as to transform, correct, 
and purify oneself, and find salvation. These attitudes can be 
interconnected, no doubt. Thus it can happen that individual¬ 
ism entails an intensification of the values of private life, or 
that the importance accorded to the relations to self is as¬ 
sociated with an exaltation of individual singularity. But these 
connections are neither constant nor necessary. One could 
find societies or social groups—military aristocracies are a 
probable example of these—in which the individual is invited 
to assert his self-worth by means of actions that set him apart
