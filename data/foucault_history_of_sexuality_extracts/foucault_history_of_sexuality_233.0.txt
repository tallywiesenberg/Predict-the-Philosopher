and enable him to win out over the others, without his having 
to attribute any great importance to his private life or to the 
relations of himself to himself. There are also societies in 
which private life is highly valued, in which it is carefully 
protected and organized, in which it forms the center of refer¬ 
ence for behaviors and one of the principles of their valuation 
—this appears to be true of the bourgeois classes in the West¬ 
ern countries of the nineteenth century. But, for this very 
reason, individualism in such societies is weak and the rela¬ 
tions of oneself to oneself are largely undeveloped. Finally, 
there are societies or groups in which the relation to self is 
intensified and developed without this resulting, as if by neces¬ 
sity, in a strengthening of the values of individualism or of 
private life. The Christian ascetic movement of the first centu¬ 
ries presented itself as an extremely strong accentuation of the 
relations of oneself to oneself, but in the form of a disqualifica¬ 
tion of the values of private life; and when it took the form of 
cenobitism, it manifested an explicit rejection of any individu¬ 
alism that might be inherent in the practice of reclusion. 

The demands of sexual austerity expressed in imperial times 
do not seem to have been the manifestation of a growing 
individualism. Their context is characterized instead by a phe¬ 
nomenon that has a rather long historical range, but reached 
its peak at that particular moment. I am referring to the 
development of what might be called a “cultivation of the 
self,” wherein the relations of oneself to oneself were inten¬ 
sified and valorized. 

This “cultivation of the self” 3 can be briefly characterized 
by the fact that in this case the art of existence—the techne tou 
biou in its different forms—is dominated by the principle that 
says one must “take care of oneself.” It is this principle of the 
care of the self that establishes its necessity, presides over its 
development, and organizes its practice. But one has to be 
precise here; the idea that one ought to attend to oneself, care 
for oneself (heautou epimeleisthai), was actually a very ancient 
theme in Greek culture. It appeared very early as a widespread

imperative. At the end of his conquests, Xenophon’s idealized 
Cyrus still does not consider his existence to be complete. It 
remains for him—and this he values above all else—to attend 
to himself: “We cannot possibly find any fault with the gods 
that all we wished for has not been fulfilled,” he says while 
reflecting on his past victories. “However, if great success is 
to have such consequences that a man is not able to have some 
leisure for himself nor time to enjoy himself with his friends, 
I am ready to bid farewell to that sort of happiness.” 4 A 
Lacedaemonian aphorism, reported by Plutarch, 5 stated that 
the reason for which cultivation of the land was entrusted to 
the helots was that the citizens of Sparta, for their part, 
wanted “to take care of themselves”: no doubt it was physical 
and military training that was meant by the phrase. But it is 
used in a completely different sense in the Alcibiades, where 
it constitutes a basic theme of the dialogue. Socrates shows the 
ambitious young man that it is quite presumptuous of him to 
want to take charge of the city, manage its affairs, and enter 
into competition with the kings of Sparta or the rulers of 
Persia, if he has not first learned that which it is necessary to 
know in order to govern: he must first attend to himself—and 
right away, while he is young, for “at the age of fifty, it would 
be too late.” 6 And in the Apology it is clearly as a master of 
the care of the self that Socrates presents himself to his judges. 
The god has sent him to remind men that they need to concern 
themselves not with their riches, not with their honor, but 
with themselves and with their souls. 7 

Now, it was this theme of the care of oneself, consecrated 
by Socrates, that later philosophy took up again and ulti¬ 
mately placed at the center of that “art of existence” which 
philosophy claimed to be. It was this theme which, breaking 
out of its original setting and working loose from its first 
philosophical meanings, gradually acquired the dimensions 
and forms of a veritable “cultivation of the self.” What is 
meant by these remarks is that the principle of care of oneself 
became rather general in scope. The precept according to 
which one must give attention to oneself was in any case an
