and enable him to win out over the others, without his having 
to attribute any great importance to his private life or to the 
relations of himself to himself. There are also societies in 
which private life is highly valued, in which it is carefully 
protected and organized, in which it forms the center of refer¬ 
ence for behaviors and one of the principles of their valuation 
—this appears to be true of the bourgeois classes in the West¬ 
ern countries of the nineteenth century. But, for this very 
reason, individualism in such societies is weak and the rela¬ 
tions of oneself to oneself are largely undeveloped. Finally, 
there are societies or groups in which the relation to self is 
intensified and developed without this resulting, as if by neces¬ 
sity, in a strengthening of the values of individualism or of 
private life. The Christian ascetic movement of the first centu¬ 
ries presented itself as an extremely strong accentuation of the 
relations of oneself to oneself, but in the form of a disqualifica¬ 
tion of the values of private life; and when it took the form of 
cenobitism, it manifested an explicit rejection of any individu¬ 
alism that might be inherent in the practice of reclusion. 

The demands of sexual austerity expressed in imperial times 
do not seem to have been the manifestation of a growing 
individualism. Their context is characterized instead by a phe¬ 
nomenon that has a rather long historical range, but reached 
its peak at that particular moment. I am referring to the 
development of what might be called a “cultivation of the 
self,” wherein the relations of oneself to oneself were inten¬ 
sified and valorized. 

This “cultivation of the self” 3 can be briefly characterized 
by the fact that in this case the art of existence—the techne tou 
biou in its different forms—is dominated by the principle that 
says one must “take care of oneself.” It is this principle of the 
care of the self that establishes its necessity, presides over its 
development, and organizes its practice. But one has to be 
precise here; the idea that one ought to attend to oneself, care 
for oneself (heautou epimeleisthai), was actually a very ancient 
theme in Greek culture. It appeared very early as a widespread
