Cyrus still does not consider his existence to be complete. It 
remains for him—and this he values above all else—to attend 
to himself: “We cannot possibly find any fault with the gods 
that all we wished for has not been fulfilled,” he says while 
reflecting on his past victories. “However, if great success is 
to have such consequences that a man is not able to have some 
leisure for himself nor time to enjoy himself with his friends, 
I am ready to bid farewell to that sort of happiness.” 4 A 
Lacedaemonian aphorism, reported by Plutarch, 5 stated that 
the reason for which cultivation of the land was entrusted to 
the helots was that the citizens of Sparta, for their part, 
wanted “to take care of themselves”: no doubt it was physical 
and military training that was meant by the phrase. But it is 
used in a completely different sense in the Alcibiades, where 
it constitutes a basic theme of the dialogue. Socrates shows the 
ambitious young man that it is quite presumptuous of him to 
want to take charge of the city, manage its affairs, and enter 
into competition with the kings of Sparta or the rulers of 
Persia, if he has not first learned that which it is necessary to 
know in order to govern: he must first attend to himself—and 
right away, while he is young, for “at the age of fifty, it would 
be too late.” 6 And in the Apology it is clearly as a master of 
the care of the self that Socrates presents himself to his judges. 
The god has sent him to remind men that they need to concern 
themselves not with their riches, not with their honor, but 
with themselves and with their souls. 7 

Now, it was this theme of the care of oneself, consecrated 
by Socrates, that later philosophy took up again and ulti¬ 
mately placed at the center of that “art of existence” which 
philosophy claimed to be. It was this theme which, breaking 
out of its original setting and working loose from its first 
philosophical meanings, gradually acquired the dimensions 
and forms of a veritable “cultivation of the self.” What is 
meant by these remarks is that the principle of care of oneself 
became rather general in scope. The precept according to 
which one must give attention to oneself was in any case an
