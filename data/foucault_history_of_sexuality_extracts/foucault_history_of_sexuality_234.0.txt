perfected, and taught. It thus came to constitute a social 
practice, giving rise to relationships between individuals, to 
exchanges and communications, and at times even to institu¬ 
tions. And it gave rise, finally, to a certain mode of knowledge 
and to the elaboration of a science. 

In the slow development of the art of living under the theme 
of the care of oneself, the first two centuries of the imperial 
epoch can be seen as the summit of a curve: a kind of golden 
age in the cultivation of the self—it being understood, of 
course, that this phenomenon concerned only the social 
groups, very limited in number, that were bearers of culture 
and for whose members a techne tou biou could have a mean¬ 
ing and a reality. 

1. The epimeleia heautou, the cur a sui, is an injunction 
that one rediscovers in many philosophical doctrines. One 
encounters it in the Platonists: Albinus advises that one com¬ 
mence the study of philosophy by reading the Alcibiades 
“with a view to turning and returning to oneself,” and for the 
purpose of learning “that which one should make into the 
object of his care.” 8 Apuleius, at the end of the God of Socrates, 
expresses his wonder at seeing the carelessness of his contem¬ 
poraries with regard to themselves: “All men should desire to 
live most happily, and should know that they cannot so live 
in any other way than by cultivating the soul, and yet leave 
the soul uncultivated [animum suum non colunt ]. If, however, 
anyone wishes to see acutely, it is requisite that he should pay 
attention to his eyes, through which he sees; if you desire to 
run with celerity, attention must be paid to the feet, by which 
you run. ... In a similar manner, in all the other members, 
attention to each must be paid according to one’s preferences. 
And, as all men may easily see that this is true, I cannot 
sufficiently . . . wonder, in such a way as the thing deserves

wonder, why they do not also cultivate their soul by reason 
[cur non etiam animum suum ratione excolant ].” 9 

As for the Epicureans, the Letter to Menoeceus began by 
stating the principle that philosophy should be considered as 
a permanent exercise of the care of oneself: “Let no young 
man delay the study of philosophy, and let no young man 
become weary of it; for it is never too early or too late to care 
for the well-being of the soul .” 10 It is this Epicurean theme of 
the need to take care of oneself that Seneca takes up in one of 
his letters: “Just as fair weather, purified into the purest bril¬ 
liancy, does not admit of a still greater degree of clearness; so, 
when a man takes care of his body and of his soul [ hominis 
corpus animumque curantis ], weaving the texture of his good 
from both, his condition is perfect, and he has found the 
consummation of his prayers, if there is no commotion in his 
soul or pain in his body .” 11 

Taking care of one’s soul was a precept that Zeno had given 
his disciples from the beginning, and one Musonius was to 
repeat, in the first century, in a sentence quoted by Plutarch: 
“He who wishes to come through life safe and sound must 
continue throughout his life to take care of himself .” 12 The 
fullness assumed, in Seneca, by the theme of application of 
oneself to oneself is well known: it is to this activity, according 
to him, that a man must devote himself, to the exclusion of 
other occupations. He will thus be able to make himself vacant 
for himself (sibi vacare). 13 But this “vacation” takes the form 
of a varied activity which demands that one lose no time and 
spare no effort in order to “develop oneself,” “transform one¬ 
self,” “return to oneself.” Se formare, sibi vindicare, se facere, 
se ad studia revocare, sibi applicare, suum fieri, in se recedere, 
ad se recurrere, secum morari u —Seneca commands a whole 
vocabulary for designating the different forms that ought to be 
taken by the care of the self and the haste with which one seeks 
to reunite with oneself (ad se properare). 15 Marcus Aurelius 
also feels the same haste to look after himself: neither reading 
nor writing must keep him any longer from the direct atten¬ 
tion he must give to his own being: “No more vague wander-

ings. You are not likely to read your memoranda, your histo¬ 
ries of Greece and Rome, or the extracts from books which 
you put aside for your old age. Hasten then to the end, discard 
vain hopes, and if you care for yourself at all, rescue yourself 
[sautoi boethei ei ti soi melei sautou] while you still may .” 16 

It is in Epictetus no doubt that one finds the highest philo¬ 
sophical development of this theme. Man is defined in the 
Discourses as the being who was destined to care for himself.
