perfected, and taught. It thus came to constitute a social 
practice, giving rise to relationships between individuals, to 
exchanges and communications, and at times even to institu¬ 
tions. And it gave rise, finally, to a certain mode of knowledge 
and to the elaboration of a science. 

In the slow development of the art of living under the theme 
of the care of oneself, the first two centuries of the imperial 
epoch can be seen as the summit of a curve: a kind of golden 
age in the cultivation of the self—it being understood, of 
course, that this phenomenon concerned only the social 
groups, very limited in number, that were bearers of culture 
and for whose members a techne tou biou could have a mean¬ 
ing and a reality. 

1. The epimeleia heautou, the cur a sui, is an injunction 
that one rediscovers in many philosophical doctrines. One 
encounters it in the Platonists: Albinus advises that one com¬ 
mence the study of philosophy by reading the Alcibiades 
“with a view to turning and returning to oneself,” and for the 
purpose of learning “that which one should make into the

run with celerity, attention must be paid to the feet, by which 
you run. ... In a similar manner, in all the other members,

[cur non etiam animum suum ratione excolant ].” 9 

As for the Epicureans, the Letter to Menoeceus began by 
stating the principle that philosophy should be considered as 
a permanent exercise of the care of oneself: “Let no young 
man delay the study of philosophy, and let no young man
