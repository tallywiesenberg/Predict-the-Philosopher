become weary of it; for it is never too early or too late to care 
for the well-being of the soul .” 10 It is this Epicurean theme of 
the need to take care of oneself that Seneca takes up in one of 
his letters: “Just as fair weather, purified into the purest bril¬ 
liancy, does not admit of a still greater degree of clearness; so, 
when a man takes care of his body and of his soul [ hominis 
corpus animumque curantis ], weaving the texture of his good 
from both, his condition is perfect, and he has found the 
consummation of his prayers, if there is no commotion in his 
soul or pain in his body .” 11 

Taking care of one’s soul was a precept that Zeno had given 
his disciples from the beginning, and one Musonius was to 
repeat, in the first century, in a sentence quoted by Plutarch: 
“He who wishes to come through life safe and sound must 
continue throughout his life to take care of himself .” 12 The 
fullness assumed, in Seneca, by the theme of application of 
oneself to oneself is well known: it is to this activity, according 
to him, that a man must devote himself, to the exclusion of 
other occupations. He will thus be able to make himself vacant 
for himself (sibi vacare). 13 But this “vacation” takes the form 
of a varied activity which demands that one lose no time and 
spare no effort in order to “develop oneself,” “transform one¬ 
self,” “return to oneself.” Se formare, sibi vindicare, se facere, 
se ad studia revocare, sibi applicare, suum fieri, in se recedere, 
ad se recurrere, secum morari u —Seneca commands a whole 
vocabulary for designating the different forms that ought to be 
taken by the care of the self and the haste with which one seeks 
to reunite with oneself (ad se properare). 15 Marcus Aurelius 
also feels the same haste to look after himself: neither reading 
nor writing must keep him any longer from the direct atten¬ 
tion he must give to his own being: “No more vague wander-

ings. You are not likely to read your memoranda, your histo¬ 
ries of Greece and Rome, or the extracts from books which 
you put aside for your old age. Hasten then to the end, discard 
vain hopes, and if you care for yourself at all, rescue yourself 
[sautoi boethei ei ti soi melei sautou] while you still may .” 16 

It is in Epictetus no doubt that one finds the highest philo¬ 
sophical development of this theme. Man is defined in the 
Discourses as the being who was destined to care for himself.
