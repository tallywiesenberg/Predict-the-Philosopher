This is where the basic difference between him and other 
creatures resides. The animals find “ready prepared” that 
which they need in order to live, for nature has so arranged 
things that animals are at our disposal without their having to 
look after themselves, and without our having to look after 
them . 17 Man, on the other hand, must attend to himself: not, 
however, as a consequence of some defect that would put him 
in a situation of need and make him in this respect inferior to 
the animals, but because the god [Zeus] deemed it right that 
he be able to make free use of himself; and it was for this 
purpose that he endowed him with reason. The latter is not 
to be understood as a substitute for natural faculties that 
might be lacking; on the contrary it is the faculty that enables 
one to use, at the right time and in the right way, the other 
faculties. In fact, it is this absolutely singular faculty that is 
capable of making use of itself, for it is capable of “contem¬ 
plating both itself and everything else .” 18 By crowning with 
this reasoning faculty all that is already given to us by nature, 
Zeus gave us the possibility and the duty to take care of 
ourselves. It is insofar as he is free and reasonable that man 
is the natural being that has been committed to the care of 
himself. The god did not fashion us out of marble, like Phidias 
his Athena, who forever extends the hand on which Victory 
came to rest immobile with wings outspread. Zeus “not only 
made you, but entrusted and committed you to yourself 
alone .” 19 The care of the self, for Epictetus, is a privilege-duty, 
a gift-obligation that ensures our freedom while forcing us to 
take ourselves as the object of all our diligence . 20 

But the fact that the philosophers advise that one give heed

The Care of the Self 


to oneself does not mean that this zeal is reserved for those 
who choose to live a life similar to theirs, or that such an 
attitude is required only during the time one spends with 
them. It is a valuable principle for everyone, all the time and 
throughout life. Apuleius points out that one can, without 
shame or dishonor, ignore the rules that make it possible to 
paint and to play the zither, but to know how “to perfect one’s 
own soul with the help of reason” is a rule “equally necessary 
for all men.” The case of Pliny can serve as a concrete example 
in this regard: aloof from all strict doctrinal adherences, lead¬ 
ing a regular career replete with honors, absorbed by his ac¬
