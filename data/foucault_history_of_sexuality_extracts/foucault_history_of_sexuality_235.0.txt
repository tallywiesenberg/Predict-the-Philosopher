This is where the basic difference between him and other 
creatures resides. The animals find “ready prepared” that 
which they need in order to live, for nature has so arranged 
things that animals are at our disposal without their having to 
look after themselves, and without our having to look after 
them . 17 Man, on the other hand, must attend to himself: not, 
however, as a consequence of some defect that would put him 
in a situation of need and make him in this respect inferior to 
the animals, but because the god [Zeus] deemed it right that 
he be able to make free use of himself; and it was for this 
purpose that he endowed him with reason. The latter is not 
to be understood as a substitute for natural faculties that 
might be lacking; on the contrary it is the faculty that enables 
one to use, at the right time and in the right way, the other 
faculties. In fact, it is this absolutely singular faculty that is 
capable of making use of itself, for it is capable of “contem¬ 
plating both itself and everything else .” 18 By crowning with 
this reasoning faculty all that is already given to us by nature, 
Zeus gave us the possibility and the duty to take care of 
ourselves. It is insofar as he is free and reasonable that man 
is the natural being that has been committed to the care of 
himself. The god did not fashion us out of marble, like Phidias 
his Athena, who forever extends the hand on which Victory 
came to rest immobile with wings outspread. Zeus “not only 
made you, but entrusted and committed you to yourself 
alone .” 19 The care of the self, for Epictetus, is a privilege-duty, 
a gift-obligation that ensures our freedom while forcing us to 
take ourselves as the object of all our diligence . 20 

But the fact that the philosophers advise that one give heed

The Care of the Self 


to oneself does not mean that this zeal is reserved for those 
who choose to live a life similar to theirs, or that such an 
attitude is required only during the time one spends with 
them. It is a valuable principle for everyone, all the time and 
throughout life. Apuleius points out that one can, without 
shame or dishonor, ignore the rules that make it possible to 
paint and to play the zither, but to know how “to perfect one’s 
own soul with the help of reason” is a rule “equally necessary 
for all men.” The case of Pliny can serve as a concrete example 
in this regard: aloof from all strict doctrinal adherences, lead¬ 
ing a regular career replete with honors, absorbed by his ac¬ 
tivities as a lawyer, he is not on the point of breaking his ties 
to society—far from it. And yet, throughout his life he does 
not cease to speak of the care he intends to devote to himself 
as perhaps the most important matter with which he could be 
concerned. When, as a very young man still, he is sent to Syria 
to do military service, his first thought is to visit with Euphra¬ 
tes, not just to hear his lectures, but little by little to get to 
know him, “win his affection,” and benefit from the admoni¬ 
tions of a master who knows how to go after faults without 
attacking individuals . 21 And later, in Rome, when he has occa¬ 
sion to take a period of rest in his villa at Laurentum, it is in 
order to be able to attend to himself, “reading and writing and 
finding time to take the exercise which keeps my mind fit,” 
and “sharing my thoughts with no one but my own writ¬ 
ings .” 22 

Hence there is no right age for attending to oneself. “It is 
never too early nor too late to care for the well-being of the 
soul,” to quote Epicurus again. “The man who says that the 
season for this study has not yet come or is already past is like 
the man who says it is too early or too late for happiness. 
Therefore, both the young and the old should study philoso¬ 
phy, the former so that as he grows old he may still retain the 
happiness of youth in his pleasant memories of the past, the 
latter so that although he is old he may at the same time be 
young by virtue of his fearlessness of the future .” 23 “Spend 
your whole life learning how to live” was an aphorism— 



The Cultivation of the Self

Seneca cites it—which asked people to transform their exis¬ 
tence into a kind of permanent exercise. And while it is good 
to begin early, it is important never to let up. 24 Those to whom 
Seneca or Plutarch offer their counsel are in fact no longer the 
eager or timid adolescents whom the Socrates of Plato or 
Xenophon urged to attend to themselves. They are men. Sere- 
nus, to whom the moral essay De tranquilitate is addressed (in 
addition to the De constantia and perhaps the De otio ) is a 
young relative under Seneca’s protection, but nothing like a 
boy pursuing his studies. At the time of the writing of De 
tranquilitate, he is a provincial who has just arrived in Rome, 
and who is still trying to decide on a career and a way of life; 
but he already has behind him a certain philosophical itiner¬ 
ary. His perplexity relates essentially to the way in which he
