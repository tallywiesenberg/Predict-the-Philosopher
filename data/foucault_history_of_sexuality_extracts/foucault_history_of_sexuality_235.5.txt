tivities as a lawyer, he is not on the point of breaking his ties 
to society—far from it. And yet, throughout his life he does 
not cease to speak of the care he intends to devote to himself 
as perhaps the most important matter with which he could be 
concerned. When, as a very young man still, he is sent to Syria 
to do military service, his first thought is to visit with Euphra¬ 
tes, not just to hear his lectures, but little by little to get to 
know him, “win his affection,” and benefit from the admoni¬ 
tions of a master who knows how to go after faults without 
attacking individuals . 21 And later, in Rome, when he has occa¬ 
sion to take a period of rest in his villa at Laurentum, it is in 
order to be able to attend to himself, “reading and writing and 
finding time to take the exercise which keeps my mind fit,” 
and “sharing my thoughts with no one but my own writ¬ 
ings .” 22 

Hence there is no right age for attending to oneself. “It is 
never too early nor too late to care for the well-being of the 
soul,” to quote Epicurus again. “The man who says that the 
season for this study has not yet come or is already past is like 
the man who says it is too early or too late for happiness. 
Therefore, both the young and the old should study philoso¬ 
phy, the former so that as he grows old he may still retain the 
happiness of youth in his pleasant memories of the past, the 
latter so that although he is old he may at the same time be 
young by virtue of his fearlessness of the future .” 23 “Spend 
your whole life learning how to live” was an aphorism— 



The Cultivation of the Self

Seneca cites it—which asked people to transform their exis¬ 
tence into a kind of permanent exercise. And while it is good 
to begin early, it is important never to let up. 24 Those to whom 
Seneca or Plutarch offer their counsel are in fact no longer the 
eager or timid adolescents whom the Socrates of Plato or 
Xenophon urged to attend to themselves. They are men. Sere- 
nus, to whom the moral essay De tranquilitate is addressed (in 
addition to the De constantia and perhaps the De otio ) is a 
young relative under Seneca’s protection, but nothing like a 
boy pursuing his studies. At the time of the writing of De 
tranquilitate, he is a provincial who has just arrived in Rome, 
and who is still trying to decide on a career and a way of life; 
but he already has behind him a certain philosophical itiner¬ 
ary. His perplexity relates essentially to the way in which he
