might bring it to a conclusion. As for Lucilius, apparently he 
was only a few years younger than Seneca. He is procurator 
in Sicily when, starting in 62, they exchange the intimate 
correspondence in which Seneca reveals to him the principles 
and practices of his wisdom, tells him of his own weaknesses 
and his still unfinished battles, and occasionally even asks for 
his help. Nor is he embarrassed to tell him that when more 
than sixty years old, he himself went to hear the lectures of 
Metronax. 25 The correspondents to whom Plutarch addresses 
his treatises—which are not just general considerations on 
virtues and faults, on the happiness of the soul and the misfor¬ 
tunes of life, but advice on conduct, often in reference to very 
specific circumstances—are men as well. 

This extreme eagerness of adults to look after their souls, 
the zeal with which, like schoolboys grown old, they sought 
out philosophers so that they might be shown the way to 
happiness, irritated Lucian, and many others with him. He 
makes fun of Hermotimus, who is seen muttering lessons in 
the street, lessons he must not forget. Hermotimus is no longer 
a young man, however: it has been twenty years already since 
he decided no longer to mingle his life with that of unfortunate 
humans, and he estimates that it will take him another twenty 
years to reach the state of bliss. Now (he mentions this himself

a little further on), he began to philosophize at the age of forty. 
So it is the last forty years of his life that he will have devoted 
to caring for himself, under the direction of a master. And his 
interlocutor Lycinus, for his own amusement, pretends to 
discover that for him, too, the time has come to study philoso¬ 
phy, seeing that he has just turned forty: “Act as my crutch,” 
he says to Hermotimus, and “lead me by the hand.” 26 As 
Ilsetraut Hadot says in reference to Seneca, all this activity of 
spiritual direction is in the category of adult education—of

2. It is important to understand that this application to 
oneself does not require simply a general attitude, an un¬ 
focused attention. The term epimeleia designates not just a 
preoccupation but a whole set of occupations; it is epimeleia 
that is employed in speaking of the activities of the master of 
a household, the tasks of the ruler who looks after his subjects,
