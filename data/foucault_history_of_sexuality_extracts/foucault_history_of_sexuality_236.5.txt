the care that must be given to a sick or wounded patient, or 
the honors that must be paid to the gods or to the dead. 28 With 
regard to oneself as well, epimeleia implies a labor. 

It takes time. And it is one of the big problems of this 
cultivation of the self to determine the portion of one’s day or 
one’s life that should be devoted to it. People resort to many 
different formulas. One can set aside a few moments, in the 
evening or in the morning, for introspection, for examining 
what needs to be done, for memorizing certain useful princi¬ 
ples, for reflecting on the day that has gone by. The morning 
and evening examination of the Pythagoreans is encountered 
again, doubtless with a different content, in the Stoics. Seneca, 
Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius refer to those moments that 
ought to be devoted to turning one’s thoughts to oneself. 29 One 
may also from time to time interrupt one’s ordinary activities 
and go into one of those retreats that Musonius, among so 
many others, strongly recommended. 30 They enable one to 
commune with oneself, to recollect one’s bygone days, to place 
the whole of one’s past life before one’s eyes, to get to know 
oneself, through reading, through the precepts and examples

that will provide inspiration, and, by contemplating a life 
reduced to its essentials, to rediscover the basic principles of 
a rational conduct. It is possible too, in the middle or at the 
end of one’s career, to unburden oneself of these activities and, 
taking advantage of these declining years when desires are 
calmed, give oneself up entirely—like Seneca in his philosoph¬ 
ical work or Spurrina in the tranquillity of a pleasant exis¬ 
tence 31 —to the possession of oneself. 

This time is not empty; it is filled with exercises, practical 
tasks, various activities. Taking care of oneself is not a rest 
cure. There is the care of the body to consider, health regi¬ 
mens, physical exercises without overexertion, the carefully 
measured satisfaction of needs. There are the meditations, the 
readings, the notes that one takes on books or on the conversa¬ 
tions one has heard, notes that one reads again later, the 
recollection of truths that one knows already but that need to 
be more fully adapted to one’s own life. Marcus Aurelius thus 
gives an example of “a retreat within oneself”: it is a sustained 
effort in which general principles are reactivated and argu¬
