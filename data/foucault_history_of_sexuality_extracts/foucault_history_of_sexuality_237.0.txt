ments are adduced that persuade one not to let oneself become 
angry at others, at providence, or at things. 32 There are also 
the talks that one has with a confidant, with friends, with a 
guide or director. Add to this the correspondence in which one 
reveals the state of one’s soul, solicits advice, gives advice to 
anyone who needs it—which for that matter constitutes a 
beneficial exercise for the giver, who is called the preceptor, 
because he thereby reactualizes it for himself. 33 Around the 
care of the self, there developed an entire activity of speaking 
and writing in which the work of oneself on oneself and com¬ 
munication with others were linked together. 

Here we touch on one of the most important aspects of this 
activity devoted to oneself: it constituted, not an exercise in 
solitude, but a true social practice. And it did so in several 
ways. It often took form within more or less institutionalized 
structures. The neo-Pythagorean communities are an example 
of this, or those Epicurean groups about whose practices we 
have some information by way of Philodemus: a recognized

hierarchy gave the most advanced members the task of tutor¬ 
ing the others (either individually or in a more collective 
fashion). But there were also common exercises that allowed 
one, in the attention he gave to himself, to receive the help of 
others: this was the task defined as to di' allelon sozesthai . 34 
Epictetus taught in a setting that was more like that of a 
school. He had several categories of students: some were there 
for only a short stay; others would remain longer in order to 
prepare for the life of an ordinary citizen or even for important 
activities; and finally a few others, who intended to become 
professional philosophers themselves, were there to be trained 
in the rules and practices of spiritual direction. 35 One also 
found—particularly in Rome, in aristocratic circles—the 
practice of the private consultant who served in a family or a 
group as a life counselor, a political adviser, a potential inter¬ 
mediary in a negotiation: “Some wealthy Romans found it 
useful to keep a philosopher, and men of distinction did not 
find the position humiliating. They expected to be able to give 
moral advice and comfort to their patrons and their families, 
while their patrons could draw strength from their ap¬ 
proval.” 36 Thus Demetrius was the spiritual guide of Thrasea 
Paetus, who had him participate in the staging of his suicide,
