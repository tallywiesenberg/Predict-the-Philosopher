ments are adduced that persuade one not to let oneself become 
angry at others, at providence, or at things. 32 There are also 
the talks that one has with a confidant, with friends, with a 
guide or director. Add to this the correspondence in which one 
reveals the state of one’s soul, solicits advice, gives advice to 
anyone who needs it—which for that matter constitutes a 
beneficial exercise for the giver, who is called the preceptor, 
because he thereby reactualizes it for himself. 33 Around the 
care of the self, there developed an entire activity of speaking 
and writing in which the work of oneself on oneself and com¬ 
munication with others were linked together. 

Here we touch on one of the most important aspects of this 
activity devoted to oneself: it constituted, not an exercise in 
solitude, but a true social practice. And it did so in several 
ways. It often took form within more or less institutionalized 
structures. The neo-Pythagorean communities are an example 
of this, or those Epicurean groups about whose practices we 
have some information by way of Philodemus: a recognized

The Care of the Self 


hierarchy gave the most advanced members the task of tutor¬ 
ing the others (either individually or in a more collective 
fashion). But there were also common exercises that allowed 
one, in the attention he gave to himself, to receive the help of 
others: this was the task defined as to di' allelon sozesthai . 34 
Epictetus taught in a setting that was more like that of a 
school. He had several categories of students: some were there 
for only a short stay; others would remain longer in order to 
prepare for the life of an ordinary citizen or even for important 
activities; and finally a few others, who intended to become 
professional philosophers themselves, were there to be trained 
in the rules and practices of spiritual direction. 35 One also 
found—particularly in Rome, in aristocratic circles—the 
practice of the private consultant who served in a family or a 
group as a life counselor, a political adviser, a potential inter¬ 
mediary in a negotiation: “Some wealthy Romans found it 
useful to keep a philosopher, and men of distinction did not 
find the position humiliating. They expected to be able to give 
moral advice and comfort to their patrons and their families, 
while their patrons could draw strength from their ap¬ 
proval.” 36 Thus Demetrius was the spiritual guide of Thrasea 
Paetus, who had him participate in the staging of his suicide, 
so that he might in this final moment help him give his life its 
finest and most accomplished form. Furthermore, these differ¬ 
ent functions of professor, guide, adviser, and personal confi¬ 
dant were not always distinct—far from it: in the practice of 
the cultivation of the self, the roles were often interchangeable, 
and they could be played in turn by the same person. 
Musonius Rufus had been the political adviser of Rubellius 
Plautus; in the exile that followed the latter’s death, he drew 
visitors and loyal supporters around him and held a kind of 
school. Under Vespasian, he returned to Rome, where he gave 
public lectures and was part of Titus’ entourage. 

But all this attention to the self did not depend solely on the 
existence of schools, lectures, and professionals of spiritual 
direction for its social base; it found a ready support in the 
whole bundle of customary relations of kinship, friendship,

and obligation. When, in the practice of the care of the self, 
one appealed to another person in whom one recognized an 
aptitude for guidance and counseling, one was exercising a 
right. And it was a duty that one was performing when one 
lavished one’s assistance on another, or when one gratefully 
received the lessons the other might give. Galen’s text on 
curing the passions is significant from this point of view: he 
advises anyone who wishes to take proper care of himself to 
seek the aid of another; he does not, however, recommend a 
technician known for his competence and learning, but simply 
a man of good reputation, whose uncompromising frankness 
one can have the opportunity of experiencing. 37 But it is some¬ 
times the case, too, that the interplay of the care of the self and 
the help of the other blends into preexisting relations, giving 
them a new coloration and a greater warmth. The care of the 
self—or the attention one devotes to the care that others 
should take of themselves—appears then as an intensification 
of social relations. Seneca addresses a letter of consolation to 
his mother, during the period when he is in exile, in order to 
help her support his present misfortune, and perhaps greater 
misfortunes in the future. The Serenus to whom he addresses 
the long moral essay on tranquillity of mind is a young provin¬ 
cial relative whom he has under his protection. His correspon¬ 
dence with Lucilius deepens a preexisting relationship 
between the two men, who are not separated by a very great
