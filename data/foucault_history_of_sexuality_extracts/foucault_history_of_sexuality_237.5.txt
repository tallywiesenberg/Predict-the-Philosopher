so that he might in this final moment help him give his life its 
finest and most accomplished form. Furthermore, these differ¬ 
ent functions of professor, guide, adviser, and personal confi¬ 
dant were not always distinct—far from it: in the practice of 
the cultivation of the self, the roles were often interchangeable, 
and they could be played in turn by the same person. 
Musonius Rufus had been the political adviser of Rubellius 
Plautus; in the exile that followed the latter’s death, he drew 
visitors and loyal supporters around him and held a kind of 
school. Under Vespasian, he returned to Rome, where he gave 
public lectures and was part of Titus’ entourage. 

But all this attention to the self did not depend solely on the 
existence of schools, lectures, and professionals of spiritual 
direction for its social base; it found a ready support in the 
whole bundle of customary relations of kinship, friendship,

and obligation. When, in the practice of the care of the self, 
one appealed to another person in whom one recognized an 
aptitude for guidance and counseling, one was exercising a 
right. And it was a duty that one was performing when one 
lavished one’s assistance on another, or when one gratefully 
received the lessons the other might give. Galen’s text on 
curing the passions is significant from this point of view: he 
advises anyone who wishes to take proper care of himself to 
seek the aid of another; he does not, however, recommend a 
technician known for his competence and learning, but simply 
a man of good reputation, whose uncompromising frankness 
one can have the opportunity of experiencing. 37 But it is some¬ 
times the case, too, that the interplay of the care of the self and 
the help of the other blends into preexisting relations, giving 
them a new coloration and a greater warmth. The care of the 
self—or the attention one devotes to the care that others 
should take of themselves—appears then as an intensification 
of social relations. Seneca addresses a letter of consolation to 
his mother, during the period when he is in exile, in order to 
help her support his present misfortune, and perhaps greater 
misfortunes in the future. The Serenus to whom he addresses 
the long moral essay on tranquillity of mind is a young provin¬ 
cial relative whom he has under his protection. His correspon¬ 
dence with Lucilius deepens a preexisting relationship 
between the two men, who are not separated by a very great
