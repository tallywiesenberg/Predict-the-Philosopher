difference in age, and tends little by little to transform this 
spiritual guidance into a shared experience, from which each 
derives a benefit for himself. In the thirty-fourth letter, Seneca, 
who is able to say to Lucilius: “I claim you for myself; you are 
my handiwork,” immediately adds: “I am cheering on one 
who is in the race and so in turn cheers me on.” And, already 
in the next letter, he alludes to the reward of perfect friendship 
in which each one will be for the other that constant help 
which will be the subject of letter 109: “Skilled wrestlers are 
kept up to the mark by practice; a musician is stirred to action 
by one of equal proficiency. The wise man also needs to have 
his virtues kept in action; and as he prompts himself to do

things, so he is prompted by another wise man.” 38 The care of 
the self appears therefore as intrinsically linked to a “soul 
service,” which includes the possibility of a round of ex¬ 
changes with the other and a system of reciprocal obligations. 

3. In keeping with a tradition that goes back a very long 
way in Greek culture, the care of the self is in close correlation 
with medical thought and practice. This ancient correlation 
became increasingly strong, so much so that Plutarch is able 
to say, at the beginning of Advice about Keeping Well, that 
philosophy and medicine are concerned with “a single field” 
(mia chora ). 39 They do in fact draw on a shared set of notions, 
whose central element is the concept of “pathos.” It applies 
to passion as well as to physical illness, to the distress of the 
body and to the involuntary movement of the soul; and in both 
cases alike, it refers to a state of passivity, which for the body 
takes the form of a disorder that upsets the balance of its 
humors or its qualities and which for the soul takes the form 
of a movement capable of carrying it away in spite of itself. 
On the basis of this shared concept, it was possible to con¬ 
struct a grid of analysis that was valid for the ailments of the 
body and the soul. For example, there was the schema pro¬ 
posed by the Stoics, which determines the degrees of develop¬ 
ment and the chronicity of diseases. The first distinction made 
in this schema is the predisposition to disease, the proclivitas 
that exposes one to the possible illnesses. Next there is the 
affection, the disorder, which in Greek is called pathos and in 
Latin affectus; then the illness (nosema, morbus) that is estab¬ 
lished and declared when the disorder has taken hold of the
