difference in age, and tends little by little to transform this 
spiritual guidance into a shared experience, from which each 
derives a benefit for himself. In the thirty-fourth letter, Seneca, 
who is able to say to Lucilius: “I claim you for myself; you are 
my handiwork,” immediately adds: “I am cheering on one 
who is in the race and so in turn cheers me on.” And, already 
in the next letter, he alludes to the reward of perfect friendship 
in which each one will be for the other that constant help 
which will be the subject of letter 109: “Skilled wrestlers are 
kept up to the mark by practice; a musician is stirred to action 
by one of equal proficiency. The wise man also needs to have 
his virtues kept in action; and as he prompts himself to do

things, so he is prompted by another wise man.” 38 The care of 
the self appears therefore as intrinsically linked to a “soul 
service,” which includes the possibility of a round of ex¬ 
changes with the other and a system of reciprocal obligations. 

3. In keeping with a tradition that goes back a very long 
way in Greek culture, the care of the self is in close correlation 
with medical thought and practice. This ancient correlation 
became increasingly strong, so much so that Plutarch is able 
to say, at the beginning of Advice about Keeping Well, that 
philosophy and medicine are concerned with “a single field” 
(mia chora ). 39 They do in fact draw on a shared set of notions, 
whose central element is the concept of “pathos.” It applies 
to passion as well as to physical illness, to the distress of the 
body and to the involuntary movement of the soul; and in both 
cases alike, it refers to a state of passivity, which for the body 
takes the form of a disorder that upsets the balance of its 
humors or its qualities and which for the soul takes the form 
of a movement capable of carrying it away in spite of itself. 
On the basis of this shared concept, it was possible to con¬ 
struct a grid of analysis that was valid for the ailments of the 
body and the soul. For example, there was the schema pro¬ 
posed by the Stoics, which determines the degrees of develop¬ 
ment and the chronicity of diseases. The first distinction made 
in this schema is the predisposition to disease, the proclivitas 
that exposes one to the possible illnesses. Next there is the 
affection, the disorder, which in Greek is called pathos and in 
Latin affectus; then the illness (nosema, morbus) that is estab¬ 
lished and declared when the disorder has taken hold of the 
body and the soul. More serious, more lasting, is the aegrotatio 
or arrhostema that constitutes a state of sickness and debility. 
Finally, there is the inveterate disease (kakia, aegrotatio in- 
veterata, vitium malum) for which no cure is possible. The 
Stoics also presented schemas that mark the different stages or 
different possible forms of the cure. Thus Seneca distinguishes 
between sick persons who are cured of all or part of their vices 
and those who are rid of their ills but not yet rid of their

affections; and there are those who have recovered their health 
but are still frail because their predispositions have not been 
corrected. 40 These notions and schemas are intended to serve 
as a common guide for the medicine of the body and the 
therapeutics of the soul. They make it possible not only to 
apply the same type of theoretical analysis to physical troubles 
and moral disorders alike, but also to use the same kind of 
approach in attending to them, treating them, and, if possible, 
curing them. 

A whole series of medical metaphors is regularly employed 
to designate the operations necessary for the care of the soul: 
put the scalpel to the wound; open an abscess; amputate; 
evacuate the superfluities; give medications; prescribe bitter, 
soothing, or bracing potions. 41 The improvement, the perfect¬ 
ing of the soul that one seeks in philosophy, the paideia the 
latter is supposed to ensure, increasingly assumes a medical 
coloration. Educating oneself and taking care of oneself are 
interconnected activities. Epictetus lays stress on this point: he 
does not want his school to be considered as just a place of 
education where one can acquire knowledge useful for a career 
or a reputation, before returning home to derive advantage 
from it. The school should be thought of as a “dispensary for 
the soul”: “The philosopher’s school is a physician’s consult¬ 
ing-room [iatreion]. You must leave it in pain, not in plea¬ 
sure.” 42 He insists that his disciples be mindful of their 
condition, regarding it as a pathological state; that they not 
consider themselves first and above all as students who have 
come to gain knowledge from the man who possesses it; that 
they present themselves as patients, as though one had a dis¬ 
located shoulder, the other an abscess, the third a fistula, and 
the next one headaches. He takes them to task for coming to 
him not in order to be treated (therapeuthesomenoi) but in
