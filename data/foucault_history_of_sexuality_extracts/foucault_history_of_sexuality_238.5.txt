body and the soul. More serious, more lasting, is the aegrotatio 
or arrhostema that constitutes a state of sickness and debility. 
Finally, there is the inveterate disease (kakia, aegrotatio in- 
veterata, vitium malum) for which no cure is possible. The 
Stoics also presented schemas that mark the different stages or 
different possible forms of the cure. Thus Seneca distinguishes 
between sick persons who are cured of all or part of their vices 
and those who are rid of their ills but not yet rid of their

affections; and there are those who have recovered their health 
but are still frail because their predispositions have not been 
corrected. 40 These notions and schemas are intended to serve 
as a common guide for the medicine of the body and the 
therapeutics of the soul. They make it possible not only to 
apply the same type of theoretical analysis to physical troubles 
and moral disorders alike, but also to use the same kind of 
approach in attending to them, treating them, and, if possible, 
curing them. 

A whole series of medical metaphors is regularly employed 
to designate the operations necessary for the care of the soul: 
put the scalpel to the wound; open an abscess; amputate; 
evacuate the superfluities; give medications; prescribe bitter, 
soothing, or bracing potions. 41 The improvement, the perfect¬ 
ing of the soul that one seeks in philosophy, the paideia the 
latter is supposed to ensure, increasingly assumes a medical 
coloration. Educating oneself and taking care of oneself are 
interconnected activities. Epictetus lays stress on this point: he 
does not want his school to be considered as just a place of 
education where one can acquire knowledge useful for a career 
or a reputation, before returning home to derive advantage 
from it. The school should be thought of as a “dispensary for 
the soul”: “The philosopher’s school is a physician’s consult¬ 
ing-room [iatreion]. You must leave it in pain, not in plea¬ 
sure.” 42 He insists that his disciples be mindful of their 
condition, regarding it as a pathological state; that they not 
consider themselves first and above all as students who have 
come to gain knowledge from the man who possesses it; that 
they present themselves as patients, as though one had a dis¬ 
located shoulder, the other an abscess, the third a fistula, and 
the next one headaches. He takes them to task for coming to 
him not in order to be treated (therapeuthesomenoi) but in
