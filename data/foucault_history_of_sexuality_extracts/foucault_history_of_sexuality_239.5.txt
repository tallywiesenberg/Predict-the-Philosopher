body if one wants it to remain completely in control of itself. 
It is to this point of contact, the weak point of the individual, 
that the attention one gives to the physical ills, discomforts,

and complaints is directed. The body the adult has to care for, 
when he is concerned about himself, is no longer the young 
body that needed shaping by gymnastics; it is a fragile, threat¬ 
ened body, undermined by petty miseries—a body that in turn 
threatens the soul, less by its too-vigorous requirements than 
by its own weaknesses. The letters of Seneca offer many exam¬ 
ples of this attention focused on health, on regimen, on the 
malaises and all the troubles that can circulate between the 
body and the soul. 47 The correspondence between Fronto and 
Marcus Aurelius—to say nothing of the Sacred Tales of 
Aelius Aristides, which give altogether different dimensions to 
the narrative of illness and an entirely different value to its 
experience—shows very well the place occupied by concern 
for the body in these practices of the self, but it also shows the 
style of this preoccupation: fear of excess, economy of regi¬ 
men, being on the alert for disturbances, detailed attention 
given to dysfunction, the taking into account of all the factors 
(season, climate, diet, mode of living) that can disturb the 
body and, through it, the soul. 48 

But there is something more important perhaps: on the 
basis of this rapprochement (practical and theoretical) be¬ 
tween medicine and ethics, there is the inducement to ac¬ 
knowledge oneself as being ill or threatened by illness. The 
practice of the self implies that one should form the image of 
oneself not simply as an imperfect, ignorant individual who 
requires correction, training, and instruction, but as one who 
suffers from certain ills and who needs to have them treated, 
either by oneself or by someone who has the necessary compe¬ 
tence. Everyone must discover that he is in a state of need, that 
he needs to receive medication and assistance. “This, then, is 
where the philosophic life begins,” says Epictetus, “in a man’s 
perception of the state of his ruling faculty [aisthesis tou idiou

in a feeble state, you will not choose to employ it anymore for

unable to swallow a mouthful, buy themselves a treatise, and 
set about eating it whole, and in consequence they vomit or
