The History of Sexuality 


simply in oneself—in some forgotten knowledge, or in a 
certain primal trace—but in the self-examination that yields, 
through a multitude of fleeting impressions, the basic cer¬ 
tainties of consciousness. The obligation to confess is now 
relayed through so many different points, is so deeply in¬ 
grained in us, that we no longer perceive it as the effect of 
a power that constrains us; on the contrary, it seems to us 
that truth, lodged in our most secret nature, “demands” only 
to surface; that if it fails to do so, this is because a constraint 
holds it in place, the violence of a power weighs it down, and 
it can finally be articulated only at the price of a kind of 
liberation. Confession frees, but power reduces one to si¬ 
lence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares 
an original affinity with freedom: traditional themes in phi¬ 
losophy, which a “political history of truth” would have to 
overturn by showing that truth is not by nature free—nor 
error servile—but that its production is thoroughly imbued 
with relations of power. The confession is an example of this. 

One has to be completely taken in by this internal ruse of 
confession in order to attribute a fundamental role to censor¬ 
ship, to taboos regarding speaking and thinking; one has to 
have an inverted image of power in order to believe that all 
these voices which have spoken so long in our civilization— 
repeating the formidable injunction to tell what one is and 
what one does, what one recollects and what one has forgot¬ 
ten, what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not 
thinking—are speaking to us of freedom. An immense labor 
to which the West has submitted generations in order to 
produce—while other forms of work ensured the accumula¬ 
tion of capital—men’s subjection: their constitution as sub¬ 
jects in both senses of the word. Imagine how exorbitant 
must have seemed the order given to all Christians at the 
beginning of the thirteenth century, to kneel at least once a 
year and confess to all their transgressions, without omitting 
a single one. And think of that obscure partisan, seven centu¬ 
ries later, who had come to rejoin the Serbian resistance deep
