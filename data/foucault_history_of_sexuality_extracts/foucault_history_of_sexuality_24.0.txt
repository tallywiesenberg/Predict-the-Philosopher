simply in oneself—in some forgotten knowledge, or in a 
certain primal trace—but in the self-examination that yields, 
through a multitude of fleeting impressions, the basic cer¬ 
tainties of consciousness. The obligation to confess is now 
relayed through so many different points, is so deeply in¬ 
grained in us, that we no longer perceive it as the effect of 
a power that constrains us; on the contrary, it seems to us 
that truth, lodged in our most secret nature, “demands” only 
to surface; that if it fails to do so, this is because a constraint 
holds it in place, the violence of a power weighs it down, and 
it can finally be articulated only at the price of a kind of 
liberation. Confession frees, but power reduces one to si¬ 
lence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares 
an original affinity with freedom: traditional themes in phi¬ 
losophy, which a “political history of truth” would have to 
overturn by showing that truth is not by nature free—nor 
error servile—but that its production is thoroughly imbued 
with relations of power. The confession is an example of this. 

One has to be completely taken in by this internal ruse of 
confession in order to attribute a fundamental role to censor¬ 
ship, to taboos regarding speaking and thinking; one has to 
have an inverted image of power in order to believe that all 
these voices which have spoken so long in our civilization— 
repeating the formidable injunction to tell what one is and 
what one does, what one recollects and what one has forgot¬ 
ten, what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not 
thinking—are speaking to us of freedom. An immense labor 
to which the West has submitted generations in order to 
produce—while other forms of work ensured the accumula¬ 
tion of capital—men’s subjection: their constitution as sub¬ 
jects in both senses of the word. Imagine how exorbitant 
must have seemed the order given to all Christians at the 
beginning of the thirteenth century, to kneel at least once a 
year and confess to all their transgressions, without omitting 
a single one. And think of that obscure partisan, seven centu¬ 
ries later, who had come to rejoin the Serbian resistance deep

in the mountains; his superiors asked him to write his life 
story; and when he brought them a few miserable pages, 
scribbled in the night, they did not look at them but only said 
to him, “Start over, and tell the truth.” Should those much- 
discussed language taboos make us forget this millennial 
yoke of confession? 

From the Christian penance to the present day, sex was a 
privileged theme of confession. A thing that was hidden, we 
are told. But what if, on the contrary, it was what, in a quite 
particular way, one confessed? Suppose the obligation to 
conceal it was but another aspect of the duty to admit to it 
(concealing it all the more and with greater care as the 
confession of it was more important, requiring a stricter 
ritual and promising more decisive effects)? What if sex in 
our society, on a scale of several centuries, was something 
that was placed within an unrelenting system of confession? 
The transformation of sex into discourse, which I spoke of 
earlier, the dissemination and reinforcement of heterogene¬ 
ous sexualities, are perhaps two elements of the same deploy¬ 
ment: they are linked together with the help of the central 
element of a confession that compels individuals to articulate 
their sexual peculiarity—no matter how extreme. In Greece, 
truth and sex were linked, in the form of pedagogy, by the 
transmission of a precious knowledge from one body to an¬ 
other; sex served as a medium for initiations into learning. 
For us, it is in the confession that truth and sex are joined, 
through the obligatory and exhaustive expression of an indi¬ 
vidual secret. But this time it is truth that serves as a medium 
for sex and its manifestations. 

The confession is a ritual of discourse in which the speak¬ 
ing subject is also the subject of the statement; it is also a 
ritual that unfolds within a power relationship, for one does 
not confess without the presence (or virtual presence) of a 
partner who is not simply the interlocutor but the authority 
who requires the confession, prescribes and appreciates it, 
and intervenes in order to judge, punish, forgive, console,

the obstacles and resistances it has had to surmount in order 
to be formulated; and finally, a ritual in which the expression
