As for the time of year or season that was most conducive 
to obtaining a fine progeny, it was seen as depending on a 
whole cluster of complex elements; it was no doubt precau¬ 
tions of this sort, among other things, that would occupy the 
attention of the women inspectors—in Plato’s scheme—who 
were to oversee the good conduct of married couples during 
the ten years within which they were required or allowed to 
procreate.20 Aristotle mentions briefly the knowledge that the 
doctors of his day and the naturalists were capable of impart¬ 
ing on this subject.According to him, the husband and wife 
ought to acquaint themselves with all these lessons: “doctors 
can tell them all they need to know about the times of good 
physical condition” (according to convention, winter is best); 
as for the “physicists,” they “hold that the north wind is better 
than the south.” 21 

In view of all these obligatory precautions, it is clear that 
procreative practice required a great deal of attention, indeed 
a whole moral attitude, if one wished to avert all the dangers 
that threatened it and to achieve the desired results.Plato 
insists that both spouses must keep in mind (dianoeisthai) that 
they are expected to present the city with “the noblest and best 
children possible.” They should earnestly reflect on the task, 
guided by the principle that human beings accomplish what 
they set out to do “if they reflect intelligently upon themselves 
and the deed itself,” whereas they fail “if they don’t apply 
their intelligence to it, or if they lack intelligence.” Therefore, 
“the groom should reflect intelligently [prosecheto ton noun ] 
on the bride and the making of children and the bride should 
do likewise—especially during the time when they don’t yet 

* According to Xenophon, it was so that they might have vigorous offspring that the 
young married couples of Sparta were not supposed to have relations very often: 
“With this restriction on intercourse the desire of the one for the other must necessar¬ 
ily be increased, and their offspring was bound to be more vigorous than if they were 
surfeited with one another .” 19

have children.” 22 We may recall in this connection an observa¬ 
tion that appears in the Aristotelian Problems: if it is so often 
the case that the children of human beings do not resemble 
their parents, the reason is that the latter, at the time of the 
sexual act, had many other things on their minds instead of 
thinking only of what they were doing at that moment.23 Later 
on, in the world of the flesh, it would be a rule necessary for 
justifying the sexual act, that it must be performed with a 
single purpose in mind, that of procreation.
