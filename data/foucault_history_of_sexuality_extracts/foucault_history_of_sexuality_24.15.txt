Here, however, 
such an intention was not necessary in order for sexual inter¬ 
course to avoid being a mortal sin.Yet, in order for it to 
achieve its aim, enabling the individual to live on in his chil¬ 
dren and to contribute to the security of the city, a whole 
mental endeavor was necessary: an unfailing concern for the 
dangers that surrounded the use of pleasures, threatening the 
purpose that nature gave them.* 

* Plato, in the Laws, would have women lead a life sheltered from overly intense 
pleasures and pains.”

Act, Expenditure,

And yet, while the use of pleasures constituted a problem 
in the individual’s relationship with his own body, and made 
it difficult to define a regimen for him, the reason lay not 
simply in the fact that this use was suspected of being the 
source of certain illnesses or that people feared its conse¬ 
quences for their offspring.The sexual act was certainly not 
perceived by the Greeks as an evil; for them it was not the 
object of a moral disqualification.But the texts bear witness 
to an anxiety concerning the activity itself.
