The physical regimen 
of the aphrodisia was a health precaution; at the same time, 
it was an exercise—an askesis —of existence.1.The violence of the act.Plato was thinking about the 
aphrodisia when, in the Philebus, he described the effects of 
pleasure when it is mixed with a little distress: pleasure “takes 
possession of a man, sometimes making him leap about in 
ecstasy, so that he changes complexion, takes up all kinds of 
strange positions, pants in strange ways, and is driven com¬ 
pletely out of his senses with mad cries and shouts....He feels 
bound to say to himself, as do others, that he is almost dying 
with enjoyment when he indulges in these delights.
