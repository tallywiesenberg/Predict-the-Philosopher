The more 
unrestrained and intemperate [ akolastoteros, aphronesteros ] 
he is, the more fervently he goes after them in wholehearted 
pursuit.” 1 

Hippocrates has been credited with the statement that or¬ 
gasm has the form of a brief epileptic seizure: at any rate, that 
is what Aulus Gellius reports: “Hippocrates, a man of divine 
wisdom, believed of venery [coitus venereus] that it was part 
of the horrible disease which our countrymen call comitalis, 
or the ‘election disease’; for these are his very words as they 
have come down to us: ‘coition is a brief epilepsy’ [ten synou- 
sian einai mikran epilepsian ].” 2 Actually the phrase comes 
from Democritus.The Hippocratic treatise The Seed, which 
in its first pages gives a detailed description of the sexual act, 
accords with another tradition, that of Diogenes of Apollonia; 
the model this tradition (also represented by Clement of Alex¬ 
andria) referred to was not the pathological model of epilepsy, 
but the mechanical model of a heated, foaming fluid: “Some 
people,” reports The Pedagogue, “suppose that the semen of 
living creatures is the foamy substance of the blood.The blood 
being greatly agitated during the intertwining of bodies, and 
heated by the natural warmth of the male, forms a froth and

spreads through the spermatic veins.According to Diogenes 
of Apollonia, this phenomenon would explain the term aphro- 
disia.” 3 This general theme of fluids, agitation, and spreading 
foam is treated in The Seed from the Hippocratic collection, 
in the form of a description organized entirely around what 
might be called the “ejaculatory schema”; it is this schema 
that is carried over unchanged from man to woman, and used 
to decipher the relationships between male and female roles in 
terms of confrontation and contest, but also domination and 
regulation of the one by the other.
