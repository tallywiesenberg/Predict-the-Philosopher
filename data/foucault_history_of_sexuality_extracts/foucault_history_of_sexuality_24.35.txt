The sexual act is analyzed, from start to finish, as a violent 
mechanical action that is directed toward the emission of 
sperm.4 First, the rubbing of the genitals and the movement 
given to the whole body produce a general warming effect; the 
latter, combined with agitation, gives the humor, diffused into 
the whole body, a greater fluidity, so that it begins to “foam” 
(aphrein), “in the same way as all other fluids produce foam 
when they are agitated.” At this stage a phenomenon of “sepa¬ 
ration” (apokrisis) occurs; the most vigorous part of this 
foaming fluid, “the most potent and the richest” (to ischyrota- 
ton kaipiotaton) is carried to the brain and the spinal marrow, 
descending its length to the loins.Then the warm foam passes 
to the kidneys and from there through the testicles to the 
penis, from which it is expelled by means of a violent spasm 
(tarache).This process, which is voluntary at the beginning 
when there is sexual union and “rubbing of the genitals,” can 
also unfold in an entirely involuntary manner.This is what 
occurs in the case of nocturnal emission, an occurrence men¬ 
tioned by the author of The Seed: when work or another 
activity has caused the body to be heated, the fluid starts to 
produce foam spontaneously; it “behaves as in coition,” and 
ejaculation takes place, accompanied by dream images, no 
doubt following the frequently invoked principle that dreams, 
or at least some of them, reveal the current state of the body.
