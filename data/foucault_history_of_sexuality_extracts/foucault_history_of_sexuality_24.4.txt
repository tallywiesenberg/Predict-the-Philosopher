The Hippocratic description establishes a general isomor¬ 
phism between the man’s sexual act and that of the woman.128 


The Use of Pleasure 


The process is the same, except that in the case of the woman 
the heating starts in the womb stimulated by the male sex 
organ during intercourse: “In the case of women, it is my 
contention that when during intercourse the vagina is rubbed 
and the womb is disturbed, an irritation is set up in the womb 
which produces pleasure and heat in the rest of the body.A 
woman also releases something from her body, sometimes into 
the womb, and sometimes externally as well.” 6 There is the 
same type of substance and the same formation (sperm formed 
from blood through warming and separation); there is also the 
same mechanism and the same terminal act of ejaculation.The author does bring out certain differences, however, relat¬ 
ing not to the nature of the act but to its peculiar violence, and 
to the intensity and duration of the pleasure that accompanies 
it.In the act itself, the woman’s pleasure is much less intense 
than that of the man, because in the case of the latter the 
excretion of fluid occurs abruptly and with much greater vio¬ 
lence.
