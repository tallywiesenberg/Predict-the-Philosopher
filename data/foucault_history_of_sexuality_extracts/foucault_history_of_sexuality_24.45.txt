In the case of the woman, on the other hand, the pleas¬ 
ure begins at the start of the act and lasts as long as intercourse 
itself.Throughout intercourse her pleasure depends on the 
man; it does not cease until “the man releases the woman”; 
and if she happens to reach orgasm before him, this does not

and in the woman, the Hippocratic text posits a relation that 
is causal and competitive at the same time: a contest, as it 
were, where the male plays the role of instigator and where he

and to the reciprocal effects of heat and cold; the male liquor 
sometimes acts as the stimulant, sometimes as the dampener;

ejaculation puts an end to the woman’s pleasure, it is like 
pouring a cold liquid on very hot water: the boiling stops 
immediately.
