in the mountains; his superiors asked him to write his life 
story; and when he brought them a few miserable pages, 
scribbled in the night, they did not look at them but only said 
to him, “Start over, and tell the truth.” Should those much- 
discussed language taboos make us forget this millennial 
yoke of confession? 

From the Christian penance to the present day, sex was a 
privileged theme of confession. A thing that was hidden, we 
are told. But what if, on the contrary, it was what, in a quite 
particular way, one confessed? Suppose the obligation to 
conceal it was but another aspect of the duty to admit to it 
(concealing it all the more and with greater care as the 
confession of it was more important, requiring a stricter 
ritual and promising more decisive effects)? What if sex in 
our society, on a scale of several centuries, was something 
that was placed within an unrelenting system of confession? 
The transformation of sex into discourse, which I spoke of 
earlier, the dissemination and reinforcement of heterogene¬ 
ous sexualities, are perhaps two elements of the same deploy¬ 
ment: they are linked together with the help of the central 
element of a confession that compels individuals to articulate 
their sexual peculiarity—no matter how extreme. In Greece, 
truth and sex were linked, in the form of pedagogy, by the 
transmission of a precious knowledge from one body to an¬ 
other; sex served as a medium for initiations into learning. 
For us, it is in the confession that truth and sex are joined, 
through the obligatory and exhaustive expression of an indi¬ 
vidual secret. But this time it is truth that serves as a medium 
for sex and its manifestations. 

The confession is a ritual of discourse in which the speak¬ 
ing subject is also the subject of the statement; it is also a 
ritual that unfolds within a power relationship, for one does 
not confess without the presence (or virtual presence) of a 
partner who is not simply the interlocutor but the authority 
who requires the confession, prescribes and appreciates it, 
and intervenes in order to judge, punish, forgive, console,

the obstacles and resistances it has had to surmount in order 
to be formulated; and finally, a ritual in which the expression
