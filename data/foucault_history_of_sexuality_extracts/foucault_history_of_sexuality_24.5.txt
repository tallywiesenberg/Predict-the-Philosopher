8 Two similar acts, therefore, bringing analogous 
substances into play, but substances endowed with opposing 
qualities that confront one another in sexual union: force 
against force, cold water against boiling, alcohol on a flame.But, in any case, it is the male act that determines, regulates, 
stimulates, dominates.It is the male act, too, that ensures the 
health of the female organs by ensuring that they function 
properly: “If women have intercourse with men their health 
is better than if they do not.For in the first place, the womb 
is moistened by intercourse, whereas when the womb is drier 
than it should be it becomes extremely contracted, and this 
extreme contraction causes pain to the body.In the second 
place, intercourse by heating the blood and rendering it more 
fluid gives an easier passage to the menses; whereas if the 
menses do not flow, women’s bodies become prone to sick¬ 
ness.” 9 For the woman’s body, penetration by the man and 
absorption of sperm are the primary source of the equilibrium 
of its qualities and the key stimulus for the necessary flow of 
its humors.
