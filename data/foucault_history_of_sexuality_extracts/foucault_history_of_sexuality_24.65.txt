According to one of these, 
it originates in the head: formed in the brain, it descends via 
the marrow to the lower parts of the body.By Diogenes 
Laertius’ account, this was the general principle of the Py¬ 
thagorean conception: the sperm was held to be “a clot of 
brain containing hot vapor within it”; from that fragment of 
matter the whole body would subsequently be formed, with its 
“flesh, sinews, bones, hairs”; from the hot ether that it con¬ 
tained, the soul of the embryo would be born, along with 
sensation.10 This privileging of the head in the formation of 
semen is echoed in the Hippocratic text, where there is the 
statement that for men who have had an incision made next 
to the ear, while they remain capable of sexual intercourse, 
they have a semen that is small in quantity, weak, and sterile: 
“For the greater part of the sperm travels from the head past 
the ears into the spinal marrow: now when the incision has 
formed a scar, this passage becomes obstructed.” 11 But this 
importance given to the head is not incompatible, in the trea¬ 
tise The Seed, with the general principle that semen issues 
from the body as a whole: a man’s sperm “comes from all the 
fluid in the body” through “veins and nerves which extend 
from every part of the body through the penis”; it is secreted 
“from the whole body—from the hard parts as well as the soft,

and from the total bodily fluid” in its four forms.12 A woman 
also “ejaculates from the entire body”; and if boys and girls 
are not able to secrete semen before puberty, this is because 
at that age the veins are so small and narrow that they “pre¬ 
vent the passage of sperm.” 13 In any case, emanating from the 
whole body, or coming for the most part from the head, semen 
is regarded as the result of a process that separates, isolates, 
and concentrates “the most potent part” of the bodily fluid: 
to ischyrotaton.This force is manifested in the rich and foamy 
nature of semen, and in the violence with which it is expelled; 
it is also evidenced by the weakness that is always felt after 
coition, however small the amount excreted.
