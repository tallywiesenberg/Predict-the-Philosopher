Actually, the origin of semen remained a topic of debate in 
the medical and philosophical literature.But no matter what 
explanations were submitted, they had to account for what 
enabled semen to transmit life, to give rise to another living 
creature.And where did the seminal substance get its potency 
if not from the source of life that was found in the individual 
from whom it came?The life that it imparted had to have been 
borrowed and separated from the living being where it origiÂ¬ 
nated.In every emission of sperm there was something that 
issued, and was withdrawn, from the most precious elements 
of the individual.
