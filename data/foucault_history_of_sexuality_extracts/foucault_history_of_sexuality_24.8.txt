And yet here, too, one finds the same principle 
of precious loss.In the Generation of Animals, the sperm is 
explained as the residue (perittoma) of nutriment: the end 
product, concentrated in very small quantities and useful in 
the same way as is the raw material for growth that the 
organism draws from food.For Aristotle, in fact, the final 
processing of what alimentation brings into the body furnishes 
a material, one portion of which is conveyed to all parts of the 
body, causing them to grow, imperceptibly, every day—while 
the other portion awaits the expulsion that will enable it, once 
inside the womb of a woman, to give rise to the formation of 
an embryo.16 The development and reproduction of the indi¬ 
vidual thus depend on the same elements and have their 
source in the same substance.The growth elements and the 
seminal fluid are doublets resulting from an alimentary proc¬ 
essing that maintains the life of one individual and makes 
possible the birth of another.
