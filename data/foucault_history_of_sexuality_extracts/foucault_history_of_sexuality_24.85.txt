Given these conditions, it is 
understandable that the discharge of this semen constitutes an 
important event for the body: it withdraws a substance that 
is precious, being the end result of a lengthy distillation by the 
organism and concentrating elements which, in accordance 
with nature, might have gone “to all parts of the body,” and 
hence might have made it grow if they had not been removed 
from the body.It is also understandable why this discharge— 
which is entirely possible at an age when a human being needs 
only to renew his organism without having to develop it—does 
not take place in early youth when all the resources of nourish¬ 
ment are used for development; at that age, “all the nutriment 
is used up too soon,” says Aristotle; it is understandable, too, 
that in old age, the production of sperm slows down: “The 
organism does not concoct enough.” 17 The entire life of the 
individual—from youth, when one needs to grow, to old age, 
when one has so much trouble sustaining oneself—is marked 
by this relation of complementarity between the power to 
procreate and the capacity to develop or continue existing.Whether the semen is drawn from the whole organism, or

originates where the body and the soul are joined to one 
another, or is formed at the end of a lengthy internal process¬ 
ing of food, the sexual act that expels it constitutes a costly 
expenditure for the human being.Pleasure may well accom¬ 
pany it, as nature intended, so that men would think of provid¬ 
ing themselves with descendants; it nonetheless constitutes a 
hard jolt for the being itself, involving as it does the relinquish¬ 
ing of a whole portion of that which contains a “being itself.” 
This is how Aristotle explains the “obvious” dejection that 
follows intercourse 18 ; it is also how the author of the Problems 
explains the dislike felt by young men for the first woman with 
whom they chanced to have sexual relations.19 Although the 
volume is small—proportionately larger, however, in men 
than in other animals—living creatures deprive themselves of 
a whole portion of the elements that are essential to their own 
existence.
