If animals united in sexual intercourse, and if this 
relation gave them descendants, it was in order that the species 
might—as the Laws puts it—endlessly accompany the march 
of time.This was its way of cheating death: leaving “the 
children of children” behind it while remaining the same, it 
“partakes of immortality by means of coming-in to-being.” 21 
For Aristotle and Plato alike, the sexual act was at the point 
of junction of an individual life that was bound to perish—and 
from which, moreover, it drew off a portion of its most pre¬ 
cious resources—and an immortality that assumed the con-

crete form of a survival of the species.Between these two lives, 
the sexual relation constituted, as Plato says, an “artifice” 
(mechane) that was designed to join them together so that the 
first might, in its own way, participate in the second; this 
mechane provided the individual with an “offspring” of him¬ 
self (apoblastema).In Plato this link, contrived and natural at the same time, 
is sustained by the longing for self-perpetuation and immortal¬ 
ity, which characterizes every perishable creature.22 In the 
Symposium, Diotima points out that such a longing exists in 
animals which, seized by the urge to procreate, “fall prey to 
a violent love-sickness,” and they are “ready to die if need be 
in order to secure the survival of their progeny.” 23 It also exists 
in the human animal who, once his life is over, does not want 
to lie in a grave uncelebrated and “nameless.” 24 This is why, 
according to the Laws, he should marry and provide himself 
with descendants in the best possible circumstances.
