have indigestion. Hence colics and fluxes and fevers. They 
ought first to have considered whether they have the fac¬ 
ulty.” 49 And the establishment of the relation to oneself as a 
sick individual is all the more necessary because the diseases 
of the soul—unlike those of the body—do not announce them¬ 
selves by the suffering that one perceives; not only can they go 
undetected for a long time, but they blind those whom they 
afflict. Plutarch remarks that the disorders of the body can 
generally be detected by the pulse, bile, temperature, and 
pains; and further, that the worst physical illnesses are those 
in which—as in lethargy, epilepsy, or apoplexy—the individ¬ 
ual is not aware of his state. The insidious thing about the 
diseases of the soul is that they pass unnoticed, or even that 
one can mistake them for virtues (anger for courage, amorous 
passion for friendship, envy for emulation, cowardice for pru¬ 
dence). Now, what physicians desire is “that a man should not 
be ill; and, if he is ill, that he should not be unaware that he 
is ill.” 50 

4. In this practice, which is at once personal and social, 
self-knowledge occupies a considerable place, of course. The 
Delphic principle is often recalled; but it would not be suffi¬ 
cient to see this merely as the influence of the Socratic theme. 
In reality, a whole art of self-knowledge developed, with 
precise recipes, specific forms of examination, and codified 
exercises. 

a. We can thus begin by isolating—very schematically and 
subject to a more thorough and systematic study—what might 
be called the “testing procedures.” These have the dual role 
of moving one forward in the acquisition of a virtue and of 
marking the point one has reached. Hence their progressive 
character, emphasized by Plutarch and Epictetus alike. But it 
is important to note that the purpose of these tests is not to 
practice renunciation for its own sake; it is to enable one to 
do without unnecessary things by establishing a supremacy 
over oneself that does not depend on their presence or absence. 
The tests to which one subjects oneself are not successive
