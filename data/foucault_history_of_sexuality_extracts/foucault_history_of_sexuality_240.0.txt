have indigestion. Hence colics and fluxes and fevers. They 
ought first to have considered whether they have the fac¬ 
ulty.” 49 And the establishment of the relation to oneself as a 
sick individual is all the more necessary because the diseases 
of the soul—unlike those of the body—do not announce them¬ 
selves by the suffering that one perceives; not only can they go 
undetected for a long time, but they blind those whom they 
afflict. Plutarch remarks that the disorders of the body can 
generally be detected by the pulse, bile, temperature, and 
pains; and further, that the worst physical illnesses are those 
in which—as in lethargy, epilepsy, or apoplexy—the individ¬ 
ual is not aware of his state. The insidious thing about the 
diseases of the soul is that they pass unnoticed, or even that 
one can mistake them for virtues (anger for courage, amorous 
passion for friendship, envy for emulation, cowardice for pru¬ 
dence). Now, what physicians desire is “that a man should not 
be ill; and, if he is ill, that he should not be unaware that he 
is ill.” 50 

4. In this practice, which is at once personal and social, 
self-knowledge occupies a considerable place, of course. The 
Delphic principle is often recalled; but it would not be suffi¬ 
cient to see this merely as the influence of the Socratic theme. 
In reality, a whole art of self-knowledge developed, with 
precise recipes, specific forms of examination, and codified 
exercises. 

a. We can thus begin by isolating—very schematically and 
subject to a more thorough and systematic study—what might 
be called the “testing procedures.” These have the dual role 
of moving one forward in the acquisition of a virtue and of 
marking the point one has reached. Hence their progressive 
character, emphasized by Plutarch and Epictetus alike. But it 
is important to note that the purpose of these tests is not to 
practice renunciation for its own sake; it is to enable one to 
do without unnecessary things by establishing a supremacy 
over oneself that does not depend on their presence or absence. 
The tests to which one subjects oneself are not successive

stages of privation. They are a way of measuring and confirm¬ 
ing the independence one is capable of with regard to every¬ 
thing that is not indispensable and essential. They bring one 
back, momentarily, to the basic needs, revealing in this man¬ 
ner the actual basis of all that is superfluous and the possibility 
of doing without it. In Socrates' Daemon, Plutarch reports on 
a test of this kind, the value of which is affirmed by the 
character in the dialogue who represents the themes of neo- 
Pythagoreanism. One began by whetting the appetite through 
the practice of some sport; next one placed oneself in front of 
tables laden with the most succulent dishes; then, having 
gazed on these, one left them to the servants and made do with 
the kind of food that slaves ate. 51 

Exercises in abstinence were common to the Epicureans 
and the Stoics, but this training did not have the same mean¬ 
ing for both groups. In the tradition of Epicurus, it was a 
matter of showing how, in this satisfaction of the most ele¬ 
mentary needs, one could find a fuller, purer, more stable 
pleasure than in the delight one might take in all that is 
superfluous; and the test served to mark the threshold where 
privation could start to make one suffer. On certain days, 
Epicurus, whose diet was extremely abstemious already, 
would take only a reduced ration in order to see how much 
his pleasure would be diminished. 52 For the Stoics, it was 
primarily a matter of preparing oneself for possible priva¬ 
tions by discovering how easy it was, finally, to dispense 
with everything to which habit, opinion, education, attention 
to reputation, and the taste for ostentation have attached us. 
With these reductive tests, they wished to show that we can 
always have at our disposal those things that are strictly nec¬ 
essary, and that one should guard against the least apprehen¬ 
sion at the thought of possible privations: “In days of peace 
the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with 
no enemy in sight, and wearies himself with gratuitous toil, 
in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you 
would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train 
him before it comes.” 53 And Seneca alludes to a practice
