stages of privation. They are a way of measuring and confirm¬ 
ing the independence one is capable of with regard to every¬ 
thing that is not indispensable and essential. They bring one 
back, momentarily, to the basic needs, revealing in this man¬ 
ner the actual basis of all that is superfluous and the possibility 
of doing without it. In Socrates' Daemon, Plutarch reports on 
a test of this kind, the value of which is affirmed by the 
character in the dialogue who represents the themes of neo- 
Pythagoreanism. One began by whetting the appetite through 
the practice of some sport; next one placed oneself in front of 
tables laden with the most succulent dishes; then, having 
gazed on these, one left them to the servants and made do with 
the kind of food that slaves ate. 51 

Exercises in abstinence were common to the Epicureans 
and the Stoics, but this training did not have the same mean¬ 
ing for both groups. In the tradition of Epicurus, it was a 
matter of showing how, in this satisfaction of the most ele¬ 
mentary needs, one could find a fuller, purer, more stable 
pleasure than in the delight one might take in all that is 
superfluous; and the test served to mark the threshold where 
privation could start to make one suffer. On certain days, 
Epicurus, whose diet was extremely abstemious already, 
would take only a reduced ration in order to see how much 
his pleasure would be diminished. 52 For the Stoics, it was 
primarily a matter of preparing oneself for possible priva¬ 
tions by discovering how easy it was, finally, to dispense 
with everything to which habit, opinion, education, attention 
to reputation, and the taste for ostentation have attached us. 
With these reductive tests, they wished to show that we can 
always have at our disposal those things that are strictly nec¬ 
essary, and that one should guard against the least apprehen¬ 
sion at the thought of possible privations: “In days of peace 
the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with 
no enemy in sight, and wearies himself with gratuitous toil, 
in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. If you 
would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train 
him before it comes.” 53 And Seneca alludes to a practice
