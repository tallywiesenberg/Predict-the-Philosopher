which he also speaks of in another letter: brief training peri¬ 
ods of “fancied poverty” to be done every month and in the 
course of which, by voluntarily placing oneself “within the 
confines of destitution” for three or four days, one experi¬ 
ences a bed of straw, coarse clothing, and bread of the lowest 
quality: “not a game, but a test” (non lusus, sed experimen- 
tum ). 54 One does not deprive oneself for a moment in order 
to sharpen one’s taste for future refinements but to convince 
oneself that the worst misfortune will not deprive one of the 
things one absolutely needs, and that one will always be able 
to tolerate what one is capable of enduring at times. 55 One 
makes oneself familiar with the minimum. This is what 
Seneca wishes to do according to a letter written a short 
time before the Saturnalia of the year 62. Rome is “in a 
sweat” and “licentiousness is officially sanctioned.” Seneca 
asks himself if one ought to take part in the festivities or not; 
it would be proof of one’s self-control if one broke with the 
general attitude and refrained. But one would be acting with 
a still greater moral force if one did not withdraw oneself; 
the best thing would be “to do what the crowd does, but in 
a different way.” And this “different way” is the way that 
one learns ahead of time by means of voluntary exercises, 
periods of abstinence, and poverty treatments. These exer¬ 
cises make it possible to celebrate the festival like everyone 
else but without ever falling into luxuria. Thanks to them, 
one can keep a detached mind in the midst of abundance: 
“We shall be rich with all the more comfort, if we once learn 
how far poverty is from being a burden.” 56 * 
b. In conjunction with these practical tests, it was consid¬ 
ered important to subject oneself to self-examination. This 
custom formed part of Pythagorean teaching, 58 but it had 
become quite widespread. It seems that the morning examina¬ 
tion served mainly as an occasion to consider the tasks and 
obligations of the day, so as to be sufficiently prepared for it. 
The evening examination for its part was devoted much more 

‘Compare: “Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living 
simply is voluntary poverty.’” 7

specifically to reviewing the day that had gone by. The most 
detailed description of this exercise, which was regularly pre¬ 
scribed by numerous authors, is given by Seneca in De ira . 59 
Seneca traces the practice of it to Sextius, that Roman Stoic 
whose teaching he knew by way of Papirius Fabianus and 
Sotion. He presents Sextius’ practice as being centered mainly 
on the evaluation of one’s progress at the end of the day. When 
he had retired for the night, Sextius would question his soul: 
“What bad habit have you cured today? What fault have 
you resisted? In what respect are you better?” Seneca, too, 
undertakes an examination of this kind every evening. Dark¬ 
ness—“when the light has been removed from sight”—and 
quiet—“when my wife has become silent”—are its external 
conditions. And he is mindful of the need to prepare for a 
blissful sleep: “Can anything be more excellent than this prac¬ 
tice of thoroughly sifting the whole day? And how delightful 
the sleep that follows this self-examination—how tranquil [ 
tranquillus ], how deep [ altus] and untroubled [liber], when 
the soul has either praised or admonished itself.” At first 
glance, the examination to which Seneca subjects himself ap¬ 
pears to constitute a sort of small-scale judicial drama, which 
is clearly evoked by such phrases as “appear before the judge,” 
“give report of my own character,” “plead my cause.” These 
elements seem to indicate the division of the subject into a 
judging authority and an accused individual. But the process 
as a whole also calls to mind a kind of administrative review, 
where it is a matter of evaluating a performed activity in order 
to reactivate its principles and ensure their correct application 
in the future. As much as the role of a judge, it is the activity 
of an inspector that Seneca evokes, or that of a master of a 
household checking his accounts. 

The words employed are significant. Seneca means to “scru¬ 
tinize” the entire day that has just unfolded (the verb ex- 
ecutere, “to shake out,” “to knock so as to make the dust fall,” 
is used to denote the scrutiny by which one locates the errors 
in an account); he intends to “inspect” it, to “remeasure” the 
acts that were committed, the words that were spoken (re-

metiri, as one might do after a piece of work is finished, to see 
if it is up to the standards set for it). The subject’s relation to 
himself in this examination is not established so much in the
