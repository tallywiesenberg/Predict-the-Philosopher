The Care of the Self 


which he also speaks of in another letter: brief training peri¬ 
ods of “fancied poverty” to be done every month and in the 
course of which, by voluntarily placing oneself “within the 
confines of destitution” for three or four days, one experi¬ 
ences a bed of straw, coarse clothing, and bread of the lowest 
quality: “not a game, but a test” (non lusus, sed experimen- 
tum ). 54 One does not deprive oneself for a moment in order 
to sharpen one’s taste for future refinements but to convince 
oneself that the worst misfortune will not deprive one of the 
things one absolutely needs, and that one will always be able 
to tolerate what one is capable of enduring at times. 55 One 
makes oneself familiar with the minimum. This is what 
Seneca wishes to do according to a letter written a short 
time before the Saturnalia of the year 62. Rome is “in a 
sweat” and “licentiousness is officially sanctioned.” Seneca 
asks himself if one ought to take part in the festivities or not; 
it would be proof of one’s self-control if one broke with the 
general attitude and refrained. But one would be acting with 
a still greater moral force if one did not withdraw oneself; 
the best thing would be “to do what the crowd does, but in 
a different way.” And this “different way” is the way that 
one learns ahead of time by means of voluntary exercises, 
periods of abstinence, and poverty treatments. These exer¬ 
cises make it possible to celebrate the festival like everyone 
else but without ever falling into luxuria. Thanks to them, 
one can keep a detached mind in the midst of abundance: 
“We shall be rich with all the more comfort, if we once learn 
how far poverty is from being a burden.” 56 * 
b. In conjunction with these practical tests, it was consid¬ 
ered important to subject oneself to self-examination. This 
custom formed part of Pythagorean teaching, 58 but it had 
become quite widespread. It seems that the morning examina¬ 
tion served mainly as an occasion to consider the tasks and 
obligations of the day, so as to be sufficiently prepared for it. 
The evening examination for its part was devoted much more 

‘Compare: “Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living 
simply is voluntary poverty.’” 7
