form of a judicial relationship in which the accused faces the 
judge; it is more like an act of inspection in which the inspec¬ 
tor aims to evaluate a piece of work, an accomplished task. 
The word speculator (one needs to be a speculator sui) desig¬ 
nates this role exactly. Further, the examination practiced in 
this manner does not focus, as if in imitation of the judicial 
procedure, on “infractions”; and it does not lead to a verdict 
of guilty or to decisions of self-castigation. Seneca, in the 
example he gives here, singles out such actions as arguing too 
intensely with ignorant people, whom one cannot convince in 
any case, or vexing, through reproaches, a friend whom one 
would have liked to help improve. Seneca is dissatisfied with 
these ways of behaving insofar as, in order to achieve the goals 
that one must in fact set for oneself, the means employed were 
not the right ones: it is good to want to correct one’s friends, 
if need be, but reproof is too extreme and gives offense instead 
of helping; it is good to convince those who don’t know, but 
it is necessary first to choose such people as are capable of 
being taught. The purpose of the examination is not therefore 
to discover one’s own guilt, down to its most trifling forms and 
its most tenuous roots. If one “conceals nothing from oneself,” 
if one “omits nothing,” it is in order to commit to memory, 
so as to have them present in one’s mind, legitimate ends, but 
also rules of conduct that enable one to achieve these ends 
through the choice of appropriate means. The fault is not 
reactivated by the examination in order to determine a culpa¬ 
bility or stimulate a feeling of remorse, but in order to 
strengthen, on the basis of the recapitulated and reconsidered 
verification of a failure, the rational equipment that ensures a 
wise behavior. 

c. Added to the foregoing is the necessity of a labor of 
thought with itself as object. This work will have to be more 
than a test for measuring what one is capable of, and some¬ 
thing other than the assessment of a fault in relation to rules

of conduct; it should have the form of a steady screening of 
representations: examining them, monitoring them, sorting 
them out. More than an exercise done at regular intervals, it 
is a constant attitude that one must take toward oneself. To 
characterize this attitude, Epictetus employs metaphors that 
will have a long career in Christian spirituality, but they will 
take on quite different values in it. He asks that one adopt, 
vis-a-vis oneself, the role and posture of a “night watchman” 
who checks the entries at the gate of cities or houses; 60 or 
further, he suggests that one exercise on oneself the functions 
of a “tester of coinage,” an “assayer,” one of those money¬ 
changers who won’t accept any coin without having made 
sure of its worth: “You all see in the matter of coinage ... how 
we have even invented an art, and how many means the tester 
employs to test the coinage—sight, touch, smell, finally hear¬ 
ing: he throws the denarius down and then listens to the sound 
and is not satisfied with the sound it makes on a single test, 
but, as a result of his constant attention to the matter, he 
catches the tune, like a musician.” Unfortunately, Epictetus 
continues, these precautions that we willingly take when it 
is a matter of money, we neglect to take when it is a question 
of our soul. Now the task of philosophy—its principal and 
primary ergon —will be precisely to exercise this control 
(dokimazein ). 61 

In order to formulate what is both a general principle and 
an attitudinal schema, Epictetus refers to Socrates and to the 
aphorism stated in the Apology: “An unexamined life [ anex- 
etastos bios] is not worth living.” 62 In reality, the examination 
Socrates was talking about was the one to which he intended 
to subject both himself and others apropos of ignorance, 
knowledge, and the non-knowledge of this ignorance. The 
examination Epictetus talks about is completely different: it is 
an examination that deals with representations, that aims to 
“test” them, to “distinguish” (diakrinein) one from another 
and thus to prevent one from accepting the “first arrival.” 
“We ought not to accept a mental representation unsubjected 
to examination, but should say, ‘Wait, allow me to see who

you are and whence you came’ (just as the night-watch say, 
‘Show me your tokens’). ‘Do you have your token from na¬ 
ture, the one which every representation which is to be ac¬ 
cepted must have?’ ” 63 However, it should be made clear that 
the control point will not be located in the origin or in the very 
object of the representation, but in the approval that one 
should or should not give to it. When a representation enters 
the mind, the work of discrimination, of diakrisis, will consist 
in applying to it the famous Stoic canon that marks the divi¬
