sion between that which does not depend on us and that which 
does. In the former case, the representations will not be ac¬ 
cepted since they are beyond our understanding; they will be 
rejected as not being appropriate objects of “desire” or “aver¬ 
sion,” of “attraction” or “repulsion.” This inspection is a test 
of power and a guarantee of freedom: a way of always making 
sure that one will not become attached to that which does not 
come under our control. To keep constant watch over one’s 
representations, or to verify their marks the way one authenti¬ 
cates a currency, is not to inquire (as will be done later in 
Christianity) concerning the deep origin of the idea that pre¬ 
sents itself; it is not to try and decipher a meaning hidden 
beneath the visible representation; it is to assess the relation¬ 
ship between oneself and that which is represented, so as to 
accept in the relation to the self only that which can depend 
on the subject’s free and rational choice. 

5. The common goal of these practices of the self, allowing 
for the differences they present, can be characterized by the 
entirely general principle of conversion to self—of epistrophe 
eis heauton. * The expression has a Platonic cast, but it gener¬ 
ally covers meanings that are considerably different. It is to be 
understood first of all as a change of activity: not that one must 
cease all other forms of occupation and devote oneself entirely 
and exclusively to oneself; but in the activities that one ought 
to engage in, one had best keep in mind that the chief objective 

*The expressions epistrophe eis heauton and epistrephein eis heauton appear in Epic- 
tetus. 6 *

one should set for oneself is to be sought within oneself, in the 
relation of oneself to oneself. This conversion implies a shift 
of one’s attention: the latter must not be dissipated in an idle 
curiosity, either that of everyday agitations and of absorption 
in the lives of others (Plutarch devoted a whole treatise to this 
polypragmosyne), or that which seeks to discover the secrets 
of nature furthest removed from human existence and from 
the things that matter for it. (Demetrius, quoted by Seneca, 
held that nature, keeping only useless secrets, had placed 
within reach and in sight of human beings the things it was 
necessary for them to know.) But the conversio ad se is also 
a path by which, escaping all the dependences and enslave¬ 
ments, one ultimately rejoins oneself, like a harbor sheltered 
from the tempests or a citadel protected by its ramparts: “The 
soul stands on unassailable grounds, if it has abandoned exter¬ 
nal things; it is independent in its own fortress; and every 
weapon that is hurled falls short of the mark. Fortune has not 
the long reach with which we credit her; she can seize none 
except him that clings to her. Let us then recoil from her as 
far as we are able.” 65 

This relation to self that constitutes the end of the conver¬ 
sion and the final goal of all the practices of the self still 
belongs to an ethics of control. Yet, in order to characterize 
it, moralists are not content with invoking the agonistic form 
of a victory over forces difficult to subdue and of a dominion 
over them that can be established beyond question. This rela¬ 
tion is often conceived in terms of the juridical model of 
possession: one “belongs to himself,” one is “his own master” 
{suum fieri, suum esse are expressions that recur often in 
Seneca); 66 one is answerable only to oneself, one is sui juris; 
one exercises over oneself an authority that nothing limits or 
threatens; one holds the potestas sui. 61 But apart from this 
rather political and judicial form, the relation to self is also 
defined as a concrete relationship enabling one to delight in 
oneself, as in a thing one both possesses and has before one’s 
eyes. If to convert to oneself is to turn away from the preoccu¬ 
pations of the external world, from the concerns of ambition,

from fear of the future, then one can turn back to one’s own 
past, recall it to mind, have it unfold as one pleases before 
one’s own eyes, and have a relationship with it that nothing 
can disturb: “This is the part of our time that is sacred and 
set apart, put beyond the reach of all human mishaps, and 
removed from the dominion of fortune, the part which is 
disquieted by no want, by no fear, by no attack of disease; this 
can neither be troubled nor snatched away—it is an everlast¬ 
ing and unanxious possession.” 48 And the experience of self 
that forms itself in this possession is not simply that of a force 
overcome, or a rule exercised over a power that is on the point 
of rebelling; it is the experience of a pleasure that one takes 
in oneself. The individual who has finally succeeded in gaining 
access to himself is, for himself, an object of pleasure. Not only 
is one satisfied with what one is and accepting of one’s limits,
