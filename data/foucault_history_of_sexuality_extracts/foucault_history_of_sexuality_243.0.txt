sion between that which does not depend on us and that which 
does. In the former case, the representations will not be ac¬ 
cepted since they are beyond our understanding; they will be 
rejected as not being appropriate objects of “desire” or “aver¬ 
sion,” of “attraction” or “repulsion.” This inspection is a test 
of power and a guarantee of freedom: a way of always making 
sure that one will not become attached to that which does not 
come under our control. To keep constant watch over one’s 
representations, or to verify their marks the way one authenti¬ 
cates a currency, is not to inquire (as will be done later in 
Christianity) concerning the deep origin of the idea that pre¬ 
sents itself; it is not to try and decipher a meaning hidden 
beneath the visible representation; it is to assess the relation¬ 
ship between oneself and that which is represented, so as to 
accept in the relation to the self only that which can depend 
on the subject’s free and rational choice. 

5. The common goal of these practices of the self, allowing 
for the differences they present, can be characterized by the 
entirely general principle of conversion to self—of epistrophe 
eis heauton. * The expression has a Platonic cast, but it gener¬ 
ally covers meanings that are considerably different. It is to be 
understood first of all as a change of activity: not that one must 
cease all other forms of occupation and devote oneself entirely 
and exclusively to oneself; but in the activities that one ought 
to engage in, one had best keep in mind that the chief objective

one should set for oneself is to be sought within oneself, in the 
relation of oneself to oneself. This conversion implies a shift 
of one’s attention: the latter must not be dissipated in an idle 
curiosity, either that of everyday agitations and of absorption 
in the lives of others (Plutarch devoted a whole treatise to this 
polypragmosyne), or that which seeks to discover the secrets 
of nature furthest removed from human existence and from 
the things that matter for it. (Demetrius, quoted by Seneca, 
held that nature, keeping only useless secrets, had placed 
within reach and in sight of human beings the things it was 
necessary for them to know.) But the conversio ad se is also 
a path by which, escaping all the dependences and enslave¬
