but one “pleases oneself.” 69 This pleasure, for which Seneca 
usually employs the word gaudium or laetitia, is a state that 
is neither accompanied nor followed by any form of distur¬ 
bance in the body or the mind. It is defined by the fact of not 
being caused by anything that is independent of ourselves and 
therefore escapes our control. It arises out of ourselves and 
within ourselves. 70 It is characterized as well by the fact that 
it knows neither degree nor change, but is given as a “woven 
fabric,” and once given no external event can rend it. 71 This 
sort of pleasure can thus be contrasted point by point with 
what is meant by the term voluptas. The latter denotes a 
pleasure whose origin is to be placed outside us and in objects 
whose presence we cannot be sure of: a pleasure, therefore, 
which is precarious in itself, undermined by the fear of loss, 
and to which we are drawn by the force of a desire that may 
or may not find satisfaction. In place of this kind of violent, 
uncertain, and conditional pleasure, access to self is capable 
of providing a form of pleasure that comes, in serenity and 
without fail, of the experience of oneself. “Disce gaudere, learn 
how to feel joy,” says Seneca to Lucilius: “I do not wish you 
ever to be deprived of gladness. I would have it born in your 
house; and it is born there, if only it is inside of you ... for 



The Cultivation of the Self

it will never fail you when once you have found its source 
. . . look toward the true good, and rejoice only in that which 
comes from your own store [de tuo ]. But what do I mean by 
‘your own store’? I mean your very self and the best part of 
you.” 72 

It was against the background of this cultivation of the self, 
of its themes and practices, that reflection on the ethics of 
pleasure developed in the first centuries of our era. It is in that 
direction that one must look in order to understand the trans¬ 
formations that may have affected that ethics. What may be 
regarded, at first sight, as a more pronounced severity, an 
increased austerity, stricter requirements, should not in fact be 
interpreted as a tightening of interdictions. The domain of 
behaviors that might be forbidden did not expand to any 
appreciable extent, and there was no attempt to organize sys¬ 
tems of prohibition that would be more authoritarian and 
efficacious. The change had much more to do with the manner 
in which the individual needed to form himself as an ethical
