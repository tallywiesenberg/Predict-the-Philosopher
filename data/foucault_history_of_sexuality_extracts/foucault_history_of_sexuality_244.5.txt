subject. The development of the cultivation of the self pro¬ 
duced its effect not in the strengthening of that which can 
thwart desire, but in certain modifications relating to the 
formative elements of ethical subjectivity. A break with the 
traditional ethics of self-mastery? Clearly not, but rather a 
shift, a change of orientation, a difference in emphasis. 

Sexual pleasure as an ethical substance continues to be gov¬ 
erned by relations of force—the force against which one must 
struggle and over which the subject is expected to establish his 
domination. But in this game of violence, excess, rebellion, 
and combat, the accent is placed more and more readily on the 
weakness of the individual, on his frailty, on his need to flee, 
to escape, to protect and shelter himself. Sexual ethics re¬ 
quires, still and always, that the individual conform to a cer¬ 
tain art of living which defines the aesthetic and ethical criteria 
of existence. But this art refers more and more to universal 
principles of nature or reason, which everyone must observe 
in the same way, whatever their social status. As for the

too undergoes, in the cultivation of the self, a certain modifica¬

constitute the required askesis, the place allotted to self- 
knowledge becomes more important. The task of testing one¬ 
self, examining oneself, monitoring oneself in a series of 
clearly defined exercises, makes the question of truth—the 
truth concerning what one is, what one does, and what one is 
capable of doing—central to the formation of the ethical sub¬ 
ject. Lastly, the end result of this elaboration is still and always 
defined by the rule of the individual over himself. But this rule 
broadens into an experience in which the relation to self takes 
the form not only of a domination but also of an enjoyment 
without desire and without disturbance. 

One is still far from an experience of sexual pleasure where 
the latter will be associated with evil, where behavior will have 
to submit to the universal form of law, and where the deci¬ 
phering of desire will be a necessary condition for acceding to 
a purified existence. Yet one can already see how the question 
of evil begins to work upon the ancient theme of force, how 
the question of law begins to modify the theme of art and
