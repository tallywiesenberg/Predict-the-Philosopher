techne, and how the question of truth and the principle of 
self-knowledge evolve within the ascetic practices. But we 
need first to try to discover in what context and for what 
reasons the cultivation of the self developed in this way, pre¬ 
cisely in the form that we have just considered. 



PART THREE 

Self and Others 




The work of historians suggests several reasons for this 
development of the cultivation of the self and for the concur¬ 
rent modulation in the ethics of pleasure. Two factors seem 
especially important: changes in marital practice and modifi¬ 
cations in the rules of the political game. In this brief section, 
I shall simply review some aspects of these two themes, bor¬ 
rowing from previous historical research, and outline a tenta¬ 
tive general hypothesis. Is it not the case that the new 
importance of marriage and the couple, together with a certain 
redistribution in political roles, gave rise, in what was essen¬ 
tially a male ethics, to a new problematization of the relation 
to the self? These developments may very well have occa¬ 
sioned, not a withdrawal into the self, but a new way of 
conceiving oneself in one’s relation to one’s wife, to others, to 
events, and to civic and political activities—and a different 
way of considering oneself as the subject of one’s pleasures. 
Hence the cultivation of the self would not be the necessary 
“consequence” of these social modifications; it would not be 
their expression in the sphere of ideology; rather, it would 
constitute an original response to them, in the form of a new 
stylistics of existence.

It is difficult to determine, for the different regions and the 
different social strata, the actual extent of marital practice in
