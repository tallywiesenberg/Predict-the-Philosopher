techne, and how the question of truth and the principle of 
self-knowledge evolve within the ascetic practices. But we 
need first to try to discover in what context and for what 
reasons the cultivation of the self developed in this way, pre¬ 
cisely in the form that we have just considered. 



PART THREE 

Self and Others 




The work of historians suggests several reasons for this 
development of the cultivation of the self and for the concur¬ 
rent modulation in the ethics of pleasure. Two factors seem 
especially important: changes in marital practice and modifi¬ 
cations in the rules of the political game. In this brief section, 
I shall simply review some aspects of these two themes, bor¬ 
rowing from previous historical research, and outline a tenta¬ 
tive general hypothesis. Is it not the case that the new 
importance of marriage and the couple, together with a certain 
redistribution in political roles, gave rise, in what was essen¬ 
tially a male ethics, to a new problematization of the relation 
to the self? These developments may very well have occa¬ 
sioned, not a withdrawal into the self, but a new way of 
conceiving oneself in one’s relation to one’s wife, to others, to 
events, and to civic and political activities—and a different 
way of considering oneself as the subject of one’s pleasures. 
Hence the cultivation of the self would not be the necessary 
“consequence” of these social modifications; it would not be 
their expression in the sphere of ideology; rather, it would 
constitute an original response to them, in the form of a new 
stylistics of existence.

The Marital Role 


It is difficult to determine, for the different regions and the 
different social strata, the actual extent of marital practice in 
Hellenistic or Roman civilization. Historians have been able, 
however, to identify—where the documentation makes this 
possible—certain transformations affecting either the insti¬ 
tutional forms, the organization of conjugal relationships, 
or the meaning and moral value that could be given to the 
latter. 

The institutional perspective first of all. As a private act, a 
matter for the family to decide, coming under its authority, 
under the rules it followed and recognized as its own, marriage 
did not call for intervention by public powers, either in Greece 
or in Rome. In Greece, it was a practice “designed to ensure 
the continued existence of the oikos. ” Of its two basic and vital 
acts, the first marked the transfer to the husband of the tute¬ 
lage exercised up to that moment by the father, and the second 
marked the actual handing over of the bride to her marriage 
partner . 1 It thus constituted “a private transaction, a piece of 
business concluded between two heads of family, the one ac¬ 
tual, the girl’s father, the other virtual, the husband-to-be.” 
This private affair was “unconnected with the political and 
social organization .” 2 The same was true of Roman marriage. 
J. A. Crook and Paul Veyne point out that it was originally 
only a de facto condition “dependent on the intention of the

parties,” “marked by a ceremony,” and “producing legal 
effects,” but without being “a juridical act.” 3 

In the Hellenistic world, marriage gradually made a place 
for itself within the public sphere. It thus overstepped the 
bounds of the family, with the paradoxical result that the 
authority of the latter found itself “publicly” sanctioned but 
also relatively limited. In Claude Vatin’s view, this evolution 
was aided by recourse to religious ceremonies, which served 
as a kind of intermediary between the private and the public 
institution. Summing up this transformation, whose results 
can be observed in the second and first centuries b.c., he 
writes: “It is clear that marriage has now gone beyond the 
limits of the familial institutions, and Alexandrian religious 
marriage, which is perhaps a vestige of the ancient religious 
marriage, is also a civic institution. It is always the entire city
