Hellenistic or Roman civilization. Historians have been able, 
however, to identify—where the documentation makes this 
possible—certain transformations affecting either the insti¬ 
tutional forms, the organization of conjugal relationships, 
or the meaning and moral value that could be given to the 
latter. 

The institutional perspective first of all. As a private act, a 
matter for the family to decide, coming under its authority, 
under the rules it followed and recognized as its own, marriage 
did not call for intervention by public powers, either in Greece 
or in Rome. In Greece, it was a practice “designed to ensure 
the continued existence of the oikos. ” Of its two basic and vital 
acts, the first marked the transfer to the husband of the tute¬ 
lage exercised up to that moment by the father, and the second 
marked the actual handing over of the bride to her marriage 
partner . 1 It thus constituted “a private transaction, a piece of 
business concluded between two heads of family, the one ac¬ 
tual, the girl’s father, the other virtual, the husband-to-be.” 
This private affair was “unconnected with the political and 
social organization .” 2 The same was true of Roman marriage. 
J. A. Crook and Paul Veyne point out that it was originally 
only a de facto condition “dependent on the intention of the

parties,” “marked by a ceremony,” and “producing legal 
effects,” but without being “a juridical act.” 3 

In the Hellenistic world, marriage gradually made a place 
for itself within the public sphere. It thus overstepped the 
bounds of the family, with the paradoxical result that the 
authority of the latter found itself “publicly” sanctioned but 
also relatively limited. In Claude Vatin’s view, this evolution 
was aided by recourse to religious ceremonies, which served 
as a kind of intermediary between the private and the public 
institution. Summing up this transformation, whose results 
can be observed in the second and first centuries b.c., he 
writes: “It is clear that marriage has now gone beyond the 
limits of the familial institutions, and Alexandrian religious 
marriage, which is perhaps a vestige of the ancient religious 
marriage, is also a civic institution. It is always the entire city
