that sanctions marriage, whether this is through an official or 
a priest.” And comparing the data for the city of Alexandria 
with the data for rural society, he adds: “One sees in the 
chord and in the capital a rapid evolution, with variants, from 
a private into a public institution.” 4 

In Rome, one notes an evolution that is of the same general 
type, although it takes different paths and although marriage 
continues, until quite late, to be essentially “a private cere¬ 
mony, a celebration.” 5 A set of legislative measures marks 
little by little the hold of public authority on the marriage 
institution. The famous law de adulteriis is one of the manife¬ 
stations of this phenomenon. A manifestation all the more 
interesting because in condemning for adultery the married 
woman who has sexual intercourse with another man and the 
man who has intercourse with a married woman (and not the 
married man who has relations with an unmarried woman), 
this law offers nothing new in the way of legal definition of 
acts. It reproduces precisely the traditional schemas of ethical 
valuation, merely transferring to public power a sanction 
previously under familial authority. 

This gradual “publicizing” of marriage accompanies many 
other transformations, of which it is at once the effect, the

relay, and the instrument. It appears, to the extent that the 
documents allow us to form a judgment, that the practice of 
marriage, or regular concubinage, became general or at least 
widespread in the dominant strata of the population. In its 
ancient form, marriage held no interest, had no reason for 
being, except insofar as, although a private act, it had legal 
effects or at least effects relative to status: handing down a 
name, instituting heirs, organizing a system of alliances, join¬ 
ing fortunes. This meant something only to those who were 
capable of developing strategies in such domains. As Paul 
Veyne says: “In pagan society, everyone did not marry, far 
from it. . . . Marriage, when one did marry, corresponded to 
a private objective: to transmit the estate to one’s descendants, 
rather than to other members of the family or to the sons of 
friends; and it corresponded to a politics of castes: to perpetu¬ 
ate the caste of citizens.” 6 As John Boswell puts it, this was 
a kind of marriage which “for the upper classes was largely 
dynastic, political, and economic.” 7 As for the lower classes, 
as little informed as we are concerning their marital practice, 
we may suppose with S. B. Pomeroy that two contradictory 
factors were able to play a part, both of which were connected 
with the economic functions of marriage: the wife and chil¬ 
dren could form a useful source of labor for a free man who 
was poor. On the other hand, “there is an economic level below 
which a man may not hope to support a wife and family.” 8 

The economico-political imperatives that governed mar¬ 
riage (making it necessary in some cases, and in others, use¬ 
less) must have lost some of their importance when, in the 
privileged classes, status and fortune came to depend on prox¬ 
imity to the prince, on a civil or military “career,” on success 
in “business,” more than simply on the alliance between fam¬ 
ily groups. Less encumbered with various strategies, marriage 
became “freer”: free in the choice of a wife; free, too, in the 
decision to marry and in the personal reasons for doing so. It 
could be, too, that in the underprivileged classes, marriage 
became—beyond the economic motives that could make it 
attractive—a form of tie that owed its value to the fact that

it established and maintained strong personal relationships, 
implying the sharing of life, mutual aid, and moral support. 
In any case, the study of tomb inscriptions has been able to 
show the relative frequency and stability of marriages in mi¬ 
lieus that were not those of the aristocracy, 9 and we have 
statements attesting to the marriage of slaves. 10 Whatever re¬ 
sponse is given to the question of the extent of marital practice, 
it seems that the latter became more accessible; the thresholds 
that made it “interesting” were lowered. 

Hence marriage appeared more and more as a voluntary 
union between two partners whose inequality diminished to a 
certain extent but did not cease to exist. It does seem that in 
the Hellenistic world, and taking many local differences into 
account, the wife’s status gained in independence compared 
with what it was in the classical period—and above all com¬ 
pared with the Athenian situation. This relative modification 
was due first of all to the fact that the position of the citizen- 
husband lost some of its political importance. It was also due 
to a strengthening of the role of the wife—of her economic role
