that sanctions marriage, whether this is through an official or 
a priest.” And comparing the data for the city of Alexandria 
with the data for rural society, he adds: “One sees in the 
chord and in the capital a rapid evolution, with variants, from 
a private into a public institution.” 4 

In Rome, one notes an evolution that is of the same general 
type, although it takes different paths and although marriage 
continues, until quite late, to be essentially “a private cere¬ 
mony, a celebration.” 5 A set of legislative measures marks 
little by little the hold of public authority on the marriage 
institution. The famous law de adulteriis is one of the manife¬ 
stations of this phenomenon. A manifestation all the more 
interesting because in condemning for adultery the married 
woman who has sexual intercourse with another man and the 
man who has intercourse with a married woman (and not the 
married man who has relations with an unmarried woman), 
this law offers nothing new in the way of legal definition of 
acts. It reproduces precisely the traditional schemas of ethical 
valuation, merely transferring to public power a sanction 
previously under familial authority. 

This gradual “publicizing” of marriage accompanies many 
other transformations, of which it is at once the effect, the

relay, and the instrument. It appears, to the extent that the 
documents allow us to form a judgment, that the practice of 
marriage, or regular concubinage, became general or at least 
widespread in the dominant strata of the population. In its 
ancient form, marriage held no interest, had no reason for 
being, except insofar as, although a private act, it had legal 
effects or at least effects relative to status: handing down a 
name, instituting heirs, organizing a system of alliances, join¬ 
ing fortunes. This meant something only to those who were 
capable of developing strategies in such domains. As Paul 
Veyne says: “In pagan society, everyone did not marry, far 
from it. . . . Marriage, when one did marry, corresponded to 
a private objective: to transmit the estate to one’s descendants, 
rather than to other members of the family or to the sons of 
friends; and it corresponded to a politics of castes: to perpetu¬ 
ate the caste of citizens.” 6 As John Boswell puts it, this was 
a kind of marriage which “for the upper classes was largely
