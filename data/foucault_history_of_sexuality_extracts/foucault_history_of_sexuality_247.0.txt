and her juridical independence. According to some historians, 
the documents show that the intervention of the wife’s father 
became less and less decisive in marriage. “It was common for 
a father to give a daughter in marriage in his role of formal 
guardian, but some contracts were made simply between a 
woman and a man agreeing to share a common life. The right 
of the married daughter to self-determination against paternal 
authority began to be asserted. According to Athenian, Roman 
and Egyptian law, the authority of the father over a married 
daughter was curtailed by judicial rulings stating that the 
wishes of the woman were the determining factor. If she 
wished to remain married, she could do so.” 11 Marriage was 
concluded more and more clearly as a voluntary agreement 
entered into by the partners, who pledged themselves person¬ 
ally. The ekdosis by which the young woman was ceremoni¬ 
ously handed over to the husband by the father or guardian 
“tended to disappear,” and the contract that traditionally 
accompanied it, which was basically financial in character,

ended up existing only in the case of written marriages, where 
it was supplemented by clauses relating to the persons. Not 
only did women receive their dowry, which they disposed of 
more and more freely within marriage, with certain contracts 
providing for restitution to them in case of divorce, but they 
also collected their share of inheritance. 

As for the obligations marriage contracts imposed on hus¬ 
bands, Claude Vatin’s study shows a significant evolution for 
Hellenistic Egypt. In documents dating from the end of the 
fourth century b.c. or from the third, the wife’s pledges im¬ 
plied obedience to the husband; prohibition from leaving the 
house, day or night, without the husband’s permission; exclu¬ 
sion of any sexual relations with another man; and the obliga¬ 
tion not to ruin the household and not to dishonor her 
husband. The latter in turn must support his wife, must not 
establish a concubine in the house, must not mistreat his wife, 
and must not have children from relationships he might main¬ 
tain on the outside. Later, the contracts studied specify much 
stricter obligations on the part of the husband. The obligation 
to provide for the needs of his wife is stipulated; but it is also 
expressly forbidden for him to have a mistress or sweetheart, 
and to own another house (in which he might maintain a 
concubine). As Vatin notes, in this type of contract “it is the 
sexual liberty of the husband that is in question; the woman 
will now be just as exclusive as the man.” Developed in this 
way, marriage contracts bring the husband and the wife into 
a system of duties or obligations that are not equal, certainly, 
but are shared. And this sharing occurs not in the name of the 
respect due to the family, which each of the two marriage 
partners represents, as it were, in the state of marriage, but on 
behalf of the couple, its stability and its internal regulation. 12 

Such explicitly affirmed obligations demanded and revealed 
forms of conjugal life that were much more closely defined 
than in the past. The prescriptions could not have been formu¬ 
lated in the contracts if they did not already correspond to a 
new attitude; and at the same time they must have carried 
such weight for each of the marriage partners that they im-

pressed on their life, much more clearly than in the past, the 
reality of the couple. The institutionalization of marriage 
based on mutual consent, says Vatin, “engendered the idea 
that there existed a conjugal community and that this reality, 
constituted by the couple, had a value greater than that of its 
component parts .” 13 Paul Veyne has called attention to a 
somewhat analogous evolution in Roman society: “Under the 
Republic, both spouses had a specific role to play and beyond 
the satisfactory performance of this role affective relations 
between husband and wife were whatever they happened to 
be. . . . Under the Empire . . . the very functioning of the 
marriage was supposed to depend on mutual understanding 
and the law of the heart. In this way a new idea came into 
being: the couple composed of the master and mistress of the 
house .” 14 

So there were many paradoxes in the evolution of this mari¬ 
tal practice. It looked to public authority for its guarantees; 
and it became an increasingly important concern in private 
life. It threw off the economic and social purposes that had 
invested it with value; and at the same time it became a general 
practice. It became more and more restrictive for spouses, and 
gave rise at the same time to attitudes that were more and 
more favorable—as if the more it demanded, the more attrac¬ 
tive it became. It appears that marriage became more general
