and her juridical independence. According to some historians, 
the documents show that the intervention of the wife’s father 
became less and less decisive in marriage. “It was common for 
a father to give a daughter in marriage in his role of formal 
guardian, but some contracts were made simply between a 
woman and a man agreeing to share a common life. The right 
of the married daughter to self-determination against paternal 
authority began to be asserted. According to Athenian, Roman 
and Egyptian law, the authority of the father over a married 
daughter was curtailed by judicial rulings stating that the 
wishes of the woman were the determining factor. If she 
wished to remain married, she could do so.” 11 Marriage was 
concluded more and more clearly as a voluntary agreement 
entered into by the partners, who pledged themselves person¬ 
ally. The ekdosis by which the young woman was ceremoni¬ 
ously handed over to the husband by the father or guardian 
“tended to disappear,” and the contract that traditionally 
accompanied it, which was basically financial in character,

ended up existing only in the case of written marriages, where 
it was supplemented by clauses relating to the persons. Not 
only did women receive their dowry, which they disposed of 
more and more freely within marriage, with certain contracts 
providing for restitution to them in case of divorce, but they 
also collected their share of inheritance. 

As for the obligations marriage contracts imposed on hus¬ 
bands, Claude Vatin’s study shows a significant evolution for 
Hellenistic Egypt. In documents dating from the end of the 
fourth century b.c. or from the third, the wife’s pledges im¬ 
plied obedience to the husband; prohibition from leaving the 
house, day or night, without the husband’s permission; exclu¬ 
sion of any sexual relations with another man; and the obliga¬ 
tion not to ruin the household and not to dishonor her 
husband. The latter in turn must support his wife, must not 
establish a concubine in the house, must not mistreat his wife, 
and must not have children from relationships he might main¬ 
tain on the outside. Later, the contracts studied specify much 
stricter obligations on the part of the husband. The obligation 
to provide for the needs of his wife is stipulated; but it is also 
expressly forbidden for him to have a mistress or sweetheart, 
and to own another house (in which he might maintain a
