concubine). As Vatin notes, in this type of contract “it is the 
sexual liberty of the husband that is in question; the woman 
will now be just as exclusive as the man.” Developed in this 
way, marriage contracts bring the husband and the wife into 
a system of duties or obligations that are not equal, certainly, 
but are shared. And this sharing occurs not in the name of the 
respect due to the family, which each of the two marriage 
partners represents, as it were, in the state of marriage, but on 
behalf of the couple, its stability and its internal regulation. 12 

Such explicitly affirmed obligations demanded and revealed 
forms of conjugal life that were much more closely defined 
than in the past. The prescriptions could not have been formu¬ 
lated in the contracts if they did not already correspond to a 
new attitude; and at the same time they must have carried 
such weight for each of the marriage partners that they im-

pressed on their life, much more clearly than in the past, the 
reality of the couple. The institutionalization of marriage 
based on mutual consent, says Vatin, “engendered the idea 
that there existed a conjugal community and that this reality, 
constituted by the couple, had a value greater than that of its 
component parts .” 13 Paul Veyne has called attention to a 
somewhat analogous evolution in Roman society: “Under the 
Republic, both spouses had a specific role to play and beyond 
the satisfactory performance of this role affective relations 
between husband and wife were whatever they happened to 
be. . . . Under the Empire . . . the very functioning of the 
marriage was supposed to depend on mutual understanding 
and the law of the heart. In this way a new idea came into 
being: the couple composed of the master and mistress of the 
house .” 14 

So there were many paradoxes in the evolution of this mari¬ 
tal practice. It looked to public authority for its guarantees; 
and it became an increasingly important concern in private 
life. It threw off the economic and social purposes that had 
invested it with value; and at the same time it became a general 
practice. It became more and more restrictive for spouses, and 
gave rise at the same time to attitudes that were more and 
more favorable—as if the more it demanded, the more attrac¬ 
tive it became. It appears that marriage became more general
