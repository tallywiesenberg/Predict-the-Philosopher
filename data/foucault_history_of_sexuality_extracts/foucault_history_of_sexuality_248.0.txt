as a practice, more public as an institution, more private as a 
mode of existence—a stronger force for binding conjugal part¬ 
ners and hence a more effective one for isolating the couple in 
a field of other social relations. 

Obviously it is difficult to measure accurately the scope of 
this phenomenon. The available documentation covers only a 
few privileged geographic areas, and it throws light only on 
certain strata of the population. It would be speculation to 
make it into a universal and massive movement, even though, 
notwithstanding their lacunary and scattered character, the 
indications are rather convergent. In any case, if we are to give 
credence to the other texts from the first centuries of our era, 
marriage appears to have become—for men, that is, since we

have only their testimony—a focus of experiences that were 
more important, more intense, but also more difficult and 
more problematic. And by marriage what is meant is not just 
the institution that is useful to the family or the city, or the 
domestic activity that is carried out in the context and accord¬ 
ing to the rules of a good household, but also the “state” of 
marriage as a form of living, a shared existence, a personal 
bond, and a respective position of the partners in this relation¬ 
ship. It is not, as we have seen, that matrimonial life according 
to the old schema excluded closeness and feeling between 
spouses. But it does seem that in the ideal set forth by Xeno¬ 
phon these feelings were tied directly (which did not rule out 
serious commitment or intensity) to the exercise of the hus¬ 
band’s status and to the authority granted to him. Rather 
paternal toward his young wife, Ischomachus patiently taught 
her what she had to do; and to the degree that she performed 
well in the role that went with her duties as mistress of the 
household, he had a respect and an affection for her that 
would not diminish to the end of their days. In the literature 
of the imperial epoch, one finds testimonies to a far more 
complex experience of marriage; and the search for an ethics 
of “conjugal honor” is clearly manifested in the reflection on 
the role of the husband, on the nature and form of the bond 
that attached him to his wife, on the interplay between a 
superiority at once natural and statutory and an affection that 
could extend to the point of need and dependence. 

It might be useful, then, to look at the image that Pliny, in 
certain of his letters, gives of himself as a “conjugal individ¬ 
ual,” and compare it with the portrait of that other good 
husband, Ischomachus. Thus, in the famous letter he ad¬ 
dresses to his wife bemoaning her absence, what is shown is 
not simply, as in other letters, a man who calls his admiring 
and docile spouse to witness his literary labors and his suc¬ 
cesses as a tribune; it is a man who feels an intense attachment 
to his wife and a physical desire so strong that he cannot keep 
from looking for her night and day even though she is no 
longer there: “You cannot believe how much I miss you. I love

you so much, and we are not used to separations. So I stay 
awake most of the night thinking of you, and by day I find my 
feet carrying me (a true word, carrying) to your room at the 
times I usually visited you; then finding it empty I depart, as 
sick and sorrowful as a lover locked out. The only time I am 
free of this misery is when I am in court and wearing myself 
out with my friends’ lawsuits. You can judge then what a life 
I am leading, when I find my rest in work and distraction in 
troubles and anxiety .” 15 The formulas of this letter merit our 
attention. The specific character of a personal, intense, and 
affective conjugal relationship, which does not depend on sta¬ 
tus, marital authority, or household responsibility, is clearly 
evident. Love is carefully differentiated from the habitual 
sharing of existence, even if both rightfully contribute to mak¬ 
ing the presence of the wife precious and her absence painful. 
Moreover, Pliny avails himself of several of the traditionally 
acknowledged signs of amorous passion: the images that 
haunt the night, the involuntary comings and goings, the 
search for the lost object. Now, these behaviors that belong to 
the classic and negative image of passion are presented in a 
positive light; or rather, the husband’s suffering, the passion¬ 
ate movement in which he is taken up, the fact that he is ruled 
by his desire and his sorrow are offered as positive tokens of 
conjugal affection. Finally, between matrimonial life and pub¬ 
lic activity, Pliny suggests, not a common principle unifying 
the government of the household and authority over others, 
but a complex process of substitution and compensation: fail¬ 
ing to find at home the happiness that his wife provided him, 
he immerses himself in public affairs. But the hurt he feels 
must be extreme for him to find comfort for his private sor¬
