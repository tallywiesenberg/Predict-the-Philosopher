as a practice, more public as an institution, more private as a 
mode of existence—a stronger force for binding conjugal part¬ 
ners and hence a more effective one for isolating the couple in 
a field of other social relations. 

Obviously it is difficult to measure accurately the scope of 
this phenomenon. The available documentation covers only a 
few privileged geographic areas, and it throws light only on 
certain strata of the population. It would be speculation to 
make it into a universal and massive movement, even though, 
notwithstanding their lacunary and scattered character, the 
indications are rather convergent. In any case, if we are to give 
credence to the other texts from the first centuries of our era, 
marriage appears to have become—for men, that is, since we

have only their testimony—a focus of experiences that were 
more important, more intense, but also more difficult and 
more problematic. And by marriage what is meant is not just 
the institution that is useful to the family or the city, or the 
domestic activity that is carried out in the context and accord¬ 
ing to the rules of a good household, but also the “state” of 
marriage as a form of living, a shared existence, a personal 
bond, and a respective position of the partners in this relation¬ 
ship. It is not, as we have seen, that matrimonial life according 
to the old schema excluded closeness and feeling between 
spouses. But it does seem that in the ideal set forth by Xeno¬ 
phon these feelings were tied directly (which did not rule out 
serious commitment or intensity) to the exercise of the hus¬ 
band’s status and to the authority granted to him. Rather 
paternal toward his young wife, Ischomachus patiently taught 
her what she had to do; and to the degree that she performed 
well in the role that went with her duties as mistress of the 
household, he had a respect and an affection for her that 
would not diminish to the end of their days. In the literature 
of the imperial epoch, one finds testimonies to a far more 
complex experience of marriage; and the search for an ethics 
of “conjugal honor” is clearly manifested in the reflection on 
the role of the husband, on the nature and form of the bond 
that attached him to his wife, on the interplay between a 
superiority at once natural and statutory and an affection that 
could extend to the point of need and dependence.
