It might be useful, then, to look at the image that Pliny, in 
certain of his letters, gives of himself as a “conjugal individ¬ 
ual,” and compare it with the portrait of that other good 
husband, Ischomachus. Thus, in the famous letter he ad¬ 
dresses to his wife bemoaning her absence, what is shown is 
not simply, as in other letters, a man who calls his admiring 
and docile spouse to witness his literary labors and his suc¬ 
cesses as a tribune; it is a man who feels an intense attachment 
to his wife and a physical desire so strong that he cannot keep 
from looking for her night and day even though she is no 
longer there: “You cannot believe how much I miss you. I love

you so much, and we are not used to separations. So I stay 
awake most of the night thinking of you, and by day I find my 
feet carrying me (a true word, carrying) to your room at the 
times I usually visited you; then finding it empty I depart, as 
sick and sorrowful as a lover locked out. The only time I am 
free of this misery is when I am in court and wearing myself 
out with my friends’ lawsuits. You can judge then what a life 
I am leading, when I find my rest in work and distraction in 
troubles and anxiety .” 15 The formulas of this letter merit our 
attention. The specific character of a personal, intense, and 
affective conjugal relationship, which does not depend on sta¬ 
tus, marital authority, or household responsibility, is clearly 
evident. Love is carefully differentiated from the habitual 
sharing of existence, even if both rightfully contribute to mak¬ 
ing the presence of the wife precious and her absence painful. 
Moreover, Pliny avails himself of several of the traditionally 
acknowledged signs of amorous passion: the images that 
haunt the night, the involuntary comings and goings, the 
search for the lost object. Now, these behaviors that belong to 
the classic and negative image of passion are presented in a 
positive light; or rather, the husband’s suffering, the passion¬ 
ate movement in which he is taken up, the fact that he is ruled 
by his desire and his sorrow are offered as positive tokens of 
conjugal affection. Finally, between matrimonial life and pub¬ 
lic activity, Pliny suggests, not a common principle unifying 
the government of the household and authority over others, 
but a complex process of substitution and compensation: fail¬ 
ing to find at home the happiness that his wife provided him, 
he immerses himself in public affairs. But the hurt he feels 
must be extreme for him to find comfort for his private sor¬
