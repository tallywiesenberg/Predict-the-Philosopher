rows in the worries of this external life. 

In many other texts as well, one sees the relation between 
husband and wife detach itself from matrimonial functions, 
from the status-determined authority of the husband and the 
reasonable government of the household, and take on the 
character of a singular relation having its own force, its own 
difficulties, obligations, benefits, and pleasures. One could cite

The Care of the Self 


other letters of Pliny and point to other indications of this in 
Lucian or Tacitus. One could also refer to the conjugal love 
poetry that is exemplified in Statius. There the state of mar¬ 
riage appears as the merging of two destinies in an undying 
passion wherein the husband recognizes his emotional bond¬ 
age: “For it is you—you, whom Venus of her grace united to 
me in the springtime of my days, and in old age keeps mine; 
you, who while I yet roved in youth nor knew nothing of love 
did transfix my heart. You it is whose rein in willing submis¬ 
sion [libens et docilis] I obeyed, and yet press the bit once put 
within my mouth, without ever thought of change. . . . This 
land bore me for you [creavit me tibi ], and bound me to you 
in partnership forever .” 16 

Of course it is not in texts like these that one should look 
for a representation of what matrimonial life may have really 
been like in the period of the Empire. The sincerity they 
display does not have the value of evidence. They are texts that 
go out of their way to proclaim an ideal of conjugality. They 
should be taken not as the reflection of a situation, but as the 
formulation of an exigency, and it is precisely on this account 
that they form part of reality. They show that marriage was 
interrogated as a mode of life whose value was not exclusively, 
nor perhaps even essentially, linked to the functioning of the 
oikos, but rather to a mode of relation between two partners. 
They also show that, in this linkage, the man had to regulate 
his conduct, not simply by virtue of status, privileges, and 
domestic functions, but also by virtue of a “relational role” 
with regard to his wife. Finally, they show not only that this 
role was a governmental function of training, education, and 
guidance, but that it was involved in a complex interplay of 
affective reciprocity and reciprocal dependence. Now, while it 
is true that moral reflection on proper conduct in marriage 
had long sought its principles in an analysis of the “house¬ 
hold” and its intrinsic necessities, one sees how a new type of 
problem emerged, where it was a matter of defining the way 
in which the husband would be able to form himself as an 
ethical subject within the relation of conjugality.

The Political 
Game 


The decline of city-states as autonomous entities starting in 
the third century B.c. is a well-known fact. It is often seen as 
evidence of a general withdrawal from political life in a place 
where civic activities had constituted for citizens a true voca¬ 
tion. It is given as the reason for the decadence of the tradi¬ 
tionally dominant classes. And its consequences are sought in 
a movement of retreat into the self by which the representa¬ 
tives of these privileged groups would have transformed this 
real loss of authority into a voluntary retirement, attributing 
in this way more and more value to personal existence and 
private life. “The collapse of the city-state was inescapable. On 
the whole, people felt themselves in the grip of world powers 
which they could not control or even affect. . . . Chance ruled. 
. . . The philosophies of the Hellenistic Age, for all their 
nobility, were essentially philosophies of escape, and the prin¬ 
cipal means of escape lay in the cultivation of autarky .” 1 

While the city-states—where they existed—did lose, from 
the third century on, a portion of their autonomy, it would 
clearly be questionable to reduce the structural transforma¬ 
tions that took place in the political domain, during the Helle¬ 
nistic and Roman epochs, essentially to that phenomenon. It 
would also be inadequate to search there for the main explana¬ 
tory principle behind the changes that occurred in moral re¬ 
flection and in the practice of the self. In actual fact—and on 
this point one must refer to the work of historians who have
