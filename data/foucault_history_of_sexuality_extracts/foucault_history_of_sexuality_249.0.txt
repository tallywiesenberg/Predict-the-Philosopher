rows in the worries of this external life. 

In many other texts as well, one sees the relation between 
husband and wife detach itself from matrimonial functions, 
from the status-determined authority of the husband and the 
reasonable government of the household, and take on the 
character of a singular relation having its own force, its own 
difficulties, obligations, benefits, and pleasures. One could cite

other letters of Pliny and point to other indications of this in 
Lucian or Tacitus. One could also refer to the conjugal love 
poetry that is exemplified in Statius. There the state of mar¬ 
riage appears as the merging of two destinies in an undying 
passion wherein the husband recognizes his emotional bond¬ 
age: “For it is you—you, whom Venus of her grace united to 
me in the springtime of my days, and in old age keeps mine; 
you, who while I yet roved in youth nor knew nothing of love 
did transfix my heart. You it is whose rein in willing submis¬

within my mouth, without ever thought of change. . . . This 
land bore me for you [creavit me tibi ], and bound me to you 
in partnership forever .” 16 

Of course it is not in texts like these that one should look 
for a representation of what matrimonial life may have really 
been like in the period of the Empire. The sincerity they 
display does not have the value of evidence. They are texts that 
go out of their way to proclaim an ideal of conjugality. They 
should be taken not as the reflection of a situation, but as the 
formulation of an exigency, and it is precisely on this account 
that they form part of reality. They show that marriage was 
interrogated as a mode of life whose value was not exclusively, 
nor perhaps even essentially, linked to the functioning of the 
oikos, but rather to a mode of relation between two partners. 
They also show that, in this linkage, the man had to regulate 
his conduct, not simply by virtue of status, privileges, and 
domestic functions, but also by virtue of a “relational role” 
with regard to his wife. Finally, they show not only that this 
role was a governmental function of training, education, and 
guidance, but that it was involved in a complex interplay of 
affective reciprocity and reciprocal dependence. Now, while it 
is true that moral reflection on proper conduct in marriage
