alone, independently of its external consequences, produces 
intrinsic modifications in the person who articulates it: it 
exonerates, redeems, and purifies him; it unburdens him of 
his wrongs, liberates him, and promises him salvation. For 
centuries, the truth of sex was, at least for the most part, 
caught up in this discursive form. Moreover, this form was 
not the same as that of education (sexual education confined 
itself to general principles and rules of prudence); nor was it 
that of initiation (which remained essentially a silent prac¬ 
tice, which the act of sexual enlightenment or deflowering 
merely rendered laughable or violent). As we have seen, it is 
a form that is far removed from the one governing the “erotic 
art.” By virtue of the power structure immanent in it, the 
confessional discourse cannot come from above, as in the ars 
erotica, through the sovereign will of a master, but rather 
from below, as an obligatory act of speech which, under some 
imperious compulsion, breaks the bonds of discretion or for¬ 
getfulness. What secrecy it presupposes is not owing to the 
high price of what it has to say and the small number of those 
who are worthy of its benefits, but to its obscure familiarity 
and its general baseness. Its veracity is not guaranteed by the 
lofty authority of the magistery, nor by the tradition it trans¬ 
mits, but by the bond, the basic intimacy in discourse, be¬ 
tween the dne who speaks and what he is speaking about. On 
the other hand, the agency of domination does not reside in 
the one who speaks (for it is he who is constrained), but in 
the one who listens and says nothing; not in the one who 
knows and answers, but in the one who questions and is not 
supposed to know. And this discourse of truth finally takes 
effect, not in the one who receives it, but in the one from 
whom it is wrested. With these confessed truths, we are a 
long way from the learned initiations into pleasure, with 
their technique and their mystery. On the other hand, we

belong to a society which has ordered sex’s difficult knowl¬ 
edge, not according to the transmission of secrets, but 
around the slow surfacing of confidential statements. 

The confession was, and still remains, the general standard 
governing the production of the true discourse on sex. It has 
undergone a considerable transformation, however. For a 
long time, it remained firmly entrenched in the practice of 
penance. But with the rise of Protestantism, the Counter 
Reformation, eighteenth-century pedagogy, and nineteenth- 
century medicine, it gradually lost its ritualistic and exclu¬ 
sive localization; it spread; it has been employed in a whole 
series of relationships: children and parents, students and 
educators, patients and psychiatrists, delinquents and ex¬ 
perts. The motivations and effects it is expected to produce 
have varied, as have the forms it has taken: interrogations, 
consultations, autobiographical narratives, letters; they have 
been recorded, transcribed, assembled into dossiers, pub¬ 
lished, and commented on. But more important, the confes¬ 
sion lends itself, if not to other domains, at least to new ways 
of exploring the existing ones. It is no longer a question 
simply of saying what was done—the sexual act—and how 
it was done; but of reconstructing, in and around the act, the 
thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accom¬ 
panied it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the 
pleasure that animated it. For the first time no doubt, a 
society has taken upon itself to solicit and hear the imparting 
of individual pleasures. 

A dissemination, then, of procedures of confession, a mul¬ 
tiple localization of their constraint, a widening of their do¬ 
main: a great archive of the pleasures of sex was gradually 
constituted. For a long time this archive dematerialized as it 
was formed. It regularly disappeared without a trace (thus 
suiting the purposes of the Christian pastoral) until medi¬ 
cine, psychiatry, and pedagogy began to solidify it: Campe, 
Salzmann, and especially Kaan, KrafFt-Ebing, Tardieu, 
Molle, and Havelock Ellis carefully assembled this whole

pitiful, lyrical outpouring from the sexual mosaic. Western 
societies thus began to keep an indefinite record of these 
people’s pleasures. They made up a herbal of them and estab¬ 
lished a system of classification. They described their every¬ 
day deficiencies as well as their oddities or exasperations. 
This was an important time. It is easy to make light of these 
nineteenth-century psychiatrists, who made a point of apolo¬ 
gizing for the horrors they were about to let speak, evoking 
“immoral behavior” or “aberrations of the genetic senses,” 
but lam more inclined to applaud their seriousness: they had 
a feeling for momentous events. It was a time when the most
