But it is 
this same desire that makes some individuals who love boys 
eager, not to sow their seed in the body, but to engender in the 
soul and to give birth to that which is, of itself, beautiful.25 In 
Aristotle, in certain early texts like the treatise On the Soul, 
sexual activity’s connection with death and immortality is still 
expressed in the somewhat “Platonizing” form of a desire for 
participation in the eternal; 26 in later texts such as the treatise 
On Generation and Corruption, or Generation of Animals, it 
is conceived in the form of a differentiation and distribution 
of beings in the natural order, according to a set of ontological 
principles concerning being, nonbeing, and the better.Propos¬ 
ing to explain in terms of final causes why there is procreation 
of animals and separate existence of the sexes, the second book 
of the Generation of Animals invokes a few basic principles 
governing the relationships of the myriads of beings to being 
per se.First, some things are eternal and divine, while others 
can be or not be; second, the beautiful and divine is always the 
better and what is not eternal can participate in the better and 
the worse; third, it is better to be than not to be, to live than

not to live, to be animate than inanimate.And, observing that 
beings who are subject to becoming can be eternal only with¬ 
in the limits of their capability, he concludes that this is 
why there is generation of animals, and that the latter, 
excluded from eternity as individuals, can be eternal as 
a species: “numerically,” an animal “cannot be eternal, 
for the substance of things that are is particular; and if it 
were such, it would be eternal—but it is possible for it as 
a species.” 27 

Hence sexual activity was located within the broad parame¬ 
ters of life and death, of time, becoming, and eternity.
