It 
became necessary because the individual was fated to die, and 
in order that he might in a sense escape death.To be sure, 
these philosophical speculations were not immediately present 
in reflection regarding the use of pleasures and their regimen.But notice the solemnity with which Plato refers to these 
themes in the “persuasive” legislation—laws that must be of 
first importance since they were to be “the first laid down in 
every city”—that he proposes concerning marriage: “A man 
is to marry after he reaches the age of thirty and before he 
reaches thirty-five, bearing in mind that there is a sense in 
which the human species has by a certain nature a share in 
immortality, and that it is the nature of everyone to desire 
immortality in every way.For the desire to become famous 
and not to lie nameless after one has died is a desire for such 
a thing.Thus the species of human beings has something in 
its nature that is bound together with all of time, which it 
accompanies and will always accompany to the end.
