In this 
way the species is immortal; by leaving behind the children of 
children and remaining one and the same for always, it par¬

Greek medicine and philosophy concerned themselves with 
the aphrodisia and the use that ought to be made of them if 
one wished to care properly for one’s body.This problematiza- 
tion did not lead to a drawing of distinctions among those acts, 
their possible forms and varieties, in order to decide which 
ones were admissible and which were harmful or “abnormal.” 
By considering them in the aggregate, as the manifestation of 
a generic activity, it sought to determine the principles that 
would enable individuals to engage in them at the appropriate 
intensity and to distribute them in the right way, according to 
circumstances.
