Yet the clearly restrictive tendencies of such an 
economy attest to an anxiety about this sexual activity.An 
anxiety that related to the possible consequences of abuses; an 
anxiety that also related—especially so—to the act itself, 
which was always perceived in terms of a male, ejaculatory, 
“paroxystic” schema that appeared to adequately define all 
sexual activity.We see, then, that the importance that was 
accorded to the sexual act and to the forms of its rarefaction 
was owing not only to its negative effects on the body, but to 
what it was in itself and by nature: a violence that confounded 
the will, an expenditure that wasted the body’s resources, a 
procreation that was linked to the future death of the individ¬ 
ual.The sexual act did not occasion anxiety because it was 
associated with evil but because it disturbed and threatened 
the individual’s relationship with himself and his integrity as 
an ethical subject in the making; if it was not properly mea¬

honorable descendants.We may note that these three great themes of preoccupation 
are not peculiar to ancient culture: indications of this anxiety, 
which identify the sexual act with the “virile” form of semen 
and associate it with violence, exhaustion, and death, could 
doubtless be found frequently elsewhere.
