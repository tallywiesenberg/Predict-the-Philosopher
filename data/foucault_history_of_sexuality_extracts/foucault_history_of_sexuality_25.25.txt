In this “erotic art,” which sought, 
with pronounced ethical concerns, to intensify insofar as pos¬ 
sible the positive effects of a controlled, deliberate, multifari¬ 
ous, and prolonged sexual activity, time—a time that 
terminated the act, aged the body, and brought death—was 
exorcised.138 


The Use of Pleasure 


It would also be easy to find in the Christian doctrine of 
the flesh closely related themes of anxiety: the involuntary 
violence of the act, its kinship with evil, and its place in the 
play of life and death.But in the irrepressible force of desire 
and the sexual act, Saint Augustine was to see one of the 
main stigmata of the Fall (that involuntary movement repro¬ 
duced in the human body man’s rebellion against God); the 
Christian pastoral ministry was to set the rules of economy, 
on a precise calendar and according to a detailed morphol¬ 
ogy of acts; and the doctrine of marriage was to give the 
procreative finality the dual role of ensuring the survival or 
even the proliferation of God’s people, and of making it pos¬ 
sible for individuals to avoid pledging their souls to eternal 
death through indulgence in that activity.In short, this was 
a juridico-moral codification of acts, moments, and inten¬ 
tions that legitimated an activity that was of itself a bearer of 
negative values; and it inscribed it in the dual order of the 
ecclesiastical institution and the matrimonial institution.The 
time of rites and the time of legitimate procreation could 
absolve it of blame.
