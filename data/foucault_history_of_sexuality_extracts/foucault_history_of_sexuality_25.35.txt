Because it was the most violent of all the 
pleasures, because it was more costly than most physical ac¬ 
tivities, and because it participated in the game of life and 
death, it constituted a privileged domain for the ethical forma¬ 
tion of the subject: a subject who ought to be distinguished by 
his ability to subdue the tumultuous forces that were loosed 
within him, to stay in control of his store of energy, and to 
make his life into an oeuvre that would endure beyond his own 
ephemeral existence.The physical regimen of pleasures and 
the economy it required were part of a whole art of the self.♦These three “arts of governing” were often likened to one another, as arts that 
demanded a knowledge and prudence attuned to circumstances; they were also 
comparable because they were knowledges that were associated with an ability to 
command.They were frequently referred to where it was a question of an individual's 
search for the principles or the authority that would help him to “conduct himself.”
