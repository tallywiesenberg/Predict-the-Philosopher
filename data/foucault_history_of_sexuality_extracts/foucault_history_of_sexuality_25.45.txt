The Against Neaera formula is also far removed from what 
one finds in the Christian doctrine and its pastoral application, 
but for entirely different reasons.In that strictly monogamous 
situation, the man was to be prohibited from going in pursuit 
of any other form of pleasure beyond the pleasure he was 
allowed to take with his lawful wife; and even that pleasure 
was to pose a number of problems, seeing that the stated goal 
of sexual relations was not in sensual delight but in procrea¬ 
tion.Around this central cluster of themes, a whole inquiry 
was to develop regarding the status of pleasures within the 
conjugal relationship.In this case, the problematization did 
not grow out of a polygamous structure but out of a monoga¬ 
mous obligation; and it did not seek to tie the quality of the 
relationship to the intensity of pleasure and the variety of 
partners, but on the contrary it sought to dissociate, insofar 
as possible, the constancy of a single conjugal relationship 
from the pursuit of pleasure.* 

The formula expressed in Against Neaera appears to have 
been based on an altogether different system.
