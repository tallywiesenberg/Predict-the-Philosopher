penance. But with the rise of Protestantism, the Counter 
Reformation, eighteenth-century pedagogy, and nineteenth- 
century medicine, it gradually lost its ritualistic and exclu¬ 
sive localization; it spread; it has been employed in a whole 
series of relationships: children and parents, students and 
educators, patients and psychiatrists, delinquents and ex¬ 
perts. The motivations and effects it is expected to produce 
have varied, as have the forms it has taken: interrogations, 
consultations, autobiographical narratives, letters; they have 
been recorded, transcribed, assembled into dossiers, pub¬ 
lished, and commented on. But more important, the confes¬ 
sion lends itself, if not to other domains, at least to new ways 
of exploring the existing ones. It is no longer a question 
simply of saying what was done—the sexual act—and how 
it was done; but of reconstructing, in and around the act, the 
thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accom¬ 
panied it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the 
pleasure that animated it. For the first time no doubt, a 
society has taken upon itself to solicit and hear the imparting 
of individual pleasures. 

A dissemination, then, of procedures of confession, a mul¬ 
tiple localization of their constraint, a widening of their do¬ 
main: a great archive of the pleasures of sex was gradually 
constituted. For a long time this archive dematerialized as it 
was formed. It regularly disappeared without a trace (thus 
suiting the purposes of the Christian pastoral) until medi¬ 
cine, psychiatry, and pedagogy began to solidify it: Campe, 
Salzmann, and especially Kaan, KrafFt-Ebing, Tardieu, 
Molle, and Havelock Ellis carefully assembled this whole

pitiful, lyrical outpouring from the sexual mosaic. Western 
societies thus began to keep an indefinite record of these 
people’s pleasures. They made up a herbal of them and estab¬ 
lished a system of classification. They described their every¬ 
day deficiencies as well as their oddities or exasperations. 
This was an important time. It is easy to make light of these 
nineteenth-century psychiatrists, who made a point of apolo¬ 
gizing for the horrors they were about to let speak, evoking 
“immoral behavior” or “aberrations of the genetic senses,” 
but lam more inclined to applaud their seriousness: they had 
a feeling for momentous events. It was a time when the most
