On the one hand, 
this system operated on the principle of a single lawful wife; 
but on the other hand, it very clearly located the domain of 
pleasures outside the marital relationship.In it, marriage 
would encounter the sexual relation only in its reproductive 
function, while the sexual relation would raise the question of 
pleasure only outside of marriage.And consequently one does 
not see why sexual relations would be a problem in married 

â€¢We have to be careful not to schematize, not to reduce the Christian doctrine or 
marital relations to the procreative function, excluding pleasure.In actual fact, the 
doctrine was to be complex and open to discussion, and it was to have numerous 
variants.But the thing to bear in mind in our context is that the question of pleasure 
in the conjugal relationship and the question of the place it ought to be given, of the 
precautions that one had to take against it, as well as of the concessions that one had 
to grant it (taking account of the weakness and lustfulness of the other), constituted 
an active focus of reflection.
