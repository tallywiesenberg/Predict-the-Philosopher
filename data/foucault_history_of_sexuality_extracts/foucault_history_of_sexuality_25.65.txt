It is true that every man, whoever 
he might be, married or not, had to respect a married woman 
(or a girl under parental control); but this was because she was 
under someone else’s authority; it was not his own status that 
prevented him, but that of the girl or woman who was the 
object of his attack.His offense was essentially against the man 
who held authority over the woman; this was why, if he was 
an Athenian, he would be punished less severely if he commit¬ 
ted rape, overcome by the voracity of his desire, than if he 
deliberately and artfully seduced a woman; as Lysias says in 
On the Murder of Eratosthenes, seducers “corrupt their vic¬ 
tims’ souls, thus making the wives of others more closely 
attached to themselves than to their husbands, and get the 
whole house into their hands, and cause uncertainty as to 
whose the children really are.” 9 The rapist violated only the 
woman’s body, while the seducer violated the husband’s au¬ 
thority.All things considered, the married man was prohib¬ 
ited only from contracting another marriage; no sexual 
relation was forbidden him as a consequence of the marriage 
obligation he had entered into; he could have an intimate 
affair, he could frequent prostitutes, he could be the lover of 
a boy—to say nothing of the men or women slaves he had in 

*One also finds evidence of an obligation in regard to conjugal duties in Pythagorean 
teaching, as reported by Diogenes Laertius: “Hieronymus, however, says that, when 
he had descended into Hades ... he saw under torture those who had neglected to 
fulfill their conjugal duties [lous me thelontes syneinai lais heauton gunaixi].” 1

strict him sexually.Juridically, this meant that adultery was not a breach of the 
marriage contract if it was committed by one of the two part¬ 
ners.
