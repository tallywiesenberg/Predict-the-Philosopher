It constituted an infraction only in cases where a married 
woman had relations with a man who was not her husband; 
it was the marital status of the woman, never that of the man, 
that made it possible to define a relation as adultery.And from 
a moral standpoint, it is clear that there did not exist for the 
Greeks that category of “mutual fidelity” which would later 
introduce into married life a sort of “sexual right” having 
moral weight, juridical effects, and religious significance.The 
principle of a double monopoly, making exclusive partners of 
the two spouses, was not required in the marital relation.For 
while the wife belonged to the husband, the husband belonged 
only to himself.Reciprocal sexual fidelity, as a duty, a com¬ 
mitment, and a feeling shared equally, did not constitute the 
necessary guarantee nor the highest expression of married life.
