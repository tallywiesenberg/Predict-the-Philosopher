First, we have many statements 
about feelings of jealousy; wives commonly reproached their 
husbands for the pleasures they would go elsewhere to enjoy, 
and the fickle wife of Euphiletus took exception to his intima¬ 
cies with a mere slave girl.10 More generally, public opinion 
expected a man who was about to be married to exhibit a 
certain change in his sexual behavior; it was understood that 
during youthful bachelorhood (it often happened that men 
would not marry before they reached thirty) one would read¬ 
ily tolerate an intensity and variety of pleasures that it was 
good to curtail after marriage, even though the latter did not 
explicitly impose any precise limitation.But apart from these 
common behaviors and attitudes, there also existed a concep¬ 
tual thematics of marital austerity.The moralists—some of 
them, at any rate—gave it to be understood in clear terms that 
a married man could not rightly feel free to indulge in pleas¬ 
ures as if he were not married.One was to hear Nicocles, in 
the speech Isocrates attributes to him, declare not only that 
he ruled his subjects justly, but that since his marriage he had 
had sexual relations only with his own wife.
