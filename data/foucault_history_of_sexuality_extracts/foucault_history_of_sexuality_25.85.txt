And Aristotle was 
to assert in the Politics that intercourse “of the husband with 
another woman, or the wife with another man” must be con¬ 
sidered “a dishonorable action.” An isolated and unimportant 
phenomenon?Already the birth of a new ethics?But as few 
in number as these texts are, and especially considering how 
far removed they are from real social practice and from the 
actual behavior of individuals, it is still pertinent to ask our¬ 
selves: why did moral reflection concern itself with the sexual 
behavior of married men?What was the nature of this con¬ 
cern, what was its origin, and what were its forms?We will do well in this connection to avoid two interpreta¬ 
tions, neither one of which seems entirely adequate.
