One of them would consist in thinking that intercourse 
between husband and wife had no other function for the 
Greeks in the classical period than the calculation which allied 
two families, two strategies, and two fortunes, and which had 
the sole objective of producing descendants.The Against Nea- 
era aphorism, which seems to sharply differentiate the roles 
that ought to be played in a man’s life by the courtesan, the 
concubine, and the wife, has sometimes been read as a triparti¬ 
tion that implies exclusive functions: sexual pleasure on one 
side, everyday life on the other, and for the wife nothing more 
than the maintenance of the line of descent.But one has to 
consider the context in which this harsh-sounding maxim was 
formulated.It was part of a litigant’s attempt to invalidate the 
apparently legitimate marriage of one of his enemies, as well 
as the claim to citizenship of the children born of that mar¬ 
riage.And the arguments given had to do with the wife’s birth, 
her past as a prostitute, and her current status, which could 
only be that of a concubine.
