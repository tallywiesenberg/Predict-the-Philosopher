Hellenistic monarchies sought much less to suppress, curb, or 
even completely reorganize the local powers than to lean on 
them and use them as intermediaries and relays for the levy 
of regular tributes, for the collection of extraordinary taxes, 
and for supplying what was necessary to the armies . 3 It is a 
fact as well that by and large Roman imperialism tended to 
prefer solutions of this kind to the exercise of a direct adminis¬ 
tration. The policy of municipalization was a rather constant 
line, whose effect was to stimulate the political life of the cities 
within the larger framework of the Empire . 4 While the speech 
Dio Cassius places in the mouth of Maecenas presents ana¬ 
chronisms with respect to the policy that had been recom¬ 
mended to Augustus and actually pursued by him, it 
nevertheless represents certain of the major tendencies of the 
imperial government in the course of the first two centuries: 
look for “assistants and allies,” persuade “those subjects 
under your rule that you are not treating them as slaves” but 
that you are making sure that they share advantages and 
authority, that “they live as it were in a single city .” 5 

Can one still speak, then, of a decline of the traditional 
aristocracies, of their political dispossession, of a consequent 
withdrawal into the self? There were economic and political 
factors of transformation, to be sure: the elimination of oppo¬ 
nents and confiscations of property played their part. There 
were also stabilizing factors: the importance of wealth in land 
and in holdings of estates , 6 or the fact that in societies of this 
kind, fortunes, influence, prestige, authority, and power were 
always interconnected. But the most important and determin¬ 
ing phenomenon for the new emphases of moral reflection did 
not relate to the disappearance of the traditionally dominant 
classes, but to the changes that could be observed in the condi¬ 
tions of the exercise of power. These changes concerned re¬ 
cruitment first of all, since it was a matter of addressing the 
needs of an administration that was both complex and exten¬ 
sive. Maecenas is supposed to have said as much to Augustus: 
the number of senators and knights must be increased to the

extent necessary to govern at the right time and in the right 
way . 7 And we know that in fact these groups grew appreciably 
larger in the course of the first centuries a.d., even if they 
never constituted more than a tiny minority of the total popu¬
