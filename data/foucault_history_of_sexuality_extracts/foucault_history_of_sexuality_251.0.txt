lation . 8 Changes also affected the role they were led to play 
and the position they occupied in the political game: with 
respect to the emperor, to his entourage, to his councilors, to 
his direct representatives; within the hierarchy, where compe¬ 
tition played a major part but in a different fashion from that 
found in agonistic societies; in the form of revocable offices 
which depended, often quite directly, on the pleasure of the 
prince; and nearly always in an intermediary position between 
a higher power whose orders must be conveyed or carried out, 
and individuals or groups whose obedience must be obtained. 
What the Roman administration needed was a “managerial 
aristocracy,” as R. Syme says, a service aristocracy, which 
would furnish the different kinds of agents necessary to “ad¬ 
minister the world”: “officers in the army, financial procura¬ 
tors, and senatorial governors of provinces .” 9 

And if one wishes to understand the interest that was di¬ 
rected in these elites to personal ethics, to the morality of 
everyday conduct, private life, and pleasure, it is not all that 
pertinent to speak of decadence, frustration, and sullen re¬ 
treat. Instead, one should see in this interest the search for a 
new way of conceiving the relationship that one ought to have 
with one’s status, one’s functions, one’s activities, and one’s 
obligations. Whereas formerly ethics implied a close connec¬ 
tion between power over oneself and power over others, and 
therefore had to refer to an aesthetics of life that accorded with 
one’s status, the new rules of the political game made it more 
difficult to define the relations between what one was, what 
one could do, and what one was expected to accomplish. The 
formation of oneself as the ethical subject of one’s own actions 
became more problematic. 

R. MacMullen has underscored two essential features of 
Roman society: the public character of existence and the very 
pronounced “verticality” of differences in a world where the

gulf separating the very small number of wealthy people and 
the very large mass of poor people did not cease to widen . 10 
One understands the importance attributed, at the intersection 
of these two traits, to status differences, to their hierarchy, to 
their visible signs, to their careful and ostentatious staging . 11 
We may suppose that starting from the moment when new
