conditions of political life modified the relations between sta¬ 
tus, functions, powers, and duties, two opposite phenomena 
occurred. One discovers them in fact—and in their very oppo¬ 
sition—as early as the beginning of the imperial epoch. On the 
one hand, there is an accentuation of everything that allows 
the individual to define his identity in accordance with his 
status and with the elements that manifest it in the most visible 
way. One seeks to make oneself as adequate as possible to 
one’s own status by means of a set of signs and marks pertain¬ 
ing to physical bearing, clothing and accommodations, ges¬ 
tures of generosity and munificence, spending behavior, and so 
on. With regard to these behaviors by which one affirms one¬ 
self in the superiority one manifests over others, MacMullen 
has shown how common they were in the Roman aristocracy 
and the degree of exaggeration to which they could be carried. 
But at the opposite extreme one finds the attitude that con¬ 
sists, on the contrary, in defining what one is purely in relation 
to oneself. It is then a matter of forming and recognizing 
oneself as the subject of one’s own actions, not through a 
system of signs denoting power over others, but through a 
relation that depends as little as possible on status and its 
external forms, for this relation is fulfilled in the sovereignty 
that one exercises over oneself. To the new forms of the politi¬ 
cal game, and to the difficulties of conceiving oneself as an 
acting subject placed between birth and functions, tasks and 
rights, prerogatives and subordinations, one was able to re¬ 
spond by intensifying all the recognizable marks of status or 
by seeking an adequate relationship with oneself. 

These two attitudes were often perceived and described in 
strict opposition to one another. Seneca offers an example of 
this: “What we have to seek for then, is that which does not

each day pass more and more under the control of some power 
which cannot be withstood. And what is this? It is the soul— 
but the soul that is upright, good, and great. What else should 
you call such a soul than a god dwelling as a guest in a human 
body? A soul like this may descend into a Roman knight just 
as well as into a freedman’s son or a slave. For what is a 
Roman knight or a freedman’s son or a slave? They are mere 
titles, born of ambition or of wrong. One may leap to heaven 
from a slum. Rise then .” 12 It is this way of being, too, which
