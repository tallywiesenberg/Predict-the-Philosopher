Epictetus endorses in opposing it to that of an imagined or real 
interlocutor: “You make it your concern how to live in a 
palace, how slaves and freedmen are to serve you, how you are 
to wear conspicuous raiment, how you are to have a multitude 
of huntsmen, minstrels, players. Do I lay claim to any of 
these? But you, for your part, have you concerned yourself 
with judgments? Have you concerned yourself with your own 
rational self ?” 13 

The importance assumed by the theme of the return to 
oneself or of the attention that must be given to oneself, in 
Hellenistic and Roman thought, is often interpreted as the 
alternative that was offered to civic activity and political re¬ 
sponsibilities. It is true that in certain philosophical currents 
one finds the recommendation to turn aside from public 
affairs, from the troubles and passions to which they give rise. 
But it is not in this choice between participation and absten¬ 
tion that the principal line of division lies; and it is not in 
opposition to the active life that the cultivation of the self 
places its own values and practices. It is much more concerned 
to define the principle of a relation to self that will make it 
possible to set the forms and conditions in which political 
action, participation in the offices of power, the exercise of a 
function, will be possible or not possible, acceptable or neces¬ 
sary. The important political transformations that took place 
in the Hellenistic and Roman world may have induced certain 
withdrawal behaviors. But, above all, they brought about, in 
a much more general and essential way, a problematization of 
political activity. It can be characterized briefly as follows. 



Self and Others

1. A relatmzation. In the new political game, the exercise 
of power is relativized in two ways. First, even if by one’s birth 
one is marked out for public offices, one no longer identifies 
sufficiently with one’s status to consider it a foregone conclu¬ 
sion that one will accept such responsibilities; or in any case, 
if many reasons, and the best of reasons, incline one toward 
public and political life, it is good to enter it precisely for those 
reasons and as a consequence of a personal act of choice. The 
treatise Plutarch addresses to the young Menemachus is char¬ 
acteristic in this regard. He condemns the attitude that would 
make politics into an occasional activity, but he refuses to 
treat it as the necessary and natural consequence of a status. 
One must not, he says, regard political activity as a sort of 
pastime (schole) in which one would engage because one has 
nothing else to do and because circumstances are favorable, 
only to abandon it when difficulties arise. 14 Politics is “a life” 
and a “practice” (bios kai praxis). 15 But one cannot devote 
oneself to it except by a free and deliberate choice. (Here 
Plutarch employs the technical expression of the Stoics: 
proairesis. ) And this choice must be based on judgment and 
reason (krisis kai logos): 16 only in this way can one deal firmly 
with the problems that may be posed. The exercise of political 
activity is indeed a “life,” implying a personal and lasting 
commitment. But the foundation, the link between oneself and 
political activity, that which establishes the individual as a 
political actor, is not—or not merely—his status; it is, in the 
general context defined by his birth and his standing, a per¬ 
sonal act. 

But one can also speak of relativization in another sense. 
Short of being the prince himself, one exercises power within 
a network in which one occupies a key position. In a certain 
way, one is always the ruler and the ruled. Aristotle, in the 
Politics, also evoked this game, but in the form of an alterna¬ 
tion or rotation: one is now the ruler, now the ruled. 17 On the 
other hand, in the fact that a man is one and the other at the 
same time, through an interplay of directions sent and re¬ 
ceived, of checks, of appeals of decisions taken, Aristides sees

The Care of the Self 


the very principle of good government. 18 Seneca, in the preface 
of Book IV of the Natural Questions, speaks of this “interme¬ 
diary” situation of the high Roman official. He reminds 
Lucilius that the power he has to exercise in Sicily is not a 
supreme authority, an imperium, but the delegated power of 
a procuratio, the limits of which must not be exceeded—which 
is, in his view, the condition for being able to take pleasure 
(delectare) in the exercise of such an office and to profit from 
the leisure time it might leave. 19 Plutarch presents the con¬ 
verse, as it were, of this situation. It is not enough that the 
young aristocrat to whom he addresses his advice is in the first 
rank among his own people: he must also relate to the “rulers” 
—hegemones —that is, to the Romans. Plutarch criticizes 
those who, in order better to establish their power in their own 
city, show servility in their dealings with the representatives
