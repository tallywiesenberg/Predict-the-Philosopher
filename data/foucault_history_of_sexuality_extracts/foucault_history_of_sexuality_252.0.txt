Epictetus endorses in opposing it to that of an imagined or real 
interlocutor: “You make it your concern how to live in a 
palace, how slaves and freedmen are to serve you, how you are 
to wear conspicuous raiment, how you are to have a multitude 
of huntsmen, minstrels, players. Do I lay claim to any of 
these? But you, for your part, have you concerned yourself 
with judgments? Have you concerned yourself with your own 
rational self ?” 13 

The importance assumed by the theme of the return to 
oneself or of the attention that must be given to oneself, in 
Hellenistic and Roman thought, is often interpreted as the 
alternative that was offered to civic activity and political re¬ 
sponsibilities. It is true that in certain philosophical currents 
one finds the recommendation to turn aside from public 
affairs, from the troubles and passions to which they give rise. 
But it is not in this choice between participation and absten¬ 
tion that the principal line of division lies; and it is not in 
opposition to the active life that the cultivation of the self 
places its own values and practices. It is much more concerned 
to define the principle of a relation to self that will make it 
possible to set the forms and conditions in which political 
action, participation in the offices of power, the exercise of a 
function, will be possible or not possible, acceptable or neces¬ 
sary. The important political transformations that took place 
in the Hellenistic and Roman world may have induced certain 
withdrawal behaviors. But, above all, they brought about, in 
a much more general and essential way, a problematization of 
political activity. It can be characterized briefly as follows. 



Self and Others

1. A relatmzation. In the new political game, the exercise 
of power is relativized in two ways. First, even if by one’s birth 
one is marked out for public offices, one no longer identifies 
sufficiently with one’s status to consider it a foregone conclu¬ 
sion that one will accept such responsibilities; or in any case, 
if many reasons, and the best of reasons, incline one toward 
public and political life, it is good to enter it precisely for those 
reasons and as a consequence of a personal act of choice. The 
treatise Plutarch addresses to the young Menemachus is char¬ 
acteristic in this regard. He condemns the attitude that would 
make politics into an occasional activity, but he refuses to 
treat it as the necessary and natural consequence of a status.
