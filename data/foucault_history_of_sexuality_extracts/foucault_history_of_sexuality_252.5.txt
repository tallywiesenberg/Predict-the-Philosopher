One must not, he says, regard political activity as a sort of 
pastime (schole) in which one would engage because one has 
nothing else to do and because circumstances are favorable, 
only to abandon it when difficulties arise. 14 Politics is “a life” 
and a “practice” (bios kai praxis). 15 But one cannot devote 
oneself to it except by a free and deliberate choice. (Here 
Plutarch employs the technical expression of the Stoics: 
proairesis. ) And this choice must be based on judgment and 
reason (krisis kai logos): 16 only in this way can one deal firmly 
with the problems that may be posed. The exercise of political 
activity is indeed a “life,” implying a personal and lasting 
commitment. But the foundation, the link between oneself and 
political activity, that which establishes the individual as a 
political actor, is not—or not merely—his status; it is, in the 
general context defined by his birth and his standing, a per¬ 
sonal act. 

But one can also speak of relativization in another sense. 
Short of being the prince himself, one exercises power within 
a network in which one occupies a key position. In a certain 
way, one is always the ruler and the ruled. Aristotle, in the 
Politics, also evoked this game, but in the form of an alterna¬ 
tion or rotation: one is now the ruler, now the ruled. 17 On the 
other hand, in the fact that a man is one and the other at the 
same time, through an interplay of directions sent and re¬ 
ceived, of checks, of appeals of decisions taken, Aristides sees

The Care of the Self 


the very principle of good government. 18 Seneca, in the preface 
of Book IV of the Natural Questions, speaks of this “interme¬ 
diary” situation of the high Roman official. He reminds 
Lucilius that the power he has to exercise in Sicily is not a 
supreme authority, an imperium, but the delegated power of 
a procuratio, the limits of which must not be exceeded—which 
is, in his view, the condition for being able to take pleasure 
(delectare) in the exercise of such an office and to profit from 
the leisure time it might leave. 19 Plutarch presents the con¬ 
verse, as it were, of this situation. It is not enough that the 
young aristocrat to whom he addresses his advice is in the first 
rank among his own people: he must also relate to the “rulers” 
—hegemones —that is, to the Romans. Plutarch criticizes 
those who, in order better to establish their power in their own 
city, show servility in their dealings with the representatives
