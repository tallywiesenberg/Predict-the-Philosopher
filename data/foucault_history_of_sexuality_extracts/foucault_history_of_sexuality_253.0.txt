of the imperial administration. He counsels Menemachus to 
carry out the necessary duties with respect to them and to 
form such friendships with them as are useful, but never to 
humiliate his native land or be anxious to ask for authoriza¬ 
tion apropos of everything. 20 Anyone who exercises power has 
to place himself in a field of complex relations where he occu¬ 
pies a transition point. * His status may have placed him there; 
it is not this status, however, that determines the rules to 
follow and the limits to observe. 

2. Political activity and moral agent. It was one of the most 
constant themes of Greek political thought that a city could 
be happy and well governed only if its leaders were virtuous; 
and inversely, that a good constitution and wise laws were 
decisive factors for the right conduct of magistrates and citi¬ 
zens. The ruler’s virtue, in an entire line of political thought 
in the imperial epoch, is still regarded as necessary, but for 
somewhat different reasons. It is not as an expression or effect 
of the general harmony that this virtue is indispensable; but 
because, in the difficult art of ruling, amid so many obstacles,

the ruler will still have to be guided by his personal reason. 
It is in knowing how properly to conduct himself that he will 
be able to lead others properly. A man, says Dio of Prusa, who 
observes the law and equity, who is more courageous than 
common soldiers, who works more diligently than those who 
are under coercion, who refrains from any sort of sensual 
excess (obviously, it is a question of virtues that anyone might 
possess, but that need to be carried to a higher degree when 
one aims to govern)—such a man, who is not just good for 
himself but for others as well, has a daimon . 22 The rationality 
of the government of others is the same as the rationality of 
the government of oneself. This is what Plutarch explains in 
To an Uneducated Ruler: one will not be able to rule if one 
is not oneself ruled. Now, who then is to govern the ruler? The 
law, of course; it must not, however, be understood as the 
written law, but rather as reason, the logos, which lives in the 
soul of the ruler and must never abandon him. 23
