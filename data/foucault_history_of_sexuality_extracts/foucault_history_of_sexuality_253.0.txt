of the imperial administration. He counsels Menemachus to 
carry out the necessary duties with respect to them and to 
form such friendships with them as are useful, but never to 
humiliate his native land or be anxious to ask for authoriza¬ 
tion apropos of everything. 20 Anyone who exercises power has 
to place himself in a field of complex relations where he occu¬ 
pies a transition point. * His status may have placed him there; 
it is not this status, however, that determines the rules to 
follow and the limits to observe. 

2. Political activity and moral agent. It was one of the most 
constant themes of Greek political thought that a city could 
be happy and well governed only if its leaders were virtuous; 
and inversely, that a good constitution and wise laws were 
decisive factors for the right conduct of magistrates and citi¬ 
zens. The ruler’s virtue, in an entire line of political thought 
in the imperial epoch, is still regarded as necessary, but for 
somewhat different reasons. It is not as an expression or effect 
of the general harmony that this virtue is indispensable; but 
because, in the difficult art of ruling, amid so many obstacles,

specific tasks to subordinates . 21

the ruler will still have to be guided by his personal reason. 
It is in knowing how properly to conduct himself that he will 
be able to lead others properly. A man, says Dio of Prusa, who 
observes the law and equity, who is more courageous than 
common soldiers, who works more diligently than those who 
are under coercion, who refrains from any sort of sensual 
excess (obviously, it is a question of virtues that anyone might 
possess, but that need to be carried to a higher degree when 
one aims to govern)—such a man, who is not just good for 
himself but for others as well, has a daimon . 22 The rationality 
of the government of others is the same as the rationality of 
the government of oneself. This is what Plutarch explains in 
To an Uneducated Ruler: one will not be able to rule if one 
is not oneself ruled. Now, who then is to govern the ruler? The 
law, of course; it must not, however, be understood as the 
written law, but rather as reason, the logos, which lives in the 
soul of the ruler and must never abandon him. 23 

In a political space where the political structure of the city 
and the laws with which it is endowed have unquestionably 
lost some of their importance, although they have not ceased 
to exist for all that, and where the decisive elements reside 
more and more in men, in their decisions, in the manner in 
which they bring their authority to bear, in the wisdom they 
manifest in the interplay of equilibria and transactions, it 
appears that the art of governing oneself becomes a crucial 
political factor. We are aware of the importance assumed by 
the problem of the emperors’ virtue, of their private life, and 
of their ability to control their passions, which is seen as the 
guarantee that they will themselves be able to set a limit on 
the exercise of their political power. But this principle applies 
to anyone who governs: he must attend to himself, guide his 
own soul, establish his own ethos. 

It is in Marcus Aurelius that one finds the clearest formula¬ 
tion of an experience of political power that, on the one hand, 
takes the form of an occupation separate from status and, on 
the other, requires the careful practice of personal virtues. 
From the emperor Antoninus, in the briefest of the two por-

traits he draws of him, Marcus Aurelius recalls that he re¬ 
ceived three lessons: first, not to identify with the political role 
that one plays (“see to it that you do not become Caesarized, 
or dyed with that coloring”); second, to practice the virtues 
in their most general forms (“treasure simplicity, goodness, 
purity, dignity, lack of affectation, justice, piety, kindliness, 
graciousness, and strength for your appropriate duties”); 
third, to hold to the precepts of philosophy such as that of 
revering the gods, protecting men, and being mindful of how 
short life is. 24 And when, at the beginning of the Meditations, 
Marcus Aurelius draws a more detailed portrait of Antoninus, 
which stands as a model for his own life, he shows how these 
same principles regulated his way of exercising power. By 
avoiding useless outbursts, satisfactions of vanity, transports 
of anger and violent displays, by eschewing everything in the 
way of vindictiveness and suspicion, by keeping flatterers 
away and giving access only to wise and frank counselors, 
Antoninus showed how he rejected the “Caesarean” mode of 
being. Through his practice of self-restraint (whether it was a 
matter of food, clothes, sleep, or boys), through the moderate
