In a political space where the political structure of the city 
and the laws with which it is endowed have unquestionably 
lost some of their importance, although they have not ceased 
to exist for all that, and where the decisive elements reside 
more and more in men, in their decisions, in the manner in 
which they bring their authority to bear, in the wisdom they 
manifest in the interplay of equilibria and transactions, it 
appears that the art of governing oneself becomes a crucial 
political factor. We are aware of the importance assumed by 
the problem of the emperors’ virtue, of their private life, and 
of their ability to control their passions, which is seen as the 
guarantee that they will themselves be able to set a limit on 
the exercise of their political power. But this principle applies 
to anyone who governs: he must attend to himself, guide his 
own soul, establish his own ethos. 

It is in Marcus Aurelius that one finds the clearest formula¬ 
tion of an experience of political power that, on the one hand, 
takes the form of an occupation separate from status and, on 
the other, requires the careful practice of personal virtues. 
From the emperor Antoninus, in the briefest of the two por-

traits he draws of him, Marcus Aurelius recalls that he re¬ 
ceived three lessons: first, not to identify with the political role 
that one plays (“see to it that you do not become Caesarized, 
or dyed with that coloring”); second, to practice the virtues 
in their most general forms (“treasure simplicity, goodness, 
purity, dignity, lack of affectation, justice, piety, kindliness, 
graciousness, and strength for your appropriate duties”); 
third, to hold to the precepts of philosophy such as that of 
revering the gods, protecting men, and being mindful of how 
short life is. 24 And when, at the beginning of the Meditations, 
Marcus Aurelius draws a more detailed portrait of Antoninus, 
which stands as a model for his own life, he shows how these 
same principles regulated his way of exercising power. By 
avoiding useless outbursts, satisfactions of vanity, transports 
of anger and violent displays, by eschewing everything in the 
way of vindictiveness and suspicion, by keeping flatterers 
away and giving access only to wise and frank counselors, 
Antoninus showed how he rejected the “Caesarean” mode of 
being. Through his practice of self-restraint (whether it was a 
matter of food, clothes, sleep, or boys), through the moderate
