use he made of the comforts of life, through the absence of 
agitation and the equanimity of his soul, and through the 
cultivation of friendships without inconstancy or passion, he 
trained himself in the art of sufficing to himself without losing 
his serenity. And it was in these conditions that the exercise 
of imperial responsibilities could appear as the practice of a 
serious occupation, and one that demanded a good deal of 
effort: examining matters closely, never leaving a dossier in¬ 
complete, not incurring useless expenses, carefully planning 
one’s projects and seeing them through. A whole elaboration 
of the self by oneself was necessary for these tasks, which 
would be accomplished all the better because one did not 
identify in an ostentatious way with the trappings of power. 

Epictetus, for his part, had set forth the principles that 
ought to guide an official—of relatively high rank—in the 
performance of his tasks. On the one hand, he must fulfill his

obligations without regard to his personal life or interests: 
“You have been given a post in an imperial city, and not in 
some mean place; not for a short time, either, but you are a 
senator for life. Do you not know that a man in such a post 
has to give only a little attention to the affairs of his own 
household, but for most of his time has to be away, in com¬ 
mand, or under command, or serving some official, or in the 
field, or on the judge’s bench?” 25 But even though the magis¬ 
trate must leave aside his personal life and that which attaches 
him to it, it is his personal virtues as a reasonable man that 
will need to serve him as a guide and regulative principle in 
governing others. “Beating an ass,” explains Epictetus to an 
inspector of cities, “is not governing men. Govern us as ratio¬ 
nal beings by pointing out to us what is profitable, and we will 
follow you; point out what is unprofitable, and we will turn 
away from it. Bring us to admire and emulate you. . . . ‘Do 
this; do not do this; otherwise I will throw you in prison.’ Say 
that and you cease to be a government as over rational beings. 
No, rather say, ‘As Zeus has ordained, do this; if you do not 
do so, you will be punished, you will suffer injury. What kind 
of injury? No injury but that of not doing what you ought.’ ” 26 
It is the modality of a rational being and not the qualification 
of a status that establishes and ought to determine, in their 
concrete form, relations between the governors and the gov¬
