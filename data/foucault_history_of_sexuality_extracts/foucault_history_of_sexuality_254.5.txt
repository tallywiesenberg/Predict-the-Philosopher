Such a modeling of political work—whether it concerned 
the emperor or a man who exercised an ordinary responsibility 
—shows clearly how these forms of activity became detached 
from status and appeared as a function to fill; but—and this 
is not the least important consideration—that function was 
not defined in terms of laws belonging to an art of governing 
others, as if it were a question of a “profession” with its 
particular skills and techniques. It was to be exercised on the 
basis of the individual’s “retreat within himself”; that is, it 
depended on the relationship he established with himself 
in the ethical work of the self on the self. Plutarch says this

power, the man who governs must “set his soul straight” and 
properly establish his own ethos . 27 

3. Political activity and personal destiny. The precarious¬ 
ness of good fortune—too much success provokes the jealousy 
of the gods, or the people are fond of withdrawing favors they 
once granted—was clearly a traditional theme of meditation. 
In reflection on political activity, during the first centuries of 
the Empire, this precariousness inherent in the exercise of 
power is associated with two other themes. First, it is per¬ 
ceived as being linked to the dependence that one experiences 
in relation to others. It is not so much the particular cycle of 
good and bad fortune that explains this fragility, but the fact 
that one is placed under what Seneca calls the potentia aliena 
or the vis potentioris. 28 In the complex network of power, one 
is never alone facing one’s enemies. One is exposed on all sides 
to influences, intrigues, conspiracies, losses of favor. To be 
secure, one will have to be careful not to “give offence. It is 
sometimes the people that we ought to fear; or sometimes a 
body of influential oligarchs in the Senate . . . and sometimes 
individuals equipped with power by the people and against the 
people. It is burdensome to keep the friendship of all such 
persons; it is enough not to make enemies of them.” Between 
the prince, the Senate, and the populace giving and taking 
away their favors according to circumstances, the exercise of 
power depends on an unstable conjuncture: “You have held 
the highest offices; but have you held any as great, as unlooked
