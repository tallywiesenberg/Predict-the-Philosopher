for, as comprehensive as those of Sejanus? Yet on the day on 
which the Senate played the escort, the people tore him to 
pieces! Of the man who had heaped upon him all that gods and 
men were able to bestow, nothing was left for the executioner 
to drag to the river!” 29 

For these reversals and for the anxiety that they cause, one 
must prepare oneself by setting a prior limit on the ambitions 
that one entertains: “Nothing can free us from these mental 
waverings so effectively as always to establish some limit to

advancement and not leave to Fortune the decision of when 
it shall end, but halt of our own accord.” 30 And if the occasion 
presents itself, it is good to withdraw from these activities 
when they become disturbing and prevent one from attending 
to oneself. If misfortune suddenly strikes, if one falls from 
favor and is exiled, one ought to tell oneself—this is the advice 
Plutarch addresses no doubt to the same Menemachus whom 
he had encouraged, several years before, to enter politics “by 
free choice”*—that one is finally free from obedience to gover¬ 
nors, from liturgies that are too costly, from services to render, 
from ambassadorial missions to accomplish, and from taxes to 
pay. 31 And to Lucilius, who is not under any threat, however, 
Seneca gives the advice to disengage himself from his duties, 
gradually and at the right time, just as Epicurus counseled, so 
as to be able to place himself at his own disposal. 32 

The basic attitude that one must have toward political activ¬ 
ity was related to the general principle that whatever one is, 
it is not owing to the rank one holds, to the responsibility one 
exercises, to the position in which one finds oneself—above or 
beneath other people. What one is, and what one needs to 
devote one’s attention to as to an ultimate purpose, is the 
expression of a principle that is singular in its manifestation 
within each person, but universal by the form it assumes in 
everyone, and collective by the community bond it establishes 
between individuals. Such is, at least for the Stoics, human 
reason as a divine principle present in all of us. Now, this god, 
“a guest in a mortal body,” can be found in the form or a 
Roman knight as well as in the body of a freedman or a slave. 
From the viewpoint of the relation to the self, the social and 
political identifications do not function as authentic marks of
