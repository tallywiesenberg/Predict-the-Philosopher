for, as comprehensive as those of Sejanus? Yet on the day on 
which the Senate played the escort, the people tore him to 
pieces! Of the man who had heaped upon him all that gods and 
men were able to bestow, nothing was left for the executioner 
to drag to the river!” 29 

For these reversals and for the anxiety that they cause, one 
must prepare oneself by setting a prior limit on the ambitions 
that one entertains: “Nothing can free us from these mental 
waverings so effectively as always to establish some limit to

advancement and not leave to Fortune the decision of when 
it shall end, but halt of our own accord.” 30 And if the occasion 
presents itself, it is good to withdraw from these activities 
when they become disturbing and prevent one from attending 
to oneself. If misfortune suddenly strikes, if one falls from 
favor and is exiled, one ought to tell oneself—this is the advice 
Plutarch addresses no doubt to the same Menemachus whom 
he had encouraged, several years before, to enter politics “by 
free choice”*—that one is finally free from obedience to gover¬ 
nors, from liturgies that are too costly, from services to render, 
from ambassadorial missions to accomplish, and from taxes to 
pay. 31 And to Lucilius, who is not under any threat, however, 
Seneca gives the advice to disengage himself from his duties, 
gradually and at the right time, just as Epicurus counseled, so 
as to be able to place himself at his own disposal. 32 

The basic attitude that one must have toward political activ¬ 
ity was related to the general principle that whatever one is, 
it is not owing to the rank one holds, to the responsibility one 
exercises, to the position in which one finds oneself—above or 
beneath other people. What one is, and what one needs to 
devote one’s attention to as to an ultimate purpose, is the 
expression of a principle that is singular in its manifestation 
within each person, but universal by the form it assumes in 
everyone, and collective by the community bond it establishes 
between individuals. Such is, at least for the Stoics, human 
reason as a divine principle present in all of us. Now, this god, 
“a guest in a mortal body,” can be found in the form or a 
Roman knight as well as in the body of a freedman or a slave. 
From the viewpoint of the relation to the self, the social and 
political identifications do not function as authentic marks of 
a mode of being; they are extrinsic, artificial, and unfounded 
signs. How could one be a Roman knight, a freedman, a slave? 
These were names that one used, born of pride and injustice. 33 
“Each man acquires his character for himself, but accident 
assigns his duties.” 34 It was according to this law, therefore,

The Care of the Self 


that one would have to assume responsibilities, and that one 
would need to rid oneself of them. 

Clearly, then, it would not be adequate to say that political 
activities, in moral reflection, were conceived primarily in the 
form of a simple alternative: to participate or to abstain. It is 
true that the question was framed in such terms rather often. 
But this alternative itself derived from a more general prob- 
lematization. The latter concerned the manner in which one 
ought to form oneself as an ethical subject in the entire sphere 
of social, political, and civic activities. It concerned how one 
determined which of these activities were obligatory or op¬ 
tional, natural or conventional, permanent or provisional, un¬ 
conditional or recommended only under certain conditions. It 
also concerned the rules that must be applied when one en¬ 
gaged in them, and the way in which one ought to govern 
oneself in order to take one’s place among others, assert one’s 
legitimate share of authority, and in general situate oneself in 
the complex and shifting interplay of relations of command 
and subordination. The question of the choice between retreat 
and activity was indeed posed in a recurrent fashion. But the 
terms in which it was posed and the solution so often given 
to it show very well that it was not purely and simply a matter 
of translating a general waning of political activity into an 
ethics of withdrawal. It was a matter of elaborating an ethics 
that enabled one to constitute oneself as an ethical subject with 
respect to these social, civic, and political activities, in the 
different forms they might take and at whatever distance one 
remained from them. 

In view of these changes in matrimonial practice and in the 
political game, one can see how the conditions under which 
the traditional ethics of self-mastery asserted itself were trans¬
