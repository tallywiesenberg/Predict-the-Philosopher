a mode of being; they are extrinsic, artificial, and unfounded 
signs. How could one be a Roman knight, a freedman, a slave? 
These were names that one used, born of pride and injustice. 33

assigns his duties.” 34 It was according to this law, therefore,

that one would have to assume responsibilities, and that one 
would need to rid oneself of them. 

Clearly, then, it would not be adequate to say that political 
activities, in moral reflection, were conceived primarily in the 
form of a simple alternative: to participate or to abstain. It is 
true that the question was framed in such terms rather often. 
But this alternative itself derived from a more general prob- 
lematization. The latter concerned the manner in which one 
ought to form oneself as an ethical subject in the entire sphere 
of social, political, and civic activities. It concerned how one 
determined which of these activities were obligatory or op¬ 
tional, natural or conventional, permanent or provisional, un¬ 
conditional or recommended only under certain conditions. It 
also concerned the rules that must be applied when one en¬ 
gaged in them, and the way in which one ought to govern 
oneself in order to take one’s place among others, assert one’s 
legitimate share of authority, and in general situate oneself in 
the complex and shifting interplay of relations of command 
and subordination. The question of the choice between retreat 
and activity was indeed posed in a recurrent fashion. But the 
terms in which it was posed and the solution so often given 
to it show very well that it was not purely and simply a matter 
of translating a general waning of political activity into an 
ethics of withdrawal. It was a matter of elaborating an ethics 
that enabled one to constitute oneself as an ethical subject with 
respect to these social, civic, and political activities, in the 
different forms they might take and at whatever distance one 
remained from them. 

In view of these changes in matrimonial practice and in the 
political game, one can see how the conditions under which 
the traditional ethics of self-mastery asserted itself were trans¬
