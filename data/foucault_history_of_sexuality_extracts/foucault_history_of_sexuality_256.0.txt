formed. Self-mastery had implied a close connection between 
the superiority one exercised over oneself, the authority one 
exercised in the context of the household, and the power one 
exercised in the field of an agonistic society. It was the practice 
of superiority over oneself that guaranteed the moderate and

reasonable use that one could and ought to make of the two 
other superiorities. 

Henceforth one was in a world where these relations could 
no longer operate in the same way: the relation of superiority 
exercised in the household and over the wife had to be as¬ 
sociated with certain forms of reciprocity and equality. As for 
the agonistic game by which one sought to manifest and en¬ 
sure one’s superiority over others, it had to be integrated into 
a far more extensive and complex field of power relations. 
Consequently, the principle of superiority over the self as the 
ethical core, the general form of “heautocratism,” needed to 
be restructured. Not that it disappeared; but it had to make 
room for a certain balance between inequality and reciprocity 
in married life. In social, civic, and political life, it had to bring 
a certain dissociation into play between power over the self 
and power over others. The importance given to the problem 
of “oneself,” the development of the cultivation of the self in 
the course of the Hellenistic period, and the apogee it ex¬ 
perienced at the beginning of the Empire manifested this effort 
of reelaboration of an ethics of self-mastery. The reflection on 
the use of pleasure that was so directly linked to the close 
correlation between the three types of authority (over oneself, 
over the household, and over others) was modified in the very 
course of this elaboration. A growth of public constraints and 
prohibitions? An individualistic withdrawal accompanying 
the valorization of private life? We need instead to think in 
terms of a crisis of the subject, or rather a crisis of subjectiva- 
tion—that is, in terms of a difficulty in the manner in which 
the individual could form himself as the ethical subject of his 
actions, and efforts to find in devotion to self that which could 
enable him to submit to rules and give a purpose to his exis¬ 
tence.
