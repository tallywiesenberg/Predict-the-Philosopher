formed. Self-mastery had implied a close connection between 
the superiority one exercised over oneself, the authority one 
exercised in the context of the household, and the power one 
exercised in the field of an agonistic society. It was the practice 
of superiority over oneself that guaranteed the moderate and

reasonable use that one could and ought to make of the two 
other superiorities. 

Henceforth one was in a world where these relations could 
no longer operate in the same way: the relation of superiority 
exercised in the household and over the wife had to be as¬ 
sociated with certain forms of reciprocity and equality. As for 
the agonistic game by which one sought to manifest and en¬ 
sure one’s superiority over others, it had to be integrated into 
a far more extensive and complex field of power relations. 
Consequently, the principle of superiority over the self as the 
ethical core, the general form of “heautocratism,” needed to 
be restructured. Not that it disappeared; but it had to make 
room for a certain balance between inequality and reciprocity 
in married life. In social, civic, and political life, it had to bring 
a certain dissociation into play between power over the self 
and power over others. The importance given to the problem 
of “oneself,” the development of the cultivation of the self in 
the course of the Hellenistic period, and the apogee it ex¬ 
perienced at the beginning of the Empire manifested this effort 
of reelaboration of an ethics of self-mastery. The reflection on 
the use of pleasure that was so directly linked to the close 
correlation between the three types of authority (over oneself, 
over the household, and over others) was modified in the very 
course of this elaboration. A growth of public constraints and 
prohibitions? An individualistic withdrawal accompanying 
the valorization of private life? We need instead to think in 
terms of a crisis of the subject, or rather a crisis of subjectiva- 
tion—that is, in terms of a difficulty in the manner in which 
the individual could form himself as the ethical subject of his 
actions, and efforts to find in devotion to self that which could 
enable him to submit to rules and give a purpose to his exis¬ 
tence.

The Body 




It has often been remarked how intense and prevalent was 
the taste for things medical in the period of the Flavians and 
the Antonines. Medicine was widely recognized as a practice 
that was of interest to the public . 1 It was also recognized as 
a high form of culture, on the same level as rhetoric and 
philosophy. G. W. Bowersock observes that the medical 
model accompanied the development of the Second Sophistic 
and that a number of important rhetors had received medical 
training or manifested interests in that field. 2 * It had long been 
established that philosophy was closely related to medicine, 
even though the demarcation of boundaries posed doctrinal 
problems and gave rise to territorial rivalries. In the first lines 
of Advice about Keeping Well, Plutarch echoes these debates: 
the physician is wrong, he says, when he claims to be able to 
do without philosophy, and one would be quite mistaken to 
reproach philosophers with crossing their own boundaries 
when they concern themselves with health and its regimen. 
One must consider, Plutarch concludes, that medicine is in no 
way inferior to the liberal arts (eleutherai technai) in elegance, 
distinction, and the satisfaction it yields. To those who study 
it, it gives access to a knowledge of great importance since it 
concerns health and the preservation of life . 4 

Thus, medicine was not conceived simply as a technique of

ment of the litterarum disciplina . 1

intervention, relying, in cases of illness, on remedies and oper¬ 
ations. It was also supposed to define, in the form of a corpus 
of knowledge and rules, a way of living, a reflective mode of 
relation to oneself, to one’s body, to food, to wakefulness and 
sleep, to the various activities, and to the environment. Medi¬ 
cine was expected to propose, in the form of regimen, a volun¬ 
tary and rational structure of conduct. One of the points of 
discussion related to the degree and form of dependence that
