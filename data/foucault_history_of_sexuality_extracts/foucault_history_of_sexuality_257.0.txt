this medically informed life ought to manifest with regard to 
the authority of physicians. The way in which the latter some¬ 
times took control of their clients’ existence in order to man¬ 
age it in the least detail was an object of criticism, for the same 
reasons as was the spiritual direction practiced by philoso¬ 
phers. And Celsus, as convinced as he was of the high value 
of regimen medicine, was against subjecting oneself to a physi¬ 
cian if one was in good health.* The literature of regimen was 
meant to ensure this self-reliance. It was in order to avoid 
too-frequent consultations—because they were not always 
possible and they were often not desirable—that it was neces¬ 
sary to equip oneself with a medical knowledge that one could 
always use. Such is the advice that Athenaeus gives: acquire 
when young sufficient knowledge to be able, throughout one’s 
life and in ordinary circumstances, to be one’s own health 
counselor. “It is advisable, or rather, necessary, for everyone 
to learn, among the subjects that are taught, not only the other 
sciences but also medicine, and to hear the precepts of this art, 
so that we may often be our own accomplished counselors in 
matters useful to health; for there is almost no moment of the 
night or the day when we have no need of medicine. Thus, 
whether we are walking or sitting, whether we are oiling our 
body or taking a bath, whether we are eating, drinking—in a 
word, whatever we may do, during the whole course of life and 

•Celsus, in the preface of his treatise De Medicina, distinguishes one kind of medicine 
by regimen (victu), another by medicaments (medicamentis). and a third by opera¬ 
tions (manu). Those who teach the first, “by far the most famous authorities, endeav¬ 
oring to go more deeply into things, claim for themselves a knowledge of nature.” 
This did not mean that a man in good health needed to subject himself to the 
physicians’ authority . 5 



The Body

in the midst of life’s diverse occupations, we have need of 
advice for an employment of this life that is worthwhile and 
free of inconvenience. Now, it is tiresome and impossible al¬ 
ways to consult a physician concerning all these details .” 6 One 
easily recognizes in this passage one of the basic principles of 
the practice of the self: be equipped with, have ready to hand, 
a “helpful discourse,” which one has learned very early, re¬ 
hearses often, and reflects on regularly. The medical logos was 
one such discourse, dictating at every moment the correct 
regimen of life. 

A reasonable discourse could not unfold without a “health 
practice ”—hygieinepragmateia or techne —which constituted 
the permanent framework of everyday life, as it were, making 
it possible to know at every moment what was to be done and 
how to do it. It implied a medical perception of the world, so 
to speak, or at least a medical perception of the space and 
circumstances in which one lived. The elements of the milieu 
were perceived as having positive or negative effects on health. 
Between the individual and his environs, one imagined a 
whole web of interferences such that a certain disposition, a 
certain event, a certain change in things would induce morbid 
effects in the body. Conversely, a certain weak constitution of 
the body would be favorably or unfavorably affected by such 
and such a circumstance. Hence there was a constant and 
detailed problematization of the environment, a differential 
valuation of this environment with regard to the body, and a 
positing of the body as a fragile entity in relation to its sur¬ 
roundings. One can cite as an example the analysis submitted 
by Antyllus of the different medical “variables” of a house, its 
architecture, its orientation, and its interior design. Each ele¬ 
ment is assigned a dietetic or therapeutic value; a house is a 
series of compartments that will be harmful or beneficial as 
regards possible illnesses. Rooms on the ground floor are good 
for acute illnesses, hemoptyses, and headaches; upper-floor 
rooms are favorable in cases of pituitary illnesses; rooms with 
a southerly exposure are good except for patients who need

The Care of the Self 


cooling; westerly facing rooms are bad, in the morning be¬ 
cause they are gloomy, in the evening because they provoke 
headaches; whitewashed walls are too dazzling, painted walls 
cause nightmares in those who are delirious due to fever; stone 
walls are too cold, brick walls are better . 7 

The different periods of time—days, seasons, ages—are 
also, in the same perspective, bearers of varying medical val¬ 
ues. A careful regimen must be able to determine precisely the 
relations between the calendar and the care that needs to be 
given to oneself. This is the advice that Athenaeus offers for 
confronting the winter season: in the city as well as in the 
house, one should wear thick clothing, “one should breathe 
while keeping a part of one’s garment in front of the mouth.”
