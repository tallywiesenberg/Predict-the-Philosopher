A reasonable discourse could not unfold without a “health 
practice ”—hygieinepragmateia or techne —which constituted 
the permanent framework of everyday life, as it were, making 
it possible to know at every moment what was to be done and 
how to do it. It implied a medical perception of the world, so 
to speak, or at least a medical perception of the space and 
circumstances in which one lived. The elements of the milieu 
were perceived as having positive or negative effects on health. 
Between the individual and his environs, one imagined a 
whole web of interferences such that a certain disposition, a 
certain event, a certain change in things would induce morbid 
effects in the body. Conversely, a certain weak constitution of 
the body would be favorably or unfavorably affected by such 
and such a circumstance. Hence there was a constant and 
detailed problematization of the environment, a differential 
valuation of this environment with regard to the body, and a 
positing of the body as a fragile entity in relation to its sur¬ 
roundings. One can cite as an example the analysis submitted 
by Antyllus of the different medical “variables” of a house, its 
architecture, its orientation, and its interior design. Each ele¬ 
ment is assigned a dietetic or therapeutic value; a house is a 
series of compartments that will be harmful or beneficial as 
regards possible illnesses. Rooms on the ground floor are good 
for acute illnesses, hemoptyses, and headaches; upper-floor 
rooms are favorable in cases of pituitary illnesses; rooms with 
a southerly exposure are good except for patients who need

cooling; westerly facing rooms are bad, in the morning be¬ 
cause they are gloomy, in the evening because they provoke 
headaches; whitewashed walls are too dazzling, painted walls 
cause nightmares in those who are delirious due to fever; stone 
walls are too cold, brick walls are better . 7 

The different periods of time—days, seasons, ages—are 
also, in the same perspective, bearers of varying medical val¬ 
ues. A careful regimen must be able to determine precisely the 
relations between the calendar and the care that needs to be 
given to oneself. This is the advice that Athenaeus offers for 
confronting the winter season: in the city as well as in the 
house, one should wear thick clothing, “one should breathe 
while keeping a part of one’s garment in front of the mouth.”
