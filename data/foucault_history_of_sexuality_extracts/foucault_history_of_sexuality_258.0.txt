As for food, one should choose food that “can heat the parts 
of the body and dissolve the liquids that have been congealed 
by the cold. Drinks should consist of hydromel, honeyed wine, 
and white wine, old and sweet-smelling; in general, they 
should be substances capable of drawing out all the excess 
moisture; but one should reduce the quantity of drink. The dry 
foods should be easy to prepare, thoroughly worked, well- 
cooked, pure, and should be mixed with fennel and ammi. For 
pot vegetables, one should eat cabbage, asparagus, leeks, 
boiled tender onions and boiled horseradish; as concerns fish, 
rockfish are good, for they are easily assimilated by the body. 
In the meat category, one should eat poultry and, among the 
other kinds, young goat and young pork. As concerns sauces, 
those that are prepared with pepper, mustard, winter cress, 
garum, and vinegar. One should take up moderately strenuous 
exercise, practice holding one’s breath, and undergo rather 
vigorous rubdowns, especially those that one applies to oneself 
by the fireside. It is also good to resort to hot baths, whether 
these be taken in the bathing pool or in a small bathtub, etc .” 8 
And the summer regimen is no less meticulous. 

This preoccupation with the environment, with places and 
times, called for a constant attention to oneself, to the state 
one was in and to the acts that one performed. Addressing that 
category of people considered to be especially fragile, the city-

dwellers, and above all, those who devote themselves to study 
(litterarum cupidi), Celsus prescribes a keen vigilance: if one 
has digested well, one should rise early; if one has digested 
poorly, one should continue to rest, and in case one is obliged 
to get up all the same, one should go back to sleep; and if no 
digestion has taken place, one should remain completely inac¬ 
tive, and “neither work nor take exercise nor attend to busi¬ 
ness.” One will know if one is in good health “if his morning 
urine is whitish, later reddish; the former indicates that diges¬ 
tion is going on, the latter that digestion is complete.” When 
one is kept busy all day by one’s affairs, one should neverthe¬ 
less set aside a little time for the curatio corporis. The exercises 
that should be practiced are “reading aloud, drill, handball, 
running, walking; but this is not by any means most useful on 
the level, since walking up and down hill varies the movement 
of the body, unless indeed the body is thoroughly weak; but 
it is better to walk in the open air than under cover; better, 
when the head allows it, in the sun than in the shade; better 
under the shade of a wall or of trees than under a roof; better 
a straight than a winding walk. . . . The proper sequel to 
exercise is: at times an anointing, whether in the sun or before 
a brazier; at times a bath, which should be in a chamber as 
lofty, well lighted and spacious as possible .” 9 

In a general way, all these themes of dietetics had remained 
remarkably continuous since the classical period. It is clear 
that the general principles stayed the same; at most, they were 
developed, given more detail, and refined. They suggested a 
tighter structuring of life, and they solicited a more constantly 
vigilant attention to the body. The evocations of their every¬ 
day life that one can find in the letters of Seneca or in the 
correspondence between Marcus Aurelius and Fronto testify 
to this mode of attention to the self and to one’s body. An 
intensification, much more than a radical change; an increase 
of apprehension and not a disparagement of the body; a 
change of scale in the elements to which one needed to direct 
one’s attention and not a different way of perceiving oneself 
as a physical individual.

The Care of the Self 


It was in this overall context, so strongly marked by con¬ 
cern for the body, health, environment, and circumstances, 
that medicine framed the question of sexual pleasures: the 
question of their nature and their mechanism, that of their 
positive and negative value for the organism, that of the regi¬ 
men to which they ought to be subjected . 10

within the ancient thematic of the relations between death,
