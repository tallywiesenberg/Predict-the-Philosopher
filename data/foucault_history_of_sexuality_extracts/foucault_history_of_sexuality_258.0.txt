As for food, one should choose food that “can heat the parts 
of the body and dissolve the liquids that have been congealed 
by the cold. Drinks should consist of hydromel, honeyed wine, 
and white wine, old and sweet-smelling; in general, they 
should be substances capable of drawing out all the excess 
moisture; but one should reduce the quantity of drink. The dry 
foods should be easy to prepare, thoroughly worked, well- 
cooked, pure, and should be mixed with fennel and ammi. For 
pot vegetables, one should eat cabbage, asparagus, leeks, 
boiled tender onions and boiled horseradish; as concerns fish, 
rockfish are good, for they are easily assimilated by the body.

exercise, practice holding one’s breath, and undergo rather 
vigorous rubdowns, especially those that one applies to oneself

poorly, one should continue to rest, and in case one is obliged 
to get up all the same, one should go back to sleep; and if no 
digestion has taken place, one should remain completely inac¬ 
tive, and “neither work nor take exercise nor attend to busi¬ 
ness.” One will know if one is in good health “if his morning 
urine is whitish, later reddish; the former indicates that diges¬ 
tion is going on, the latter that digestion is complete.” When 
one is kept busy all day by one’s affairs, one should neverthe¬ 
less set aside a little time for the curatio corporis. The exercises 
that should be practiced are “reading aloud, drill, handball, 
running, walking; but this is not by any means most useful on 
the level, since walking up and down hill varies the movement 
of the body, unless indeed the body is thoroughly weak; but
