it is better to walk in the open air than under cover; better, 
when the head allows it, in the sun than in the shade; better 
under the shade of a wall or of trees than under a roof; better 
a straight than a winding walk. . . . The proper sequel to 
exercise is: at times an anointing, whether in the sun or before 
a brazier; at times a bath, which should be in a chamber as 
lofty, well lighted and spacious as possible .” 9 

In a general way, all these themes of dietetics had remained 
remarkably continuous since the classical period. It is clear 
that the general principles stayed the same; at most, they were 
developed, given more detail, and refined. They suggested a 
tighter structuring of life, and they solicited a more constantly 
vigilant attention to the body. The evocations of their every¬ 
day life that one can find in the letters of Seneca or in the 
correspondence between Marcus Aurelius and Fronto testify 
to this mode of attention to the self and to one’s body. An 
intensification, much more than a radical change; an increase 
of apprehension and not a disparagement of the body; a 
change of scale in the elements to which one needed to direct 
one’s attention and not a different way of perceiving oneself 
as a physical individual.

The Care of the Self 


It was in this overall context, so strongly marked by con¬ 
cern for the body, health, environment, and circumstances, 
that medicine framed the question of sexual pleasures: the

Galen 


1. Galen’s analyses concerning the aphrodisia are situated 
within the ancient thematic of the relations between death, 
immortality, and reproduction. For him, as for a whole philo¬ 
sophical tradition, the necessity of the division of the sexes, the
