intensity of their mutual attraction, and the possibility of gen¬ 
eration are rooted in the lack of eternity. This is the general 
explanation given by the treatise On the Usefulness of the Parts 
of the Body. 1 Nature, doing her work, encountered an obsta¬ 
cle, a sort of intrinsic incompatibility in her task. Her plan, 
what she strove (espoudase) to do, was to construct an immor¬ 
tal work. But the substance she had to work with did not 
permit this; she could not make arteries, nerves, bones, and 
flesh using an “incorruptible” material. Galen discerns at the 
very core of the demiurgic work—the demiourgema —an in¬ 
ternal limit and a kind of “failure” due to an unavoidable 
inadequacy between the immortality that was planned and the 
corruptibility of the material used. The logos that builds the 
natural order is in a situation rather similar to that of the 
founder of a city: the latter may very well bring men together 
to form a community; however, the city will disappear, will 
fall into oblivion, if one does not discover how to make it 
endure beyond the death of its first citizens. A means is neces¬ 
sary to surmount this fundamental difficulty. Galen’s vocabu¬ 
lary is both insistent and significant. It is a question of finding 
an aid, of contriving a means (boetheia), of discovering an art

(techne), of using an enticement (delear), to ensure the salva¬ 
tion and protection of the species. In short, something inge¬ 
nious (sophisma) is needed. 2 To bring her work to its logical 
conclusion, the demiurge, in creating living beings and giving 
them a means to reproduce, had to perfect a ruse: a ruse of 
the logos that presides over the world, in order to overcome 
the unavoidable corruptibility of the material of which this 
very world is made. 

This ruse brings three elements into play. First, the organs 
that are given to all animals and are used for fertilization. 
Next, a capacity for pleasure that is extraordinary and “very 
keen.” Lastly, in the soul, the longing (epithumia) to make use 
of these organs—a marvelous, inexpressible (arrheton) desire. 
The “sophism” of sex does not therefore reside simply in a 
subtle anatomical arrangement and in carefully planned 
mechanisms; it also consists in their association with a plea¬ 
sure and a desire, the singular force of which is “even beyond 
words.” To overcome the incompatibility between her plan 
and the limitations of her materials, Nature had to place the 
principle of a force, an extraordinary dynamis, in the body 
and soul of the living creature. 

Hence the wisdom of the demiurgic principle, which, know¬ 
ing very well the substance of her work and consequently its 
limits, invented this mechanism of excitement—this “sting” of 
desire. (Here Galen repeats the traditional image, by which 
one spoke metaphorically of the uncontrolled vehemence of 
desire. 3 ) So that, experiencing this sting, even those animals 
that are incapable of understanding the purpose of Nature in 
her wisdom—because they are young, foolish (aphrona), or 
without reason (aloga) —do in fact accomplish it. 4 By their 
intensity the aphrodisia serve a rationality which those who 
engage in them do not even need to know. 

2. The physiology of sexual acts in Galen is still marked 
by some fundamental traits found in the earlier traditions. 

In the first place, there is the isomorphism of these acts in 
the man and the woman. For Galen, it rests on the principle 



The Body

of an identity of the anatomical apparatus in the two sexes: 
“Consider first whichever parts you please, turn outward the 
woman’s, turn inward, so to speak, and fold double the man’s, 
and you will find them the same in both in every respect.” 5 He 
assumes the emission of sperm by the woman as well as by the 
man, the difference being that the production of this humor 
is less perfect in the woman and less complete—which ex¬ 
plains its minor role in the formation of the embryo. 

One also finds in Galen the traditional model of the 
paroxysmal process of excretion that traverses the body, 
shakes it, and exhausts it. But the analysis he gives of this 
phenomenon deserves nonetheless to be examined. It has the 
double effect of linking, very closely, the mechanisms of the 
sexual act with the organism as a whole, while making it a 
process in which the individual’s health, and possibly his very 
life, is at risk. At the same time that it inserts the act into a 
dense and unbroken physiological web, it invests it with a high 
potential for danger.
