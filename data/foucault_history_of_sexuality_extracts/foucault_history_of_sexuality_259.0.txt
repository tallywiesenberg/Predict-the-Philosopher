intensity of their mutual attraction, and the possibility of gen¬ 
eration are rooted in the lack of eternity. This is the general 
explanation given by the treatise On the Usefulness of the Parts 
of the Body. 1 Nature, doing her work, encountered an obsta¬ 
cle, a sort of intrinsic incompatibility in her task. Her plan, 
what she strove (espoudase) to do, was to construct an immor¬ 
tal work. But the substance she had to work with did not 
permit this; she could not make arteries, nerves, bones, and 
flesh using an “incorruptible” material. Galen discerns at the 
very core of the demiurgic work—the demiourgema —an in¬ 
ternal limit and a kind of “failure” due to an unavoidable 
inadequacy between the immortality that was planned and the 
corruptibility of the material used. The logos that builds the 
natural order is in a situation rather similar to that of the 
founder of a city: the latter may very well bring men together 
to form a community; however, the city will disappear, will 
fall into oblivion, if one does not discover how to make it 
endure beyond the death of its first citizens. A means is neces¬ 
sary to surmount this fundamental difficulty. Galen’s vocabu¬ 
lary is both insistent and significant. It is a question of finding 
an aid, of contriving a means (boetheia), of discovering an art

(techne), of using an enticement (delear), to ensure the salva¬ 
tion and protection of the species. In short, something inge¬ 
nious (sophisma) is needed. 2 To bring her work to its logical 
conclusion, the demiurge, in creating living beings and giving 
them a means to reproduce, had to perfect a ruse: a ruse of 
the logos that presides over the world, in order to overcome 
the unavoidable corruptibility of the material of which this 
very world is made. 

This ruse brings three elements into play. First, the organs 
that are given to all animals and are used for fertilization. 
Next, a capacity for pleasure that is extraordinary and “very 
keen.” Lastly, in the soul, the longing (epithumia) to make use 
of these organs—a marvelous, inexpressible (arrheton) desire. 
The “sophism” of sex does not therefore reside simply in a 
subtle anatomical arrangement and in carefully planned 
mechanisms; it also consists in their association with a plea¬ 
sure and a desire, the singular force of which is “even beyond
