words.” To overcome the incompatibility between her plan 
and the limitations of her materials, Nature had to place the 
principle of a force, an extraordinary dynamis, in the body 
and soul of the living creature. 

Hence the wisdom of the demiurgic principle, which, know¬ 
ing very well the substance of her work and consequently its 
limits, invented this mechanism of excitement—this “sting” of 
desire. (Here Galen repeats the traditional image, by which 
one spoke metaphorically of the uncontrolled vehemence of 
desire. 3 ) So that, experiencing this sting, even those animals 
that are incapable of understanding the purpose of Nature in 
her wisdom—because they are young, foolish (aphrona), or 
without reason (aloga) —do in fact accomplish it. 4 By their 
intensity the aphrodisia serve a rationality which those who 
engage in them do not even need to know. 

2. The physiology of sexual acts in Galen is still marked 
by some fundamental traits found in the earlier traditions. 

In the first place, there is the isomorphism of these acts in 
the man and the woman. For Galen, it rests on the principle

of an identity of the anatomical apparatus in the two sexes: 
“Consider first whichever parts you please, turn outward the 
woman’s, turn inward, so to speak, and fold double the man’s, 
and you will find them the same in both in every respect.” 5 He 
assumes the emission of sperm by the woman as well as by the 
man, the difference being that the production of this humor 
is less perfect in the woman and less complete—which ex¬ 
plains its minor role in the formation of the embryo. 

One also finds in Galen the traditional model of the 
paroxysmal process of excretion that traverses the body, 
shakes it, and exhausts it. But the analysis he gives of this 
phenomenon deserves nonetheless to be examined. It has the 
double effect of linking, very closely, the mechanisms of the 
sexual act with the organism as a whole, while making it a 
process in which the individual’s health, and possibly his very 
life, is at risk. At the same time that it inserts the act into a 
dense and unbroken physiological web, it invests it with a high 
potential for danger.
