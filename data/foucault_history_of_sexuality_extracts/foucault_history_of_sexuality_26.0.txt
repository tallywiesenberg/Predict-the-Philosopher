singular pleasures were called upon to pronounce a discourse 
of truth concerning themselves, a discourse which had to 
model itself after that which spoke, not of sin and salvation, 
but of bodies and life processes—the discourse of science. It 
was enough to make one’s voice tremble, for an improbable 
thing was then taking shape: a confessional science, a science 
which relied on a many-sided extortion, and took for its 
object what was unmentionable but admitted to nonetheless. 
The scientific discourse was scandalized, or in any case re¬ 
pelled, when it had to take charge of this whole discourse 
from below. It was also faced with a theoretical and method¬ 
ological paradox: the long discussions concerning the possi¬ 
bility of constituting a science of the subject, the validity of 
introspection, lived experience as evidence, or the presence 
of consciousness to itself were responses to this problem that 
is inherent in the functioning of truth in our society: can one 
articulate the production of truth according to the old juridi- 
co-religious model of confession, and the extortion of confi¬ 
dential evidence according to the rules of scientific discourse? 
Those who believe that sex was more rigorously elided in the 
nineteenth century than ever before, through a formidable 
mechanism of blockage and a deficiency of discourse, can say 
what they please. There was no deficiency, but rather an 
excess, a redoubling, too much rather than not enough dis¬ 
course, in any case an interference between two modes of

production of truth: procedures of confession, and scientific 
discursivity. 

And instead of adding up the errors, naivetes, and moral- 
isms that plagued the nineteenth-century discourse of truth 
concerning sex, we would do better to locate the procedures 
by which that will to knowledge regarding sex, which cha¬ 
racterizes the modern Occident, caused the rituals of confes¬ 
sion to function within the norms of scientific regularity: how 
did this immense and traditional extortion of the sexual con¬ 
fession come to be constituted in scientific terms?
