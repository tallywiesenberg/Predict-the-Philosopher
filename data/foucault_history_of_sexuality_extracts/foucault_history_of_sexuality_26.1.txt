This is why reflection on marriage and the good 
behavior of husbands was regularly combined with reflection 
concerning the oikos (house and household).Thus, it becomes clear that the principle that obligated a 
man to have no partner outside the couple he formed was 
different in nature from that which tied a woman to an analo¬ 
gous obligation.In the case of the woman, it was insofar as 
she was under the authority of her husband that this obliga¬ 
tion was imposed on her.In the man’s case, it was because he 
exercised authority and because he was expected to exhibit 
self-mastery in the use of this authority, that he needed to limit 
his sexual options.For the wife, having sexual relations only 
with her husband was a consequence of the fact that she was 
under his control.
