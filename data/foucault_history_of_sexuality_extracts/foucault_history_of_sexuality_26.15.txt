For the husband, having sexual relations 
only with his wife was the most elegant way of exercising his 
control.This was not nearly so much the prefiguration of a 
symmetry that was to appear in the subsequent ethics, as it 
was the stylization of an actual dissymmetry.The restriction, 
which was analogous in what it allowed or forbade the two 
spouses, did not cover the same manner of “conducting one¬ 
self.” This is exemplified very well in a text devoted to the way 
in which a man was to conduct the affairs of his household and 
conduct himself as the master of the household.2
