In conjunction with some specific 
advice on administering the domain, supervising the workers, 
undertaking different kinds of cultivation, applying the right 
techniques at the right time, and selling or buying as one 
should and when one should, Xenophon develops a number 
of general ideas: considerations on the need, in these matters, 
to rely on rational practices, which he sometimes designates 
by the term “knowledge” (episteme) and sometimes by the 
term signifying art or technique (techne); considerations on 
the goal to have in view (to preserve and develop the estate); 
and lastly, considerations on the means of achieving this ob¬ 
jective—that is, on the art of ruling.It is this theme that recurs 
most often through the whole length of the text.The mileu in which this analysis is placed is socially and 
politically quite distinct.It is the small society of landholders 
who must maintain and increase the family wealth and be¬ 
queath it to those who bear their name.Xenophon explicitly 
contrasts this world with that of craftsmen, whose life is not 
beneficial either to their own health (because of their way of 
living), or to their friends, or to the city (seeing that they do 
not have the leisure to attend to its affairs).
