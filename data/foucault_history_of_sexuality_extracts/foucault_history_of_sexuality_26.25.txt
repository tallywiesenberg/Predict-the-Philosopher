place, in the agora, where they can fulfill their duties as friends 
and as citizens, as well as in the oikos.But the oikos comprises 
more than just the house proper; it also includes the fields and 
possessions, wherever they may be located (even outside the 
boundaries of the city): “whatever someone possesses is part 
of his household”; it defines a whole sphere of activities.2 And 
this activity is connected to a lifestyle and an ethical order.The landowner’s existence, if he takes proper care of his estate, 
is good for him first of all; in any case it is an endurance 
exercise, physical training that is good for the body, for its 
health and vigor; it also encourages piety by making it possible 
to offer rich sacrifices to the gods; it favors friendship relations 
by providing the occasion to show generosity, to satisfy fully 
one’s hospitality obligations, and to manifest one’s beneficence 
toward other citizens.Further, this activity is useful to the 
entire city in that it adds to its wealth and especially because 
it supplies it with good defenders: the landowner, being used 
to strenuous work, is a strong soldier and the wealth he pos¬ 
sesses motivates him to courageously defend the homeland.
