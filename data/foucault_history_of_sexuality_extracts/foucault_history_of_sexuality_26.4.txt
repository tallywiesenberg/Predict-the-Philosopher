The domestic art was of 
the same nature as the political art or the military art, at least 
insofar as all three involved ruling others.6 

It is in this framework of an art of “economy” that Xeno¬ 
phon introduces the problem of the relations between husband 
and wife.Now, the wife, as mistress of the house, is a key 
figure in the management of the oikos and she is essential for 
its good government.Socrates asks Critobulus: “Is there any¬ 
one to whom you entrust more serious matters than to your 
wife?”; and a little later, he adds: “I hold that a woman who 
is a good partner in the household is a proper counterweight 
to the man in attaining the good”; and in this sphere, “when 
things turn out well, the households increase, but when done 
badly, the households diminish.” 7 But, in spite of the wife’s 
importance, nothing has really prepared her to play the re¬ 
quired role, given her extreme youth, first of all, and the very 
brief education she has received (“Did you marry her when 
she was a very young girl and had seen and heard as little as 
possible?”), and also the near-total absence of relations with 
her husband, with whom she rarely converses (“is there any¬ 
one with whom you discuss fewer things than with your 
wife?”).8 This is precisely where the need exists for the hus¬ 
band to establish relations with his wife that are for the pur¬ 
pose of training and guidance at the same time.
