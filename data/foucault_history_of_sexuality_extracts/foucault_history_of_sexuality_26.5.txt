and hypnosis, with the recollection of memories and free 
association: all were ways of reinscribing the procedure of 
confession in a field of scientifically acceptable observations. 

2. Through the postulate of a general and diffuse causality. 
Having to tell everything, being able to pose questions about 
everything, found their justification in the principle that en¬ 
dowed sex with an inexhaustible and polymorphous causal 
power. The most discrete event in one’s sexual behavior— 
whether an accident or a deviation, a deficit or an excess— 
was deemed capable of entailing the most varied conse¬ 
quences throughout one’s existence; there was scarcely a 
malady or physical disturbance to which the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury did not impute at least some degree of sexual etiology. 
From the bad habits of children to the phthises of adults, the 
apoplexies of old people, nervous maladies, and the degener¬ 
ations of the race, the medicine of that era wove an entire 
network of sexual causality to explain them. This may well 
appear fantastic to us, but the principle of sex as a “cause of 
any and everything” was the theoretical underside of a con¬ 
fession that had to be thorough, meticulous, and constant,

and at the same time operate within a scientific type of 
practice. The limitless dangers that sex carried with it jus¬ 
tified the exhaustive character of the inquisition to which it 
was subjected. 

3. Through the principle of a latency intrinsic to sexuality. 
If it was necessary to extract the truth of sex through the 
technique of confession, this was not simply because it was 
difficult to tell, or stricken by the taboos of decency, but 
because the ways of sex were obscure; it was elusive by 
nature; its energy and its mechanisms escaped observation, 
and its causal power was partly clandestine. By integrating 
it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth 
century altered the scope of the confession; it tended no 
longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished 
to hide, but with what was hidden from himself, being inca¬ 
pable of coming to light except gradually and through the 
labor of a confession in which the questioner and the ques¬ 
tioned each had a part to play. The principle of a latency 
essential to sexuality made it possible to link the forcing of
