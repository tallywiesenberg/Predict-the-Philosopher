Ischomachus recalls the first principle of marriage by 
citing the discourse he remembers having addressed to his 
young wife shortly after marriage, when she had become “ac¬ 
customed” to her husband and “domesticated to the extent 
that we could have discussions”: “Tell me, woman, have you 
thought yet why it was that I took you and your parents gave 
you to me?” Ischomachus answers the question himself: “I 
considered for myself, and your parents for you, whom we 
might take as the best partner for the household and chil¬ 
dren.” 11 The marriage bond is thus represented in its original 
dissymmetry—the man decides for himself whereas it is the 
family that decides for the young woman—and in its dual 
finality: the house and the children.We may note, further, that 
the question of descendants is left aside for the moment and 
that before being trained for motherhood, the young woman 
must become a good mistress of the house.12 And Ischoma¬ 
chus shows that this role is that of partner; the respective 
contribution of each does not have to be taken into considera¬ 
tion,* but only the way each one acts with a view to the 
common goal, which is “to keep their substance in the best 
condition but also to add as much as possible to it by fine and 
just means.” 14 One should note this emphasis on the necessary 
equalization of initial differences between the husband and the 
wife, and on the partnership that must be established between 
them; and yet it is clear that this community, this koinonia, 
is not established in the dual relation between two individuals, 

•Ischomachus stresses this cancelling of differences between spouses, differences that 
may be substantial in terms of what each partner contributes.1 ’

but is mediated by a common purpose, which is the household: 
its maintenance and also the dynamics of its increase.This will 
serve as a starting point for analyzing the forms of that “com¬ 
munity” and the specific nature of the roles that the two 
marriage partners should play.
