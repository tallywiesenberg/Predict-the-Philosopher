2.In order to define the respective functions of the two 
spouses in the household, Xenophon starts from the notion of 
the “shelter” (stegos): it seems that when the gods created the 
human couple, they were thinking of offspring and of the 
perpetuation of the race, of the support one needs in old age, 
and of the necessity “not to live in the open air, like beasts” 
—humans “obviously need shelter.” At first it looks as if 
descendants provide the family with its temporal dimension 
and shelter gives it its spatial organization.But things are a 
little more complex than that.The “shelter” does delimit an 
outside and an inside, the first being the man’s domain and the 
second constituting the privileged place of the woman; but it 
is also the place where they bring in, store, and preserve that 
which has been acquired; to shelter is to provide for future 
distribution at the right times.Outside, therefore, the man 
sows, cultivates, plows, and tends the flocks; he brings back 
the things he has produced, earned, or acquired through ex¬ 
change.
