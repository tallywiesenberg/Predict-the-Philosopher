Indoors, the woman for her part receives, preserves, 
and allocates according to need.Generally speaking, it is the 
husband’s activity that brings provisions into the house, but 
it is the wife’s management that regulates their expenditure.15 
The two roles are exactly complementary and the absence of 
one would make the other useless: “My guarding and distribu¬ 
tion of the indoor things would look somewhat ridiculous,” 
says the wife, “if it weren’t your concern to bring in something 
from outside.” To which the husband replies that if there were 
no one to keep secure the things that are brought into the 
house, he would look as ridiculous as “those who are said to 
draw water with a leaking jar.” 16 Thus, two places, two forms 
of activity, and two ways of organizing time: on one side (that

of the man), production, the rhythm of the seasons, waiting 
for the harvest, respecting and foreseeing the opportune time; 
on the other side (that of the woman), preservation and ex¬ 
penditure, ordering and distributing what is needed, orderly 
storage above all: Ischomachus dwells at length on all the 
advice he remembers giving his wife on how to store things in 
the space of the house so that she might find what she has put 
away, thus making her home a place of order and memory.In order that they might work together in the exercise of 
these different functions, the gods endowed each of the two 
sexes with particular qualities.Physical traits, first of all: to 
men, who must work in the open air “plowing, sowing, plant¬ 
ing, herding,” they gave the capacity to endure cold, heat, and 
journeys on foot; women, who work indoors, were given bod¬ 
ies that are less resistant.
