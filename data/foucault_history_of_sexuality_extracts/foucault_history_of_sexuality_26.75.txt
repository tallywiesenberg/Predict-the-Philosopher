This “law” declares good (kala) 
“what the god has brought forth each to be capable of”: hence 
“it is a finer thing [kallion \ for the woman to stay indoors than

to spend her time in the open” and not good for the man “to 
stay indoors instead of concerning himself with outdoor 
things.” To alter this division, going from one activity to the 
other, is to be in contempt of this nomos; it is at the same time 
to go against nature and to abandon one’s place: “When some¬ 
one acts in a way contrary to what the god has brought forth, 
perhaps in causing some disorder [atakton ] he is noticed by 
the gods and pays the penalty for neglecting his own works or 
for doing the woman’s works.” 19 The natural oppositeness of 
man and woman and the specificity of their aptitudes are 
indissociably tied to the good order of the household; they are 
designed for this order, and inversely, order demands them as 
obligations.3.This text, so detailed when it is a matter of determining 
the division of household tasks, is quite discrete on the ques¬ 
tion of sexual relations, both in terms of their place in the 
marital relationship and in regard to the prohibitions that 
might result from marriage as such.It is not that the impor¬ 
tance of having descendants is neglected; the fact is noted 
several times in the course of Ischomachus’ speech: he re¬ 
marks that it is one of the main objectives of marriage;* he also 
points out that nature has endowed the woman with a special 
affection that makes her better suited to take care of children; 
and he remarks how fortunate it is when one grows old to find 
the support that one needs in one’s children.21 But nothing is 
said in this text about either procreation itself or the precau¬ 
tions to take in order to have the finest possible offspring: it 
is not yet time to take up this kind of question with the young 
bride.
