22 But Critobulus prides himself on hav¬ 
ing already defeated these enemies; his moral training has 
supplied him with a sufficient amount of enkrateia: “On exam¬ 
ining myself I seem to find I am fairly self-controlled in such 
matters, so that if you advise me about what I might do to 
increase my household, it seems to me I wouldn’t be prevented 
from doing it, at least by those things you call mistresses.” 23 
This is what entitles Critobulus to say that he is now ready to 
play the role of master of a household and to learn the difficult 
tasks that are involved.It has to be understood that marriage, 
the functions of a head of a family, and the government of an 
oikos presuppose that one has acquired the ability to govern 
oneself.Further on, in Ischomachus’ listing of different qualities 
with which nature has supplied each of the two sexes in order 
for them to play their domestic roles, he mentions self-control 
(enkrateia).He does not describe it as a trait belonging specifi¬ 
cally to the man or the woman, but as a virtue common to both 
sexes, like memory and diligence; individual differences may 
modulate the distribution of this quality; and what shows its 
high value in married life is that it is awarded to the better of 
the marriage partners: be it the husband or the wife, the better 
one has the larger share of this virtue.24 

Now, in the case of Ischomachus, we see how his self- 
restraint is manifested for its own sake and how it guides that 
of his wife.
