form of a lesson, one day when, thinking to please him (by 
seeming to have “a fairer complexion” than she really has, 
“rosier” cheeks, and a “taller and more slender” figure), his 
wife appears before him perched on high sandals and all made 
up with ceruse and alkanet dye.Ischomachus will respond to 
this reprehensible behavior by giving a two-part lesson.
