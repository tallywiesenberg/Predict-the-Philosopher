This is brought out very clearly in what we might call a 
“physiologization” of desire and pleasure. Chapter Nine of 
Book XIV of On the Usefulness of the Parts poses the question: 
“Why is a very great pleasure coupled with the exercise of the 
generative parts?” From the outset Galen rejects the idea that 
the vehemence of desire and the intensity of pleasure could 
simply have been associated with the sexual act by the will of 
the creating gods as a means of inciting men to its perform¬ 
ance. Galen does not deny that the demiurgic power so ar¬ 
ranged things that there would be that intensity which sweeps 
us along. He means that it was not added in the soul as a 
supplement, but that it was most certainly planned as an 
integral consequence of the mechanisms of the body. Desire 
and pleasure are direct effects of anatomical dispositions and 
physical processes. The final cause—which is the continuation 
of the generations—is pursued through a material cause and 
an organic arrangement: “For animals acquired this desire 
and pleasure not simply because the gods that formed us 
wished a vehement desire for love to be born in us or a vehe-

ment pleasure to be coupled with it, but because a suitable 
material and instruments had been prepared for this pur¬ 
pose.” 6 Desire is not just a movement of the soul, nor is 
pleasure a reward added in as something extra. They are the 
effects of a pressure and a sudden evacuation. Galen sees 
several pleasure factors in this mechanism. First, there is the 
accumulation of a humor of such a nature that it provokes 
intense sensations in those parts where it collects. “It is the 
sort of thing that happens when serous humors are heated, as 
they frequently are, especially when acrid humors collect 
under the skin of the animal and then itch and make it scratch 
and enjoy the scratching.” 7 One must also take into account 
the heat that is particularly strong in the lower part, and 
singularly so on the right side because of the nearness of the 
liver and the large number of vessels that come from it. This 
dissymmetry with regard to heat explains the fact that boys 
are formed most frequently in the right uterus and girls in the 
left. 8 It also explains why the parts on the right side are more 
apt to be the locus of intense pleasure. In any case, Nature 
gave the organs of this area a special sensitivity, much greater 
than that of the skin, despite their having the same functions.
