This is brought out very clearly in what we might call a 
“physiologization” of desire and pleasure. Chapter Nine of 
Book XIV of On the Usefulness of the Parts poses the question: 
“Why is a very great pleasure coupled with the exercise of the 
generative parts?” From the outset Galen rejects the idea that 
the vehemence of desire and the intensity of pleasure could 
simply have been associated with the sexual act by the will of 
the creating gods as a means of inciting men to its perform¬ 
ance. Galen does not deny that the demiurgic power so ar¬ 
ranged things that there would be that intensity which sweeps 
us along. He means that it was not added in the soul as a 
supplement, but that it was most certainly planned as an 
integral consequence of the mechanisms of the body. Desire 
and pleasure are direct effects of anatomical dispositions and 
physical processes. The final cause—which is the continuation 
of the generations—is pursued through a material cause and 
an organic arrangement: “For animals acquired this desire 
and pleasure not simply because the gods that formed us 
wished a vehement desire for love to be born in us or a vehe-

ment pleasure to be coupled with it, but because a suitable 
material and instruments had been prepared for this pur¬ 
pose.” 6 Desire is not just a movement of the soul, nor is 
pleasure a reward added in as something extra. They are the 
effects of a pressure and a sudden evacuation. Galen sees 
several pleasure factors in this mechanism. First, there is the 
accumulation of a humor of such a nature that it provokes 
intense sensations in those parts where it collects. “It is the 
sort of thing that happens when serous humors are heated, as 
they frequently are, especially when acrid humors collect 
under the skin of the animal and then itch and make it scratch 
and enjoy the scratching.” 7 One must also take into account 
the heat that is particularly strong in the lower part, and 
singularly so on the right side because of the nearness of the 
liver and the large number of vessels that come from it. This 
dissymmetry with regard to heat explains the fact that boys 
are formed most frequently in the right uterus and girls in the 
left. 8 It also explains why the parts on the right side are more 
apt to be the locus of intense pleasure. In any case, Nature 
gave the organs of this area a special sensitivity, much greater 
than that of the skin, despite their having the same functions. 
Lastly, the much thinner humor coming from the glandular 
bodies Galen calls parastata constitutes an additional material 
factor of pleasure. This humor, by permeating the parts in¬ 
volved in the sexual act, makes them more elastic and height¬ 
ens the pleasure they experience. There is, then, a whole 
anatomical disposition and a whole physiological design that 
inscribe in the body and its specific mechanisms pleasure with 
its excessive vigor (hyperoche tes hedones), which cannot be 
resisted: it is amechanos . 9 

But even though the formation of pleasure is firmly an¬ 
chored and precisely localized in this way, it is no less true 
that, by virtue of the elements it brings into play and the 
consequences it entails, the sexual act involves the entire body. 
Galen does not hold, as does the Hippocratic author of De 
generation, that the sperm is formed by agitation occurring 
in the bloodstream; nor does he believe, as does Aristotle, that

it constitutes the final state of digestion. In his view, it com¬ 
bines two elements: first, the product of a certain “coction” of 
the blood that is effected in the coils of the spermatic channels 
(it is this slow elaboration that gradually gives it its color and 
consistency); and second, the presence of the pneuma: it is the 
pneuma that swells the sexual organs, it is the pneuma that 
seeks to exit violently from the body and escapes in the sperm 
at the moment of ejaculation. Now, this pneuma is formed in 
the complex labyrinth of the brain. The sexual act, when it 
takes place and thus withdraws sperm and pneuma, acts on 
the general mechanism of the body, where all the elements are 
linked “as in a chorus.” And, “when, as a result of venereal 
excesses, all the sperm has been evacuated, the testicles draw 
from the veins above them all the seminal fluid which they 
contain. Now, this liquid is found there only in small quanti¬ 
ties, mixed with the blood in the form of dew.” These veins, 
“violently deprived of this fluid by the testicles, which have a 
more energetic action than they, in turn draw the liquid away 
from the veins situated above them, these draw it from the 
next ones, and the latter from those that are adjacent to them. 
This movement of attraction does not stop before the transfer 
has been propagated in all parts of the body.” And if this 
expenditure continues, the body is not simply deprived of its 
seminal fluid: “all the parts of the animal find themselves
