robbed of their vital breath.” 10 

3. We can thus understand the cluster of relations that are 
established in Galen’s thought between the sexual act and the 
phenomena of epilepsy and convulsions: relations of affinity, 
analogy, and causality. 

The sexual act belongs, by reason of its mechanism, to the 
large family of convulsions, the theory of which is given in the 
treatise On the Affected Parts . 11 In that work Galen analyzes 
the process of convulsion as being of the same nature as any 
other involuntary movement; the difference lies in the fact that 
the traction exerted by the nerve on the muscle does not 
originate in the will but in a certain condition of dryness

(which draws the nerve tight, like a leather cord left in the sun) 
or repletion (which by swelling the nerves shortens them and 
pulls excessively on the muscles). It is to this last type of 
mechanism that the spasm peculiar to the sexual act is as¬ 
similated. 

In this large family of convulsions, Galen identifies a partic¬ 
ular analogy between epilepsy and the sexual act. For him, 
epilepsy is caused by a congestion of the brain, which finds 
itself completely filled by a thick humor: whence the obstruc¬ 
tion of the channels that leave the ventricles where the 
pneuma resides. The latter is therefore imprisoned by this 
accumulation and it tries to escape, just as it strains to get out 
when it has collected with the sperm in the testicles. It is this 
attempt that is the source of the agitation of the nerves and 
muscles that one can witness, with varying proportions, in 
epileptic seizures or in the performance of the aphrodisia. 

Finally, there is, between the aphrodisia and convulsive 
attacks, a relation of causality that can be established in either 
direction. The epileptic convulsion can lead to a spasm in the 
sexual organs: “From severe attacks of epilepsy,” says Galen 
in the treatise On the Usefulness of the Parts, “and from the 
disease called gonorrhea you may learn how great a power the 
spasm, so to speak, of the parts that accompanies the sexual 
act has to expel what they contain. For in violent attacks of 
epilepsy semen is expelled because the whole body and with 
it the generative parts are strongly convulsed.” 12 Conversely, 
indulgence in the sexual pleasures at the wrong time can in¬ 
duce illnesses of the convulsive type by causing a gradual 
drying and an ever greater tension of the nerves. 

In the great edifice of Galenic theory, the aphrodisia appear 
to be situated on three successive planes. First, they are firmly 
anchored in the order of demiurgic providence: they were 
conceived and positioned at that precise point where the crea¬ 
tor’s wisdom came to the rescue of her power, in order to 
transcend the limits she encountered in death. Second, they 
are placed within an interplay of complex and constant corre-

lations with the body, both by the precise anatomical location 
of their processes and by the effects they produce in the overall 
economy of the pneuma, which ensures the unity of the body. 
Lastly, they are situated in a vast field of affinity with a group 
of diseases, within which they maintain relations of analogy 
and a relationship of cause to effect. A clearly visible thread 
extends, in Galen’s analyses, from a cosmology of reproduc¬ 
tion to a pathology of spasmodic excretions. And from the 
natural foundation of the aphrodisia, it leads to an analysis of 
the perilous mechanisms that constitute their intrinsic nature 
and associate them with dread diseases.

Are They Good? 
Are They Bad? 


This ambiguity in medical thought concerning the sexual 
pleasures is not peculiar to Galen, although it is more discern¬ 
ible in him than elsewhere. It characterizes the essential part 
of what remains of the medical texts of the first and second 
centuries. In reality it is an ambivalence rather than an ambi¬ 
guity, for what is involved is the interweaving of two antitheti¬ 
cal valuations.
