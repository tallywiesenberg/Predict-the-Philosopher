it the generative parts are strongly convulsed.” 12 Conversely, 
indulgence in the sexual pleasures at the wrong time can in¬ 
duce illnesses of the convulsive type by causing a gradual 
drying and an ever greater tension of the nerves. 

In the great edifice of Galenic theory, the aphrodisia appear 
to be situated on three successive planes. First, they are firmly 
anchored in the order of demiurgic providence: they were 
conceived and positioned at that precise point where the crea¬ 
tor’s wisdom came to the rescue of her power, in order to 
transcend the limits she encountered in death. Second, they 
are placed within an interplay of complex and constant corre-

lations with the body, both by the precise anatomical location 
of their processes and by the effects they produce in the overall 
economy of the pneuma, which ensures the unity of the body. 
Lastly, they are situated in a vast field of affinity with a group 
of diseases, within which they maintain relations of analogy 
and a relationship of cause to effect. A clearly visible thread 
extends, in Galen’s analyses, from a cosmology of reproduc¬ 
tion to a pathology of spasmodic excretions. And from the 
natural foundation of the aphrodisia, it leads to an analysis of 
the perilous mechanisms that constitute their intrinsic nature 
and associate them with dread diseases.

Are They Good? 
Are They Bad? 


This ambiguity in medical thought concerning the sexual 
pleasures is not peculiar to Galen, although it is more discern¬ 
ible in him than elsewhere. It characterizes the essential part 
of what remains of the medical texts of the first and second 
centuries. In reality it is an ambivalence rather than an ambi¬ 
guity, for what is involved is the interweaving of two antitheti¬ 
cal valuations.
