First, on the positive side, there is the valorization of semen, 
of sperm—that precious substance which Nature, when she 
designed the human body, took so many precautions in form¬ 
ing. It gathers up all that is powerful in life and transmits it, 
thereby enabling us to cheat death. It is in the male that it 
reaches its greatest strength and its highest perfection. And it 
is this substance that gives him his superiority. It contributes 
“to health, strength, courage, and generation.” 1 The male is 
preeminent because he is the spermatic animal par excellence. 

There is also a valorization of the act for which, in both 
sexes, the organs were so carefully arranged. Sexual union is 
a fact of nature; it cannot be considered bad. Rufus of Ephesus 
expresses a general opinion when he says that sexual inter¬ 
course is a natural act, and that consequently it cannot be 
harmful in itself. 2 

But in a sense it is only the possibility and the principle of 
the act that are validated in this way. For as soon as the act 
takes place, it is, in its unfolding, regarded as intrinsically

dangerous. Dangerous because it is a wasting of that precious 
substance whose accumulation nevertheless incites one to 
commit it—it allows all the life force that the semen has 
concentrated to escape. Dangerous, too, because its very un¬ 
folding makes it akin to a disease. Aretaeus had a meaningful 
phrase for this: the sexual act, he said, “bears the symbola ” of 
epilepsy. 3 Caelius Aurelianus compared, term by term, the 
unfolding of the sexual act and the development of an epileptic 
seizure, finding exactly the same phases in both: “various parts 
are subjected to spasms, and at the same time there occur 
panting, sweating, rolling of the eyes and flushing of the face, 
and finally a feeling of malaise along with pallor, weakness, or 
dejection.” 4 Such is the paradox of the sexual pleasures: the 
high function Nature assigned them, the value of the sub¬ 
stance they have to transmit and therefore lose—this is the 
very thing that relates them to sickness. The physicians of the 
first and second centuries were not the first nor the only ones 
to formulate this ambivalence. But around it, they described 
an entire pathology, more developed, more complex, and 
more systematic than that attested in the past. 

1. The pathology of sexual activity itself is constructed 
around two elements by which the dangers of the sexual act 
are usually characterized: an involuntary violence of tension 
and an indefinite, exhausting expenditure. 

On the one hand, there is the disease that is marked by a 
constant excitation, which restrains the act while indefinitely 
prolonging the mechanism of stimulation. In the male version 
of this kind of affliction—designated as satyriasis or priapism 
—all the mechanisms that prepare the sexual act and ejacula¬ 
tion (tensions, agitations, heatings) are brought together and 
maintained in a continuous fashion, whether or not there is an 
evacuation of sperm: a sexual erethism that is never resolved. 
The patient is in a state of constant convulsion, traversed by 
extreme attacks, which closely resemble epilepsy. Aretaeus’ 
description can serve as a testimony of the way in which 
people perceived this strange disease where the sexual act is

as though left to itself in a timeless and boundless movement; 
its convulsive, epileptic nature is revealed there in the raw 
state, as it were: “It is a disease in which the patient has 
erection of the genital organ. ... It is an unrestrainable im¬ 
pulse to connection; but neither are they at all relieved by 
those embraces, nor is the tentigo soothed by many and re¬ 
peated acts of sexual intercourse. Spasms of all the nerves, and 
tension of all the tendons, groins, and perineum, inflammation 
and pain of the genital parts.” This constant state is punc¬ 
tuated by attacks. The patients then lose “all restraint of 
tongue as regards obscenity, and likewise all restraint in re¬ 
gard to the open performance of the act...; they vomit much 
phlegm. Afterwards, froth settles on their lips, as is the case 
with goats in the season of rutting, and the smell likewise is 
similar.” Their minds lapse into madness, and they do not 
come to their ordinary senses again until the paroxysm has 
ended. 5 Galen, in his treatise On the Affected Parts, gives a 
much more sober description of satyriasis: “Priapism is an 
increase in the length and circumference of the male genitalia 
without sexual desire and without the acquired increase in 
heat which some people experience in the recumbent position. 
Other physicians describe it in the following manner, which
