First, on the positive side, there is the valorization of semen, 
of sperm—that precious substance which Nature, when she 
designed the human body, took so many precautions in form¬ 
ing. It gathers up all that is powerful in life and transmits it, 
thereby enabling us to cheat death. It is in the male that it 
reaches its greatest strength and its highest perfection. And it 
is this substance that gives him his superiority. It contributes 
“to health, strength, courage, and generation.” 1 The male is 
preeminent because he is the spermatic animal par excellence. 

There is also a valorization of the act for which, in both 
sexes, the organs were so carefully arranged. Sexual union is 
a fact of nature; it cannot be considered bad. Rufus of Ephesus 
expresses a general opinion when he says that sexual inter¬ 
course is a natural act, and that consequently it cannot be 
harmful in itself. 2 

But in a sense it is only the possibility and the principle of 
the act that are validated in this way. For as soon as the act 
takes place, it is, in its unfolding, regarded as intrinsically

dangerous. Dangerous because it is a wasting of that precious 
substance whose accumulation nevertheless incites one to 
commit it—it allows all the life force that the semen has 
concentrated to escape. Dangerous, too, because its very un¬ 
folding makes it akin to a disease. Aretaeus had a meaningful 
phrase for this: the sexual act, he said, “bears the symbola ” of 
epilepsy. 3 Caelius Aurelianus compared, term by term, the 
unfolding of the sexual act and the development of an epileptic 
seizure, finding exactly the same phases in both: “various parts 
are subjected to spasms, and at the same time there occur 
panting, sweating, rolling of the eyes and flushing of the face, 
and finally a feeling of malaise along with pallor, weakness, or 
dejection.” 4 Such is the paradox of the sexual pleasures: the 
high function Nature assigned them, the value of the sub¬ 
stance they have to transmit and therefore lose—this is the 
very thing that relates them to sickness. The physicians of the 
first and second centuries were not the first nor the only ones 
to formulate this ambivalence. But around it, they described 
an entire pathology, more developed, more complex, and
