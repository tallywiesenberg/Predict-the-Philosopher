more systematic than that attested in the past. 

1. The pathology of sexual activity itself is constructed 
around two elements by which the dangers of the sexual act 
are usually characterized: an involuntary violence of tension 
and an indefinite, exhausting expenditure. 

On the one hand, there is the disease that is marked by a 
constant excitation, which restrains the act while indefinitely 
prolonging the mechanism of stimulation. In the male version 
of this kind of affliction—designated as satyriasis or priapism 
—all the mechanisms that prepare the sexual act and ejacula¬ 
tion (tensions, agitations, heatings) are brought together and 
maintained in a continuous fashion, whether or not there is an 
evacuation of sperm: a sexual erethism that is never resolved. 
The patient is in a state of constant convulsion, traversed by 
extreme attacks, which closely resemble epilepsy. Aretaeus’ 
description can serve as a testimony of the way in which 
people perceived this strange disease where the sexual act is

as though left to itself in a timeless and boundless movement; 
its convulsive, epileptic nature is revealed there in the raw 
state, as it were: “It is a disease in which the patient has 
erection of the genital organ. ... It is an unrestrainable im¬ 
pulse to connection; but neither are they at all relieved by 
those embraces, nor is the tentigo soothed by many and re¬ 
peated acts of sexual intercourse. Spasms of all the nerves, and 
tension of all the tendons, groins, and perineum, inflammation 
and pain of the genital parts.” This constant state is punc¬ 
tuated by attacks. The patients then lose “all restraint of 
tongue as regards obscenity, and likewise all restraint in re¬ 
gard to the open performance of the act...; they vomit much 
phlegm. Afterwards, froth settles on their lips, as is the case 
with goats in the season of rutting, and the smell likewise is 
similar.” Their minds lapse into madness, and they do not 
come to their ordinary senses again until the paroxysm has 
ended. 5 Galen, in his treatise On the Affected Parts, gives a 
much more sober description of satyriasis: “Priapism is an 
increase in the length and circumference of the male genitalia 
without sexual desire and without the acquired increase in 
heat which some people experience in the recumbent position. 
Other physicians describe it in the following manner, which
