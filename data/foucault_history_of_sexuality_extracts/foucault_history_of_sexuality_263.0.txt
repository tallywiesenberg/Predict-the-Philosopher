is a shorter definition: a persisting increase of the external 
genitals or a persisting swelling.” 6 The cause of this disease is 
to be understood, according to Galen, from the mechanisms 
of erection, which means that it will be found in “the dilated 
orifices of the arteries” or in “the formation of the pneuma in 
the nerve.” Actually, Galen allows for both causes and their 
convergence in the genesis of symptoms. But he is most often 
inclined to blame the dilation of arteries, which is, according 
to him, a phenomenon that occurs much more frequently than 
that involving the pneuma “in the cavernous nerve.” This 
kind of disease is found in those who “have too much sperm” 
and who, contrary to their usual habits, “abstain from inter¬ 
course” (unless they find a means of “dissipating in numerous 
occupations the surplus quantity of their blood”), or in those 
who, while practicing self-control, imagine sexual pleasures

after seeing certain spectacles or as a result of recurring 
memories. 

Satyriasis in women is sometimes mentioned. Soranus en¬ 
counters the same type of symptoms in such cases; they take 
the form of an “intense itching of the genitals.” Women 
afflicted with this ailment are moved by “an irresistible desire 
for sexual intercourse,” which “throws aside all sense of 
shame.” 7 But it is doubtless hysteria that best represents the 
excessive tension of the sexual organs. In any case, that is how 
Galen describes an affliction in which he declines to see a 
movement of the uterus. The changes that have made some 
people think that the desiccated organ draws up toward the 
diaphragm in search of the moisture it lacks are due, accord¬ 
ing to him, either to retention of the menstrual flow or to 
retention of sperm. The obstruction of the vessels may cause 
them to become enlarged and hence shortened. A traction is 
thus brought to bear on the uterus. But it is not this process 
in itself which provokes the set of other symptoms; these all 
stem from the retention of humors that occurs, either when 
menstruation is suspended or when the woman interrupts her 
sexual relations: whence the hysteria that one can observe in 
widowed women, “particularly those who previously men¬ 
struated regularly, had been pregnant, and were eager for 
intercourse, but were now deprived of all this.” 8 

The other pole of the pathology is constituted by unlimited 
expenditure. This is what the Greeks call gonorrhea and the 
Latins seminis effusio. Galen defines it thus: “an involuntary 
discharge of sperm,” or “to be more definite, a continuous 
discharge of semen without erection of the penis.” Whereas 
satyriasis attacks the penis, gonorrhea affects the spermatic 
vessels, paralyzing their “retentive faculty.” 9 Aretaeus de¬ 
scribes it at length in On the Causes and Signs of Chronic 
Diseases as the exhaustion of the vital principles, its three 
effects being a general loss of strength, premature aging, and 
a feminization of the body. “Young persons, when they suffer 
from this affection, necessarily become old in constitution, 
torpid, dull, spiritless, enfeebled, shriveled, inactive, pale whit-

ish, effeminate, loathe their food, and become frigid; they have 
heaviness of the members, torpidity of the legs, are powerless, 
and incapable of all exertion. In many cases, this disease is the 
way to paralysis; for how could the nervous power not suffer 
when nature has become frigid in regard to the generation of 
life? For it is the semen, when possessed of vitality, which 
makes us men, hot, well-braced in limbs, hairy, well-voiced, 
spirited, strong to think and to act, as the characteristics of 
men prove. For when the semen is not possessed of its vitality, 
persons become shriveled, have a sharp tone of voice, lose 
their hair and their beard, and become effeminate.” 10 With 
gonorrhea it is virility, the life principle, that is lost via the 
genitals. Hence the traits that are traditionally associated with 
it. It is a shameful disease—no doubt because it is often in¬ 
duced by a quantitative excess of sexual activity. But it is also 
shameful in itself because of the appearance of emasculation 
it produces. It is a disease that leads inevitably to death. Celsus 
says that in a short time it causes the patient to die of con¬ 
sumption. 11 Finally, it is a disease that is perilous not just for 
the individual but, according to Aretaeus, for his offspring as 
well. 12 

2. Beyond the particular sphere of their pathology, sexual 
acts are placed, by the medicine of the first two centuries, at 
the junction of a complex pathology. On the one hand, sexual 
acts are susceptible of being affected, in their unfolding and 
their satisfactory conclusion, by an abundance of diverse fac¬ 
tors: there is the temperament of the individuals; there is the
