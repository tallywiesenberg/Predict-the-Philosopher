is a shorter definition: a persisting increase of the external 
genitals or a persisting swelling.” 6 The cause of this disease is 
to be understood, according to Galen, from the mechanisms 
of erection, which means that it will be found in “the dilated 
orifices of the arteries” or in “the formation of the pneuma in 
the nerve.” Actually, Galen allows for both causes and their 
convergence in the genesis of symptoms. But he is most often 
inclined to blame the dilation of arteries, which is, according 
to him, a phenomenon that occurs much more frequently than 
that involving the pneuma “in the cavernous nerve.” This 
kind of disease is found in those who “have too much sperm” 
and who, contrary to their usual habits, “abstain from inter¬ 
course” (unless they find a means of “dissipating in numerous 
occupations the surplus quantity of their blood”), or in those 
who, while practicing self-control, imagine sexual pleasures

after seeing certain spectacles or as a result of recurring

Satyriasis in women is sometimes mentioned. Soranus en¬ 
counters the same type of symptoms in such cases; they take 
the form of an “intense itching of the genitals.” Women 
afflicted with this ailment are moved by “an irresistible desire 
for sexual intercourse,” which “throws aside all sense of 
shame.” 7 But it is doubtless hysteria that best represents the 
excessive tension of the sexual organs. In any case, that is how 
Galen describes an affliction in which he declines to see a 
movement of the uterus. The changes that have made some 
people think that the desiccated organ draws up toward the 
diaphragm in search of the moisture it lacks are due, accord¬ 
ing to him, either to retention of the menstrual flow or to 
retention of sperm. The obstruction of the vessels may cause 
them to become enlarged and hence shortened. A traction is 
thus brought to bear on the uterus. But it is not this process 
in itself which provokes the set of other symptoms; these all 
stem from the retention of humors that occurs, either when 
menstruation is suspended or when the woman interrupts her 
sexual relations: whence the hysteria that one can observe in 
widowed women, “particularly those who previously men¬ 
struated regularly, had been pregnant, and were eager for 
intercourse, but were now deprived of all this.” 8
