The other pole of the pathology is constituted by unlimited 
expenditure. This is what the Greeks call gonorrhea and the 
Latins seminis effusio. Galen defines it thus: “an involuntary 
discharge of sperm,” or “to be more definite, a continuous 
discharge of semen without erection of the penis.” Whereas 
satyriasis attacks the penis, gonorrhea affects the spermatic 
vessels, paralyzing their “retentive faculty.” 9 Aretaeus de¬ 
scribes it at length in On the Causes and Signs of Chronic 
Diseases as the exhaustion of the vital principles, its three 
effects being a general loss of strength, premature aging, and 
a feminization of the body. “Young persons, when they suffer 
from this affection, necessarily become old in constitution, 
torpid, dull, spiritless, enfeebled, shriveled, inactive, pale whit-

ish, effeminate, loathe their food, and become frigid; they have 
heaviness of the members, torpidity of the legs, are powerless, 
and incapable of all exertion. In many cases, this disease is the 
way to paralysis; for how could the nervous power not suffer 
when nature has become frigid in regard to the generation of 
life? For it is the semen, when possessed of vitality, which 
makes us men, hot, well-braced in limbs, hairy, well-voiced, 
spirited, strong to think and to act, as the characteristics of 
men prove. For when the semen is not possessed of its vitality, 
persons become shriveled, have a sharp tone of voice, lose 
their hair and their beard, and become effeminate.” 10 With 
gonorrhea it is virility, the life principle, that is lost via the 
genitals. Hence the traits that are traditionally associated with 
it. It is a shameful disease—no doubt because it is often in¬ 
duced by a quantitative excess of sexual activity. But it is also 
shameful in itself because of the appearance of emasculation 
it produces. It is a disease that leads inevitably to death. Celsus 
says that in a short time it causes the patient to die of con¬ 
sumption. 11 Finally, it is a disease that is perilous not just for 
the individual but, according to Aretaeus, for his offspring as 
well. 12 

2. Beyond the particular sphere of their pathology, sexual 
acts are placed, by the medicine of the first two centuries, at 
the junction of a complex pathology. On the one hand, sexual 
acts are susceptible of being affected, in their unfolding and 
their satisfactory conclusion, by an abundance of diverse fac¬ 
tors: there is the temperament of the individuals; there is the
