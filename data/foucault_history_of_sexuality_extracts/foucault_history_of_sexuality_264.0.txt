climate, the time of day; there is the food that one has in¬ 
gested, its quality and amount. The acts are so fragile that the 
least deviation, the least malaise, risks perturbing them. As 
Galen says, to experience the sexual pleasures, one ought to 
be in an exactly medial state, at the zero point, as it were, of 
all the possible organic variations: “beware of repletion and 
deficiency,” avoid “fatigue, indigestion, and anything, more¬ 
over, which might be suspect in consideration of a person’s 
health.” 13

But if the aphrodisia constitute such a fragile and precari¬ 
ous activity, they in return exert a substantial and quite exten¬ 
sive influence on the entire organism. The list of ailments, 
malaises, and diseases that can be engendered by the sexual 
pleasures if one commits a deviation, with respect either to 
time or measure, is virtually open. “It is not difficult,” says 
Galen, “to recognize that sexual relations are fatiguing for the 
chest, the lungs, the head and the nerves.” 14 Rufus submits a 
table in which are juxtaposed, as effects of an abuse of sexual 
relations, digestive disorders, a weakening of sight and hear¬ 
ing, a general weakness of the sense organs, and memory loss; 
convulsive trembling, pains of the joints, a stabbing pain in the 
side; aphtha in the mouth, toothaches, inflammation of the 
throat, spitting of blood, and kidney and bladder diseases. 15 It 
is concerning hysteria that Galen meets the objection of those 
who cannot believe that symptoms so numerous, so extensive, 
and so violent can be due to the retention or alteration of such 
a small amount of humor, which remains in the body as a 
result of the suspension of sexual relations. To which Galen 
replies by comparing the noxious powers of corrupted sperm 
to those of the virulent poisons that one observes in nature: 
“We can see that the entire body is affected by the bite of the 
venemous spider, although only an insignificant amount of 
venom enters through a very small opening.” The effect pro¬ 
duced by the scorpion is more surprising still, for the most 
violent symptoms declare themselves immediately; and yet, “a 
truly minimal amount or absolutely nothing is injected by the 
attacking stinger, the point of which seems to be without 
perforation.” The torpedo-fish is another example of this fact 
that “a minute quantity of some substance elicits a most pain¬ 
ful effect simply by contact.” And Galen concludes: “When, 
however, an affection involving our body originates inside and
