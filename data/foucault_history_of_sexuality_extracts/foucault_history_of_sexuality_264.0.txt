climate, the time of day; there is the food that one has in¬ 
gested, its quality and amount. The acts are so fragile that the 
least deviation, the least malaise, risks perturbing them. As 
Galen says, to experience the sexual pleasures, one ought to 
be in an exactly medial state, at the zero point, as it were, of 
all the possible organic variations: “beware of repletion and 
deficiency,” avoid “fatigue, indigestion, and anything, more¬ 
over, which might be suspect in consideration of a person’s 
health.” 13

But if the aphrodisia constitute such a fragile and precari¬ 
ous activity, they in return exert a substantial and quite exten¬ 
sive influence on the entire organism. The list of ailments, 
malaises, and diseases that can be engendered by the sexual 
pleasures if one commits a deviation, with respect either to 
time or measure, is virtually open. “It is not difficult,” says 
Galen, “to recognize that sexual relations are fatiguing for the 
chest, the lungs, the head and the nerves.” 14 Rufus submits a 
table in which are juxtaposed, as effects of an abuse of sexual 
relations, digestive disorders, a weakening of sight and hear¬ 
ing, a general weakness of the sense organs, and memory loss; 
convulsive trembling, pains of the joints, a stabbing pain in the 
side; aphtha in the mouth, toothaches, inflammation of the 
throat, spitting of blood, and kidney and bladder diseases. 15 It 
is concerning hysteria that Galen meets the objection of those 
who cannot believe that symptoms so numerous, so extensive, 
and so violent can be due to the retention or alteration of such 
a small amount of humor, which remains in the body as a 
result of the suspension of sexual relations. To which Galen 
replies by comparing the noxious powers of corrupted sperm 
to those of the virulent poisons that one observes in nature: 
“We can see that the entire body is affected by the bite of the 
venemous spider, although only an insignificant amount of 
venom enters through a very small opening.” The effect pro¬ 
duced by the scorpion is more surprising still, for the most 
violent symptoms declare themselves immediately; and yet, “a 
truly minimal amount or absolutely nothing is injected by the 
attacking stinger, the point of which seems to be without 
perforation.” The torpedo-fish is another example of this fact 
that “a minute quantity of some substance elicits a most pain¬ 
ful effect simply by contact.” And Galen concludes: “When, 
however, an affection involving our body originates inside and 
resembles the effect of the administration of a dangerous poi¬ 
son, then it is not astonishing that an abnormally composed 
semen or an equally abnormal menstrual discharge produces 
serious symptoms by stagnation or putrefaction in persons 
susceptible to such diseases.” 16 The organs, the humors, and

sexual acts constitute both a surface that is receptive and 
especially sensitive to anything capable of disturbing the orga¬ 
nism, and a very active focus for inducing a long series of 
polymorphous symptoms throughout the body. 

3. Sexual activity is a source of therapeutic effects as well 
as pathological consequences. Its ambivalence makes it capa¬ 
ble of healing in certain cases. In others, on the contrary, it 
is likely to lead to illnesses. But it is not always easy to de¬ 
termine which of the two effects it will have: a question 
of individual temperament; a question, too, of particular cir¬ 
cumstances and of the transitory state of the body. In general, 
theorists subscribe to the Hippocratic teaching that “sexual 
intercourse is excellent against diseases due to the phlegm.” 
And Rufus comments: “Many individuals who are emaciated 
as a result of an illness are restored by means of this practice. 
Some of them thereby regain an easy respiration, which had 
been obstructed, others recover the appetite for food which 
they had lost, still others achieve the cessation of contrary 
nocturnal emissions.” 17 He also credits the evacuation of 
sperm with positive effects on the soul when the latter is 
troubled and needs, like the body, to be purged of that which 
encumbers it: intercourse dissipates fixed ideas and pacifies 
violent fits of anger. This is why there does not exist a more 
eminently useful remedy against melancholy and misan¬ 
thropy. Galen also attributes to sexual relations a number of 
curative effects, on the soul as well as the body: “this act 
predisposes the soul to tranquillity. Indeed it restores the 
melancholy and furious man to a more sensible state, and in 
an amorous individual it dampens the too immoderate ardor, 
even when this man has intercourse with a different woman. 
Further, animals that are ferocious when they have given birth 
become calm after copulation.” As to their effectiveness for 
the body, Galen sees a proof of their action in the fact that, 
once sexual practice has begun, boys become “hairy, large, 
manly,” whereas before they were “smooth-skinned, small,
