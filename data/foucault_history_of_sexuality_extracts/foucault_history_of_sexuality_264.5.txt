son, then it is not astonishing that an abnormally composed 
semen or an equally abnormal menstrual discharge produces 
serious symptoms by stagnation or putrefaction in persons 
susceptible to such diseases.” 16 The organs, the humors, and

sexual acts constitute both a surface that is receptive and 
especially sensitive to anything capable of disturbing the orga¬ 
nism, and a very active focus for inducing a long series of 
polymorphous symptoms throughout the body. 

3. Sexual activity is a source of therapeutic effects as well 
as pathological consequences. Its ambivalence makes it capa¬ 
ble of healing in certain cases. In others, on the contrary, it 
is likely to lead to illnesses. But it is not always easy to de¬ 
termine which of the two effects it will have: a question 
of individual temperament; a question, too, of particular cir¬ 
cumstances and of the transitory state of the body. In general, 
theorists subscribe to the Hippocratic teaching that “sexual 
intercourse is excellent against diseases due to the phlegm.” 
And Rufus comments: “Many individuals who are emaciated 
as a result of an illness are restored by means of this practice. 
Some of them thereby regain an easy respiration, which had 
been obstructed, others recover the appetite for food which 
they had lost, still others achieve the cessation of contrary 
nocturnal emissions.” 17 He also credits the evacuation of 
sperm with positive effects on the soul when the latter is 
troubled and needs, like the body, to be purged of that which 
encumbers it: intercourse dissipates fixed ideas and pacifies 
violent fits of anger. This is why there does not exist a more 
eminently useful remedy against melancholy and misan¬ 
thropy. Galen also attributes to sexual relations a number of 
curative effects, on the soul as well as the body: “this act 
predisposes the soul to tranquillity. Indeed it restores the 
melancholy and furious man to a more sensible state, and in 
an amorous individual it dampens the too immoderate ardor, 
even when this man has intercourse with a different woman. 
Further, animals that are ferocious when they have given birth 
become calm after copulation.” As to their effectiveness for 
the body, Galen sees a proof of their action in the fact that, 
once sexual practice has begun, boys become “hairy, large, 
manly,” whereas before they were “smooth-skinned, small,
