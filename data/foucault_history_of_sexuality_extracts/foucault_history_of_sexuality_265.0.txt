and feminine.” 18

But Galen also remarks on the opposite effects that sexual 
relations may have according to the condition in which the 
subject finds himself: “intercourse reduces to extreme weak¬ 
ness those whose strength is inconsiderable while those whose 
strength is intact and who are sick through the effect of the 
phlegm will not be struck down by intercourse.” For a mo¬ 
ment “it makes weak people warm again, but afterwards it 
chills them considerably”; or further, whereas some, “already 
in their early youth, become instantly enfeebled by inter¬ 
course. Others, if they do not have regular sexual relations, 
feel heavy in the head, become nauseated and feverish, have 
a poor appetite and bad digestion.” 19 And Galen even men¬ 
tions the case of certain temperaments for which the evacua¬ 
tion of sperm provokes illnesses or malaises despite the fact 
that its retention is harmful: “Certain people have an abun¬ 
dant, warm sperm which incessantly arouses the need for 
excretion; however, after its expulsion, people who are in this 
state experience a languor at the stomach orifice, exhaustion, 
weakness, and dryness in the whole body. They become thin, 
their eyes grow hollow and if, because they have suffered these 
effects after intercourse, they abstain from sexual relations, 
they feel discomfort in the head and at the stomach orifice 
along with nausea, and they do not derive any significant 
advantage from their self-control.” 20 

Around these positive or negative effects, several debates 
developed concerning certain precise questions. For example, 
the question of nocturnal emissions. Rufus reports the opinion 
of those for whom these losses of semen during sleep are “less 
distressing.” But for his part, he opposes this conception, 
being of the opinion that “emissions relax the body even more, 
when it is already relaxed in sleep.” 21 And Galen does not see 
that anything is gained by those who, abstaining from inter¬ 
course because of its harmful effects, experience nocturnal 
emissions as a result. 22 More important no doubt was the 
debate concerning children’s convulsions and their cessation 
at the age of puberty. It had often been held that, because of 
the affinity between ejaculation and spasm, young boys

stricken with convulsions could be cured by the first sexual 
practice. This is the thesis of Rufus, who believes that epilepsy 
and headaches come to an end when a boy reaches puberty. 23 
As a therapy against these spasms, some physicians recom¬ 
mended making the age of the first sexual relations earlier for 
those children. Aretaeus criticizes this method, because it 
violates the designs of Nature, who appointed the proper 
times, and because it produces or prolongs the disease it aims 
to cure: physicians who give such advice “are ignorant of the 
spontaneous law of Nature by which all cures are accom¬ 
plished. For along with every age she produces that which is 
proper for it in due season. At a given time there is the matu¬ 
rity of semen, of the beard, of hoary hairs. For on the one hand 
what physician could alter Nature’s original change in regard 
to the semen, and, on the other, the appointed time for each? 
But they also offend against the nature of the disease; for being 
previously injured by the unseasonableness of the act, they are 
not possessed of seasonable powers at the proper commence¬ 
ment of the age for coition.” 24 If in fact the convulsions disap¬ 
pear at puberty, this is due not to the enjoyment of sexual 
pleasures, but to a general modification in the balance and role 
of the humors. 

4. But the most important consideration is doubtless the 
tendency to attribute positive effects to sexual abstention. It is 
true, as we have seen, that the physicians call attention to the 
disorders that can result from the practice of self-restraint. 
But they generally observe them in subjects who were accus¬ 
tomed to frequent sexual relations and in whom the cessation 
amounts to a sudden change of regimen. This is the case 
reported by Galen in the treatise On the Affected Parts, involv¬ 
ing a man who, breaking with all this previous habits, had 
given up sexual activity. 25 They are also observed in subjects 
whose sperm is affected by qualities that make its evacuation 
necessary. Galen has seen men who, through the effect of this 
deprivation, became “dull and inactive,” and others who, “for
