The Care of the Self 


stricken with convulsions could be cured by the first sexual 
practice. This is the thesis of Rufus, who believes that epilepsy 
and headaches come to an end when a boy reaches puberty. 23 
As a therapy against these spasms, some physicians recom¬ 
mended making the age of the first sexual relations earlier for 
those children. Aretaeus criticizes this method, because it 
violates the designs of Nature, who appointed the proper 
times, and because it produces or prolongs the disease it aims 
to cure: physicians who give such advice “are ignorant of the 
spontaneous law of Nature by which all cures are accom¬ 
plished. For along with every age she produces that which is 
proper for it in due season. At a given time there is the matu¬ 
rity of semen, of the beard, of hoary hairs. For on the one hand 
what physician could alter Nature’s original change in regard 
to the semen, and, on the other, the appointed time for each? 
But they also offend against the nature of the disease; for being 
previously injured by the unseasonableness of the act, they are 
not possessed of seasonable powers at the proper commence¬ 
ment of the age for coition.” 24 If in fact the convulsions disap¬ 
pear at puberty, this is due not to the enjoyment of sexual 
pleasures, but to a general modification in the balance and role 
of the humors. 

4. But the most important consideration is doubtless the 
tendency to attribute positive effects to sexual abstention. It is 
true, as we have seen, that the physicians call attention to the 
disorders that can result from the practice of self-restraint. 
But they generally observe them in subjects who were accus¬ 
tomed to frequent sexual relations and in whom the cessation 
amounts to a sudden change of regimen. This is the case 
reported by Galen in the treatise On the Affected Parts, involv¬ 
ing a man who, breaking with all this previous habits, had 
given up sexual activity. 25 They are also observed in subjects 
whose sperm is affected by qualities that make its evacuation 
necessary. Galen has seen men who, through the effect of this 
deprivation, became “dull and inactive,” and others who, “for
