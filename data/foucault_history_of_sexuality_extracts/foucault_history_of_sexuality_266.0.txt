no evident reason, had a sad and hopeless expression on their 
faces like melancholics.” These observations allow him to 
state that “the retention of sperm does considerable harm to 
young and strong individuals, in whom the sperm is naturally 
abundant and formed of humors that are not entirely faultless, 
who lead a somewhat lazy life, who had quite frequently 
indulged in sexual intercourse before, and who suddenly prac¬ 
tice continence.” 26 That abstention from all sexual relations is 
harmful to the organism is therefore not regarded as a general 
fact that might be observed in anyone, no matter who they 
might be, but rather as the consequence of certain particular 
facts pertaining either to the state of the organism or to a 
habitual mode of living. In itself, and without any other factor 
entering in, abstinence that retains the spermatic substance 
cannot reasonably be considered harmful. 

As concerns men, the high vital value granted to the sper¬ 
matic humor had long enabled people to attribute positive 
effects to the kind of rigorous self-restraint practiced by ath¬ 
letes. The example is still regularly cited. It was precisely in 
order to follow this model that a patient of Galen’s had de¬ 
cided to refrain from all sexual activity, without considering 
that up to then he had led a very different life and that the 
effects of this abstention could not therefore be comparable. 
Aretaeus, describing the beneficial effects of semen, that “vivi¬ 
fying humor”—it makes one manly, courageous, full of fire, 
robust; it gives a deep tone to the voice and makes one capable 
of vigorous action—asserts that a self-con trolled man “who 
retains his semen” thereby becomes “bold, daring, and strong 
as wild beasts.” He recalls the example of athletes or animals 
that are all the more vigorous because they keep their semen; 
thus, “such as are naturally superior in strength, by inconti¬ 
nence [akrasia ] become inferior to their inferiors; while those 
by nature much their inferiors by continence [enkrateia] be¬ 
come superior to their superiors [ kreittones ].” 27 

On the other hand, the values of abstinence were much less 
likely to be granted for women, given the fact that they were

considered to be socially and physiologically destined for mar¬ 
riage and procreation. Yet Soranus, in his Gynecology, cites 
the arguments of a debate, which seems to have been impor¬ 
tant in his day, on the advantages and disadvantages of virgin¬ 
ity. Those who criticize it call attention to the diseases that are 
due to humors that do not flow out and desires that are not 
extinguished by abstinence. The advocates of virginity point 
out, to the contrary, that women thereby avert the dangers of 
childbearing, are unacquainted with desire since they do not 
know pleasure, and keep within themselves the force that 
semen possesses. Soranus, for his part, concedes that virginity 
can have disadvantages. But he observes them for the most 
part in women who live “shut inside the temples” and are 
deprived of “the necessary exercises.” He contends that as a 
rule permanent virginity is healthy for both sexes. 28 Hence 
sexual union would not in his view have any natural justifica¬ 
tion in the health of individuals; only the obligation to main¬ 
tain the human race makes its practice necessary. It is “the 
general principle of nature” that requires it, more than per¬ 
sonal regimen. 

Sexual abstinence was not regarded as a duty, certainly, nor 
was the sexual act represented as an evil. But we see how, in 
the development of these themes that were already explicitly 
formulated by the medical and philosophical thought of the 
fourth century, a certain inflection occurred: an insistence on 
the ambiguity of the effects of sexual activity, an extension of 
the correlations attributed to it throughout the organism, an 
accentuation of its peculiar fragility and its pathogenic power, 
and a valorization of abstinent behaviors, for both sexes. In 
times past the dangers of sexual activity were perceived in 
connection with involuntary violence and careless expendi¬ 
ture. They are now described more as the effect of a general 
fragility of the human body and its functioning. 

We can understand, given these conditions, the importance 
that the regimen of the aphrodisia was apt to assume in the 
management of one’s personal life. On this point, Rufus makes 
a noteworthy statement, which links together, quite explicitly,
