no evident reason, had a sad and hopeless expression on their 
faces like melancholics.” These observations allow him to 
state that “the retention of sperm does considerable harm to 
young and strong individuals, in whom the sperm is naturally 
abundant and formed of humors that are not entirely faultless, 
who lead a somewhat lazy life, who had quite frequently 
indulged in sexual intercourse before, and who suddenly prac¬ 
tice continence.” 26 That abstention from all sexual relations is 
harmful to the organism is therefore not regarded as a general 
fact that might be observed in anyone, no matter who they 
might be, but rather as the consequence of certain particular 
facts pertaining either to the state of the organism or to a 
habitual mode of living. In itself, and without any other factor 
entering in, abstinence that retains the spermatic substance 
cannot reasonably be considered harmful. 

As concerns men, the high vital value granted to the sper¬ 
matic humor had long enabled people to attribute positive 
effects to the kind of rigorous self-restraint practiced by ath¬ 
letes. The example is still regularly cited. It was precisely in 
order to follow this model that a patient of Galen’s had de¬ 
cided to refrain from all sexual activity, without considering 
that up to then he had led a very different life and that the 
effects of this abstention could not therefore be comparable. 
Aretaeus, describing the beneficial effects of semen, that “vivi¬ 
fying humor”—it makes one manly, courageous, full of fire, 
robust; it gives a deep tone to the voice and makes one capable 
of vigorous action—asserts that a self-con trolled man “who 
retains his semen” thereby becomes “bold, daring, and strong 
as wild beasts.” He recalls the example of athletes or animals 
that are all the more vigorous because they keep their semen; 
thus, “such as are naturally superior in strength, by inconti¬ 
nence [akrasia ] become inferior to their inferiors; while those 
by nature much their inferiors by continence [enkrateia] be¬ 
come superior to their superiors [ kreittones ].” 27 

On the other hand, the values of abstinence were much less 
likely to be granted for women, given the fact that they were
