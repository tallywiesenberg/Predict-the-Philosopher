riage and procreation. Yet Soranus, in his Gynecology, cites 
the arguments of a debate, which seems to have been impor¬ 
tant in his day, on the advantages and disadvantages of virgin¬ 
ity. Those who criticize it call attention to the diseases that are 
due to humors that do not flow out and desires that are not 
extinguished by abstinence. The advocates of virginity point 
out, to the contrary, that women thereby avert the dangers of 
childbearing, are unacquainted with desire since they do not 
know pleasure, and keep within themselves the force that 
semen possesses. Soranus, for his part, concedes that virginity 
can have disadvantages. But he observes them for the most 
part in women who live “shut inside the temples” and are 
deprived of “the necessary exercises.” He contends that as a 
rule permanent virginity is healthy for both sexes. 28 Hence 
sexual union would not in his view have any natural justifica¬ 
tion in the health of individuals; only the obligation to main¬ 
tain the human race makes its practice necessary. It is “the 
general principle of nature” that requires it, more than per¬ 
sonal regimen. 

Sexual abstinence was not regarded as a duty, certainly, nor 
was the sexual act represented as an evil. But we see how, in 
the development of these themes that were already explicitly 
formulated by the medical and philosophical thought of the 
fourth century, a certain inflection occurred: an insistence on 
the ambiguity of the effects of sexual activity, an extension of 
the correlations attributed to it throughout the organism, an 
accentuation of its peculiar fragility and its pathogenic power, 
and a valorization of abstinent behaviors, for both sexes. In 
times past the dangers of sexual activity were perceived in 
connection with involuntary violence and careless expendi¬ 
ture. They are now described more as the effect of a general 
fragility of the human body and its functioning. 

We can understand, given these conditions, the importance 
that the regimen of the aphrodisia was apt to assume in the 
management of one’s personal life. On this point, Rufus makes 
a noteworthy statement, which links together, quite explicitly,

especially those who indulge without much caution need to
