take care of themselves in a much more rigorous fashion than 
others, so that, by putting their body in the best possible 
condition, they might experience less the harmful effects of 
these relations” (he ek ton aphrodision blabe ). 29

The Regimen of 
Pleasures 


Sexual acts must therefore be placed under an extremely 
careful regimen. But this regimen is very different from a 
prescriptive system that would try to define a “natural,” legiti¬ 
mate, and acceptable form of practice. It is remarkable that 
almost nothing is said in these regimens about the type of 
sexual acts that one may engage in or about those which 
Nature disfavors. Rufus, for example, mentions relations with 
boys in passing. He also alludes to the positions the partners 
can take, but he translates the dangers of these positions di¬ 
rectly into quantitative terms: they would demand a greater 
expenditure of strength than the others. 1 * Remarkable, too, is 
the fact that these regimens are more “concessive” than “nor¬ 
mative.” Rufus sets forth his regimen after having evoked the 
pathogenic effects of sexual activity—if it is exaggerated and 
practiced unduly—and after submitting that these acts “are 
not harmful absolutely, in every respect, provided that one 
considers the opportuneness of the act, the limit that is to be 
put on it, and the hygienic constitution of the person who 
performs it .” 2 And Galen says, also with a view to limitations, 
that he would not want that “people were completely prohib¬ 
ited from practicing sexual intercourse.” 3 ! These are circum¬ 
stantial regimens, which demand that one take great care to 

*Rufus also notes that the standing position is tiring. 

tNote, however, in Celsus, a moderate judgment: “Coition is neither to be desired 
overmuch, nor overmuch to be feared .” 4

determine the conditions that will least affect the whole com¬ 
bination of balances. Four variables are singled out: the auspi¬ 
cious occasion for procreation, the age of the subject, the time 
frame (the season or the hour of the day), and individual 
temperament. 

1. The regimen of the aphrodisia and procreation. An en¬ 
tirely traditional theme said that noble offspring— euteknia — 
could not be engendered unless one took a certain number of 
precautions. The disorders of conception would be reflected in 
one’s progeny. Not only because the descendants would re¬ 
semble their parents, but because they would bear the charac¬ 
teristics of the act that brought them into existence. We recall 
the recommendations of Aristotle and Plato on this point. 5 
That the sexual act, in its procreative finality, requires a good 
deal of care and a meticulous preparation is a principle that 
one finds again in the medical regimens of the imperial epoch. 
These regimens prescribe a long-term preparation first of all. 
This involves a general conditioning of the body and the soul 
designed to produce or maintain in the individual the qualities 
with which the semen will need to be imbued and by which 
the embryo will need to be marked. One must form oneself as 
the prior image of the child one wishes to have. A passage 
from Athenaeus, cited by Oribasius, is very explicit on this 
point: those who intend to beget children must have body and 
soul in the best possible condition. In other words, the soul 
must be tranquil and completely free of pain, of worries ac¬ 
companied by fatigue, and of any other affliction; and the body 
must be healthy and not spoiled in any way. 6 An immediate 
preparation is necessary as well: a period of restraint during 
which the sperm accumulates and gathers strength, while 
the urge acquires the necessary intensity (too-frequent sexual 
relations prevent the sperm from reaching the degree of elab¬ 
oration at which it becomes fully potent). A rather strict 
alimentary diet is recommended: no food that is too hot or too 
moist, just “a light meal which will give the impetus towards 
coitus, and which should not be overloaded with too many
