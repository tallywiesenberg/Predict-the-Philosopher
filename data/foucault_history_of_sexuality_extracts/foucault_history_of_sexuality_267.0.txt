others, so that, by putting their body in the best possible 
condition, they might experience less the harmful effects of 
these relations” (he ek ton aphrodision blabe ). 29

The Regimen of 
Pleasures 


Sexual acts must therefore be placed under an extremely 
careful regimen. But this regimen is very different from a 
prescriptive system that would try to define a “natural,” legiti¬ 
mate, and acceptable form of practice. It is remarkable that 
almost nothing is said in these regimens about the type of 
sexual acts that one may engage in or about those which 
Nature disfavors. Rufus, for example, mentions relations with 
boys in passing. He also alludes to the positions the partners 
can take, but he translates the dangers of these positions di¬ 
rectly into quantitative terms: they would demand a greater 
expenditure of strength than the others. 1 * Remarkable, too, is 
the fact that these regimens are more “concessive” than “nor¬ 
mative.” Rufus sets forth his regimen after having evoked the 
pathogenic effects of sexual activity—if it is exaggerated and 
practiced unduly—and after submitting that these acts “are 
not harmful absolutely, in every respect, provided that one 
considers the opportuneness of the act, the limit that is to be 
put on it, and the hygienic constitution of the person who 
performs it .” 2 And Galen says, also with a view to limitations, 
that he would not want that “people were completely prohib¬ 
ited from practicing sexual intercourse.” 3 ! These are circum¬ 
stantial regimens, which demand that one take great care to 

*Rufus also notes that the standing position is tiring. 

tNote, however, in Celsus, a moderate judgment: “Coition is neither to be desired 
overmuch, nor overmuch to be feared .” 4
