eral purification of the body that will ensure the quietude 
necessary to the sexual function. It is in this way that “the 
farmer sows only after having first cleansed the soil and 
removed any foreign material.” 7 Soranus, who gives this ad¬ 
vice, puts no trust in those who prescribe, for a good concep¬ 
tion, waiting until the period of the full moon; the essential 
thing is to choose “a time in which the body is neither in want 
nor overburdened, but in a satisfactory state in every respect” 
—both for physiological reasons (the harmful humors that 
rise up in the body may prevent the seed from adhering to the 
fundus of the uterus) and for ethical reasons (the embryo will 
be imbued with the condition of the procreators). 

There is, of course, a time more favorable than others in the 
woman’s cycle. According to a metaphor that is already quite 
ancient and that will still do long service in Christianity, 
“every season is not propitious for sewing seed upon the land 
for the purpose of bringing forth fruit, so in humans too not 
every time is suitable for conception of the seed discharged in 
intercourse.” 8 Soranus places this favorable time immediately 
after menstruation. His argumentation rests on the metaphor 
—which is not personal to him, moreover—of the appetite. 9 
The uterus is avid; it consumes, it loads itself with nutriment, 
sometimes with blood (the normal case), sometimes with seed 
(and fertilization occurs). To be procreative, the sexual act 
must take place at a favorable time in this alimentary rhythm. 
Not before menstruation, for “just as the stomach when over¬ 
burdened with some kind of material and turned to nausea is 
disposed to vomit what oppresses it and is averse to receiving 
food, so according to the same principle, the uterus, being 
congested at the time of menstruation, is well adapted for the 
evacuation of the blood which has flowed into it, but is unfitted 
for the reception and retention of the seed.” Not during men¬ 
strual evacuation, which constitutes a kind of natural vomit¬ 
ing, when the semen runs the risk of being swept out as well. 
Nor when the flow has completely stopped: the uterus, desic¬ 
cated and chilled, is then no longer in a condition to receive

the seed. The favorable time is when “the flow is ceasing,” so 
that the uterus is still moist with blood and permeated with 
warmth, “and hence turgescent with a craving to receive the 
sperm.” 10 This craving, which reappears in the body after 
purgation, is manifested in the woman by a desire that dis¬ 
poses her to sexual intercourse. 11 

But there is more still. For conception to occur in suitable 
conditions and for the offspring to have every possible quality, 
the sexual act itself must be performed with the observance of 
certain precautions. Soranus says nothing precise on this sub¬ 
ject. He simply indicates the necessity of a prudent and calm 
behavior, one that avoids all the disturbances, all the intoxica¬ 
tions that might be reflected in the embryo, since the latter 
would be a kind of mirror and witness of these excesses: 
“Thus, in order that the offspring may not be rendered mis¬ 
shapen, women must be sober during coitus because in drunk¬ 
enness the soul becomes the victim of strange phantasies; this 
furthermore, because the offspring bears some resemblance to 
the mother as well, not only in body but in soul. Therefore it 
is good that the offspring be made to resemble the soul when 
it is stable and not deranged by drunkenness.” 12 Finally, dur¬ 
ing pregnancy sexual relations must be extremely limited: 
completely discontinued in the first period, because inter¬ 
course “causes movement in the whole body in general and 
especially in the various parts about the uterus which need 
rest. For just as the stomach when quiet retains the food, but 
when shaken often ejects through vomiting what it has re¬ 
ceived, so also the uterus when not shaken holds fast the seed; 
when agitated, however, discharges it.” 13 Yet some physicians, 
such as Galen, consider it advisable to resume intercourse and 
practice it during pregnancy: “It is not good for pregnant 
women either to abstain from coitus or to return to it continu¬ 
ally: for in women who are abstinent childbirth becomes more 
difficult, whereas in those who constantly indulge in coitus the 
infant will be weak; there may even be a miscarriage.” 14 

Hence there is a whole government of the aphrodisia, whose 
principle and whose justification are in this preparation of

offspring. It is not that there is an obligation to practice sexual 
intercourse only in order to have children: if the conditions of 
probable conception are carefully laid down, this is not for the 
purpose of setting the limits of the legitimate act by means of 
them, but is meant to serve as useful advice for anyone who 
cares about their offspring. And if the latter are an important
