concern, this is in the form of a duty that the parents can 
assume with respect to them. It is also an obligation vis-a-vis 
themselves since it is advantageous for them to have offspring 
endowed with the best qualities. These obligations that sur¬ 
round procreation define a whole set of possible errors, which 
are at the same time faults. And they are so numerous, they 
bring in so many different factors, that few procreations would 
be successful were it not for Nature’s ability to compensate for 
these failings and to prevent disasters. At least this is how 
Galen justifies both the necessity of taking a large number of 
precautions and the fact that in spite of everything many 
births come off well: “How frequently in the fathers that beget 
and the mothers that bear us it must be not error that is rare 
but right-doing. For drunkards consort with drunkards, and 
men do not know their own whereabouts from repletion with 
women in the same state. Hence in this way the very beginning 
of our procreation is faulty; and then come the unspeakable 
errors of the pregnant woman, her indifference to proper exer¬ 
cise, her gluttony, passions, drunkenness, bathing, and un¬ 
timely indulgence in love [akarion aphrodision ]. Nevertheless, 
to such outrages Nature opposes many acts and performs 
them successfully.” Peasants are careful when they sow their 
fields; but, Galen notes, taking up the Socratic themes of the 
care of the self, humans who “take little heed of themselves” 
in their own lives are no longer concerned about their progeny 
either. 15 

2. The age of the subject. The practice of the aphrodisia 
must neither be continued too long nor begun too early. Sexual 
intercourse when one is old is dangerous: it exhausts a body 
no longer capable of reconstituting the elements that were

withdrawn from it. 16 But it is also harmful when one is too 
young. It arrests growth and disturbs the development of the 
signs of puberty—which are the result of the body’s develop¬ 
ment of the seminal elements. “Nothing hinders the progress 
of the soul and the body as does a premature and excessive 
practice of sexual intercourse.” 17 And Galen: “Many young 
people are attacked by incurable diseases due to sexual rela¬ 
tions because they insisted on violating the time prescribed by 
Nature.” 18 What is this “prescribed time”? Is it the appearance 
or confirmation of the signs of puberty? All the physicians are
