concern, this is in the form of a duty that the parents can 
assume with respect to them. It is also an obligation vis-a-vis 
themselves since it is advantageous for them to have offspring 
endowed with the best qualities. These obligations that sur¬ 
round procreation define a whole set of possible errors, which 
are at the same time faults. And they are so numerous, they 
bring in so many different factors, that few procreations would 
be successful were it not for Nature’s ability to compensate for 
these failings and to prevent disasters. At least this is how 
Galen justifies both the necessity of taking a large number of 
precautions and the fact that in spite of everything many 
births come off well: “How frequently in the fathers that beget 
and the mothers that bear us it must be not error that is rare 
but right-doing. For drunkards consort with drunkards, and 
men do not know their own whereabouts from repletion with 
women in the same state. Hence in this way the very beginning 
of our procreation is faulty; and then come the unspeakable 
errors of the pregnant woman, her indifference to proper exer¬ 
cise, her gluttony, passions, drunkenness, bathing, and un¬ 
timely indulgence in love [akarion aphrodision ]. Nevertheless, 
to such outrages Nature opposes many acts and performs 
them successfully.” Peasants are careful when they sow their 
fields; but, Galen notes, taking up the Socratic themes of the 
care of the self, humans who “take little heed of themselves” 
in their own lives are no longer concerned about their progeny 
either. 15 

2. The age of the subject. The practice of the aphrodisia 
must neither be continued too long nor begun too early. Sexual 
intercourse when one is old is dangerous: it exhausts a body 
no longer capable of reconstituting the elements that were

withdrawn from it. 16 But it is also harmful when one is too 
young. It arrests growth and disturbs the development of the 
signs of puberty—which are the result of the body’s develop¬ 
ment of the seminal elements. “Nothing hinders the progress 
of the soul and the body as does a premature and excessive 
practice of sexual intercourse.” 17 And Galen: “Many young 
people are attacked by incurable diseases due to sexual rela¬ 
tions because they insisted on violating the time prescribed by 
Nature.” 18 What is this “prescribed time”? Is it the appearance 
or confirmation of the signs of puberty? All the physicians are 
in agreement that puberty for boys is situated at about the age 
of fourteen. But all are in agreement as well that access to the 
aphrodisia should not be had so early. One finds scarcely any 
exact indication concerning the age at which one may begin 
sexual intercourse. In any case several years should pass dur¬ 
ing which the body is forming the seminal liquids without it 
being advisable to evacuate them. Whence the necessity of a 
specific regimen designed to ensure the self-control of adoles¬ 
cents. The physicians prescribe, in keeping with tradition, a 
life of intense physical exercise. Thus Athenaeus: “Since the 
production of sperm begins at that age [fourteen] and since 
young people have very strong cravings which incite them to 
sexual intercourse, physical exercises should be very numer¬ 
ous, so that tiring the body and the soul very quickly, they 
may repress their desires from the beginning.” 19 

The problem for girls is a little different. The practice of 
early marriage doubtless caused people to concede that the 
first sexual relations and childbearing could occur as soon as 
menstruation was regularly established. 20 This is the opinion 
of Soranus, who advises reliance on organic criteria in setting 
the age for marriage and not on the desires of the girls them¬ 
selves. Depending on education, these desires can awaken 
before the body is ready; “since the female conceives seed into 
the substance of a living being,” there is a danger when the 
body of the woman has not reached the maturity necessary to 
this function; so it is good that she remain a virgin until 
menstruation has been established spontaneously. 21 Other

The Care of the Self 


physicians envisage a much later date. Thus Rufus of Ephesus 
considers that a pregnancy before the age of eighteen risks 
being unfavorable to mother and child alike. He recalls that 
this is the age recommended long ago by Hesiod; and he points 
out that this age—quite late in the eyes of some—did not have, 
in a former time, the drawbacks that it may have subsequently 
assumed. In those days, women led a life just as active as men; 
it is overeating and idleness that cause problems in unmarried 
girls, making it desirable for them to have sexual relations, 
which may facilitate the menstrual flow. The solution Rufus 
suggests, then, is a relatively late marriage (at about eighteen), 
but a marriage prepared for by a whole regimen that ought to 
accompany the life of the young girl even before puberty.
