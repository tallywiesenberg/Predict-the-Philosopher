in agreement that puberty for boys is situated at about the age 
of fourteen. But all are in agreement as well that access to the 
aphrodisia should not be had so early. One finds scarcely any 
exact indication concerning the age at which one may begin 
sexual intercourse. In any case several years should pass dur¬ 
ing which the body is forming the seminal liquids without it 
being advisable to evacuate them. Whence the necessity of a 
specific regimen designed to ensure the self-control of adoles¬ 
cents. The physicians prescribe, in keeping with tradition, a 
life of intense physical exercise. Thus Athenaeus: “Since the 
production of sperm begins at that age [fourteen] and since 
young people have very strong cravings which incite them to 
sexual intercourse, physical exercises should be very numer¬ 
ous, so that tiring the body and the soul very quickly, they 
may repress their desires from the beginning.” 19 

The problem for girls is a little different. The practice of 
early marriage doubtless caused people to concede that the 
first sexual relations and childbearing could occur as soon as 
menstruation was regularly established. 20 This is the opinion 
of Soranus, who advises reliance on organic criteria in setting 
the age for marriage and not on the desires of the girls them¬ 
selves. Depending on education, these desires can awaken 
before the body is ready; “since the female conceives seed into 
the substance of a living being,” there is a danger when the 
body of the woman has not reached the maturity necessary to 
this function; so it is good that she remain a virgin until 
menstruation has been established spontaneously. 21 Other

The Care of the Self 


physicians envisage a much later date. Thus Rufus of Ephesus 
considers that a pregnancy before the age of eighteen risks 
being unfavorable to mother and child alike. He recalls that 
this is the age recommended long ago by Hesiod; and he points 
out that this age—quite late in the eyes of some—did not have, 
in a former time, the drawbacks that it may have subsequently 
assumed. In those days, women led a life just as active as men; 
it is overeating and idleness that cause problems in unmarried 
girls, making it desirable for them to have sexual relations, 
which may facilitate the menstrual flow. The solution Rufus 
suggests, then, is a relatively late marriage (at about eighteen), 
but a marriage prepared for by a whole regimen that ought to 
accompany the life of the young girl even before puberty.
