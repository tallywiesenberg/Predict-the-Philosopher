a difficult confession to a scientific practice. It had to be 
exacted, by force, since it involved something that tried to 
stay hidden. 

4. Through the method of interpretation. If one had to 
confess, this was not merely because the person to whom one 
confessed had the power to forgive, console, and direct, but 
because the work of producing the truth was obliged to pass 
through this relationship if it was to be scientifically vali¬ 
dated. The truth did not reside solely in the subject who, by 
confessing, would reveal it wholly formed. It was constituted 
in two stages: present but incomplete, blind to itself, in the 
one who spoke, it could only reach completion in the one 
who assimilated and recorded it. It was the latter’s function 
to verify this obscure truth: the revelation of confession had 
to be coupled with the decipherment of what it said. The one

who condemned or acquitted; he was the master of truth. His 
was a hermaneutic function. With regard to the confession, 
his power was not only to demand it before it was made, or 
decide what was to follow after it, but also to constitute a 
discourse of truth on the basis of its decipherment. By no 
longer making the confession a test, but rather a sign, and by 
making sexuality something to be interpreted, the nineteenth 
century gave itself the possibility of causing the procedures 
of confession to operate within the regular formation of a 
scientific discourse. 

5. Through the medicalization of the effects of confession. 
The obtaining of the confession and its effects were recodified 
as therapeutic operations. Which meant first of all that the 
sexual domain was no longer accounted for simply by the 
notions of error or sin, excess or transgression, but was 
placed under the rule of the normal and the pathological 
(which, for that matter, were the transposition of the former 
categories); a characteristic sexual morbidity was defined for 
the first time; sex appeared as an extremely unstable patho¬ 
logical field: a surface of repercussion for other ailments, but 
also the focus of a specific nosography, that of instincts, 
tendencies, images, pleasure, and conduct. This implied fur¬ 
thermore that sex would derive its meaning and its necessity
