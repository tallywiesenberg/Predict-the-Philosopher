The just 
community of bodies demands this consideration.The attrac¬ 
tion that should come into play between husband and wife is 
the kind that expresses itself naturally—as in every animal 
species—between male and female: “Just as the gods have 
made horses most pleasant to horses, oxen to oxen, and sheep 
to sheep, so human beings [anthropoi] suppose the undisguised 
body of a human being is most pleasant.” 26 It is natural attrac¬ 
tion that should serve as the basis for sexual relations between 
spouses and for the community of bodies they constitute.Ischomachus’ enkrateia rejects all the artifices that people use 
in order to increase desires and pleasures.But a question arises: how can the wife remain an object of 
desire for her husband?How can she be sure of not being 
supplanted someday by someone younger and prettier?
