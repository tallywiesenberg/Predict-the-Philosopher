a difficult confession to a scientific practice. It had to be 
exacted, by force, since it involved something that tried to 
stay hidden. 

4. Through the method of interpretation. If one had to 
confess, this was not merely because the person to whom one 
confessed had the power to forgive, console, and direct, but 
because the work of producing the truth was obliged to pass 
through this relationship if it was to be scientifically vali¬ 
dated. The truth did not reside solely in the subject who, by 
confessing, would reveal it wholly formed. It was constituted 
in two stages: present but incomplete, blind to itself, in the 
one who spoke, it could only reach completion in the one 
who assimilated and recorded it. It was the latter’s function 
to verify this obscure truth: the revelation of confession had 
to be coupled with the decipherment of what it said. The one

who listened was not simply the forgiving master, the judge 
who condemned or acquitted; he was the master of truth. His 
was a hermaneutic function. With regard to the confession, 
his power was not only to demand it before it was made, or 
decide what was to follow after it, but also to constitute a 
discourse of truth on the basis of its decipherment. By no 
longer making the confession a test, but rather a sign, and by 
making sexuality something to be interpreted, the nineteenth 
century gave itself the possibility of causing the procedures 
of confession to operate within the regular formation of a 
scientific discourse. 

5. Through the medicalization of the effects of confession. 
The obtaining of the confession and its effects were recodified 
as therapeutic operations. Which meant first of all that the 
sexual domain was no longer accounted for simply by the 
notions of error or sin, excess or transgression, but was 
placed under the rule of the normal and the pathological 
(which, for that matter, were the transposition of the former 
categories); a characteristic sexual morbidity was defined for 
the first time; sex appeared as an extremely unstable patho¬ 
logical field: a surface of repercussion for other ailments, but 
also the focus of a specific nosography, that of instincts, 
tendencies, images, pleasure, and conduct. This implied fur¬ 
thermore that sex would derive its meaning and its necessity 
from medical interventions: it would be required by the doc¬ 
tor, necessary for diagnosis, and effective by nature in the 
cure. Spoken in time, to the proper party, and by the person 
who was both the bearer of it and the one responsible for it, 
the truth healed. 

Let us consider things in broad historical perspective: 
breaking with the traditions of the ars erotica, our society has 
equipped itself with a scientia sexualis. To be more precise, 
it has pursued the task of producing true discourses concern¬ 
ing sex, and this by adapting—not without difficulty—the

ancient procedure of confession to the rules of scientific dis¬ 
course. Paradoxically, the scientia sexualis that emerged in 
the nineteenth century kept as its nucleus the singular ritual 
of obligatory and exhaustive confession, which in the Chris¬ 
tian West was the first technique for producing the truth of 
sex. Beginning in the sixteenth century, this rite gradually 
detached itself from the sacrament of penance, and via the 
guidance of souls and the direction of conscience—the ars 
artium —emigrated toward pedagogy, relationships between 
adults and children, family relations, medicine, and psychia¬ 
try. In any case, nearly one hundred and fifty years have gone 
into the making of a complex machinery for producing true 
discourses on sex: a deployment that spans a wide segment 
of history in that it connects the ancient injunction of confes¬ 
sion to clinical listening methods. It is this deployment that 
enables something called “sexuality” to embody the truth of 
sex and its pleasures. 

“Sexuality”: the correlative of that slowly developed dis¬ 
cursive practice which constitutes the scientia sexualis. The 
essential features of this sexuality are not the expression of 
a representation that is more or less distorted by ideology, or 
of a misunderstanding caused by taboos; they correspond to 
the functional requirements of a discourse that must produce 
its truth. Situated at the point of intersection of a technique 
of confession and a scientific discursivity, where certain 
major mechanisms had to be found for adapting them to one 
another (the listening technique, the postulate of causality, 
the principle of latency, the rule of interpretation, the imper¬ 
ative of medicalization), sexuality was defined as being “by
