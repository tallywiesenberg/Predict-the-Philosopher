The 
young wife of Ischomachus asks him directly: what can she do 
not just to seem beautiful but to be beautiful and remain so?27 
And once again, by a logic that may appear strange to us, the 
household and the government of the household will be the 
crucial factor.According to Ischomachus, at any rate, the 
wife’s real beauty is sufficiently guaranteed by her household 
occupations, provided that she goes about them in the right 
way.He explains that by performing her appointed tasks, she 
will not sit about, huddled up like a slave, or remain idle like 
a coquette.She will stand, she will observe, she will supervise, 
she will go from room to room checking the work that is in 
progress; standing and walking will give her body that certain 
demeanor, that carriage which in the eyes of the Greeks cha¬ 
racterized the physique of the free individual (Ischomachus 
will later show that a man becomes vigorous as a soldier and 
free citizen through his active participation in the responsibili¬ 
ties of a taskmaster).
