30 It is the latter pleasure that the wife can give her 
husband.Thus, by virtue of the forms of a physical beauty that 
is indissociable from her privileged status and by virtue of her 
unconstrained willingness to gratify (charizesthai), the mis¬ 
tress of the household will always be preeminent over the 
other women of the household.In this text devoted to the “masculine” art of governing a 
household—wife, servants, estate—there is no allusion to the 
sexual faithfulness of the wife or to the fact that her husband 
should be her only sexual partner: this is taken for granted as 
a necessary principle.As for the self-restrained attitude of the 
husband, it is never defined as the monopoly over all his sexual 
activity which he would concede to his wif e. What is at stake 
in this reflective practice of marital life, what appears as essen¬ 
tial to the orderliness of the household, to the peace that must 
reign within it, and to the woman’s expectations, is that she 
be able, as the lawful wife, to keep the preeminent place that 
marriage has assigned to her: not to see another woman given 
preference over her, not to suffer a loss of status and dignity, 
not to be replaced at her husband’s side by another—this was 
what mattered to her above all else.For the threat to marriage 
did not come from the pleasure which the husband happened 
to enjoy here or there, but from the rivalries that might form 
between the wife and the other women over one’s position in 
the household and over the order of precedence to be ob¬ 
served.
