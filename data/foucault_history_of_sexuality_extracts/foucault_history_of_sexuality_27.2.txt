The Use of Pleasure 


pleasure enjoyed with someone else; it was the husband who 
steadfastly maintained the privileges to which the wife was 
entitled by marriage.Moreover, this is how the “betrayed” 
women who appear in Euripides’ tragedies understand the 
matter.Medea complains bitterly of Jason’s “unfaithfulness”: 
he has forsaken her for a royal bride and he will beget descend¬ 
ants who will reduce his children by Medea to a state of 
humiliation and servitude.31 What makes Creusa lament the 
imagined “betrayal” of Xuthus is the thought of living “a 
childless life, in a house forsaken and solitary”; it is that—at 
least this is what she is made to believe—“into her house,” 
which was the house of Erechtheus, will come “a motherless 
nobody, some slave’s brat.” 32 

This preeminence of the wife, which the husband must 
protect, was implied by the act of marriage.But it was not 
acquired once and for all; it was not guaranteed by any moral 
pledge on the part of the husband; even in addition to the 
possibility of repudiation and divorce, there was always the 
threat of a de facto loss of prestige.
