Now, what Xenophon’s 
Oeconomicus and Ischomachus’ discourse show is that while 
the husband’s wisdom—his enkrateia but also his knowledge 
as head of a family—was always ready to acknowledge the 
wife’s privileges, the wife, if she was to preserve them, must 
in return exercise her function in the house and accomplish 
the tasks that were associated with it in the best possible way.Ischomachus does not promise his wife at the outset either 
“sexual fidelity” in the way we understand it, or even that she 
will never have to fear any other preference on his part; but 
just as he assures her that her activity as mistress of the house, 
her bearing and her way of dressing, will give her a greater 
charm than that of the servants, he also assures her that she 
can keep the place of honor in the house until old age.And 
he suggests a kind of contest between the two of them to see 
who behaves best and who is the most diligent in caring for 
the household; if she manages to win, she will then have 
nothing more to fear from any sort of rival, even a young one.Economics

“But the most pleasant thing of all: if you look to be better 
than I and make me your servant, you will have no need to 
fear that with advancing age you will be honored any less in 
the household, and you may trust that as you grow older, the 
better a partner you prove to be for me, and for the children 
a better guardian of the household, by so much more will you 
be honored in the household.” 33 

In this ethics of married life, the “fidelity” that is recom¬ 
mended to the husband is therefore something quite different 
from the sexual exclusivity that marriage imposes on the wife.It has to do with maintaining the wife’s status and privileges, 
and her preeminence over other women.
