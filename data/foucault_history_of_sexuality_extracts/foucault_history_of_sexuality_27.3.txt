And while it does 
imply a certain reciprocity of behavior between the man and 
the woman, this is in the sense that the man’s faithfulness 
would correspond not so much to the good sexual conduct of 
the wife, which is always presupposed, but to the way in which 
she conducts the household and conducts herself in the house¬ 
hold.A reciprocity, then, but a fundamental dissymmetry 
since the two interdependent behaviors are not based on the 
same exigencies and do not obey the same principles.The 
husband’s self-restraint pertains to an art of governing—gov¬ 
erning in general, governing oneself, and governing a wife who 
must be kept under control and respected at the same time, 
since in relation to her husband she is the obedient mistress 
of the household.3 


Three Policies of 
Moderation 


Other texts, dating from the fourth century and the begin¬ 
ning of the fifth, also develop the theme that the state of 
marriage calls for at least some form of sexual moderation.Three of these texts are especially noteworthy: the passage in 
the Laws where Plato discusses the rules and obligations of 
marriage; Isocrates’ exposition concerning the way Nicocles 
manages his life as a married man; and a treatise on economics 
attributed to Aristotle and definitely a product of his school.
