How¬ 
ever, a reading of these three texts shows that it would clearly 
be a mistake to project onto them retrospectively a principle 
of “reciprocal sexual fidelity” like the one that served as a 
juridico-moral pillar for later forms of matrimonial practice.The fact is that in all these texts, the obligation the husband 
is under, or the recommendation that is made to him, to be 
moderate to the extent of having no other sexual partner but 
his own wife is not the result of a personal commitment he 
might make with respect to her; it is the result of a political 
regulation that is imposed by fiat in the case of the Platonic 
laws, or—in the case of Isocrates or Aristotle—by the hus¬ 
band himself through a sort of deliberate self-limitation of 
his power.1.Thus, when it is stipulated in the Laws that one should 
marry at the proper age (for men, between the ages of twenty- 
five and thirty-five), beget children in the best possible condi¬ 
tions, and not have relations—whether one is a man or a 
woman—with anyone other than one’s marriage partner, all 
these injunctions take the form, not of a voluntary ethics, but 
of a coercive regimentation; it is true that the author remarks 
several times on the difficulty of legislating in this area and on 
the desirability for some measures to take the form of an 
ordinance only in the case of disorders and where the greatest 
number is no longer capable of moderation.1 In any case, the 
principles of this moral code are always directly referred to the 
needs of the state, and never to the internal demands of the 
household, the family, or married life: one should bear in mind 
that the good marriage is the one that benefits the city and it 
is for the sake of the latter that the children ought to be “the 
noblest and best possible.” 2 Unions that—with respect to pro¬ 
portions beneficial to the state—should not be instances of the

rich marrying the rich; 3 meticulous inspections that would 
verify that young couples are carefully preparing themselves 
for the procreative task; 4 the injunction, backed up by penal¬ 
ties, to inseminate only one’s lawful wife without having any 
other sexual relations during the period in which one is capa¬ 
ble of procreation 5 —all this is tied to the particular structures 
of an ideal city and is rather foreign to a style of moderation 
based on the voluntary pursuit of moderation.
