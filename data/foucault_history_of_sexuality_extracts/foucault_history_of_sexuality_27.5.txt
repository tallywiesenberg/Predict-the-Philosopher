from medical interventions: it would be required by the doc¬ 
tor, necessary for diagnosis, and effective by nature in the 
cure. Spoken in time, to the proper party, and by the person 
who was both the bearer of it and the one responsible for it, 
the truth healed. 

Let us consider things in broad historical perspective: 
breaking with the traditions of the ars erotica, our society has 
equipped itself with a scientia sexualis. To be more precise, 
it has pursued the task of producing true discourses concern¬ 
ing sex, and this by adapting—not without difficulty—the

ancient procedure of confession to the rules of scientific dis¬ 
course. Paradoxically, the scientia sexualis that emerged in 
the nineteenth century kept as its nucleus the singular ritual 
of obligatory and exhaustive confession, which in the Chris¬ 
tian West was the first technique for producing the truth of 
sex. Beginning in the sixteenth century, this rite gradually 
detached itself from the sacrament of penance, and via the 
guidance of souls and the direction of conscience—the ars 
artium —emigrated toward pedagogy, relationships between 
adults and children, family relations, medicine, and psychia¬ 
try. In any case, nearly one hundred and fifty years have gone 
into the making of a complex machinery for producing true 
discourses on sex: a deployment that spans a wide segment 
of history in that it connects the ancient injunction of confes¬ 
sion to clinical listening methods. It is this deployment that 
enables something called “sexuality” to embody the truth of 
sex and its pleasures. 

“Sexuality”: the correlative of that slowly developed dis¬ 
cursive practice which constitutes the scientia sexualis. The 
essential features of this sexuality are not the expression of 
a representation that is more or less distorted by ideology, or 
of a misunderstanding caused by taboos; they correspond to 
the functional requirements of a discourse that must produce 
its truth. Situated at the point of intersection of a technique 
of confession and a scientific discursivity, where certain 
major mechanisms had to be found for adapting them to one 
another (the listening technique, the postulate of causality, 
the principle of latency, the rule of interpretation, the imper¬ 
ative of medicalization), sexuality was defined as being “by
