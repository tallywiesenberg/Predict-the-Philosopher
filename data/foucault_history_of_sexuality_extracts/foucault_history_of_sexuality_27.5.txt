9 (3) The honor 
of the human being: Here Plato gives an example that will be 
used often subsequently; he speaks of those animals which live 
in bands, each in the midst of others, but “which live celibate, 

•Note that once past the age limit for having children, “the man or woman 
who behaves moderately [sophrorion kai sophronousa] in all such respects should be 
accorded an entirely good reputation; he who behaves in the opposite fashion should 
be honored in the opposite way—or rather dishonored .” 6

pure, and chaste”; when the age for procreation is reached, 
they separate from the group and pair into couples that will 
last.Now, it will be noticed that this animal conjugality is not 
cited as a natural principle that would be universal, but rather 
as a challenge that men ought to take up: how could calling 
attention to such a practice fail to prompt reasonable men to 
prove themselves “superior to the beasts.” 10 (4) Shame: By 
reducing the frequency of sexual activity, shame will “weaken 
the sway of this mistress”; without there being the need to 
prohibit the acts, it will be held “noble to engage in them if 
one escapes notice,” and people will have to learn that to 
commit them openly is “shameful” by “the custom laid down 
in habit and unwritten law.” 11 

Hence Plato’s legislation does set a requirement that is 
symmetrical for the man and the woman, each on their own 
account.It is because they have a certain role to play for the 
common purpose—that of father and mother of future citizens 
—that they are bound exactly in the same way by the same 
laws, which impose the same restrictions on both.But it is 
important to see that this symmetry in no way implies that 
husband and wife are held to “sexual fidelity” by a personal 
bond that would be intrinsic to the matrimonial relation and 
constitute a mutual commitment.The symmetry is not based 
on a direct and reciprocal relation between the two, but on an 
element that dominates both of them: principles and laws to 
which they are both subjected in the same way.
