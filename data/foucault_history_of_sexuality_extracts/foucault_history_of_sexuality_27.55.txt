It is true that 
their compliance must be voluntary, the result of an internal 
persuasion; but the latter does not involve an attachment they 
should have for one another; it involves the reverence one 
should feel for the law, or the concern one should have for 
oneself, one’s reputation, one’s honor.The relation of the 
individual to himself and to his city in the form of respect or 
shame, honor or glory—not the relation to the other person 
—is what imposes this obedience.And we may note that in Plato’s proposal for the law con¬

bidden to touch any woman of good birth who is not his lawful 
wife, to procreate outside of marriage, and to “go against 
nature and sow sterile seed in males.” The other formulation 
repeats the prohibition against male love relations, making it 
absolute this time; as for extramarital sexual relations, he 
contemplates punishment only in cases where the wrongdoing 
would not go unnoticed by “all men and women.”* Clearly, 
then, the double obligation to limit sexual activities relates to 
the stability of the city, to its public morality, to the conditions 
of good procreation, and not to the reciprocal obligations that 
attach to a dual relation between husbands and wives.2.
