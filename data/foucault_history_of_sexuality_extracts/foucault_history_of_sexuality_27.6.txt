In the text by Isocrates, which has the form of an 
address by Nicocles to his fellow citizens, an explicit connec¬ 
tion is established between the views on moderation and mar¬ 
riage it sets forth and the exercise of political power.This 
speech is a companion piece to the one Isocrates addressed to 
Nicocles shortly after the latter came to power: the orator gave 
the young man advice on personal conduct and government, 
advice that ought to serve him well for the rest of his life.Nicocles’ speech is supposed to be an address by the monarch 
in which he explains to his subjects how they ought to behave 
toward him.Now, the whole first part of the text is devoted 
to justifying his power: the merits of a monarchical regime, the 
rights of the ruling family, the personal qualities of the ruler; 
and it is only once these justifications have been given that the 
obedience and attachment the citizens owe their ruler will be 
defined.By reason of his special virtues, the monarch is enti¬ 
tled to demand his subjects’ submission.
