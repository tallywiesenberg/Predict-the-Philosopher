What we are dealing with, therefore, is 
the moral formula of example (to be a model for everyone by 
being better than the best) combined with the political formula 
of competition for personal power in an aristocracy and the 
principle of a stable basis for wise and moderate tyranny (to 
be, in the eyes of the people, better endowed with virtue than 
the most virtuous): “I saw that while the majority of people 
are masters of themselves in other matters, even the best are 
slaves to the passions whose objects are boys and women; and 
therefore I wanted to show that I could be strong in those 
things in which I should be superior, not merely to people 
in general, but even to those who pride themselves on their 
virtue.” 23 

But it is essential to understand that this virtue that func¬ 
tions as an example and a sign of superiority does not owe its 
political value simply to the fact that it is an honorable behav¬ 
ior in everyone’s eyes.In reality, as far as the subjects are 
concerned, it reveals the form of relationship that the prince 
maintains with himself.This is an important political point 
because it is this relationship with the self that modulates and 
regulates the use the prince makes of the power he exercises 
over others.It is therefore important in itself, for the visible 
excellence it displays, and because of the rational frame that 
braces it.This is why Nicocles points out that his sophrosyne 
has passed a test before everyone’s witness; there are clearly 
circumstances and ages in which it is not difficult to show that 
one can be just and forgo money and pleasure; but when one 
assumes power in the midst of one’s youth, to give proof of 
moderation then constitutes a kind of qualifying test.
