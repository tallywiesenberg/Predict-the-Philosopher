over, he makes it clear that his virtue is not just a matter of 
nature but a result of reasoning (logismos) as well: conse¬ 
quently, his good behavior will not be due to chance or cir¬ 
cumstance; it will be deliberate and constant.Thus, the prince’s moderation, tested in the most hazardous 
of situations, and ensured by the continuous exercise of rea¬ 
son, serves as the basis of a sort of compact between the ruler 
and the ruled: the latter can obey him, seeing that he is master 
of himself.One can demand the subjects’ obedience, since it 
is warranted by the prince’s virtue.The prince is indeed capa¬ 
ble of moderating the power he exercises over others by means 
of the mastery he establishes over himself.This is in fact how 
the passage ends where Nicocles, having finished talking about 
himself, draws on what he has said in order to exhort his 
subjects to obey him: “The reason I have spoken at some 
length about myself ... is that I might leave you no excuse 
for not doing willingly and zealously whatever I counsel and 
command.” 25 The prince’s relationship with himself and the 
manner in which he forms himself as an ethical subject are an 
important component of the political structure; his austerity 
is part of it, contributing to its solidity.
