Much 
shorter and infinitely less rich than the text by Xenophon, 
Book I is likewise presented as a reflection on the art (techne) 
of economics.It aims to explain how to “own” a household 
and how to “make use of” it (ktesasthai, chresasthai).27 The 
text purports to be an art of governing, and not so much things 
as people.This is in keeping with a principle stated elsewhere 
by Aristotle; namely, that in economics one is more concerned 
with persons than with inanimate property.28 And the treatise 
Economics actually does devote the bulk of its instructions 
(without giving much space to the techniques of cultivation, 
as Xenophon does) to the tasks of leadership, oversight, and 
control.
