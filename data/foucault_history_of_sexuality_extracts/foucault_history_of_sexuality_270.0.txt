During childhood let girls be mixed with boys; then when the 
age comes for separating them from boys, place them under 
a very careful regimen: no meat, no overly rich dishes, no or 
very little wine, long walks, exercises. It must be kept in mind 
that idleness “is for them the most harmful thing of all,” and 
that it is “advantageous to have the exercises be a means of 
putting warmth into movement and of reheating the habit of 
the body, but in such a manner that they remain women and 
do not take on a masculine character.” Participation in cho¬ 
ruses in which one sings and dances seems to be Rufus’ idea 
of the best form of exercise: “Choruses were not invented just 
for honoring the deity, but also in view of health.” 22 

3. The “'favorable time. ” The kairos of the sexual act is the 
topic of many discussions. As concerns the larger time frame, 
the traditional calendar is taken more or less for granted: 
winter and spring are the best seasons; autumn is accepted by 
some, rejected by others; in a general way, it is thought that 
one should abstain, as much as possible, during the summer. 23 
On the other hand, determining the right hour of the day 
requires that a variety of factors be taken into account. In 
addition to the religious considerations that Plutarch men¬ 
tions in one of his table-talks, 24 the question of the right time 



The Body

is linked to that of exercise, eating, and digestion. It is best not 
to let sexual intercourse be preceded by exercises that are too 
strenuous, which divert to other parts of the body the re¬ 
sources it needs. Inversely, baths and rubdowns are recom¬ 
mended after lovemaking. It is not good to practice the 
aphrodisia before meals, when one is hungry, because under 
these conditions the act is not tiring but it loses some of its 
force. 25 But, on the other hand, one must avoid copious meals 
and excessive quantities of drink. The time of digestion is 
always harmful: “That is why coitus in the middle of the night 
is deceptive, because then the food is not yet elaborated; the 
same is true of coitus that one has early in the morning, 
because there still may be ill-digested food in the stomach and 
because all the superfluities have not yet been evacuated 
through the urine and the feces.” 26 So that, all things consid¬ 
ered, it is after a moderate meal and before sleep—or possibly 
before the afternoon nap—that the time will be most favorable 
for sexual intercourse. According to Rufus, Nature herself 
indicated her preference for this time by giving the body its 
strongest excitation then. Furthermore, if one wishes to have 
children, it is appropriate that the man “engage in sexual 
intercourse after having eaten and drunk to satisfaction, 
whereas the woman ought to follow a less invigorating diet”; 
indeed, it is necessary that “the one give and the other re¬ 
ceive.” 27 Galen is of the same opinion: he recommends that 
time when one is going to sleep, after having enjoyed “a solid 
meal but one that does not cause discomfort.” In this way the 
food is sufficient to nourish and strengthen the body, and sleep 
allows one to repair the fatigue; further, this is the best mo¬ 
ment for conceiving children “because the woman retains the 
sperm better while sleeping”; finally, this is in fact the hour 
for which Nature herself indicates her preference by giving 
rise then to desire. 28 * 

*It may be added that for Celsus, night is preferable "but care should be taken that 
by day it not be immediately followed by a meal, and at night not immediately 
followed by work and wakefulness. - ’”

The Care of the Self 


4. Individual temperaments. Rufus posits as a general 
principle that the natures most suited for coition are those 
which are “more or less hot and moist”; in return, sexual 
activity is rather unfavorable for constitutions that are cold 
and dry. Thus, in order to maintain or restore the warm 
moisture needed in the aphrodisia, it is good to adopt an entire 
complex and continuous regimen of suitable exercise and 
proper nourishment. Around sexual activity, and in order to 
preserve the balance it risks upsetting, one must keep to a 
whole mode of living. It is helpful to drink pale red wine, to 
eat oven bread made from bran (its moisture is useful for 
preparation and regulation); to consume, in the meat category, 
young goat, lamb, hen, grouse, partridge, goose, duck; in the 
seafood category, octopus and mollusks—together with tur¬ 
nips, broad beans, green beans, chick peas (for their heat), and 
grapes (for their moisture). As for the activities to which one 
should resort, they include excursions, on foot or horseback, 
and running, but neither too fast nor too slow; but no violent 
exercises, no gesticulation as in javelin throwing (which di¬ 
verts the nutritive material to other parts of the body), no 
excessively hot baths, no heating and cooling off; no strenuous 
work. One should also avoid anything that would contribute
