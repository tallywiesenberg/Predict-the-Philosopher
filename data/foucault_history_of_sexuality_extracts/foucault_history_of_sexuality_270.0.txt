During childhood let girls be mixed with boys; then when the 
age comes for separating them from boys, place them under 
a very careful regimen: no meat, no overly rich dishes, no or 
very little wine, long walks, exercises. It must be kept in mind 
that idleness “is for them the most harmful thing of all,” and 
that it is “advantageous to have the exercises be a means of 
putting warmth into movement and of reheating the habit of 
the body, but in such a manner that they remain women and 
do not take on a masculine character.” Participation in cho¬ 
ruses in which one sings and dances seems to be Rufus’ idea 
of the best form of exercise: “Choruses were not invented just 
for honoring the deity, but also in view of health.” 22 

3. The “'favorable time. ” The kairos of the sexual act is the 
topic of many discussions. As concerns the larger time frame, 
the traditional calendar is taken more or less for granted: 
winter and spring are the best seasons; autumn is accepted by 
some, rejected by others; in a general way, it is thought that 
one should abstain, as much as possible, during the summer. 23 
On the other hand, determining the right hour of the day 
requires that a variety of factors be taken into account. In 
addition to the religious considerations that Plutarch men¬ 
tions in one of his table-talks, 24 the question of the right time

is linked to that of exercise, eating, and digestion. It is best not 
to let sexual intercourse be preceded by exercises that are too 
strenuous, which divert to other parts of the body the re¬ 
sources it needs. Inversely, baths and rubdowns are recom¬ 
mended after lovemaking. It is not good to practice the 
aphrodisia before meals, when one is hungry, because under 
these conditions the act is not tiring but it loses some of its 
force. 25 But, on the other hand, one must avoid copious meals 
and excessive quantities of drink. The time of digestion is 
always harmful: “That is why coitus in the middle of the night 
is deceptive, because then the food is not yet elaborated; the 
same is true of coitus that one has early in the morning, 
because there still may be ill-digested food in the stomach and 
because all the superfluities have not yet been evacuated 
through the urine and the feces.” 26 So that, all things consid¬ 
ered, it is after a moderate meal and before sleep—or possibly 
before the afternoon nap—that the time will be most favorable 
for sexual intercourse. According to Rufus, Nature herself
