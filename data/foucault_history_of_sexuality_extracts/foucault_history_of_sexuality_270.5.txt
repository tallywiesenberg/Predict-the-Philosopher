indicated her preference for this time by giving the body its 
strongest excitation then. Furthermore, if one wishes to have 
children, it is appropriate that the man “engage in sexual 
intercourse after having eaten and drunk to satisfaction, 
whereas the woman ought to follow a less invigorating diet”; 
indeed, it is necessary that “the one give and the other re¬ 
ceive.” 27 Galen is of the same opinion: he recommends that 
time when one is going to sleep, after having enjoyed “a solid 
meal but one that does not cause discomfort.” In this way the 
food is sufficient to nourish and strengthen the body, and sleep 
allows one to repair the fatigue; further, this is the best mo¬ 
ment for conceiving children “because the woman retains the 
sperm better while sleeping”; finally, this is in fact the hour 
for which Nature herself indicates her preference by giving 
rise then to desire. 28 * 

*It may be added that for Celsus, night is preferable "but care should be taken that 
by day it not be immediately followed by a meal, and at night not immediately 
followed by work and wakefulness. - ’”

The Care of the Self 


4. Individual temperaments. Rufus posits as a general 
principle that the natures most suited for coition are those 
which are “more or less hot and moist”; in return, sexual 
activity is rather unfavorable for constitutions that are cold 
and dry. Thus, in order to maintain or restore the warm 
moisture needed in the aphrodisia, it is good to adopt an entire 
complex and continuous regimen of suitable exercise and 
proper nourishment. Around sexual activity, and in order to 
preserve the balance it risks upsetting, one must keep to a 
whole mode of living. It is helpful to drink pale red wine, to 
eat oven bread made from bran (its moisture is useful for 
preparation and regulation); to consume, in the meat category, 
young goat, lamb, hen, grouse, partridge, goose, duck; in the 
seafood category, octopus and mollusks—together with tur¬ 
nips, broad beans, green beans, chick peas (for their heat), and 
grapes (for their moisture). As for the activities to which one 
should resort, they include excursions, on foot or horseback, 
and running, but neither too fast nor too slow; but no violent 
exercises, no gesticulation as in javelin throwing (which di¬ 
verts the nutritive material to other parts of the body), no 
excessively hot baths, no heating and cooling off; no strenuous 
work. One should also avoid anything that would contribute
