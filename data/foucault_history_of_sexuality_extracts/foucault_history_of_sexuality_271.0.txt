The Work of the 
Soul 


The regimen recommended for the sexual pleasures seems 
to be centered entirely on the body. Its condition, its balances, 
its ailments, the general or transitory dispositions in which it 
finds itself, function as the principal variables that ought to 
determine behavior. It is as if the body dictated to the body. 
And yet the soul has its part to play as well, and the physicians 
bring it into the scheme of things. For it is the soul that 
constantly risks carrying the body beyond its own mechanics 
and its elementary needs; it is the soul that prompts one to 
choose the times that are not suitable, to act in questionable 
circumstances, to contravene natural dispositions. If humans 
need a regimen that takes into account, with such meticulous¬ 
ness, all the elements of physiology, this is because they always 
tend to be led astray by their imaginings, their passions, and 
their loves. Even the proper age for beginning sexual inter¬ 
course gets confused in girls and boys alike; education and 
habits can cause desire to appear at the wrong time. 1 

The reasonable soul thus has a dual role to play: it needs to 
assign a regimen for the body that is actually determined by 
the latter’s nature, its tensions, the condition and circum¬ 
stances in which it finds itself. But it will be able to assign this 
regimen correctly only provided it has done a good deal of 
work on itself: eliminated the errors, reduced the imaginings, 
mastered the desires, that cause it to misconstrue the sober law 
of the body. Athenaeus—on whom the Stoic influence is con-
