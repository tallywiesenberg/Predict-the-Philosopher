The Work of the 
Soul 


The regimen recommended for the sexual pleasures seems 
to be centered entirely on the body. Its condition, its balances, 
its ailments, the general or transitory dispositions in which it 
finds itself, function as the principal variables that ought to 
determine behavior. It is as if the body dictated to the body. 
And yet the soul has its part to play as well, and the physicians 
bring it into the scheme of things. For it is the soul that 
constantly risks carrying the body beyond its own mechanics 
and its elementary needs; it is the soul that prompts one to 
choose the times that are not suitable, to act in questionable 
circumstances, to contravene natural dispositions. If humans 
need a regimen that takes into account, with such meticulous¬ 
ness, all the elements of physiology, this is because they always 
tend to be led astray by their imaginings, their passions, and 
their loves. Even the proper age for beginning sexual inter¬ 
course gets confused in girls and boys alike; education and 
habits can cause desire to appear at the wrong time. 1 

The reasonable soul thus has a dual role to play: it needs to 
assign a regimen for the body that is actually determined by 
the latter’s nature, its tensions, the condition and circum¬ 
stances in which it finds itself. But it will be able to assign this 
regimen correctly only provided it has done a good deal of 
work on itself: eliminated the errors, reduced the imaginings, 
mastered the desires, that cause it to misconstrue the sober law 
of the body. Athenaeus—on whom the Stoic influence is con-

The Care of the Self 


siderable—defines very clearly this labor of the soul on itself 
as a requisite condition of the good physical regimen. “What 
adults need is a complete regimen of the soul and the body 
. . . to try and calm its impulses [hormai], and to achieve a 
condition in which our desires [prothumiai] do not exceed our 
own particular powers.” 2 This regimen does not require that 
one institute a struggle of the soul against the body, nor even 
that one establish means by which the soul might defend itself 
from the body. Rather, it is a matter of the soul’s correcting 
itself in order to be able to guide the body according to a law 
which is that of the body itself. 

This work is described by the physicians in reference to 
three elements by which the subject risks being carried beyond 
the actual necessities of the organism: the movement of desire, 
the presence of images, the attachment to pleasure. 

a. In the medical regimen it is not a question of eliminat¬ 
ing desire. Nature herself placed it in all the animal species as 
a spur for exciting both sexes and for attracting them to one 
another. Nothing would be more unnatural, therefore, noth¬ 
ing more harmful than to seek to have the aphrodisia escape 
the natural force of desire; one must never—out of a spirit of 
debauchery or in order to circumvent the lost vigor of age— 
try to force nature. One must not have sexual relations aneu 
epithumein, without feeling desire: such is the advice of Rufus 
in the treatise On Satyriasis. But this desire is twofold: it 
appears in the body and it appears in the soul. The problem 
of regimen consists in bringing about an exact correlation of 
the two manifestations. One must take care that, in the body 
and in the soul, its movements are coordinated and adjusted 
as precisely as possible. Rufus makes a noteworthy pro¬ 
nouncement in this regard: “It is best that the man indulge in 
sexual intercourse when he is pressed at the same time by the 
soul’s desire and the body’s need.” 3 

It sometimes happens that this natural correlation is jeop¬ 
ardized through the action of the body itself. The body loses 
control of itself, as it were. Nothing in the soul corresponds

to its excitation. It gives way to a kind of pure convulsion. The 
sexual act then becomes altogether “paroxysmal,” as Rufus 
says. 4 It is to this purely physical excitation that Rufus seems 
to allude when he speaks of the hormai that accompany the
