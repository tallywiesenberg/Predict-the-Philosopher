adults need is a complete regimen of the soul and the body 
. . . to try and calm its impulses [hormai], and to achieve a 
condition in which our desires [prothumiai] do not exceed our 
own particular powers.” 2 This regimen does not require that 
one institute a struggle of the soul against the body, nor even 
that one establish means by which the soul might defend itself 
from the body. Rather, it is a matter of the soul’s correcting 
itself in order to be able to guide the body according to a law 
which is that of the body itself. 

This work is described by the physicians in reference to 
three elements by which the subject risks being carried beyond 
the actual necessities of the organism: the movement of desire, 
the presence of images, the attachment to pleasure. 

a. In the medical regimen it is not a question of eliminat¬ 
ing desire. Nature herself placed it in all the animal species as 
a spur for exciting both sexes and for attracting them to one 
another. Nothing would be more unnatural, therefore, noth¬ 
ing more harmful than to seek to have the aphrodisia escape 
the natural force of desire; one must never—out of a spirit of 
debauchery or in order to circumvent the lost vigor of age— 
try to force nature. One must not have sexual relations aneu 
epithumein, without feeling desire: such is the advice of Rufus 
in the treatise On Satyriasis. But this desire is twofold: it 
appears in the body and it appears in the soul. The problem 
of regimen consists in bringing about an exact correlation of 
the two manifestations. One must take care that, in the body 
and in the soul, its movements are coordinated and adjusted 
as precisely as possible. Rufus makes a noteworthy pro¬ 
nouncement in this regard: “It is best that the man indulge in 
sexual intercourse when he is pressed at the same time by the 
soul’s desire and the body’s need.” 3 

It sometimes happens that this natural correlation is jeop¬ 
ardized through the action of the body itself. The body loses 
control of itself, as it were. Nothing in the soul corresponds

to its excitation. It gives way to a kind of pure convulsion. The 
sexual act then becomes altogether “paroxysmal,” as Rufus 
says. 4 It is to this purely physical excitation that Rufus seems 
to allude when he speaks of the hormai that accompany the
