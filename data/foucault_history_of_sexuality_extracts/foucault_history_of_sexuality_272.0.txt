warning signs of mania or epilepsy. 5 The same phenomenon 
occurs, but in a different form, in satyriasis or gonorrhea: the 
sexual organs become inflamed by themselves, in the first of 
these diseases; and in the other, “without an act, without a 
nocturnal image, a profusion of semen is discharged in abun¬ 
dance”; the patient, transported by the crazed mechanics of 
his body, becomes exhausted and “dies of consumption after 
a certain time.” 6 

But the soul, conversely, can escape the forms and limits of 
the desire manifested in the body. The term Rufus and Galen 
use to designate this excess is significant: it is the word doxa. 
The soul, instead of attending only to the wants and needs of 
the body, allows itself to be enticed by representations that are 
peculiar to it and have no counterpart in the organism: repre¬ 
sentations that are vain and empty (kenai). Just as the body 
must not let itself be carried away without the correlative of 
a desire in the soul, the latter must not go beyond what the 
body demands and what its needs dictate. But in the first case, 
what is involved is an illness, which remedies may be able to 
cure; in the second, what is involved above all is an ethical 
regimen, which ought to be applied to oneself. Rufus proposes 
a formula for this: “subdue the soul and make it obey the 
body.” 7 

A paradoxical proposition, if one thinks of the eminently 
traditional theme of the soul that must not be seduced by the 
entreaties of the body. But it has to be grasped in its precise 
theoretical and medical context, which was inspired perhaps 
by Stoicism. The voluntary submission of the soul to the body 
should be understood as obedience to a rationality that has 
presided over the natural order and has designed, for its own 
purposes, the mechanics of the body. It is from this natural 
reason that the doxai risk leading the soul astray by creating 
extraneous desires; it is to this reason that the reasonable

medical regimen, based on the true knowledge of living crea¬ 
tures, must be attuned. In this context the animal example, 
which so often served to disqualify the appetites of man, can 
on the contrary constitute a model for conduct. This is be¬ 
cause in their sexual regimen animals follow the dictates of the 
body, but never anything more or anything else. What directs
