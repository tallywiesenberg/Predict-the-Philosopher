them, explains Rufus, and hence what ought also to guide 
humans, are not the doxai, but the “preludes of a nature that 
needs evacuation.” For Galen, similarly, animals are not led 
to seek sexual union by the “belief”— doxa —that “pleasure is 
a good thing”; they are prompted to desire sexual relations 
“for the sake of the discharge, since the retention of semen is 
a burden to them.” For them, there is no difference between 
that which brings them to sexual intercourse and that which 
“makes them regard the elimination of stool and urine as a 
natural act.” 8 

The medical regimen proposes, then, a sort of animalization 
of the epithumia; that is, a subordination, as strict as possible, 
of the soul’s desire to the body’s needs; an ethics of desire that 
is modeled on a natural philosophy of excretions; and the 
tendency toward an ideal point where the soul, purified of all 
its vain representations, no longer gives its attention to any¬ 
thing but the austere economy of organic functions. 

b. Hence the physicians’ general distrust of “images” 
(phantasiai). The theme recurs again and again in the treat¬ 
ments they recommend. Thus, on the subject of satyriasis, 
Rufus suggests a cure that has two aspects; the first concerns 
diet, from which all warming foods should be excluded; the 
second concerns the stimulations of the soul: “One should 
avoid conversations, thoughts, erotic cravings, and above all 
one should protect oneself from that which the eyes see, know¬ 
ing very well that all these things, even in dreams, . . . incite 
to copulation if one has abstained from intercourse after hav¬ 
ing eaten rich food in abundance.” 9 Galen, in the same spirit, 
recommends a doubly cathartic cure to one of his friends who 
has given up sexual activity but finds that he is in a state of

constant excitation. Galen advises him first to relieve himself 
physically by excreting the accumulated semen; then—once 
the body is purified—to let nothing enter the mind that might 
deposit images there: “to refrain completely from spectacles, 
not to tell stories or recall memories which could stimulate his 
sexual desire.” 10 

These dangerous images, which also give rise in the soul to 
“empty” desires, having no correlation with the needs of the
