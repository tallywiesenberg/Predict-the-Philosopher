body, are of several types. There are of course the dream 
images, which the physicians seem especially concerned about 
when these images are accompanied by emissions—whence 
the often repeated advice not to sleep on one’s back, not to 
drink too much or eat before sleeping, and to keep the mind 
at rest when one is going to go to bed. In any case Rufus of 
Ephesus makes this an important item in the regimen of those 
suffering from satyriasis: “Sleep on your side rather than on 
your back.” 11 * Among the images to be avoided are those 
which can be seen at the theater; those which are suggested 
by reading, singing, music, and dancing, and which insinuate 
themselves into the mind without there being anything that 
corresponds to them in the needs of the body. Galen thus 
claims to have observed symptoms of satyriasis in subjects 
“who fail to get rid of an excess of blood, particularly when 
they do not refrain from erotic ideas. Likewise do persons 
suffer who are chaste by nature and accustomed to self-control 
over a long time but who indulge in imaginings in order to 
stimulate themselves by such spectacles and memories. The 
condition of the genital organs of these patients is quite con¬ 
trary to that of others who never indulge in erotic ideas.” 13 

But visual perceptions must also be included under this 
term phantasia, in keeping with a philosophical usage. There 
is a danger not just in imagining or remembering the aphro- 
disia, but also in perceiving them. It is a very old theme of 
traditional modesty that the aphrodisia ought to take place at 
night and in darkness rather than in broad daylight. But this

same precept is also emphasized as an element of regimen: by 
not seeing, one is protected from the images that might be 
engraved in the soul, remain there, and return in an untimely 
manner. Plutarch alludes to this problem in connection with 
the kairos, the right time for sexual acts. Among the reasons 
for shunning the light there is, for him, the concern to avoid 
“the images of pleasure” that constantly “renew” our desire; 
“but night blots out the insatiate and wildest of the deeds of 
love-making and thus diverts and calms one’s own constitu¬ 
tion, which visual stimuli do not shipwreck on the shores of
