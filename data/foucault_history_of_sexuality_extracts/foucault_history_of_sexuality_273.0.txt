body, are of several types. There are of course the dream 
images, which the physicians seem especially concerned about 
when these images are accompanied by emissions—whence 
the often repeated advice not to sleep on one’s back, not to 
drink too much or eat before sleeping, and to keep the mind 
at rest when one is going to go to bed. In any case Rufus of 
Ephesus makes this an important item in the regimen of those 
suffering from satyriasis: “Sleep on your side rather than on 
your back.” 11 * Among the images to be avoided are those 
which can be seen at the theater; those which are suggested 
by reading, singing, music, and dancing, and which insinuate 
themselves into the mind without there being anything that 
corresponds to them in the needs of the body. Galen thus 
claims to have observed symptoms of satyriasis in subjects 
“who fail to get rid of an excess of blood, particularly when 
they do not refrain from erotic ideas. Likewise do persons 
suffer who are chaste by nature and accustomed to self-control 
over a long time but who indulge in imaginings in order to 
stimulate themselves by such spectacles and memories. The 
condition of the genital organs of these patients is quite con¬ 
trary to that of others who never indulge in erotic ideas.” 13 

But visual perceptions must also be included under this 
term phantasia, in keeping with a philosophical usage. There 
is a danger not just in imagining or remembering the aphro- 
disia, but also in perceiving them. It is a very old theme of 
traditional modesty that the aphrodisia ought to take place at 
night and in darkness rather than in broad daylight. But this

same precept is also emphasized as an element of regimen: by 
not seeing, one is protected from the images that might be 
engraved in the soul, remain there, and return in an untimely 
manner. Plutarch alludes to this problem in connection with 
the kairos, the right time for sexual acts. Among the reasons 
for shunning the light there is, for him, the concern to avoid 
“the images of pleasure” that constantly “renew” our desire; 
“but night blots out the insatiate and wildest of the deeds of 
love-making and thus diverts and calms one’s own constitu¬ 
tion, which visual stimuli do not shipwreck on the shores of 
lust.” 14 

We may recall here that the question of “images” was much 
discussed in the literature of love. The gaze was thought to be 
the surest vehicle of passion; it was the path by which passion 
entered the heart and the means by which passion was main¬ 
tained. Propertius finds that the play of Venus loses its charm 
in darkness: “why make love in the dark . . . naked Endymion 
won the love of Phoebus’ sister and held in his arms the 
goddess naked.” 15 By the same token, the gaze, light, and 
image were considered dangerous. Dangerous as far as strict 
morals were concerned: the same Propertius believes that im¬ 
modesty spread when images were introduced into people’s 
houses. 16 Dangerous as well for love itself, which could be 
wounded by the unloveliness of the images. Ovid recommends 
prudence to anyone who wishes to preserve their love: “Don’t 
let the light pour in, with all the windows wide open—it is 
more fitting to keep much of your body concealed.” 17 And for 
the same reason, the cruel image can be an excellent means of 
protecting oneself against passion or even a means of ridding 
oneself of it. When one wishes to free oneself of a love there 
is nothing so effective, says Ovid in The Remedies for Love, as 
to let the light in when it is time for sex: the body’s defects, 
together with the stains and the mess, will be imprinted on the 
mind, giving rise to disgust. It is also good, when one is trying 
to get free of one’s mistress, to surprise her early in the morn¬ 
ing amid the disorder of the dressing table. 18 There is a whole 
technique of the image, which can be organized for and

against love. Moreover, the struggle against internal or exter¬ 
nal images will be one of the most constant aspects of sexual 
ethics from the end of antiquity onward. 

c. There remains the pleasure inscribed by Nature in the 
process of the aphrodisia. Can one eliminate it, or arrange not 
to feel it? This is out of the question, seeing that pleasure is 
tied directly to the movements of the body and the mech¬ 
anisms of retention and erection. However, Galen believes 
that one can prevent this pleasure from becoming an element 
of excess in the economy of the aphrodisia. The approach he 
recommends is clearly Stoic: it is a matter of considering 
pleasure as nothing more than the accompaniment of the act;
