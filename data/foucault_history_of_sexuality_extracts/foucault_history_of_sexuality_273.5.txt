We may recall here that the question of “images” was much 
discussed in the literature of love. The gaze was thought to be 
the surest vehicle of passion; it was the path by which passion 
entered the heart and the means by which passion was main¬ 
tained. Propertius finds that the play of Venus loses its charm 
in darkness: “why make love in the dark . . . naked Endymion 
won the love of Phoebus’ sister and held in his arms the 
goddess naked.” 15 By the same token, the gaze, light, and 
image were considered dangerous. Dangerous as far as strict 
morals were concerned: the same Propertius believes that im¬ 
modesty spread when images were introduced into people’s 
houses. 16 Dangerous as well for love itself, which could be 
wounded by the unloveliness of the images. Ovid recommends 
prudence to anyone who wishes to preserve their love: “Don’t 
let the light pour in, with all the windows wide open—it is 
more fitting to keep much of your body concealed.” 17 And for 
the same reason, the cruel image can be an excellent means of 
protecting oneself against passion or even a means of ridding 
oneself of it. When one wishes to free oneself of a love there 
is nothing so effective, says Ovid in The Remedies for Love, as 
to let the light in when it is time for sex: the body’s defects, 
together with the stains and the mess, will be imprinted on the 
mind, giving rise to disgust. It is also good, when one is trying 
to get free of one’s mistress, to surprise her early in the morn¬ 
ing amid the disorder of the dressing table. 18 There is a whole 
technique of the image, which can be organized for and

against love. Moreover, the struggle against internal or exter¬ 
nal images will be one of the most constant aspects of sexual 
ethics from the end of antiquity onward. 

c. There remains the pleasure inscribed by Nature in the 
process of the aphrodisia. Can one eliminate it, or arrange not 
to feel it? This is out of the question, seeing that pleasure is 
tied directly to the movements of the body and the mech¬ 
anisms of retention and erection. However, Galen believes 
that one can prevent this pleasure from becoming an element 
of excess in the economy of the aphrodisia. The approach he 
recommends is clearly Stoic: it is a matter of considering 
pleasure as nothing more than the accompaniment of the act;
