is an act of Nature herself, one that, without recourse to 
passions and artifices and in complete independence, corre¬ 
sponds strictly to need. In Western literature—beginning with 
Christian monasticism—masturbation remains associated 
with the chimera of the imagination and its dangers. It is the 
very form of unnatural pleasure that humans invented in order 
to exceed the limits assigned to them. In a medical ethics 
anxious, like that of the first centuries of our era, to gear sexual 
activity to the basic needs of the body, the act of solitary 
purgation constitutes the barest form of the uselessness of 
desire, images, and pleasure. 

1. However meticulous and complex these regimens of 
activity may be, we must not exaggerate their relative impor¬ 
tance. The place they are allocated is limited in comparison 
with the other regimens—particularly in comparison with the 
dietary regimen. When, in the fifth century, Oribasius comes 
to edit his great collection of medical texts, he will devote four 
entire books to the qualities, disadvantages, dangers, and vir¬ 
tues of the different possible foods and to the conditions in

which one should and should not consume them. He will give 
only two paragraphs to sexual regimen, citing a text by Rufus, 
another by Galen. One may think that this limitation reflects, 
more than anything else, an attitude characteristic of Oriba- 
sius and his epoch. But it is a trait manifested by all Greek and 
Roman medicine to accord much more space to the dietetics 
of alimentation than to that of sex. For this medicine, the 
thing that matters is eating and drinking. A whole develop¬ 
ment—evident in Christian monasticism—will be necessary 
before the preoccupation with sex will begin to match the 
preoccupation with food. But alimentary abstentions and fasts 
will long remain fundamental. And it will be an important 
moment for the history of ethics in European societies when 
apprehension about sex and its regimen will significantly out¬ 
weigh the rigor of alimentary prescriptions. In the Roman 
epoch, at all events, the regimen of sexual pleasures holds a 
relatively limited place next to the great alimentary regimen, 
just as, moreover, these pleasures themselves are associated in 
moral thought and social ritual with the delights of eating and 
drinking. The banquet, an occasion shared by gluttony, 
drunkenness, and love, is a direct testimony of this associa¬
