tion; the latter is attested indirectly by the inverse ritual of the 
philosophical symposium, where the food is always measured, 
the drunkenness is still capable of truth, and the love is an 
object of reasonable discourses. 

2. In these medical regimens, one sees a certain “patholog- 
ization” of the sexual act take shape. But there must be no 
misunderstanding on this point: the development in question 
is in no way similar to the one that occurred much later in 
Western societies, when sexual behavior was perceived as a 
bearer of unhealthy deviations. In the latter case, it was to be 
organized as a domain that would have its normal forms and 
its morbid forms, its specific pathology, its nosography and 
etiology—to say nothing of its therapeutics. Greco-Roman 
medicine operates differently. It inscribes the sexual act within 
a field where it constantly risks being affected and disturbed

by alterations in the organism—and where, conversely, it al¬ 
ways risks inducing diseases of various kinds, proximate and 
distant. 

We may speak of pathologization in two senses. First, be¬ 
cause the disturbing effects are attributed not only to the great 
excesses in the practice of sex but also to the very nature of 
the process—to the expenditures, tremors, perturbations, that 
it provokes in the organism; but, above all, because these 
medical analyses tend to overturn the representations of the 
sexual act as an activity, as an energy whose violence is the 
only thing to be feared. They describe it rather as a process 
in which the individual is passively overcome by the mech¬ 
anisms of the body and the movements of the soul, so that he 
must reestablish his mastery by means of a precise adjustment 
to the needs of nature alone. It is important to understand that 
this medicine of the chresis aphrodision did not aim to delimit 
the “pathological” forms of sexual behavior: rather, it uncov¬ 
ered, at the root of sexual acts, an element of passivity that was 
also a source of illness, according to the double meaning of the 
word pathos. The sexual act is not an evil; it manifests a 
permanent focus of possible ills. 

3. A medical science of this sort requires an extreme vigi¬ 
lance toward sexual activity. But this attention does not lead
