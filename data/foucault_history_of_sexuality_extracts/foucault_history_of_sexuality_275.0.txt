tion; the latter is attested indirectly by the inverse ritual of the 
philosophical symposium, where the food is always measured, 
the drunkenness is still capable of truth, and the love is an 
object of reasonable discourses. 

2. In these medical regimens, one sees a certain “patholog- 
ization” of the sexual act take shape. But there must be no 
misunderstanding on this point: the development in question 
is in no way similar to the one that occurred much later in 
Western societies, when sexual behavior was perceived as a 
bearer of unhealthy deviations. In the latter case, it was to be 
organized as a domain that would have its normal forms and 
its morbid forms, its specific pathology, its nosography and 
etiology—to say nothing of its therapeutics. Greco-Roman 
medicine operates differently. It inscribes the sexual act within 
a field where it constantly risks being affected and disturbed

by alterations in the organism—and where, conversely, it al¬ 
ways risks inducing diseases of various kinds, proximate and 
distant. 

We may speak of pathologization in two senses. First, be¬ 
cause the disturbing effects are attributed not only to the great 
excesses in the practice of sex but also to the very nature of 
the process—to the expenditures, tremors, perturbations, that 
it provokes in the organism; but, above all, because these 
medical analyses tend to overturn the representations of the 
sexual act as an activity, as an energy whose violence is the 
only thing to be feared. They describe it rather as a process 
in which the individual is passively overcome by the mech¬ 
anisms of the body and the movements of the soul, so that he 
must reestablish his mastery by means of a precise adjustment 
to the needs of nature alone. It is important to understand that 
this medicine of the chresis aphrodision did not aim to delimit 
the “pathological” forms of sexual behavior: rather, it uncov¬ 
ered, at the root of sexual acts, an element of passivity that was 
also a source of illness, according to the double meaning of the 
word pathos. The sexual act is not an evil; it manifests a 
permanent focus of possible ills. 

3. A medical science of this sort requires an extreme vigi¬ 
lance toward sexual activity. But this attention does not lead 
to a decipherment of that activity in its origin and unfolding; 
it is not a matter of the subject’s knowing precisely how things 
are with his own desire, with the movements that lead him to 
the sexual act, with the choices he makes, with the forms of 
acts he commits or the modes of pleasure he experiences. The 
attention he must give is that which keeps him mindful of the 
rules to which he must refer his sexual activity. He is not 
expected to rediscover the obscure processes of desire working 
within him; he needs to recognize the numerous complex 
conditions that must be jointly present if one is to perform the 
acts of pleasure in an appropriate manner, without danger or 
harm. He must address a discourse of “truth” to himself. But 
this discourse does not have the function of telling the subject

the truth about himself; it should teach him, given what sexual 
acts are by nature, how to resort to them in a way that con¬ 
forms as closely, as strictly as possible to that nature. Georges 
Canguilhem said that “the cause of the cure” for Aristotle 
“was the form of health in one’s medical activity”; that it was 
not the physician but rather “health that cured the patient”; 
and that, broadly speaking, “the responsibility for a technical 
production did not belong to the artisan but to the art ... ; 
the Art, which is to say, the nondeliberative finality of a 
natural logos.” 21 Similarly, one might say that the regimen of 
the aphrodisia, the regimen of their distribution, as proposed 
by medicine, needed to be nothing more nor less than the form 
of their nature present to thought, their truth dwelling in 
conduct as its constant prescription. 


4. Between these dietetic recommendations and the pre¬ 
cepts that are to be found later, in Christian ethics and medical 
thought, the analogies are numerous: the principle of a strict 
economy aiming at scarcity; a dread of individual misfortunes 
or collective ills that can be caused by disorderly sexual behav¬ 
ior; the need for a rigorous mastery of desires, for a struggle 
against images and a disallowance of pleasure as the goal of 
sexual intercourse. These analogies are not distant resem¬ 
blances. Several continuities can be identified. Certain of them 
are indirect, relayed through philosophical doctrines: the rule 
according to which pleasure must not be a goal was doubtless 
conveyed into Christianity more by philosophers than by
