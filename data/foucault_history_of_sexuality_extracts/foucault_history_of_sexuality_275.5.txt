to a decipherment of that activity in its origin and unfolding; 
it is not a matter of the subject’s knowing precisely how things 
are with his own desire, with the movements that lead him to 
the sexual act, with the choices he makes, with the forms of 
acts he commits or the modes of pleasure he experiences. The 
attention he must give is that which keeps him mindful of the 
rules to which he must refer his sexual activity. He is not 
expected to rediscover the obscure processes of desire working 
within him; he needs to recognize the numerous complex 
conditions that must be jointly present if one is to perform the 
acts of pleasure in an appropriate manner, without danger or 
harm. He must address a discourse of “truth” to himself. But 
this discourse does not have the function of telling the subject

the truth about himself; it should teach him, given what sexual 
acts are by nature, how to resort to them in a way that con¬ 
forms as closely, as strictly as possible to that nature. Georges 
Canguilhem said that “the cause of the cure” for Aristotle 
“was the form of health in one’s medical activity”; that it was 
not the physician but rather “health that cured the patient”; 
and that, broadly speaking, “the responsibility for a technical 
production did not belong to the artisan but to the art ... ; 
the Art, which is to say, the nondeliberative finality of a 
natural logos.” 21 Similarly, one might say that the regimen of 
the aphrodisia, the regimen of their distribution, as proposed 
by medicine, needed to be nothing more nor less than the form 
of their nature present to thought, their truth dwelling in 
conduct as its constant prescription. 


4. Between these dietetic recommendations and the pre¬ 
cepts that are to be found later, in Christian ethics and medical 
thought, the analogies are numerous: the principle of a strict 
economy aiming at scarcity; a dread of individual misfortunes 
or collective ills that can be caused by disorderly sexual behav¬ 
ior; the need for a rigorous mastery of desires, for a struggle 
against images and a disallowance of pleasure as the goal of 
sexual intercourse. These analogies are not distant resem¬ 
blances. Several continuities can be identified. Certain of them 
are indirect, relayed through philosophical doctrines: the rule 
according to which pleasure must not be a goal was doubtless 
conveyed into Christianity more by philosophers than by
