physicians. But there are also direct continuities. The treatise 
by Basil of Ancyra on virginity—its author is thought to have 
been a physician—refers to considerations that are clearly 
medical. Saint Augustine makes use of Soranus in his polemic 
against Julian of Eclana. One must not forget, either, the 
explicit references to Roman and Greek medicine that were 
made in the eighteenth century and the first half of the nine¬ 
teenth, during the time of a major new development in the 
pathology of sex.

The Care of the Self 


By focusing only on these common traits, one may get the 
impression that the sexual ethics attributed to Christianity or 
even to the modern West was already in place, at least with 
respect to its basic principles, at the time when Greco-Roman 
culture reached its culmination. But this would be to disregard 
fundamental differences concerning the type of relation to the 
self and hence the forms of integration of these precepts in the 
subject’s experience of himself. 22 



PART FIVE 

The Wife 




The great classical texts that dealt with the question of 
marriage—Xenophon’s Oeconomicus, Plato’s Republic and 
Laws, Aristotle’s Politics and Nicomachean Ethics, the Aris¬ 
totelian Economics —inscribed their reflection on marital rela¬ 
tions within a broad context: the city, with the laws or customs 
necessary to its survival and its prosperity; the household, 
with the organization that made possible its maintenance or 
enrichment. From this subordination of marriage to civic or 
familial utilities one should not infer that marriage itself was 
considered an unimportant tie that had no value other than 
that of producing descendants for the benefit of families and 
states. We have seen how demanding were the precepts that 
Xenophon, Isocrates, Plato, or Aristotle imposed on spouses 
so that they might conduct themselves properly in marriage; 
the privilege to which the wife was entitled, the justice owed 
to her, the care taken to set an example for her, to train her: 
all this would suggest a mode of relations that went far beyond 
generative functions alone. But marriage required a particular 
style of conduct, especially insofar as the married man was the 
head of the family, an honorable citizen, or a man who aspired 
to exercise over others an authority that was both political and 
moral; and in this art of being married it was the requisite 
self-mastery that was expected to give its particular form to 
the behavior of the reasonable, moderate, and just man. 

The ethics of matrimonial behavior appears in a rather

The Care of the Self 


different light in a series of texts that spread out from the first 
two centuries b.c. to the second century of our era, over the 
length of that period in which one notes a certain change in 
the practice of marriage. We thus have the Peri gamou by 
Antipater, the Latin translation of a Greek text that was for 
a long time held to be the last part of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle, the different passages Musonius devotes to mar¬ 
riage, the Marriage Precepts by Plutarch and his Dialogue on 
Love, the treatise on marriage by Hierocles, without counting 
the indications that one can find in Seneca, Epictetus, and 
certain Pythagorean texts. 1 

Must it be said that marriage became a more insistent and 
more often debated question than in the past? Should one 
suppose that the choice of the matrimonial life and the way 
one was expected to conduct oneself in it occasioned in this 
period more apprehension and that they were more carefully 
problematized? It is doubtless not possible to give an answer 
in quantitative terms. It does seem, however, that the art of 
leading the married life was considered and defined in several 
important texts in a relatively new way. The first change 
appears to consist in the fact that the art of matrimonial 
existence, while continuing to be concerned with the house¬ 
hold, its management, the birth and procreation of children, 
places an increasing value on a particular element in the midst 
of this ensemble: the personal relationship between husband 
and wife, the tie that joins them, their behavior toward each
