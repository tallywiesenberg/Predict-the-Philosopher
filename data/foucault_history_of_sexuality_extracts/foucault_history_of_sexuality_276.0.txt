physicians. But there are also direct continuities. The treatise 
by Basil of Ancyra on virginity—its author is thought to have 
been a physician—refers to considerations that are clearly 
medical. Saint Augustine makes use of Soranus in his polemic 
against Julian of Eclana. One must not forget, either, the 
explicit references to Roman and Greek medicine that were 
made in the eighteenth century and the first half of the nine¬

pathology of sex.

The Care of the Self 


By focusing only on these common traits, one may get the 
impression that the sexual ethics attributed to Christianity or 
even to the modern West was already in place, at least with 
respect to its basic principles, at the time when Greco-Roman 
culture reached its culmination. But this would be to disregard 
fundamental differences concerning the type of relation to the 
self and hence the forms of integration of these precepts in the 
subject’s experience of himself. 22 



PART FIVE 

The Wife 




The great classical texts that dealt with the question of 
marriage—Xenophon’s Oeconomicus, Plato’s Republic and 
Laws, Aristotle’s Politics and Nicomachean Ethics, the Aris¬ 
totelian Economics —inscribed their reflection on marital rela¬ 
tions within a broad context: the city, with the laws or customs 
necessary to its survival and its prosperity; the household, 
with the organization that made possible its maintenance or 
enrichment. From this subordination of marriage to civic or 
familial utilities one should not infer that marriage itself was 
considered an unimportant tie that had no value other than 
that of producing descendants for the benefit of families and 
states. We have seen how demanding were the precepts that 
Xenophon, Isocrates, Plato, or Aristotle imposed on spouses 
so that they might conduct themselves properly in marriage;
