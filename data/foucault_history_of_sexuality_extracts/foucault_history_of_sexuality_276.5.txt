the privilege to which the wife was entitled, the justice owed 
to her, the care taken to set an example for her, to train her: 
all this would suggest a mode of relations that went far beyond 
generative functions alone. But marriage required a particular 
style of conduct, especially insofar as the married man was the 
head of the family, an honorable citizen, or a man who aspired 
to exercise over others an authority that was both political and 
moral; and in this art of being married it was the requisite 
self-mastery that was expected to give its particular form to 
the behavior of the reasonable, moderate, and just man. 

The ethics of matrimonial behavior appears in a rather

two centuries b.c. to the second century of our era, over the 
length of that period in which one notes a certain change in

Antipater, the Latin translation of a Greek text that was for 
a long time held to be the last part of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle, the different passages Musonius devotes to mar¬ 
riage, the Marriage Precepts by Plutarch and his Dialogue on 
Love, the treatise on marriage by Hierocles, without counting 
the indications that one can find in Seneca, Epictetus, and 
certain Pythagorean texts. 1 

Must it be said that marriage became a more insistent and

suppose that the choice of the matrimonial life and the way 
one was expected to conduct oneself in it occasioned in this 
period more apprehension and that they were more carefully 
problematized? It is doubtless not possible to give an answer 
in quantitative terms. It does seem, however, that the art of 
leading the married life was considered and defined in several 
important texts in a relatively new way. The first change 
appears to consist in the fact that the art of matrimonial 
existence, while continuing to be concerned with the house¬ 
hold, its management, the birth and procreation of children, 
places an increasing value on a particular element in the midst 
of this ensemble: the personal relationship between husband 
and wife, the tie that joins them, their behavior toward each
