other. And this relationship, rather than borrowing its impor¬ 
tance from the other exigencies of the life of a master of a 
household, seems to be regarded as a primary and fundamen¬ 
tal element around which all the others are organized, from 
which they derive, and to which they owe their strength. In 
sum, the art of conducting oneself in marriage would appear 
to be defined less by a technique of government and more by 
a stylistics of the individual bond. 

/ The second change resides in the fact that the principle of 
moderate conduct in a married man is placed more in the 
duties of reciprocity than in mastery over others; or rather, in

the fact that the dominion of oneself over oneself is increas¬ 
ingly manifested in the practice of obligations with regard to 
others and above all in showing a certain respect for one’s 
wife. The intensification of the concern for the self goes hand 
in hand with a valorization of the other. The new way in which 
the question of sexual “fidelity” is sometimes formulated at¬ 
tests to this change. Finally, and this is the most important 
point in the present context, this art of marriage—in the 
form of a symmetrical relationship—accords a comparatively 
greater place to the problems of sexual relations between 
spouses. These problems are still treated in a rather discreet 
and allusive manner, but the fact remains that one finds, in 
authors like Plutarch, a concern with defining a certain way 
for marriage partners to act, to conduct themselves in pleasure 
relations. Here the interest in procreation is combined with 
other significations and values, which have to do with love, 
affection, understanding, and mutual sympathy. 

Once again, I am not claiming that such behaviors or senti¬ 
ments were unknown in the classical period and that they 
appeared subsequently: to establish changes of that order 
would demand an entirely different documentation and very 
different analyses as well. But it does appear—if we are to 
believe the texts we possess—that these attitudes, these ways 
of behaving, of acting and feeling, became themes of prob- 
lematization, objects of philosophical discussion, and elements 
of a deliberative art of self-conduct. 2 A stylistics of living as 
a couple emerges from the traditional precepts of matrimonial 
management: it can be observed rather clearly in an art of
