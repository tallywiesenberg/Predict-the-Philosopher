other. And this relationship, rather than borrowing its impor¬ 
tance from the other exigencies of the life of a master of a 
household, seems to be regarded as a primary and fundamen¬ 
tal element around which all the others are organized, from 
which they derive, and to which they owe their strength. In 
sum, the art of conducting oneself in marriage would appear 
to be defined less by a technique of government and more by 
a stylistics of the individual bond. 

/ The second change resides in the fact that the principle of 
moderate conduct in a married man is placed more in the 
duties of reciprocity than in mastery over others; or rather, in

the fact that the dominion of oneself over oneself is increas¬ 
ingly manifested in the practice of obligations with regard to 
others and above all in showing a certain respect for one’s 
wife. The intensification of the concern for the self goes hand 
in hand with a valorization of the other. The new way in which 
the question of sexual “fidelity” is sometimes formulated at¬ 
tests to this change. Finally, and this is the most important 
point in the present context, this art of marriage—in the 
form of a symmetrical relationship—accords a comparatively 
greater place to the problems of sexual relations between 
spouses. These problems are still treated in a rather discreet 
and allusive manner, but the fact remains that one finds, in 
authors like Plutarch, a concern with defining a certain way 
for marriage partners to act, to conduct themselves in pleasure 
relations. Here the interest in procreation is combined with 
other significations and values, which have to do with love, 
affection, understanding, and mutual sympathy. 

Once again, I am not claiming that such behaviors or senti¬ 
ments were unknown in the classical period and that they 
appeared subsequently: to establish changes of that order 
would demand an entirely different documentation and very 
different analyses as well. But it does appear—if we are to 
believe the texts we possess—that these attitudes, these ways 
of behaving, of acting and feeling, became themes of prob- 
lematization, objects of philosophical discussion, and elements 
of a deliberative art of self-conduct. 2 A stylistics of living as 
a couple emerges from the traditional precepts of matrimonial 
management: it can be observed rather clearly in an art of 
conjugal relationship, in a doctrine of sexual monopoly, and 
in an aesthetics of shared pleasures.

The Marriage Tie 


In several of these reflections on marriage, and particularly 
in the Stoic texts of the first two centuries, one discerns the 
elaboration of a certain model of relationship between spouses. 
Not that there is any notion of imposing new institutional 
forms on marriage, or any suggestion of fitting it into a differ¬ 
ent legal framework. But, without calling the traditional struc¬ 
tures into question, there is an attempt to define a mode of 
coexistence between husband and wife, a modality of relations 
between them, and a way of living together that are rather 
different from what was proposed in the classical texts. 
Schematizing a good deal, perhaps, and employing a some¬ 
what anachronistic vocabulary, we may say that marriage is 
no longer conceived simply as a “matrimonial form” fixing the 
complementarity of roles in the management of the house¬ 
hold, but also and above all as a “marriage tie” and a personal 
relationship between the man and the woman. This art of 
married living defines a relation that is dual in its form, uni¬ 
versal in its value, and specific in its intensity and its strength. 

1. A dual relation. If there is one thing that is in conform¬ 
ity with nature (kata physin) it is marrying, says Musonius 
Rufus.’ And in order to explain that nothing could be more 
essential than the discourse he is undertaking on the subject 
of marriage, Hierocles declares that it is Nature who causes 
our species to prefer that form of community. 2

These principles merely restated a lesson that was entirely 
traditional. The naturalness of marriage, though it was dis¬ 
puted by certain philosophical schools, and by the Cynics in
