The Marriage Tie 


In several of these reflections on marriage, and particularly 
in the Stoic texts of the first two centuries, one discerns the 
elaboration of a certain model of relationship between spouses. 
Not that there is any notion of imposing new institutional 
forms on marriage, or any suggestion of fitting it into a differ¬ 
ent legal framework. But, without calling the traditional struc¬ 
tures into question, there is an attempt to define a mode of 
coexistence between husband and wife, a modality of relations 
between them, and a way of living together that are rather 
different from what was proposed in the classical texts. 
Schematizing a good deal, perhaps, and employing a some¬ 
what anachronistic vocabulary, we may say that marriage is 
no longer conceived simply as a “matrimonial form” fixing the 
complementarity of roles in the management of the house¬ 
hold, but also and above all as a “marriage tie” and a personal 
relationship between the man and the woman. This art of 
married living defines a relation that is dual in its form, uni¬ 
versal in its value, and specific in its intensity and its strength. 

1. A dual relation. If there is one thing that is in conform¬ 
ity with nature (kata physin) it is marrying, says Musonius 
Rufus.’ And in order to explain that nothing could be more 
essential than the discourse he is undertaking on the subject 
of marriage, Hierocles declares that it is Nature who causes 
our species to prefer that form of community. 2

These principles merely restated a lesson that was entirely 
traditional. The naturalness of marriage, though it was dis¬
