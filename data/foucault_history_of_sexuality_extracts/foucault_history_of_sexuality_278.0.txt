particular, had been broadly founded on a series of reasons: 
the indispensable joining of male and female for procreation; 
the necessity of prolonging this conjunction, of transforming 
it into a stable union in order to ensure the education of 
offspring; the combination of assistance, comforts, and plea¬ 
sures that married life can provide, with its services and its 
obligations; and lastly, the forming of the family as the basic 
unit of the city. As for the first of these functions, the union 
of man and woman was sanctioned by a principle common to 
all animals. In regard to the others, this union manifested the 
forms of an existence that was generally considered to be 
properly human and reasonable. 

This classical theme of marriage as something natural by 
virtue of its twofold contribution to procreation and commu¬ 
nity life was taken up by the Stoics of the imperial epoch, but 
they transformed it in a significant way. 

Musonius first of all. One notes in his formulations a certain 
shift of emphasis from the “procreative” aim to the “commu¬ 
nal” finality. A passage from the treatise On the Purpose of 
Marriage is revealing in this connection. 3 It begins with the 
duality of the goals of marriage: descendants to beget, a life 
to share. But Musonius immediately adds that while procrea¬ 
tion may very well be an important thing, it could not in itself 
justify marriage. Recalling an objection made often by the 
Cynics, he points out that if it were only a matter of begetting 
offspring, humans could very well behave like the animals: 
join together and immediately separate. If they do not do so, 
it is because the essential thing for them is community: a 
companionship in which they exchange mutual care, in which 
they compete in attentiveness and kindness for one another, 
and in which the two partners can be compared to two beasts 
in a yoke, which make no progress if each one looks off to its 
side. It would be incorrect to say that Musonius gives prefer¬ 
ence to relations of help and comfort over the objective goal

of descendants. But these goals have to fit into a single form, 
which is that of a common life; the mutual solicitude that is 
shown by the partners and the progeny they rear together are 
two aspects of this essential form.
