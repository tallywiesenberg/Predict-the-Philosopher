particular, had been broadly founded on a series of reasons: 
the indispensable joining of male and female for procreation; 
the necessity of prolonging this conjunction, of transforming 
it into a stable union in order to ensure the education of 
offspring; the combination of assistance, comforts, and plea¬ 
sures that married life can provide, with its services and its 
obligations; and lastly, the forming of the family as the basic 
unit of the city. As for the first of these functions, the union 
of man and woman was sanctioned by a principle common to 
all animals. In regard to the others, this union manifested the 
forms of an existence that was generally considered to be 
properly human and reasonable. 

This classical theme of marriage as something natural by 
virtue of its twofold contribution to procreation and commu¬ 
nity life was taken up by the Stoics of the imperial epoch, but 
they transformed it in a significant way. 

Musonius first of all. One notes in his formulations a certain 
shift of emphasis from the “procreative” aim to the “commu¬ 
nal” finality. A passage from the treatise On the Purpose of 
Marriage is revealing in this connection. 3 It begins with the 
duality of the goals of marriage: descendants to beget, a life 
to share. But Musonius immediately adds that while procrea¬ 
tion may very well be an important thing, it could not in itself 
justify marriage. Recalling an objection made often by the 
Cynics, he points out that if it were only a matter of begetting 
offspring, humans could very well behave like the animals: 
join together and immediately separate. If they do not do so, 
it is because the essential thing for them is community: a 
companionship in which they exchange mutual care, in which 
they compete in attentiveness and kindness for one another, 
and in which the two partners can be compared to two beasts 
in a yoke, which make no progress if each one looks off to its 
side. It would be incorrect to say that Musonius gives prefer¬ 
ence to relations of help and comfort over the objective goal

of descendants. But these goals have to fit into a single form, 
which is that of a common life; the mutual solicitude that is 
shown by the partners and the progeny they rear together are 
two aspects of this essential form. 

Musonius indicates in another passage how this form of 
unity has been inscribed by Nature in each individual. The 
treatise Is Marriage a Handicap for the Pursuit of Philosophy? 
evokes the original division brought about in the human spe¬ 
cies between men and women. 4 Musonius reflects on the fact 
that after having separated the two sexes, the Creator wished 
to bring them back together. Now, Musonius notes, he 
brought them together again by implanting in each of them a 
“strong desire,” a desire that was both for “association” and 
for “union”— homilia and koindnia. Of the two terms, the 
first seems in fact to refer to sexual intercourse, the second to 
community life. What should be understood, then, is that 
there is a certain fundamental and original desire in human 
beings, and that this desire is directed toward physical inti¬ 
macy as well as toward the sharing of existence. A thesis that 
has this double consequence: that the extreme intensity of 
desire is not characterized simply by the movement that leads 
to the conjoining of the sexes, but also by the movement that 
conduces to the sharing of lives; conversely, that the relation¬ 
ship between the sexes belongs to the same rational scheme as 
the relations that bind two individuals to one another through 
interest, affection, and community of souls. It is the same 
natural inclination that leads, with an equal intensity and a 
rationality of the same type, to the coupling of existences and 
to the joining of bodies. 

For Musonius, then, what founds marriage is not that it is 
situated at the point of intersection of two heterogeneous 
predilections, one of which is physical, the other rational and 
social. It is rooted in a single, primitive tendency that aims 
directly toward it as an essential goal and hence, through it, 
toward its two intrinsic effects: the formation of a common 
progeny and companionship in life. One understands how 
Musonius can say that nothing is more desirable (prosphilo-

steron) than marriage. The naturalness of the latter is not due 
merely to the consequences that one can derive from its prac¬ 
tice; its naturalness is already declared by the existence of 
an original predilection, which establishes it as a desirable 
objective. 

Hierocles, in a rather similar way, founds marriage on the
