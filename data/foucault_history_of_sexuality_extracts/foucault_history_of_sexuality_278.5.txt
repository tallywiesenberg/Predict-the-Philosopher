Musonius indicates in another passage how this form of 
unity has been inscribed by Nature in each individual. The 
treatise Is Marriage a Handicap for the Pursuit of Philosophy? 
evokes the original division brought about in the human spe¬ 
cies between men and women. 4 Musonius reflects on the fact 
that after having separated the two sexes, the Creator wished 
to bring them back together. Now, Musonius notes, he 
brought them together again by implanting in each of them a 
“strong desire,” a desire that was both for “association” and 
for “union”— homilia and koindnia. Of the two terms, the 
first seems in fact to refer to sexual intercourse, the second to 
community life. What should be understood, then, is that 
there is a certain fundamental and original desire in human 
beings, and that this desire is directed toward physical inti¬ 
macy as well as toward the sharing of existence. A thesis that 
has this double consequence: that the extreme intensity of 
desire is not characterized simply by the movement that leads 
to the conjoining of the sexes, but also by the movement that 
conduces to the sharing of lives; conversely, that the relation¬ 
ship between the sexes belongs to the same rational scheme as 
the relations that bind two individuals to one another through 
interest, affection, and community of souls. It is the same 
natural inclination that leads, with an equal intensity and a 
rationality of the same type, to the coupling of existences and 
to the joining of bodies. 

For Musonius, then, what founds marriage is not that it is 
situated at the point of intersection of two heterogeneous 
predilections, one of which is physical, the other rational and 
social. It is rooted in a single, primitive tendency that aims 
directly toward it as an essential goal and hence, through it, 
toward its two intrinsic effects: the formation of a common 
progeny and companionship in life. One understands how 
Musonius can say that nothing is more desirable (prosphilo-

steron) than marriage. The naturalness of the latter is not due 
merely to the consequences that one can derive from its prac¬ 
tice; its naturalness is already declared by the existence of 
an original predilection, which establishes it as a desirable 
objective. 

Hierocles, in a rather similar way, founds marriage on the
