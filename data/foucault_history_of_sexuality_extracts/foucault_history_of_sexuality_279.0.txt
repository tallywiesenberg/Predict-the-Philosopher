“binary” nature of man. For him, humans are “conjugal” 
animals (syndyastikoi ). 5 The notion was already present in the 
Naturalists: they distinguished between animals that herd to¬ 
gether (synagelastikoi) and those that live in pairs (syndyas¬ 
tikoi). Moreover, Plato had referred to this distinction in a 
passage of the Laws. He recommended to humans the example 
of those animals that are chaste so long as they are living in 
a band but pair off and become “conjugal” when the mating 
season arrives. Aristotle had likewise spoken of the “syndas- 
tic” character of human beings, in order to define the relations 
of the master with the slave as well as relations between 
spouses. 6 

Hierocles uses the notion for different ends. He applies it 
exclusively to the conjugal relation, of which, in his view, it 
is the founding principle and natural basis. Humans are binary 
by nature; they are made to live in pairs, in a relation that at 
the same time gives them descendants and enables them to live 
their lives with a partner. For Hierocles and Musonius alike, 
Nature is not content to make allowance for marriage; she 
incites individuals to marry through a primordial inclination; 
she urges each of them to do so, including the philosopher 
himself. Nature and reason coincide in the movement that 
conduces to marriage. But it should further be noted that 
Hierocles does not oppose, as if it were a matter of two incom¬ 
patible possibilities, the syndastic character of human beings, 
which causes them to live in pairs, and their “synagelastic” 
character, which causes them to live in groups. Humans are 
made to live in twos and also to live in a multiplicity. Mankind 
is at once conjugal and social; the dual relation and the plural 
relation are linked together. Hierocles explains that a city is 
made up of households that constitute its basic units, but in

each one it is the couple that constitutes both its founding 
principle and its finished form, so that a household is not 
complete unless it is organized around a couple. One thus 
finds this conjugal duality over the entire course of human 
existence and in all of its aspects: in the original constitution 
that Nature has given it; in the obligations that man is under 
insofar as he is a creature endowed with reason; in the form 
of social life that ties him to the human community of which 
he is a part. As an animal, as a reasonable creature, and as an
