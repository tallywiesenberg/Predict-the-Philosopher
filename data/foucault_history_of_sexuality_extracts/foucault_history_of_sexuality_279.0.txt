“binary” nature of man. For him, humans are “conjugal” 
animals (syndyastikoi ). 5 The notion was already present in the 
Naturalists: they distinguished between animals that herd to¬ 
gether (synagelastikoi) and those that live in pairs (syndyas¬ 
tikoi). Moreover, Plato had referred to this distinction in a 
passage of the Laws. He recommended to humans the example 
of those animals that are chaste so long as they are living in 
a band but pair off and become “conjugal” when the mating 
season arrives. Aristotle had likewise spoken of the “syndas- 
tic” character of human beings, in order to define the relations 
of the master with the slave as well as relations between 
spouses. 6 

Hierocles uses the notion for different ends. He applies it 
exclusively to the conjugal relation, of which, in his view, it 
is the founding principle and natural basis. Humans are binary 
by nature; they are made to live in pairs, in a relation that at 
the same time gives them descendants and enables them to live 
their lives with a partner. For Hierocles and Musonius alike, 
Nature is not content to make allowance for marriage; she 
incites individuals to marry through a primordial inclination; 
she urges each of them to do so, including the philosopher 
himself. Nature and reason coincide in the movement that 
conduces to marriage. But it should further be noted that 
Hierocles does not oppose, as if it were a matter of two incom¬ 
patible possibilities, the syndastic character of human beings, 
which causes them to live in pairs, and their “synagelastic” 
character, which causes them to live in groups. Humans are 
made to live in twos and also to live in a multiplicity. Mankind 
is at once conjugal and social; the dual relation and the plural 
relation are linked together. Hierocles explains that a city is 
made up of households that constitute its basic units, but in

each one it is the couple that constitutes both its founding 
principle and its finished form, so that a household is not 
complete unless it is organized around a couple. One thus 
finds this conjugal duality over the entire course of human 
existence and in all of its aspects: in the original constitution 
that Nature has given it; in the obligations that man is under 
insofar as he is a creature endowed with reason; in the form 
of social life that ties him to the human community of which 
he is a part. As an animal, as a reasonable creature, and as an 
individual whose reason connects him to the human race, man 
is, in every respect, a conjugal being. 

2. A universal relation. For a long time, the question of 
knowing whether or not one should marry had been, in philo¬ 
sophical reflection on ways of living, a subject of discussion. 
The advantages and disadvantages of marriage; the usefulness 
of having a lawful wife and, through her, of providing oneself 
with honorable descendants; the cares and troubles, on the 
other hand, when one had to support one’s wife, look after 
one’s children, supply their needs, and at times face their 
illness or their death—these were the inexhaustible themes of 
a debate that was sometimes serious, sometimes ironic, and 
always repetitious. The echoes of it will be heard very late in 
antiquity. Epictetus and Clement of Alexandria, Pseudo- 
Lucian, the author of Affairs of the Heart, or Libanius in the 
treatise Ei gameteon (Whether One Should Marry), will draw 
from this stock of arguments, which scarcely changed over the 
centuries. The Epicureans and the Cynics were theoretically 
opposed to marriage. It seems that the Stoics were, on the 
contrary, favorable toward it from the start. 7 In any case, the 
thesis that one ought to marry seems to have become very 
common in Stoicism and entirely characteristic of its individ¬ 
ual and social ethics. But what makes the Stoic position im¬ 
portant for the history of ethics is the fact that it was not 
formulated as a simple preference for marriage by reason of 
the latter’s advantages and in spite of its disadvantages; mar¬ 
rying, for Musonius, Epictetus, or Hierocles, is something one

does, not because it is “better,” but because it is a duty. The 
marital tie derives from a universal rule. This general principle 
is supported by two types of reflection. For the Stoics, the 
obligation to marry is first of all the direct consequence of the 
principle that marriage was ordained by Nature and that 
human beings are led to it by an impulse which, being at once 
natural and rational, is the same in everyone. But it is also 
implied as an element in a set of tasks and duties that must 
not be evaded by any human being who acknowledges himself 
to be a member of a community and a part of the human race. 
Marriage is one of those duties by which private existence 
acquires a value for all.
