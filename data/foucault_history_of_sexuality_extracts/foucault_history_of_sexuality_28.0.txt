nature”: a domain susceptible to pathological processes, and 
hence one calling for therapeutic or normalizing interven¬ 
tions; a field of meanings to decipher; the site of processes 
concealed by specific mechanisms; a focus of indefinite causal 
relations; and an obscure speech (parole) that had to be 
ferreted out and listened to. The “economy” of discourses— 
their intrinsic technology, the necessities of their operation,

the tactics they employ, the effects of power which underlie 
them and which they transmit—this, and not a system of 
representations, is what determines the essential features of 
what they have to say. The history of sexuality—that is, the 
history of what functioned in the nineteenth century as a 
specific field of truth—must first be written from the view¬ 
point of a history of discourses. 

Let us put forward a general working hypothesis. The 
society that emerged in the nineteenth century—bourgeois, 
capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will—did not 
confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition. On 
the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for 
producing true discourses concerning it. Not only did it 
speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to 
formulate the uniform truth of sex. As if it suspected sex of 
harboring a fundamental secret. As if it needed this produc¬ 
tion of truth. As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not 
only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of 
knowledge. Thus sex gradually became an object of great 
suspicion; the general and disquieting meaning that pervades 
our conduct and our existence, in spite of ourselves; the point 
of weakness where evil portents reach through to us; the 
fragment of darkness that we each carry within us: a general 
signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause, a fear 
that never ends. And so, in this “question” of sex (in both 
senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the 
need for confession and integration into a field of rationality), 
two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other: 
we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret 
and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves 
the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and 
deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth, 
or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about our¬ 
selves which we think we possess in our immediate con¬ 
sciousness. We tell it its truth by deciphering what it tells us 
about that truth; it tells us our own by delivering up that part

of it that escaped us. From this interplay there has evolved, 
over several centuries, a knowledge of the subject; a knowl¬ 
edge not so much of his form, but of that which divides him, 
determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be 
ignorant of himself. As unlikely as this may seem, it should 
not surprise us when we think of the long history of the 
Christian and juridical confession, of the shifts and transfor¬ 
mations this form of knowledge-power, so important in the 
West, has undergone: the project of a science of the subject 
has gravitated, in ever narrowing circles, around the question 
of sex. Causality in the subject, the unconscious of the sub¬ 
ject, the truth of the subject in the other who knows, the 
knowledge he holds unbeknown to him, all this found an 
opportunity to deploy itself in the discourse of sex. Not, 
however, by reason of some natural property inherent in sex 
itself, but by virtue of the tactics of power immanent in this 
discourse. 

Scientia sexualis versus ars erotica, no doubt. But it should 
be noted that the ars erotica did not disappear altogether 
from Western civilization; nor has it always been absent from 
the movement by which one sought to produce a science of 
sexuality. In the Christian confession, but especially in the 
direction and examination of conscience, in the search for 
spiritual union and the love of God, there was a whole series 
of methods that had much in common with an erotic art: 
guidance by the master along a path of initiation, the inten¬ 
sification of experiences extending down to their physical 
components, the optimization of effects by the discourse that 
accompanied them. The phenomena of possession and ec¬ 
stasy, which were quite frequent in the Catholicism of the 
Counter Reformation, were undoubtedly effects that had got 
outside the control of the erotic technique immanent in this 
subtle science of the flesh. And we must ask whether, since 
the nineteenth century, the scientia sexualis —under the 
guise of its decent positivism—has not functioned, at least to
