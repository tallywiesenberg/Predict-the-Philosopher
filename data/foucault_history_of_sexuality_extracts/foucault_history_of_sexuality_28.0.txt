nature”: a domain susceptible to pathological processes, and 
hence one calling for therapeutic or normalizing interven¬ 
tions; a field of meanings to decipher; the site of processes 
concealed by specific mechanisms; a focus of indefinite causal 
relations; and an obscure speech (parole) that had to be 
ferreted out and listened to. The “economy” of discourses— 
their intrinsic technology, the necessities of their operation,

the tactics they employ, the effects of power which underlie 
them and which they transmit—this, and not a system of 
representations, is what determines the essential features of 
what they have to say. The history of sexuality—that is, the 
history of what functioned in the nineteenth century as a 
specific field of truth—must first be written from the view¬ 
point of a history of discourses. 

Let us put forward a general working hypothesis. The 
society that emerged in the nineteenth century—bourgeois, 
capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will—did not 
confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition. On 
the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for 
producing true discourses concerning it. Not only did it 
speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to 
formulate the uniform truth of sex. As if it suspected sex of 
harboring a fundamental secret. As if it needed this produc¬ 
tion of truth. As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not 
only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of 
knowledge. Thus sex gradually became an object of great 
suspicion; the general and disquieting meaning that pervades 
our conduct and our existence, in spite of ourselves; the point 
of weakness where evil portents reach through to us; the 
fragment of darkness that we each carry within us: a general 
signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause, a fear 
that never ends. And so, in this “question” of sex (in both 
senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the 
need for confession and integration into a field of rationality), 
two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other: 
we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret 
and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves 
the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and 
deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth, 
or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about our¬
