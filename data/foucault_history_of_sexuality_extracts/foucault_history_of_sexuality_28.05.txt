In 
humans, in any case, the existence of the couple allows for 
mutual help and support throughout existence; as for their 
offspring, they do not merely ensure the survival of the species; 
they are a means of “securing advantage” for the parents, for 
“the care which parents bestow on their helpless children 
when they are themselves vigorous is repaid to them in old age 
when they are helpless by their children, who are then in full 
vigor.” 34 And it was with this life enhancement in mind that 
nature arranged man and woman in the way that she did; it 
was with a view to their common life that “she organized both 
sexes.” The first is strong, the second is held back by fear; one 
finds his health in movement, the other is inclined to live a 
sedentary life; one brings provisions back to the house, the 
other watches over what is there; one nurtures the children, 
the other educates them.In a manner of speaking, nature has 
programmed the household economy and the parts that both 
spouses must take within it.Here, starting from Aristotelian 
principles, the author links up with the general outline of a 
traditional description, which had already been illustrated by 
Xenophon.It is immediately after this analysis of natural complemen¬ 
tarities that the author of the Economics addresses the ques¬ 
tion of sexual behavior.And this comes in a brief, elliptical 
passage that is worth quoting in its entirety: “First, then, he 
must do her no wrong, for thus a man is less likely himself to 
be wronged.
