What forms must they have?In spite 
of the text’s declaration a little earlier regarding the need to 
determine what kind of “association” (homilia) should unite 
man and woman, nothing is said in the Economics concerning 
its general form or its principle.In other texts, however, and 
particularly in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Politics, Aris¬ 
totle does reply to this question when he analyzes the political 
nature of the marriage tie; that is, the type of authority that 
is exercised within marriage.In his view, the relationship 
between man and wife is plainly nonegalitarian, since it is the 
man’s role to govern the wife (the reverse situation, which can 
be due to several causes, is “contrary to nature”).36 However, 
this inequality must be carefully distinguished from three 
other inequalities: that which separates the master from the 
slave (the wife is a free being), that which separates a father 
from his children (and which makes for a kingly type of 
authority), and lastly, that which in a city separates the citi¬ 
zens who rule from those who are ruled.
