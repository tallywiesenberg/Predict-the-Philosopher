38 The relationship with the wife is thus posited 
as a question of justice which is linked directly to the “politi¬ 
cal” nature of the marriage bond.Between father and son, says 
the Magna Moralia, the relationship cannot be one of justice, 
at least so long as the son has still not gained his independence, 
for he is only “a part of his father”; nor can it be a question 
of justice between master and servants unless by this is meant 
a justice “of the economic or household kind.” The same does 
not hold with the wife: doubtless the latter is and will always 
be inferior to the man, and the justice that should govern 
relations between spouses cannot be the same as the justice 
that obtains between citizens; and yet, because of their resem¬ 
blance, man and wife should be in a relationship that “ap¬ 
proaches near to political justice.” 39 Now, in the Economics 
passage where it is a question of the sexual behavior that the 
husband ought to exhibit, the author seems to be referring to 
a very different kind of justice; recalling a Pythagorean obser¬ 
vation, he declares that the wife is like “a suppliant and taken 
from her hearth.” However, a closer look at this passage 
indicates that this reference to the suppliant—and more gener¬ 
ally, to the fact that the wife was born in another household 
and that in her husband’s house she is not “at home”—is not 
meant to define the type of relations that should ordinarily 
obtain between a man and his wife.These relations, in their 
positive form and their conformity with the nonegalitarian 
justice that should govern them, had been spoken of indirectly 
in the preceding passage.We may suppose that by evoking the 
figure of the suppliant the author is saying that the marriage

itself does not authorize the wife to demand sexual faithf ulness 
of her husband, but that there is something in the married 
woman’s situation that calls for restraint and limitation on the 
part of the husband.The thing to note is precisely her position 
of weakness, which makes her subject to the benevolence of 
her husband, like a suppliant who has been taken from her 
household of birth.
