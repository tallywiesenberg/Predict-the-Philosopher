As for the nature of these unjust acts, it is not at all easy 
to specify in terms of the Economics.The text speaks of 
thyraze synousiai (“outside connections”).The word synousiai 
can signify a particular sexual union; it can also mean a “com¬ 
merce”, an “intimate relationship.” If we had to give the word 
its narrowest meaning here, it would denote any sexual act 
committed “outside the house,” which would constitute an 
injustice with regard to the wife.Such a standard appears 
rather improbable in a text that holds rather closely to the 
current thinking about ethics.If, on the other hand, we give 
the word synousia the more general meaning of “relation¬ 
ship,” we can easily see why there would be injustice in the 
exercise of an authority that is supposed to mete out to each 
according to his value, his merit, and his status: an extramari¬ 
tal liaison, a concubinage, and perhaps illegitimate children 
would be serious instances of derogation from the respect that 
is owing to the wife.
