In any case, as far as the husband’s sexual 
relations are concerned, anything that threatens the privileged 
position of the wife in the aristocratic government of the 
household also compromises the necessary and essential jus¬ 
tice of that government.Understood in this way, the formula¬ 
tion found in the Economics is not far removed in its concrete 
significance from what Xenophon implied by having Ischoma- 
chus promise his wife never to violate her privileges and status 
so long as she behaved well.* It should be noted, moreover, 
that the themes evoked in the lines that immediately follow are

quite close to those of Xenophon: the husband’s responsibility 
in the moral training of his spouse and the criticism of adorn¬

seems to place it within the multifarious interaction of the 
different forms of justice that should govern relations of hu¬ 
mans in society.
