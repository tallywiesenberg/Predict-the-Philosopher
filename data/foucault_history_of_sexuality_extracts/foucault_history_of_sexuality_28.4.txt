It is no doubt difficult to identify exactly which sexual 
practices the author of the Economics would allow or forbid 
the husband who wished to conduct himself properly.Even 
so, it does seem that the husband’s moderation—whatever its 
precise form—does not derive from the personal bond be¬ 
tween the spouses and that it is not imposed on him in the 
same way that strict faithfulness can be required of the wife.It is in the context of an unequal distribution of powers and 
functions that the husband has to privilege his wife; and it is 
through a voluntary attitude—based on interest and wisdom 
—that he will be able, as one who knows how to manage an 
aristocratic authority, to judge what is owing to each individ¬ 
ual.The husband’s moderation in this case is still an ethics of 
power that one exercises, but this ethics is conceived as one 
of the forms of justice.This is a nonegalitarian and formal way 
of defining the association between husband and wife and the 
place that their respective virtues ought to have in that associ¬ 
ation.
