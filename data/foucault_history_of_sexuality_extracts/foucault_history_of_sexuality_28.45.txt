Let us not forget that this way of thinking about marital 
relations did not in the least exclude the kind of intensity that 
was acknowledged in relations of friendship.The Nicoma- 
chean Ethics brings together all these elements—justice, ine¬ 
quality, virtue, the aristocratic form of government; and it is 
through them that Aristotle defines the special nature of the 
husband’s friendship for his wife; this philia between spouses 
“is the same as that which is found in an aristocracy; for it is 
in accordance with excellence—the better gets more of what 
is good, and each gets what befits him; and so, too, with the

justice in these relations.” 40 And further on, Aristotle adds: 
“How man and wife and in general friend and friend ought 
mutually to behave seems to be the same question as how it 
is just for them to behave.” 41 * 

One thus finds, in Greek thought of the classical period, 
elements of a marriage ethics that seems to demand on the 
part of both spouses a similar renunciation of all extramarital 
sexual activity.Now, the rule prescribing an exclusively con¬ 
jugal sexual practice, which in theory was imposed on the wife 
by her status and by the laws of the city and the family alike 
—it seems that some people may have believed that this rule 
was applicable to men as well; at any rate, this is the lesson 
that seems to emerge from Xenophon’s Oeconomicus and 
from the Aristotelian Economics, or from certain texts by 
Plato and Isocrates.These few texts appear quite isolated in 
the midst of a society in which neither the laws nor the cus¬ 
toms contained any such requirements.True.
