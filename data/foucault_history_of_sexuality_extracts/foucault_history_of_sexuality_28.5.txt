about that truth; it tells us our own by delivering up that part

of it that escaped us. From this interplay there has evolved, 
over several centuries, a knowledge of the subject; a knowl¬ 
edge not so much of his form, but of that which divides him, 
determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be 
ignorant of himself. As unlikely as this may seem, it should 
not surprise us when we think of the long history of the 
Christian and juridical confession, of the shifts and transfor¬ 
mations this form of knowledge-power, so important in the 
West, has undergone: the project of a science of the subject 
has gravitated, in ever narrowing circles, around the question 
of sex. Causality in the subject, the unconscious of the sub¬ 
ject, the truth of the subject in the other who knows, the 
knowledge he holds unbeknown to him, all this found an 
opportunity to deploy itself in the discourse of sex. Not, 
however, by reason of some natural property inherent in sex 
itself, but by virtue of the tactics of power immanent in this 
discourse. 

Scientia sexualis versus ars erotica, no doubt. But it should 
be noted that the ars erotica did not disappear altogether 
from Western civilization; nor has it always been absent from 
the movement by which one sought to produce a science of 
sexuality. In the Christian confession, but especially in the 
direction and examination of conscience, in the search for 
spiritual union and the love of God, there was a whole series 
of methods that had much in common with an erotic art: 
guidance by the master along a path of initiation, the inten¬ 
sification of experiences extending down to their physical 
components, the optimization of effects by the discourse that 
accompanied them. The phenomena of possession and ec¬ 
stasy, which were quite frequent in the Catholicism of the 
Counter Reformation, were undoubtedly effects that had got 
outside the control of the erotic technique immanent in this 
subtle science of the flesh. And we must ask whether, since 
the nineteenth century, the scientia sexualis —under the 
guise of its decent positivism—has not functioned, at least to
