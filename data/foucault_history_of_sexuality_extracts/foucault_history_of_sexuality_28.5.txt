But it does not 
appear possible to see in this the first outlines of an ethics of 
reciprocal conjugal fidelity, or the beginnings of a codification 
of married life to which Christianity was to give a universal 
form, an imperative value, and the support of a whole institu¬ 
tional system.There are several reasons for this.Except in the Platonic 
city, where the same laws apply to everyone in the same way, 
the moderation that is demanded of the husband does not have 
the same ethical basis or the same forms as that which is 
imposed on the wife; in the latter case, these derive directly 

•It should be noted that in the ideal city described by Aristotle in the Politics, 
relations between husband and wife are defined in a way that is rather similar to what 
one finds in Plato.The obligation to procreate will be lifted when the parents risk 
being too old: “from that time forward we must regard them as indulging in inter¬ 
course for reasons of health, or for some similar cause.” As for adulterous relations 
of the husband with another woman or the wife with another man, they will rightly 
be regarded as a disgraceful action (trie kalon) “in whatever shape or form, during 
all the period of their being married and being called husband and wife.” For reasons 
easy to understand, this offense will have legal consequences— atimia —if it is com¬ 
mitted “during the period of bringing children into the world .” 42

from a de jure situation, and from a statutory dependence that 
places her under the authority of her husband; in the case of 
the husband, they depend on a choice, on a willingness to give 
his life a certain form.A matter of style, as it were: the man 
is called upon to temper his conduct in terms of the mastery 
he intends to bring to bear on himself, and in terms of the 
moderation with which he aims to exercise his mastery over 
others.
