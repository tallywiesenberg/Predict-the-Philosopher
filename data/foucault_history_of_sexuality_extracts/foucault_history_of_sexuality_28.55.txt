Whence the fact that this austerity is presented—in 
Isocrates, for instance—as a refinement whose exemplary 
value does not take the form of a universal principle; whence, 
too, the fact that the renunciation of every relation outside the 
conjugal relation is not explicitly prescribed by Xenophon or 
perhaps even by the Aristotelian author, and it does not take 
the form of a permanent commitment in Isocrates but that of 
an achievement instead.Furthermore, whether the prescription is symmetrical (as in 
Plato) or not, the moderation that is demanded of the husband 
is not based on the special nature and peculiar form of the 
conjugal relationship.No doubt it is because he is married that 
his sexual activity must undergo some restrictions and accept 
a certain delimitation.But it is the status of a married man, 
not the relation to the wife, that requires this: married—in 
Plato’s city—according to the forms that the state will decide, 
and in order to provide it with the citizens it needs; married 
and thus having to manage a household that should prosper 
in an orderly fashion and be maintained in a condition that 
will be, in everyone’s eyes, the image and proof of a good 
government (Xenophon and Isocrates); married and obligated 
to apply the rules of justice in the forms of inequality appropri¬ 
ate to marriage and to the wife’s nature (Aristotle).There is 
nothing in all this that would rule out personal feelings of 
attachment, affection, and concern.
