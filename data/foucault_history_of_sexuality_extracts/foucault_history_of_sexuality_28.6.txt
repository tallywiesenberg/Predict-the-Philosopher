But it should be clearly 
understood that it is never vis-a-vis the wife that this sophro- 
syne is necessary, in the association that joins them together

interplay of duties and demands in which his reputation, his 
relation to others, his prestige in the city, and his willingness 
to lead a fine and good existence are at stake.One understands, therefore, how the man’s moderation and 
the wife’s virtue could be presented as two simultaneous re¬ 
quirements, each deriving, in its own way and its own forms, 
from the state of marriage; and yet it is as if the question of 
sexual practice as an element—a crucial element—of the con¬ 
jugal relationship were hardly raised.Later, sexual relations 
between spouses, the form they should take, the acts that were 
permitted, the rules of decency they should observe—but also 
the intensity of the bonds they manifested and drew closer— 
were to be an important subject of reflection.The entire sexual 
life between husbands and wives was to give rise, in the Chris¬ 
tian pastoral ministry, to a codification that was often quite 
detailed; but already before this, Plutarch had broached ques¬ 
tions concerning not only the form of sexual relations between 
spouses but their affective significance as well; he had under¬ 
scored the importance of reciprocal pleasures for the mutual 
attachment of husband and wife.
