This new ethics would be 
characterized, not simply by the fact that man and wife would 
be restricted to one sexual partner, the spouse, but also by the 
fact that their sexual activity would be problematized as an 
essential, decisive, and especially delicate component of their 
personal conjugal relation.Nothing of the sort is visible in the 
moral reflection of the fourth century B.C.This is not to sug¬ 
gest that sexual pleasures had little importance in the married 
life of the Greeks of that period, or that they did not contrib¬ 
ute to a couple’s mutual understanding: that is another ques¬ 
tion in any case.But in order to understand the working out 
of sexual conduct as a moral problem, it is necessary to em¬ 
phasize that, in classical Greek thought, the sexual behavior 
of the two spouses was not questioned from the standpoint of 
their personal relationship.What occurred between them as¬ 
sumed importance from the moment it became a question of 
having children.
