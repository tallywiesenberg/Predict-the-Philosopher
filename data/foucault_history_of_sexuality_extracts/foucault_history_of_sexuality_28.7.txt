an object of reflection and prescription: the point of prob- 
lematization was in the moderation that each of the two part¬ 
ners needed to show for reasons and in forms corresponding 
to their sex and their status.Moderation was not a matter 
shared between them and requiring concern on the part of the 
one for the other.In this we are f ar from the Christian teach¬

tity, being careful not to cause him or her to commit the sin 
of the flesh—either through indecent entreaties or through 
harsh refusals.For the Greek moralists of the classical epoch, 
moderation was prescribed to both partners in matrimony; 
but it depended on two distinct modes of relation to self, 
corresponding to the two individuals.The wife’s virtue 
constituted the correlative and the proof of a submissive 
behavior; the man’s austerity was part of an ethics of self¬ 
delimiting domination.
