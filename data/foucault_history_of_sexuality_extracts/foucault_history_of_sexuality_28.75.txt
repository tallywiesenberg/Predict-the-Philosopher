Erotics

A Problematic 
Relation 


The use of pleasures in the relationship with boys was a 
theme of anxiety for Greek thought—which is paradoxical in 
a society that is believed to have “tolerated” what we call 
“homosexuality.” But perhaps it would be just as well if we 
avoided those two terms here.As matter of fact, the notion of homosexuality is plainly 
inadequate as a means of referring to an experience, forms of 
valuation, and a system of categorization so different from 
ours.The Greeks did not see love for one’s own sex and love 
for the other sex as opposites, as two exclusive choices, two 
radically different types of behavior.The dividing lines did not 
follow that kind of boundary.What distinguished a moderate, 
self-possessed man from one given to pleasures was, from the 
viewpoint of ethics, much more important than what differen¬ 
tiated, among themselves, the categories of pleasures that in¬ 
vited the greatest devotion.
