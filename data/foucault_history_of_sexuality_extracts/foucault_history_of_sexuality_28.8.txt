To have loose morals was to be 
incapable of resisting either women or boys, without it being 
any more serious than that.When he portrays the tyrannical 
man—that is, one “in whose soul dwells the tyrant Eros who 
directs everything” 1 —Plato shows him from two equivalent 
angles, so that what we see in both instances is contempt for 
the most fundamental obligations and subjection to the rule of 
pleasure: “Do you think he would sacrifice his long beloved 
and irreplaceable mother for a recently acquired mistress 
whom he can do without, or, for the sake of a young boy

recently become dear to him, sacrifice his aged and irreplace¬ 
able father, his oldest friend, beat him, and make his parents 
slaves of those others if he brought them under the same 
roof?” 2 When Alcibiades was censured for his debauchery, it 
was not for the former kind in contradistinction to the latter, 
it was, as Bion the Borysthenite put it, “that in his adolescence 
he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as a young 
man the wives from their husbands.” 3 

Conversely, if one wanted to show that a man was self- 
controlled, it was said of him—as Plato said concerning Iccus 
of Tarentum 4 —that he was able to abstain from relations with 
boys and women alike; and, according to Xenophon, the ad¬ 
vantage that Cyrus saw in relying on eunuchs for court service 
was that they were incapable of offending the honor of either 
women or boys.5 So it seemed to people that of these two 
inclinations one was not more likely than the other, and the 
two could easily coexist in the same individual.Were the Greeks bisexual, then?Yes, if we mean by this that 
a Greek could, simultaneously or in turn, be enamored of a 
boy or a girl; that a married man could have paidika; that it 
was common for a male to change to a preference for women 
after “boy-loving” inclinations in his youth.
