But if we wish to 
turn our attention to the way in which they conceived of this 
dual practice, we need to take note of the fact that they did 
not recognize two kinds of “desire,” two different or compet¬ 
ing “drives,” each claiming a share of men’s hearts or appe¬

free choice they allowed themselves between the two sexes, but 
for them this option was not referred to a dual, ambivalent,

nobler, and more reasonable love that is drawn to what has 
the most vigor and intelligence, which obviously can only 
mean the male sex.
