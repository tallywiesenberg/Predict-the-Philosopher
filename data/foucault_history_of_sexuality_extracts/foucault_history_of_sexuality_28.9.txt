Xenophon’s Symposium shows very well 
that the choice between girls and boys in no way relates to the 
distinction between two tendencies or to the opposition be¬ 
tween two forms of desire.The dinner is given by Callias in 
honor of the very young Autolycus whom he is enamored of; 
the boy’s beauty is so striking that he draws looks from all the 
guests as “the sudden glow of a light at night draws all eyes 
to itself”; “there was not one ...who did not feel his soul 
strangely stirred by the boy.” 8 Now, among the participants, 
several were engaged or married, like Niceratus—who felt a 
love for his wife that she reciprocated, in the play of Eros and 
Anteros—or Critobulus, who was nonetheless still of an age 
to have suitors and male lovers; 9 further, Critobulus tells of his 
love for Cleinias, a boy he has met at school and, in a comic 
joust with Socrates, he matches his own beauty against that 
of the latter; the contest prize is to be a kiss from a boy and 
one from a girl: the boy and girl belong to a Syracusan who 
has taught them a dance whose graceful charm and acrobatic 
movements are the delight of everyone present.
