He has also 
taught them to mime the loves of Dionysus and Ariadne; and 
the guests, who have just heard Socrates say what true love for 
boys should be, all feel extremely “excited” (aneptoromenoi) 
on seeing this “Dionysus truly handsome” and this “Ariadne 
truly fair” exchanging real kisses; one can tell from the lovers’ 
vows pronounced by the young acrobats that they “are now 
permitted to satisfy their long cherished desires.” 10 So many 
different incitements to love put everyone in the mood for 
pleasure: at the end of the Symposium, some ride off on their

The Use of Pleasure 


where they felt a common enchantment with the beauty of a 
girl or the charm of boys, men of various ages kindled the 
appetite for pleasure or serious love—love that some would 
look for in women, others in young men.To be sure, the preference for boys or girls was easily recog¬ 
nized as a character trait: men could be distinguished by the 
pleasure they were most fond of; 11 a matter of taste that could 
lend itself to humorous treatment, not a matter of topology 
involving the individual’s very nature, the truth of his desire, or 
the natural legitimacy of his predilection.People did not have 
the notion of two distinct appetites allotted to different in¬ 
dividuals or at odds with each other in the same soul; rather, 
they saw two ways of enjoying one’s pleasure, one of which was 
more suited to certain individuals or certain periods of exis¬ 
tence.The enjoyment of boys and of women did not constitute 
two classificatory categories between which individuals could 
be distributed; a man who preferred paidika did not think of 
himself as being “different” from those who pursued women.
