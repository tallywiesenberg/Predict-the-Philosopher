Epictetus’ discussion with an Epicurean shows clearly this 
recognition of marriage as a universal duty for every human 
being who wishes to live in harmony with nature, and as a 
function for the individual who aims to lead a life that is useful 
to those around him and to humanity in general. The Epicu¬ 
rean whom Epictetus refutes in Discourse Seven of Book III 
is a leading citizen; he exercises responsibilities; he is an “in¬ 
spector of cities.” But, out of faithfulness to his philosophical 
principles, he rejects marriage. To which Epictetus retorts 
with three arguments. The first refers to immediate utility and 
to the impossibility of universalizing the renunciation of mar¬ 
riage: if everyone refuses to get married, “what is to happen 
then? Where will our citizens come from? Who will educate 
them? Who will be governor of the ephebes? Who will manage 
the gymnasia? Yes, and what will be their education?” The 
second argument refers to the social obligations that no man 
must shirk and of which marriage forms a part, alongside the 
duties that pertain to political life, religion, and the family: 
“citizenship, marriage, procreation of children, worship of 
God, care of parents.” The final argument concerns the natu¬ 
ralness of a behavior that reason prescribes: “We must subor¬ 
dinate pleasure to these principles, to minister to them as a 
servant, to evoke our interests, and to keep us in the way of 
our natural activities.” 8 

We see then that the principle of having to marry has be-

come detached from the comparative interplay between the 
advantages and drawbacks of marriage. It is expressed as the 
need for everyone to make a choice of a life that assumes the 
form of a universal, in that it conforms to nature and is useful 
to all. Marriage joins man to himself insofar as he is a natural 
being and a member of the human race. Epictetus says as 
much to his Epicurean interlocutor, in taking leave of him: by 
not doing what Zeus prescribes, “you will suffer penalty and 
harm. What kind of harm? No harm but that of failing to do 
your duty; you will destroy the trustworthy, self-respecting, 
well-behaved man in you. Look not for any greater harm than 
this!” 9 

And yet, it was the same with marriage as with all the other 
practices that the Stoics classed among the proegoumena, the
