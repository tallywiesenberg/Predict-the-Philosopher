Epictetus’ discussion with an Epicurean shows clearly this 
recognition of marriage as a universal duty for every human 
being who wishes to live in harmony with nature, and as a 
function for the individual who aims to lead a life that is useful 
to those around him and to humanity in general. The Epicu¬ 
rean whom Epictetus refutes in Discourse Seven of Book III 
is a leading citizen; he exercises responsibilities; he is an “in¬ 
spector of cities.” But, out of faithfulness to his philosophical 
principles, he rejects marriage. To which Epictetus retorts 
with three arguments. The first refers to immediate utility and 
to the impossibility of universalizing the renunciation of mar¬ 
riage: if everyone refuses to get married, “what is to happen 
then? Where will our citizens come from? Who will educate 
them? Who will be governor of the ephebes? Who will manage 
the gymnasia? Yes, and what will be their education?” The 
second argument refers to the social obligations that no man 
must shirk and of which marriage forms a part, alongside the 
duties that pertain to political life, religion, and the family: 
“citizenship, marriage, procreation of children, worship of 
God, care of parents.” The final argument concerns the natu¬ 
ralness of a behavior that reason prescribes: “We must subor¬ 
dinate pleasure to these principles, to minister to them as a 
servant, to evoke our interests, and to keep us in the way of 
our natural activities.” 8 

We see then that the principle of having to marry has be-

come detached from the comparative interplay between the 
advantages and drawbacks of marriage. It is expressed as the 
need for everyone to make a choice of a life that assumes the 
form of a universal, in that it conforms to nature and is useful 
to all. Marriage joins man to himself insofar as he is a natural 
being and a member of the human race. Epictetus says as 
much to his Epicurean interlocutor, in taking leave of him: by 
not doing what Zeus prescribes, “you will suffer penalty and 
harm. What kind of harm? No harm but that of failing to do 
your duty; you will destroy the trustworthy, self-respecting, 
well-behaved man in you. Look not for any greater harm than 
this!” 9 

And yet, it was the same with marriage as with all the other 
practices that the Stoics classed among the proegoumena, the 
things that are preferable. There may be circumstances in 
which it is not obligatory. This is what Hierocles says: “Mar¬ 
rying is preferable [proegoumenon ]; hence it is an imperative 
for us provided that no circumstance opposes it.” 10 It is pre¬ 
cisely in this relationship between the obligation to marry and 
the conjuncture of circumstances that the difference between 
the Stoics and the Epicureans was most pronounced. For the 
Epicureans, no one was obliged to marry, unless there existed 
a circumstance that could make this form of union desirable. 
For the Stoics, only particular circumstances could lift an 
obligation that in theory one could not escape. 

Among these circumstances, there was one that was long an 
object of discussion: the choice of the philosophical lif e. That 
the marriage of philosophers had been, since the classical age, 
a theme of debate can be explained by several factors: the 
heterogeneity of this type of life compared with other forms 
of existence; the incompatibility between the goal of philoso¬ 
phy (the care of one’s own soul, the mastery of one’s passion, 
the search for peace of mind) and what was traditionally 
described as the agitation and troubles of married life. In 
short, it seemed difficult to reconcile the style characteristic of 
the philosophical life with the demands of a marriage defined, 
above all, by its responsibilities. Two important texts show,

however, an entirely different way not only of resolving the 
difficulty but of posing the very elements of the problem. 

Musonius is the author of the oldest. In his text he takes up 
the question of the practical incompatibility between the mar¬ 
ried life and the philosophical life, turning it into the affirma¬ 
tion of an essential connection between the two. 11 Anyone who 
would be a philosopher, he says, should marry. He should do 
so because the primary function of philosophy is to enable one 
to live in accord with nature and to fulfill all the obligations 
that follow from nature. He will take as his “teacher and 
guide” that which is fitting for a human being who conforms 
to nature. But, further, he is under a greater obligation to 
marry than anyone else, for the philosopher’s role is not sim¬ 
ply to live according to reason; he must be for everyone else 
an example of that reasonable life as well as a master who 
shows the way to it. The philosopher cannot be inferior to
