things that are preferable. There may be circumstances in 
which it is not obligatory. This is what Hierocles says: “Mar¬ 
rying is preferable [proegoumenon ]; hence it is an imperative 
for us provided that no circumstance opposes it.” 10 It is pre¬ 
cisely in this relationship between the obligation to marry and 
the conjuncture of circumstances that the difference between 
the Stoics and the Epicureans was most pronounced. For the 
Epicureans, no one was obliged to marry, unless there existed 
a circumstance that could make this form of union desirable. 
For the Stoics, only particular circumstances could lift an 
obligation that in theory one could not escape. 

Among these circumstances, there was one that was long an 
object of discussion: the choice of the philosophical lif e. That 
the marriage of philosophers had been, since the classical age, 
a theme of debate can be explained by several factors: the 
heterogeneity of this type of life compared with other forms 
of existence; the incompatibility between the goal of philoso¬ 
phy (the care of one’s own soul, the mastery of one’s passion, 
the search for peace of mind) and what was traditionally 
described as the agitation and troubles of married life. In 
short, it seemed difficult to reconcile the style characteristic of 
the philosophical life with the demands of a marriage defined, 
above all, by its responsibilities. Two important texts show,

however, an entirely different way not only of resolving the 
difficulty but of posing the very elements of the problem. 

Musonius is the author of the oldest. In his text he takes up 
the question of the practical incompatibility between the mar¬ 
ried life and the philosophical life, turning it into the affirma¬ 
tion of an essential connection between the two. 11 Anyone who 
would be a philosopher, he says, should marry. He should do 
so because the primary function of philosophy is to enable one 
to live in accord with nature and to fulfill all the obligations 
that follow from nature. He will take as his “teacher and 
guide” that which is fitting for a human being who conforms 
to nature. But, further, he is under a greater obligation to 
marry than anyone else, for the philosopher’s role is not sim¬ 
ply to live according to reason; he must be for everyone else 
an example of that reasonable life as well as a master who 
shows the way to it. The philosopher cannot be inferior to
