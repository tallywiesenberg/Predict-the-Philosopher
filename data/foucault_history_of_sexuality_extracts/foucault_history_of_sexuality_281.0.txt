those he must advise and lead. If he were to refuse marriage, 
he would be showing himself inferior to all those who, obeying 
reason and following nature, practice, out of concern for 
themselves and for others, matrimonial life. The latter, far 
from being incompatible with philosophy, constitutes for it a 
double obligation. In relation to oneself, it is the duty of giving 
one’s existence a universally valuable form, and in relation to 
others, it is the necessity of offering them a model of living. 

One might be tempted to oppose to this analysis the one that 
Epictetus submits when he draws the ideal portrait of the 
Cynic, of the man who makes a profession of philosophizing, 
who must be the common pedagogue, the herald of truth, 
Zeus’ messenger to humans, who goes on stage to challenge 
men and to reproach them for the way they live. Such a man 
rightly “has nothing, is naked, without home or hearth; he 
lives in squalor, without a slave, without a city.” Nor does he 
have “a wife or children,” but “only earth and sky and one 
poor cloak.” 12 Moreover, Epictetus presents a familiar picture 
of marriage and its disadvantages. In its banal verve, it con¬ 
forms to what had been said for a very long time concerning 
the “annoyances of housekeeping,” which disturb the soul and

interfere with reflection. Married, a man is bound by “private 
duties.” He has to heat the water for the cooking pot, accom¬ 
pany the children to school, render service to his father-in- 
law, provide his wife with wool, oil, a bed, and a cup. 13 At first 
glance, this looks like nothing more than the long list of 
obligations that burden the sage and prevent him from attend¬ 
ing to himself. But the reason for which the ideal Cynic 
should, according to Epictetus, forgo marriage is not the de¬ 
sire to reserve his attentions for himself and no one else. On 
the contrary, it is because he has the mission of caring for 
humans, of looking after them, of being their “benefactor.” It 
is because, like a doctor, he must “make his rounds” and “feel 
men’s pulses.” 14 Kept occupied by the responsibilities of a 
household (and perhaps especially by the household Epictetus 
describes), he would not have the leisure to go about a task 
that takes in the whole of humanity. His renunciation of all 
these private ties is but the consequence of the ties he estab¬ 
lishes, qua philosopher, with the human race. He has no 
family because his family is mankind; he has no children
