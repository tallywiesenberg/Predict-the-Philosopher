because, in a sense, he has fathered all men and all women. It 
is important to understand, therefore, that the responsibility 
for the universal family is what prevents the Cynic from devot¬ 
ing himself to a particular household. 

But Epictetus does not stop there. He fixes a limit to this 
incompatibility. It is limited by the present situation, by what 
he calls the current “catastasis” of the world. If in fact we 
lived in a city of wise men, there would be no further need of 
these men who are sent by the gods and who, unburdening 
themselves of everything, rise up to awaken others to truth. 
Everyone would be a philosopher. The Cynic and his rude 
profession would be unnecessary. Furthermore, marriage, in 
this state of things, would not present the same kind of difficul¬ 
ties as it does today, in the present form of humanity. Each 
philosopher would be able to find in his wife, in his father-in- 
law, in his children, people like him and brought up in the 
same manner as he. 15 The conjugal relation would bring the

sage face to face with an alter ego. Hence it must be borne in 
mind that the militant philosopher’s refusal of marriage does 
not bespeak an essential condemnation. It answers only to a 
circumstantial necessity. The philosopher’s celibacy could just 
as well be abandoned if all humans were in a condition to lead 
an existence conforming to their essential nature. 

3. A singular relation. The philosophers of the imperial 
epoch obviously did not invent the affective dimension of the 
conjugal relationship, just as they did not efface the useful 
purposes it might serve in individual, familial, or civic life. But 
to that relationship and to the way in which it established a 
bond between husband and wife, they proposed to give a form 
and particular qualities. 

Aristotle ascribed considerable importance and strength to 
the relationship between spouses. But when he analyzed the 
ties that attach humans to one another, it was blood relations 
that he seemed to favor. According to him, no tie was more 
intense than the attachment of parents to their children, in 
whom they could recognize a part of themselves. 16 The hierar¬ 
chy Musonius posits in the treatise Is Marriage a Handicap for 
the Pursuit of Philosophy? is different. Of all the communities
