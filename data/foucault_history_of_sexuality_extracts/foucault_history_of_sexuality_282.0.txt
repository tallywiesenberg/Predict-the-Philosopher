that can be established among humans, Musonius designates 
marriage as the highest, the most important, and the most 
venerable (presbytate). It is greater in strength than that which 
can join a friend to a friend, a brother to a brother, a son to 
his parents. It even surpasses—this is the decisive point—the 
bond that attaches parents to their offspring. No father, no 
mother, writes Musonius, will feel greater friendship for their 
child than for their marriage partner, and he cites the example 
of Admetus: Who was willing to die for him? Not his old 
parents, but his wife, Alcestis, in spite of her youth. 17 

Conceived in this way, as a closer and more fundamental 
relationship than any other, the marriage tie serves to define 
a whole mode of existence. Married life had been character¬ 
ized by an allocation of tasks and behaviors that were comple-

which the wife could not do, and she, for her part, did the 
work that was not within the competence of the husband. It 
was the fact of having the same goal (the prosperity of the 
household) that gave a unity to these activities and to modes 
of life that were different by definition. This adjustment of 
specific roles did not disappear from the set of precepts for 
living that could be given to married people. Hierocles refers, 
in his Economics, to rules that are identical to those found in 
Xenophon. 18 But behind this distribution of behaviors relating 
to the house, the possessions, and the estate, one sees a shared 
life and a common existence being affirmed as an exigency. 
The art of marriage is not simply a rational way for the 
spouses to act, each on his or her own account, in view of a 
purpose both partners recognize and in which they are united. 
It is a way of living together and of being as one person. 
Marriage calls for a certain style of conduct in which each of 
the two partners leads his or her life with the other, and in 
which, together, they form a common existence. 

This style of existence is characterized first of all by a cer¬ 
tain art of being together. For his business affairs, the husband 
must be away from home, while the wife must remain at home. 
But good spouses will want to rejoin one another and remain 
separated as little as possible. Closeness, the other’s presence, 
living side by side, are presented not simply as duties, but as
