that can be established among humans, Musonius designates 
marriage as the highest, the most important, and the most 
venerable (presbytate). It is greater in strength than that which 
can join a friend to a friend, a brother to a brother, a son to 
his parents. It even surpasses—this is the decisive point—the 
bond that attaches parents to their offspring. No father, no 
mother, writes Musonius, will feel greater friendship for their 
child than for their marriage partner, and he cites the example 
of Admetus: Who was willing to die for him? Not his old 
parents, but his wife, Alcestis, in spite of her youth. 17 

Conceived in this way, as a closer and more fundamental 
relationship than any other, the marriage tie serves to define 
a whole mode of existence. Married life had been character¬ 
ized by an allocation of tasks and behaviors that were comple-

mentary in form. The man was expected to do those things 
which the wife could not do, and she, for her part, did the 
work that was not within the competence of the husband. It 
was the fact of having the same goal (the prosperity of the 
household) that gave a unity to these activities and to modes 
of life that were different by definition. This adjustment of 
specific roles did not disappear from the set of precepts for 
living that could be given to married people. Hierocles refers, 
in his Economics, to rules that are identical to those found in 
Xenophon. 18 But behind this distribution of behaviors relating 
to the house, the possessions, and the estate, one sees a shared 
life and a common existence being affirmed as an exigency. 
The art of marriage is not simply a rational way for the 
spouses to act, each on his or her own account, in view of a 
purpose both partners recognize and in which they are united. 
It is a way of living together and of being as one person. 
Marriage calls for a certain style of conduct in which each of 
the two partners leads his or her life with the other, and in 
which, together, they form a common existence. 

This style of existence is characterized first of all by a cer¬ 
tain art of being together. For his business affairs, the husband 
must be away from home, while the wife must remain at home. 
But good spouses will want to rejoin one another and remain 
separated as little as possible. Closeness, the other’s presence, 
living side by side, are presented not simply as duties, but as 
an aspiration characteristic of the relationship that should join 
husband and wife. They may each have their roles; there is no 
question of their doing without each other. Musonius under¬ 
scores the need felt by spouses in a good marriage to be 
together. He even makes the difficulty of being apart the crite¬ 
rion of their singular friendship. No absence, he says, is as 
difficult to endure as, for the wife, that of the husband and, for 
the husband, that of the wife. No presence has such a power 
to lighten grief, to increase joy, to remedy misfortune. 19 The 
presence of the spouse is at the heart of married life. One 
thinks of Pliny describing to his absent wife the nights and

days he spends looking for her in vain, and recalling her face 
in order to evoke a quasi-presence in his mind. 20 

An art of being together, and an art of dialogue as well. To 
be sure, the Oeconomicus of Xenophon described a certain 
model of exchange between the two spouses. The husband was 
supposed above all to guide, to give advice, to instruct, and, 
when required, to direct her in her activity as mistress of the 
house. For her part, the wife needed to ask questions about 
those things she did not know and to give an account of what 
she had been able to accomplish. The later texts suggest an¬ 
other kind of dialogue, with different ends. Each of the two 
spouses, according to Hierocles, should report to the other 
concerning what they have done. The wife will tell the hus¬ 
band what is going on at home, but she will also need to ask 
him about what is happening on the outside. 21 Pliny likes 
Calpurnia to keep informed of his public activity, to encourage 
him, and to rejoice in his successes—a custom that had long 
been traditional in aristocratic Roman families. But he associ¬ 
ates it directly with his work; and in return, the taste his wife 
has for belles-lettres is inspired by the tenderness she feels for 
her husband. She must be the witness and judge of his literary 
endeavors. She reads his works, listens to his speeches, and 
receives with pleasure the compliments she may hear. Pliny 
trusts that in this way mutual affection, concordia, will endure 
and grow stronger day by day. 22 

Whence the idea that married life must also be the art of 
collaborating to form a new unity. One recalls how Xenophon 
had distinguished the different qualities with which nature
