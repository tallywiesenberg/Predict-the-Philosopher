an aspiration characteristic of the relationship that should join 
husband and wife. They may each have their roles; there is no 
question of their doing without each other. Musonius under¬ 
scores the need felt by spouses in a good marriage to be 
together. He even makes the difficulty of being apart the crite¬ 
rion of their singular friendship. No absence, he says, is as 
difficult to endure as, for the wife, that of the husband and, for 
the husband, that of the wife. No presence has such a power 
to lighten grief, to increase joy, to remedy misfortune. 19 The 
presence of the spouse is at the heart of married life. One 
thinks of Pliny describing to his absent wife the nights and

days he spends looking for her in vain, and recalling her face 
in order to evoke a quasi-presence in his mind. 20 

An art of being together, and an art of dialogue as well. To 
be sure, the Oeconomicus of Xenophon described a certain 
model of exchange between the two spouses. The husband was 
supposed above all to guide, to give advice, to instruct, and, 
when required, to direct her in her activity as mistress of the 
house. For her part, the wife needed to ask questions about 
those things she did not know and to give an account of what 
she had been able to accomplish. The later texts suggest an¬ 
other kind of dialogue, with different ends. Each of the two 
spouses, according to Hierocles, should report to the other 
concerning what they have done. The wife will tell the hus¬ 
band what is going on at home, but she will also need to ask 
him about what is happening on the outside. 21 Pliny likes 
Calpurnia to keep informed of his public activity, to encourage 
him, and to rejoice in his successes—a custom that had long 
been traditional in aristocratic Roman families. But he associ¬ 
ates it directly with his work; and in return, the taste his wife 
has for belles-lettres is inspired by the tenderness she feels for 
her husband. She must be the witness and judge of his literary 
endeavors. She reads his works, listens to his speeches, and 
receives with pleasure the compliments she may hear. Pliny 
trusts that in this way mutual affection, concordia, will endure 
and grow stronger day by day. 22 

Whence the idea that married life must also be the art of 
collaborating to form a new unity. One recalls how Xenophon 
had distinguished the different qualities with which nature
