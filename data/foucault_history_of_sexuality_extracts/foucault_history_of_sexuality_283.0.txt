had endowed the man and the woman so that they might carry 
out their respective responsibilities in the household, or how 
Aristotle bestowed on men the possibility of developing, to the 
point of perfection, virtues which in women would always 
remain inferior, justifying their subordination. The Stoics, on 
the other hand, granted both sexes, if not identical aptitudes, 
at least an equal capability for virtue. The good marriage, 
according to Musonius, depends on homonoia. What is meant

The Care of the Self 


by this word is not just likemindedness between the partners; 
rather, it denotes an identity in their way of being reasonable, 
in their moral attitude, and in their virtue. The couple is 
expected to form a veritable ethical unity in marital life. This 
unity is compared by Musonius to the fitting of two pieces of 
wood in a frame: they must both be straight in order to consti¬ 
tute a solid whole. 23 But in order to characterize the substan¬ 
tial unity the couple must form, writers occasionally resort to 
another metaphor, stronger than that of pieces fitted together: 
di'holdn krasis, complete fusion, according to a notion bor¬ 
rowed from Stoic physics. 

The treatise by Antipater had already appealed to this 
model in order to contrast conjugal affection with the other 
forms of friendship. 24 He described the latter as combinations 
in which the elements remain independent of each other, like 
the seeds that one mixes and that can be separated again. The 
term mixis denotes this type of blending by juxtaposition. By 
contrast, marriage should be in the nature of a total fusion, 
like that observed between water and wine, which form by 
their mixture a new liquid. This same notion of matrimonial 
“crasis” is reencountered in Plutarch, in the thirty-fourth of 
the Marriage Precepts. It is used to distinguish between three 
types of marriage and to rank them in relation to one another. 
There are marriages that are contracted solely for the plea¬ 
sures of the bed. They belong in the category of those mixtures 
that juxtapose separate elements, each of which retains its 
individuality. There are marriages that are concluded for rea¬ 
sons of self-interest. They are like those combinations in which 
the elements form a new, solid unity, but can always be dis¬ 
sociated from one another: e.g., the unity constituted by the 
parts of a frame. As for total fusion—the “crasis” that ensures 
the formation of a new unity that nothing can undo—only
