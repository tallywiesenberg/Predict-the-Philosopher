sum up the theoretical debates to which it may have given rise. 
They have to be taken in their partiality, for what they present 
that was characteristic of certain doctrines and no doubt pecu¬ 
liar to a few limited milieus. But they reveal, albeit in frag¬

married—that attention to oneself and devotion to conjugal 
life could be closely associated. If relationship with a woman 
who is “the wife,” “the spouse,” is essential to existence, if
