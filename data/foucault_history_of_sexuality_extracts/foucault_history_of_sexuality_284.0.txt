principle that one must govern oneself in order to be able to 
rule others. It is also defined by the elaboration of a certain 
form of reciprocity. In the conjugal bond that so strongly 
marks the existence of each person, the spouse, as privileged

need to look into the lives of young married couples—under¬ 
scores the difficulty people probably would have in accept¬ 
ing legislation concerned with such things. 1 Opposing this
