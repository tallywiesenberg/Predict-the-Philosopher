it requires, is not defined by self-mastery alone and by the 
principle that one must govern oneself in order to be able to 
rule others. It is also defined by the elaboration of a certain 
form of reciprocity. In the conjugal bond that so strongly 
marks the existence of each person, the spouse, as privileged

partner, must be treated as a being identical to oneself and as 
an element with whom one forms a substantial unity. Such is 
the paradox of this thematics of marriage in the cultivation of 
the self, as it was developed by an entire philosophy. The 
woman as spouse is valorized within it as the other par excel¬ 
lence. But the husband must also recognize her as forming a 
unity with himself. Compared with the traditional forms of 
matrimonial relations, the change was considerable.

The Question of 
Monopoly 


One might expect that the treatises on matrimonial life 
would assign an important role to the regimen of sexual rela¬ 
tions that must be established between husband and wife. In 
actual fact, the place reserved for them is relatively limited. It 
is as if the objectivation of the conjugal relation had preceded, 
and by far, the objectivation of the sexual relations that devel¬ 
oped within it. As if all the effort and attention that needed 
to be devoted to living together continued to leave the question 
of conjugal sex in the shadows. 

A discretion that was traditional, no doubt. Plato, at the 
point where he is nevertheless about to legislate on these mat¬ 
ters—determining the precautions to take in order to produce 
healthy children, prescribing the physical and moral state of 
future parents, even instituting female inspectors who will 
need to look into the lives of young married couples—under¬ 
scores the difficulty people probably would have in accept¬ 
ing legislation concerned with such things. 1 Opposing this 
Greek discretion, there will be the meticulous attentiveness of 
the Christian pastoral ministry, starting in the Middle Ages. 
One will then attempt to regulate everything—positions, fre¬ 
quency, gestures, each partner’s state of mind, knowledge by 
the one of the intentions of the other, signs of desire on one 
side, tokens of acceptance on the other, and so on. For its part, 
Hellenistic and Roman moral philosophy says little on this 
subject.

The Care of the Self 


Yet several important principles bearing on the relations 
between the use of pleasure and married life are formulated in 
certain of these texts. 

We have seen that traditionally the connection between the 
sexual act and marriage was established on the basis and in 
terms of the need to have descendants. This procreative aim 
figured among the reasons for marrying. It was what made 
sexual relations within marriage necessary. Its absence, more¬ 
over, was what could dissolve the conjugal union. It was in 
order to take account of the best possible conditions for pro¬ 
creation that certain recommendations were made to married 
people regarding the proper way to perform the conjugal act 
(the time one should choose, the regimen that ought to pre¬ 
cede the act). It was also in order to avoid the disadvantages 
of illegitimate offspring that extramarital liaisons were dis¬ 
couraged (for women, certainly, but also for men). Let us say 
schematically that in the classical texts the synthesis of the 
marriage tie and sexual relations was granted mainly for 
reasons pertaining to procreation. For men at least, it was 
neither the very nature of sexual acts nor the essence of mar¬ 
riage itself that implied that there should be pleasure only in 
conjugality. Apart from the question of illegitimate births, and 
allowing for the ethical requirement of self-mastery, there was 
no reason to expect a man, even a married man, to reserve all 
his sexual pleasures for his wife, and for her alone. 

Now in the ethics of strict marriage that we see being for¬ 
mulated in the first centuries of our era, it is easy to ascertain 
something that might be called a “conjugalization” of sexual
