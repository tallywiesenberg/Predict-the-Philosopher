Greek discretion, there will be the meticulous attentiveness of 
the Christian pastoral ministry, starting in the Middle Ages. 
One will then attempt to regulate everything—positions, fre¬ 
quency, gestures, each partner’s state of mind, knowledge by 
the one of the intentions of the other, signs of desire on one 
side, tokens of acceptance on the other, and so on. For its part, 
Hellenistic and Roman moral philosophy says little on this 
subject.

The Care of the Self 


Yet several important principles bearing on the relations 
between the use of pleasure and married life are formulated in 
certain of these texts. 

We have seen that traditionally the connection between the 
sexual act and marriage was established on the basis and in 
terms of the need to have descendants. This procreative aim 
figured among the reasons for marrying. It was what made 
sexual relations within marriage necessary. Its absence, more¬

schematically that in the classical texts the synthesis of the 
marriage tie and sexual relations was granted mainly for 
reasons pertaining to procreation. For men at least, it was 
neither the very nature of sexual acts nor the essence of mar¬

conjugality. Apart from the question of illegitimate births, and 
allowing for the ethical requirement of self-mastery, there was 
no reason to expect a man, even a married man, to reserve all 
his sexual pleasures for his wife, and for her alone. 

Now in the ethics of strict marriage that we see being for¬ 
mulated in the first centuries of our era, it is easy to ascertain 
something that might be called a “conjugalization” of sexual
