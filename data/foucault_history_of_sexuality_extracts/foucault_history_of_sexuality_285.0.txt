relations—a conjugalization at once direct and reciprocal. Di¬ 
rect: it is the nature of sexual intercourse that must prevent 
one from resorting to it outside marriage. Reciprocal, for it is 
the nature of marriage and of the bond formed between 
spouses that must rule out the sexual pleasures one might find 
elsewhere. The state of marriage and sexual activity must 
therefore coincide, and for good reasons, rather than for the 
sole aim of a legitimate progeny. This coincidence—or rather 
the movement that tends to make them coincide, not without

a certain number of possible gaps and margins—is manifested 
in the elaboration of two principles. First, given its nature, 
sexual pleasure cannot be allowed outside marriage, which 
implies practically that it should not even be tolerated in an 
unmarried individual. Second, the marriage bond is such that 
the wife risks being hurt not just by the loss of her status but 
by the fact that her husband might take his pleasure with 
someone other than her. 

1. It is doubtless rare to see formulated the principle that 
all sexual relations are culpable if they do not take place in a 
relationship of marriage that makes them legitimate. Provided 
that he exhibits personal moderation and respect for customs, 
laws, and the rights of others, an unmarried man may very 
well enjoy his pleasure as he sees fit. It would be very difficult, 
even within this austere ethics, to oblige him to abstain com¬ 
pletely so long as he has not contracted a marriage. It was 
owing to a great personal virtue that the son of Marcia, by 
Seneca’s account, rejected the advances of the women who 
desired him, even going so far as to blush at the thought of 
pleasing them, as if this were a fault (quasi peccasset ). 2 We 
may also remark that Dio of Prusa shows himself to be very 
severe with regard to prostitution and the way it is organized: 
first, because he sees it as a form of “loveless love,” and a kind 
of union that is foreign to Aphrodite; second, because its 
victims are nonconsenting human beings. Though he hopes 
that a truly well-governed city will abolish these institutions, 
he does not expect such an inveterate evil to be eliminated at 
once. 3 Marcus Aurelius expresses pride in his own sobriety in 
matters of sexual pleasure: he has “preserved [his] adoles¬ 
cence,” he “did not become a man before the proper time,” 
he “even took a little longer.” Now these statements show 
very clearly that the point of virtue is not in the fact that he 
has reserved his pleasures only for marriage, but that he has 
managed to master himself well enough to wait, longer than 
men usually do, for the right time to taste the pleasures of sex. 4 
Epictetus also evokes the ideal of sexual intercourse not taking

place prior to the marriage tie, but he makes it the object of 
a piece of advice that one gives. This advice is to be followed 
if one can, but there is no reason to make an arrogant precept 
of this sort of chastity: “Before marriage guard yourself with 
all your ability from illicit intercourse with women; yet be not 
uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this, nor boast 
frequently that you yourself do otherwise.” 5 Epictetus does 
not justify the extreme reserve that he demands in the sexual 
relationship by the form of marriage, by the rights and duties 
it establishes and which must be rendered to the wife; he 
explains it by saying that one owes it to oneself since one is 
a fragment of God, that one must honor this principle which 
dwells for a time in the body, and that one must respect it over 
the entire course of one’s everyday existence. Mindfulness of 
one’s own nature, rather than consciousness of one’s ties with 
others, should serve as the permanent basis of austerity: “Will 
you not remember, when you eat, who you are that eat, and 
whom you are feeding, and the same in your relations with 
women? When you take part in society, or training, or conver¬ 
sation, do you not know that it is God you are nourishing and 
training? ... Yet when God himself is present within you and 
sees and hears all things, you are not ashamed of thinking and 
acting thus: so slow to understand your nature, and estranged 
from God!” 6 

On the other hand, it seems that Musonius Rufus under¬ 
takes a thorough conjugalization of sexual activity since he 
condemns all sexual intercourse that does not take place 
within marriage and with a view to the latter’s particular 
objectives. The passage of the treatise on the aphrodisia that 
is preserved in Stobaeus opens with a customary criticism of 
the life of debauchery: a life that, being incapable of exercising 
the necessary mastery over itself, gets caught up in the pursuit 
of rare and affected pleasures and “shameful intimacies.” 
Now, to this banal condemnation, Musonius adds as a positive 
prescription a definition of what must be considered as aphro¬
