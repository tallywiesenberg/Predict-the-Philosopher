relations—a conjugalization at once direct and reciprocal. Di¬ 
rect: it is the nature of sexual intercourse that must prevent 
one from resorting to it outside marriage. Reciprocal, for it is 
the nature of marriage and of the bond formed between 
spouses that must rule out the sexual pleasures one might find 
elsewhere. The state of marriage and sexual activity must 
therefore coincide, and for good reasons, rather than for the 
sole aim of a legitimate progeny. This coincidence—or rather 
the movement that tends to make them coincide, not without

a certain number of possible gaps and margins—is manifested 
in the elaboration of two principles. First, given its nature, 
sexual pleasure cannot be allowed outside marriage, which 
implies practically that it should not even be tolerated in an 
unmarried individual. Second, the marriage bond is such that 
the wife risks being hurt not just by the loss of her status but 
by the fact that her husband might take his pleasure with 
someone other than her. 

1. It is doubtless rare to see formulated the principle that 
all sexual relations are culpable if they do not take place in a 
relationship of marriage that makes them legitimate. Provided 
that he exhibits personal moderation and respect for customs, 
laws, and the rights of others, an unmarried man may very 
well enjoy his pleasure as he sees fit. It would be very difficult, 
even within this austere ethics, to oblige him to abstain com¬ 
pletely so long as he has not contracted a marriage. It was 
owing to a great personal virtue that the son of Marcia, by 
Seneca’s account, rejected the advances of the women who 
desired him, even going so far as to blush at the thought of 
pleasing them, as if this were a fault (quasi peccasset ). 2 We 
may also remark that Dio of Prusa shows himself to be very 
severe with regard to prostitution and the way it is organized: 
first, because he sees it as a form of “loveless love,” and a kind 
of union that is foreign to Aphrodite; second, because its 
victims are nonconsenting human beings. Though he hopes 
that a truly well-governed city will abolish these institutions, 
he does not expect such an inveterate evil to be eliminated at 
once. 3 Marcus Aurelius expresses pride in his own sobriety in 
matters of sexual pleasure: he has “preserved [his] adoles¬ 
cence,” he “did not become a man before the proper time,” 
he “even took a little longer.” Now these statements show
