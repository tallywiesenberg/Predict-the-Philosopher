that the partners enjoy together in marriage and for the pur¬ 
pose of begetting children (ta en gamdi kai epi genesei paidon 
synteloumena). And Musonius then states precisely the two 
hypotheses that can emerge: either extramarital relations are 
sought in adultery (moicheia), and nothing could be more 
unlawful (paranomotatai); or one obtains them without any 
adultery. Yet from the moment they are “without that which 
makes them lawful,” they are themselves shameful and have 
their origin in self-indulgence. 7 Conjugality is for sexual activ¬ 
ity the condition of its legitimate exercise. 

Between the ancient theme that the overly intense pursuit 
of pleasure goes against the necessary self-mastery and the 
principle that there can be legitimate pleasure only in the 
context of the matrimonial institution, there is an important 
threshold that Musonius crosses. He draws the consequence 
this necessarily implies, even if it may have seemed paradoxi¬ 
cal to many of his contemporaries. Moreover, he himself pre¬ 
sents the inference in connection with a possible objection: 
Should one regard as culpable, sexual relations that would 
occur between two free persons not bound by the ties of mar¬ 
riage? “The man who has relations with a courtesan or a 
woman who has no husband wrongs no one for he does not 
destroy anyone’s hope of children.” Even in these circum¬ 
stances, one commits an offense—just as a man can commit 
an offense and an injustice without doing wrong to anyone 
around him: he defiles himself, and “like swine, rejoices in his 
own vileness.” 8 One must also count among the implications 
of this conception of the essential relationship between mar¬ 
riage and sexual activity the objection raised by Musonius to 
contraceptive practices. These practices, he says, in a text 
devoted to the question of whether all children must be raised, 
transgress the laws of cities that take care to maintain their 
population. They are harmful to individuals as well since it is 
useful to have descendants. They also violate the universal 
order that was willed by the gods: “How could we not be 
sinning against our ancestral gods and against Zeus, protector
