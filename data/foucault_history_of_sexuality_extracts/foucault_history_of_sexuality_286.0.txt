disia dikaia, legitimate pleasures: these, he says, are pleasures

that the partners enjoy together in marriage and for the pur¬ 
pose of begetting children (ta en gamdi kai epi genesei paidon 
synteloumena). And Musonius then states precisely the two 
hypotheses that can emerge: either extramarital relations are 
sought in adultery (moicheia), and nothing could be more 
unlawful (paranomotatai); or one obtains them without any 
adultery. Yet from the moment they are “without that which 
makes them lawful,” they are themselves shameful and have 
their origin in self-indulgence. 7 Conjugality is for sexual activ¬ 
ity the condition of its legitimate exercise. 

Between the ancient theme that the overly intense pursuit 
of pleasure goes against the necessary self-mastery and the 
principle that there can be legitimate pleasure only in the 
context of the matrimonial institution, there is an important 
threshold that Musonius crosses. He draws the consequence 
this necessarily implies, even if it may have seemed paradoxi¬ 
cal to many of his contemporaries. Moreover, he himself pre¬ 
sents the inference in connection with a possible objection: 
Should one regard as culpable, sexual relations that would 
occur between two free persons not bound by the ties of mar¬ 
riage? “The man who has relations with a courtesan or a 
woman who has no husband wrongs no one for he does not 
destroy anyone’s hope of children.” Even in these circum¬ 
stances, one commits an offense—just as a man can commit 
an offense and an injustice without doing wrong to anyone 
around him: he defiles himself, and “like swine, rejoices in his 
own vileness.” 8 One must also count among the implications 
of this conception of the essential relationship between mar¬ 
riage and sexual activity the objection raised by Musonius to 
contraceptive practices. These practices, he says, in a text 
devoted to the question of whether all children must be raised, 
transgress the laws of cities that take care to maintain their 
population. They are harmful to individuals as well since it is 
useful to have descendants. They also violate the universal 
order that was willed by the gods: “How could we not be 
sinning against our ancestral gods and against Zeus, protector

of the family, when we do such things? For just as he who 
mistreats a guest sins against Zeus, the protector of the rights 
of hospitality, and he who acts unrighteously to a friend, 
against Zeus, the god of friendship, even so whoever acts 
unrighteously toward his family line sins against his ancestral 
gods and against Zeus, protector of the family.” 9 

Here one might be tempted to see the anticipation of the 
Christian idea that sexual pleasure is in itself a defilement, 
which only the lawful form of marriage, with the possibility 
of procreation, could render acceptable. It is a fact that this 
passage from Musonius was utilized by Clement of Alexandria 
in the second book of the Pedagogue . 10 However, although 
Musonius—like most of the ancient moral philosophers, with 
the exception of the Cynics—does consider the public practice 
of this type of relation to be reprehensible, it would undoubt¬ 
edly be a falsification of his doctrine to attribute to him the 
idea that sexual pleasure is an evil, and that marriage was 
instituted in order to redeem and regulate the necessary expe¬ 
rience of it within a strict framework. If Musonius regards as 
shameful any sexual intercourse outside marriage, it is not 
that the latter has been superimposed on the former so as to 
rid it of its intrinsically wrongful character. It is that, for the 
reasonable and social human being, the very nature of the 
sexual act demands that it be inscribed within the matrimonial 
relation, where it may produce a legitimate progeny. The 
sexual act, the conjugal tie, offspring, the family, the city, and 
beyond it, the human community—all this constitutes a series 
whose elements are connected and in which man’s existence 
achieves its rational form. To withdraw pleasure from this 
form, to detach pleasure from the conjugal relation in order 
to propose other ends for it, is in fact to debase the essential 
composition of the human being. The defilement is not in the 
sexual act itself, but in the “debauchery” that would dissociate 
it from marriage, where it has its natural form and its rational 
purpose. From this perspective, marriage constitutes for 
human beings the only legitimate context for sexual union and 
the experience of the aphrodisia.
