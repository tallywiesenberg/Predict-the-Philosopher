The Care of the Self 


of the family, when we do such things? For just as he who 
mistreats a guest sins against Zeus, the protector of the rights 
of hospitality, and he who acts unrighteously to a friend, 
against Zeus, the god of friendship, even so whoever acts 
unrighteously toward his family line sins against his ancestral 
gods and against Zeus, protector of the family.” 9 

Here one might be tempted to see the anticipation of the 
Christian idea that sexual pleasure is in itself a defilement, 
which only the lawful form of marriage, with the possibility 
of procreation, could render acceptable. It is a fact that this 
passage from Musonius was utilized by Clement of Alexandria 
in the second book of the Pedagogue . 10 However, although 
Musonius—like most of the ancient moral philosophers, with 
the exception of the Cynics—does consider the public practice 
of this type of relation to be reprehensible, it would undoubt¬ 
edly be a falsification of his doctrine to attribute to him the 
idea that sexual pleasure is an evil, and that marriage was 
instituted in order to redeem and regulate the necessary expe¬ 
rience of it within a strict framework. If Musonius regards as 
shameful any sexual intercourse outside marriage, it is not 
that the latter has been superimposed on the former so as to 
rid it of its intrinsically wrongful character. It is that, for the 
reasonable and social human being, the very nature of the 
sexual act demands that it be inscribed within the matrimonial 
relation, where it may produce a legitimate progeny. The 
sexual act, the conjugal tie, offspring, the family, the city, and 
beyond it, the human community—all this constitutes a series 
whose elements are connected and in which man’s existence 
achieves its rational form. To withdraw pleasure from this 
form, to detach pleasure from the conjugal relation in order 
to propose other ends for it, is in fact to debase the essential 
composition of the human being. The defilement is not in the 
sexual act itself, but in the “debauchery” that would dissociate 
it from marriage, where it has its natural form and its rational 
purpose. From this perspective, marriage constitutes for 
human beings the only legitimate context for sexual union and 
the experience of the aphrodisia.
