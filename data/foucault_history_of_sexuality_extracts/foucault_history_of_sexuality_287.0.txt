2. Given this essential association of sexual relations and 
sexual pleasure with lawful conjugality, one can understand 
the new problematization of adultery and the incipient re¬ 
quirement of double sexual fidelity. 

We know that adultery was juridically condemned and 
morally reproved on account of the injustice done by a man 
to the one whose wife he led astray. What constituted adul¬ 
tery, therefore, in an extramarital sexual relation was the fact 
that the woman was married and that fact alone: the marital 
status of the man was not relevant. The deceit and injury were 
a matter between the two men—the one who had possessed 
himself of the woman and the one who had the legitimate 
rights to her. 11 This definition of adultery, solely in terms of 
the derogation of the husband’s rights, was common enough 
to be found even in an ethics as exacting as that of Epictetus. 12 
In the middle of a lecture on the theme “man is born for 
mutual trust” (pistis), there enters a man of letters (philologos) 
who had been discovered committing adultery and who de¬ 
fends himself by appealing to the doctrine of Archedemus on 
women as common property. The remonstrances that Epic¬ 
tetus addresses to him relate to two points. By the practice of 
adultery the man has transgressed “the principle of trust for 
which we were born.” But Epictetus does not localize this 
“trust” in the matrimonial institution. What is more, he does 
not even cite the marriage bond as one of its essential forms. 
He characterizes it by the ties that join a man to his neighbor¬ 
hood, his friends, his city. And what constitutes in his eyes 
adultery as a transgression is the rent it effects in this fabric 
of relations between men, where each is called upon not only 
to respect others but to recognize himself. “If we put away this 
trust, for which we are born, and plot against our neighbor’s 
wife, what are we doing? Are we not pulling down and de¬ 
stroying? Whom? The man of trust, of honor, of piety. Is this 
all? Are we not overthrowing neighborly feeling, friendship, 
the city itself?” 13 It is to himself and to other men, as human 
beings, that adultery is injurious. 

Yet, contrary to and alongside of this traditional characteri-

zation of adultery, one finds, in certain reflections on married 
life, exigencies that are much more rigorous, in the double 
sense that they tend to bring more and more into play a 
principle of symmetry between the man and the woman, and 
that they justify this principle by referring to the respect owed 
to the personal bond between the two spouses. Concerning 
those “salutary truths,” which one knows at a distance but 
which, not having been sufficiently dwelled upon, are not 
really capable of governing conduct, Seneca evokes the obliga¬ 
tions of friendship together with those of a strictly symmetri¬ 
cal conjugal fidelity: “You know that friendship should be 
scrupulously honored, and yet you do not hold it in honor. 
You know that a man does wrong in requiring chastity of his 
wife while he himself is intriguing with the wives of other men; 
you know that, as your wife should have no dealings with a 
lover, neither should you yourself with a mistress.” 14 

It is in Musonius that one finds the most detailed statement 
of the principle of a symmetrical conjugality. 15 The argument 
is set forth in the long passage of the treatise On the Aphrodisia 
where it is demonstrated that only marriage can constitute the 
naturally legitimate tie for sexual relations. Musonius focuses 
on what might be called “the problem of the servant.” The 
slave was so taken for granted as a household sexual object 
that it might seem impossible to forbid a married man to use 
her; yet this is precisely what Musonius would prohibit, even, 
he notes, if the slave is not married (which implies that a 
married slave couple in a house was entitled to a certain 
respect). And to justify this prohibition, Musonius posits a 
principle of symmetry, or rather a relatively complex interplay 
between a symmetry with respect to rights and a superiority 
concerning obligations. In the first place, how could one ac¬ 
cept that the husband might have relations with a maid¬ 
servant, whereas one does not recognize the right of a wife to 
have relations with her manservant? The right that is disputed 
on the one hand cannot be granted on the other. And while 
Musonius finds it both natural and lawful for the husband, as 
head of the family, to have more rights than the wife, in the

domain of sexual relations and pleasures he demands an exact 
symmetry. But, second, this symmetry of rights is completed
