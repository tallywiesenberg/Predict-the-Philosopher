2. Given this essential association of sexual relations and 
sexual pleasure with lawful conjugality, one can understand 
the new problematization of adultery and the incipient re¬ 
quirement of double sexual fidelity. 

We know that adultery was juridically condemned and 
morally reproved on account of the injustice done by a man 
to the one whose wife he led astray. What constituted adul¬ 
tery, therefore, in an extramarital sexual relation was the fact 
that the woman was married and that fact alone: the marital 
status of the man was not relevant. The deceit and injury were 
a matter between the two men—the one who had possessed 
himself of the woman and the one who had the legitimate 
rights to her. 11 This definition of adultery, solely in terms of 
the derogation of the husband’s rights, was common enough 
to be found even in an ethics as exacting as that of Epictetus. 12 
In the middle of a lecture on the theme “man is born for 
mutual trust” (pistis), there enters a man of letters (philologos) 
who had been discovered committing adultery and who de¬ 
fends himself by appealing to the doctrine of Archedemus on 
women as common property. The remonstrances that Epic¬ 
tetus addresses to him relate to two points. By the practice of 
adultery the man has transgressed “the principle of trust for 
which we were born.” But Epictetus does not localize this 
“trust” in the matrimonial institution. What is more, he does 
not even cite the marriage bond as one of its essential forms. 
He characterizes it by the ties that join a man to his neighbor¬ 
hood, his friends, his city. And what constitutes in his eyes 
adultery as a transgression is the rent it effects in this fabric 
of relations between men, where each is called upon not only 
to respect others but to recognize himself. “If we put away this 
trust, for which we are born, and plot against our neighbor’s 
wife, what are we doing? Are we not pulling down and de¬ 
stroying? Whom? The man of trust, of honor, of piety. Is this 
all? Are we not overthrowing neighborly feeling, friendship, 
the city itself?” 13 It is to himself and to other men, as human 
beings, that adultery is injurious. 

Yet, contrary to and alongside of this traditional characteri-
