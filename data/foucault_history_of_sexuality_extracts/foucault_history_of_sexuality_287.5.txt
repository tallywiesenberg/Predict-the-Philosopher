zation of adultery, one finds, in certain reflections on married 
life, exigencies that are much more rigorous, in the double 
sense that they tend to bring more and more into play a 
principle of symmetry between the man and the woman, and 
that they justify this principle by referring to the respect owed 
to the personal bond between the two spouses. Concerning 
those “salutary truths,” which one knows at a distance but 
which, not having been sufficiently dwelled upon, are not 
really capable of governing conduct, Seneca evokes the obliga¬ 
tions of friendship together with those of a strictly symmetri¬ 
cal conjugal fidelity: “You know that friendship should be 
scrupulously honored, and yet you do not hold it in honor. 
You know that a man does wrong in requiring chastity of his 
wife while he himself is intriguing with the wives of other men; 
you know that, as your wife should have no dealings with a 
lover, neither should you yourself with a mistress.” 14 

It is in Musonius that one finds the most detailed statement 
of the principle of a symmetrical conjugality. 15 The argument 
is set forth in the long passage of the treatise On the Aphrodisia 
where it is demonstrated that only marriage can constitute the 
naturally legitimate tie for sexual relations. Musonius focuses 
on what might be called “the problem of the servant.” The 
slave was so taken for granted as a household sexual object 
that it might seem impossible to forbid a married man to use 
her; yet this is precisely what Musonius would prohibit, even, 
he notes, if the slave is not married (which implies that a 
married slave couple in a house was entitled to a certain 
respect). And to justify this prohibition, Musonius posits a 
principle of symmetry, or rather a relatively complex interplay 
between a symmetry with respect to rights and a superiority 
concerning obligations. In the first place, how could one ac¬ 
cept that the husband might have relations with a maid¬ 
servant, whereas one does not recognize the right of a wife to 
have relations with her manservant? The right that is disputed 
on the one hand cannot be granted on the other. And while 
Musonius finds it both natural and lawful for the husband, as 
head of the family, to have more rights than the wife, in the

symmetry. But, second, this symmetry of rights is completed
