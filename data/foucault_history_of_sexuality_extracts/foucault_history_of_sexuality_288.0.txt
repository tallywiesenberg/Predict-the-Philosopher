by the need to accentuate, in the sphere of self-mastery, the 
superiority of the husband. If in fact one allowed the husband 
to do with the servant girl that which one expects a wife not 
to do with a slave, one would be supposing that the wife were 
more able than the husband to master herself and govern her 
desires. The one who in the house should be led would then 
be stronger than the one who leads her. For the husband to 
be the one who actually prevails, he must forgo doing that 
which is forbidden a wife. In this Stoic art of marriage, for 
which Musonius proposes such a strict model, a form of 
fidelity is required. It obligates the man and the woman alike. 
It does not merely prohibit anything that might compromise 
the rights of other men. Nor is it content just to protect the 
wife against the threats that could compromise her privileged 
status as mistress of the house and as a mother. It interprets 
the marriage relationship as a system that establishes an exact 
balance of obligations in the practice of pleasure. 

This integral conjugalization of sexual practice that one 
finds in Musonius and the principle of a strict monopoly of the 
aphrodisia reserved for marriage are no doubt exceptional. A 
point has been reached where the art of married life seems to 
be organized around the formal principle of double prohibi¬ 
tion. But in the authors who are careful not to formulate such 
rigid rules, one also notes the emergence of a requirement of 
fidelity calling for slightly different modes of conduct and 
ways of acting. These authors do not assert an explicit prohibi¬ 
tion, but rather a concern with preserving the conjugal bond 
with all that it may entail in the way of individual relationship, 
attachment, affection, and personal respect between the mar¬ 
riage partners. This fidelity is defined less by a law than by a 
style of relating to the wife, by a way of being and of behaving 
with respect to her. The renunciation, as complete as possible, 
of extramarital relations must stem, on the part of the hus¬ 
band, from a pursuit of refinement in marital relations. It must 
be the result of conduct that is both skillful and affectionate,

tolerance that she is fully obliged to concede and that she 
would be unwise not to show.
