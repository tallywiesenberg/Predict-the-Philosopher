by the need to accentuate, in the sphere of self-mastery, the 
superiority of the husband. If in fact one allowed the husband 
to do with the servant girl that which one expects a wife not 
to do with a slave, one would be supposing that the wife were 
more able than the husband to master herself and govern her 
desires. The one who in the house should be led would then 
be stronger than the one who leads her. For the husband to 
be the one who actually prevails, he must forgo doing that 
which is forbidden a wife. In this Stoic art of marriage, for 
which Musonius proposes such a strict model, a form of 
fidelity is required. It obligates the man and the woman alike. 
It does not merely prohibit anything that might compromise 
the rights of other men. Nor is it content just to protect the 
wife against the threats that could compromise her privileged 
status as mistress of the house and as a mother. It interprets 
the marriage relationship as a system that establishes an exact 
balance of obligations in the practice of pleasure. 

This integral conjugalization of sexual practice that one 
finds in Musonius and the principle of a strict monopoly of the 
aphrodisia reserved for marriage are no doubt exceptional. A 
point has been reached where the art of married life seems to 
be organized around the formal principle of double prohibi¬ 
tion. But in the authors who are careful not to formulate such 
rigid rules, one also notes the emergence of a requirement of 
fidelity calling for slightly different modes of conduct and 
ways of acting. These authors do not assert an explicit prohibi¬ 
tion, but rather a concern with preserving the conjugal bond 
with all that it may entail in the way of individual relationship, 
attachment, affection, and personal respect between the mar¬ 
riage partners. This fidelity is defined less by a law than by a 
style of relating to the wife, by a way of being and of behaving 
with respect to her. The renunciation, as complete as possible, 
of extramarital relations must stem, on the part of the hus¬ 
band, from a pursuit of refinement in marital relations. It must 
be the result of conduct that is both skillful and affectionate,

The Care of the Self 


while a certain subtlety is expected of the wife in the de facto 
tolerance that she is fully obliged to concede and that she 
would be unwise not to show. 

The rather belated Latin text that was long considered to 
be a translation of the Economics attributed to Aristotle thus 
places a traditional perspective on the dignity of the wife side 
by side with advice to be prudent and accommodating. On the 
one hand, the author instructs the husband to take proper care 
of a wife who will become the mother of the children he hopes 
for. He also enjoins him not to deprive the woman he has 
married of the honor she is due. 16 But he also demands that 
the two spouses prevent one another from doing anything base 
and dishonest. He counsels the husband to “approach his wife 
in an honorable way, full of self-restraint and awe” (cum 
honestate, et cum multa modestia et timore). He hopes that the 
husband will be “neither indifferent nor harsh” (nec negligens 
nec sever us): “Between a courtesan and her lover, such tem¬ 
pers are allowed their course.” With his wife, on the contrary, 
the good husband should be attentive but also restrained, and 
the wife will respond with modesty and tact, and by showing 
affection and fear “in equal parts.” 17 And while he stresses the 
value of this fidelity, the author makes it clear to the wife that 
she will need to have a relatively accommodating attitude 
toward her husband’s faults: “and let her forget any wrong her 
husband may have done her through distress of mind” (si quid 
vir animae passione ad ipsam peccaverit); “let her refrain from 
all complaint nor charge him with the wrong, but rather attri¬ 
bute everything of this kind to sickness or ignorance or acci¬ 
dental errors.” In this way the husband in return will be ready 
to show her his gratitude after his cure. 

In a similar fashion, the Marriage Precepts affirm the princi¬ 
ple of a reciprocal fidelity. They do not, however, formulate 
it as a rigorously and formally symmetrical requirement. 
While the text assumes, without even having to recall the fact, 
that the wife owes her husband fidelity, it implies that al¬ 
though the pursuit of other pleasures may be for the husband 
a rather frequent offense, it is also a rather minor one. At all

events, it is within the marriage relationship, according to the 
affective relations obtaining between the two spouses, and not 
according to rights and prerogatives, that the question must 
be resolved. Plutarch expects the husband not to have sexual 
relations with other women, not just because to do so would 
pose a threat to the prestige of the lawful wife, but because it 
would inflict a wound—a natural wound that causes suffering.
