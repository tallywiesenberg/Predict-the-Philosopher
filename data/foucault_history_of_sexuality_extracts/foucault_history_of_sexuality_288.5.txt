be a translation of the Economics attributed to Aristotle thus 
places a traditional perspective on the dignity of the wife side 
by side with advice to be prudent and accommodating. On the 
one hand, the author instructs the husband to take proper care 
of a wife who will become the mother of the children he hopes 
for. He also enjoins him not to deprive the woman he has 
married of the honor she is due. 16 But he also demands that 
the two spouses prevent one another from doing anything base 
and dishonest. He counsels the husband to “approach his wife 
in an honorable way, full of self-restraint and awe” (cum 
honestate, et cum multa modestia et timore). He hopes that the 
husband will be “neither indifferent nor harsh” (nec negligens 
nec sever us): “Between a courtesan and her lover, such tem¬ 
pers are allowed their course.” With his wife, on the contrary, 
the good husband should be attentive but also restrained, and 
the wife will respond with modesty and tact, and by showing 
affection and fear “in equal parts.” 17 And while he stresses the 
value of this fidelity, the author makes it clear to the wife that 
she will need to have a relatively accommodating attitude 
toward her husband’s faults: “and let her forget any wrong her 
husband may have done her through distress of mind” (si quid 
vir animae passione ad ipsam peccaverit); “let her refrain from 
all complaint nor charge him with the wrong, but rather attri¬ 
bute everything of this kind to sickness or ignorance or acci¬ 
dental errors.” In this way the husband in return will be ready 
to show her his gratitude after his cure. 

In a similar fashion, the Marriage Precepts affirm the princi¬ 
ple of a reciprocal fidelity. They do not, however, formulate 
it as a rigorously and formally symmetrical requirement. 
While the text assumes, without even having to recall the fact, 
that the wife owes her husband fidelity, it implies that al¬ 
though the pursuit of other pleasures may be for the husband 
a rather frequent offense, it is also a rather minor one. At all

events, it is within the marriage relationship, according to the 
affective relations obtaining between the two spouses, and not 
according to rights and prerogatives, that the question must 
be resolved. Plutarch expects the husband not to have sexual 
relations with other women, not just because to do so would 
pose a threat to the prestige of the lawful wife, but because it 
would inflict a wound—a natural wound that causes suffering.
