He calls to mind the behavior of cats, which are excited to 
frenzy by the odor of perfume. In the same way, women are 
infuriated when the husband has intercourse with other 
women. It is therefore unjust (adikon) to make them suffer 
such a violent vexation for a pleasure that is “trivial.” And he 
advises the husband to follow, with his wife, the example of 
the beekeeper, who does not go near his bees if he has had 
intercourse with a woman . 18 Conversely, Plutarch counsels 
wives to show a certain tolerance; not only would it be better 
for them to shut their eyes—a little like the wives of Persian 
kings who take part in banquets with their husbands but re¬ 
turn to their apartments when, with the onset of drunkenness, 
the musicians and courtesans are summoned. But they ought 
to tell themselves that if their husbands are going to seek 
pleasure with a hetaera or a maidservant, this is out of respect 
for them, and because he would not want them to share his 
debauchery, his licentiousness, and his excess . 19 Thus mar¬ 
riage, as a bond of affection and a relation of respect, much 
more than as a statutory structure, draws all sexual activities 
to it and condemns all those that might take place outside it. 
And while it tends to demand a symmetrical fidelity of the two 
partners, it also constitutes a locus of conciliation, where the 
husband’s attachment to the wife and the wife’s prudence 
vis-a-vis the husband will manage to correspond. The external 
pleasures of the husband will no longer be the recognized 
consequence of his statutory superiority, but the consequence 
of a certain weakness, which he is all the more obliged to limit 
seeing that the wife tolerates it through a concession that, 
while possibly saving her honor, also proves her affection.

The Pleasures of 
Marriage 


This definition of marriage as a relationship that is as exclu¬ 
sive as possible regarding the practice of the aphrodisia raises 
(or could raise) a number of questions pertaining to the inte¬ 
gration, the role, the form, and the finality of acts of pleasure 
in the interplay of affective or statutory relations between 
husband and wife. 

In actual fact, one has to admit that even in the forms of 
reflection in which marriage occupies an important place, the 
economy of pleasures in the conjugal relationship is treated 
with a great deal of reserve. Marriage, in this rigorous ethics 
advocated by some, demands a monopoly of pleasure. But as 
to which pleasures will be allowed within marriage and which 
others excluded, little is said. 

However, two general principles are often evoked. First, it 
is made clear that the conjugal relation must not be foreign to 
Eros, to that love which some philosophers wished to reserve 
for boys; but neither must it ignore or exclude Aphrodite. 
Musonius, in the text where he shows that marriage, far from 
being a hindrance, is an obligation for the philosopher, affirms 
the greatness and value of the marital state. He invokes the 
three great deities who watch over it: Hera, whom “we address 
as the patroness of wedlock”; Aphrodite, since people have 
called “Aphrodision ergon the joining of wife and husband”; 
and Eros (to what indeed could the name be better applied 
“than to the lawful union of man and wife”?). Together, these

three powers have the function of “bringing together man and 
woman for the procreation of children.” 1 It is in the same 
manner that Plutarch will affirm the role of Aphrodite and 
Eros in that which properly constitutes the conjugal relation¬ 
ship. 2 

In correlation with this presence of amorous passion and 
physical pleasures in marriage, another principle, opposite to 
the first one but also quite general, is brought into play; 
namely, that one must not treat one’s wife as a mistress and 
one should behave as a husband rather than as a lover. 3 It is 
only logical that the old principle of conjugal decency will 
become all the more important as marriage tends to constitute 
the only licit context for the pleasures of sex. Aphrodite and 
Eros must be present in marriage and nowhere else. Moreover, 
the conjugal relationship needs to be different from the rela¬ 
tionship of lovers. One encounters the principle in several 
forms. In the form of a (doubtless quite traditional) counsel 
of prudence: by introducing one’s wife to overly intense pleas¬ 
ures one risks giving her lessons she will put to bad use and 
which one will regret having taught her. 4 Or in the form of 
advice given to both spouses: let them find a middle way 
between an excessive austerity and a conduct too close to that
