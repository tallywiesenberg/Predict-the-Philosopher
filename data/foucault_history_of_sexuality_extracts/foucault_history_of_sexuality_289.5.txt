advocated by some, demands a monopoly of pleasure. But as 
to which pleasures will be allowed within marriage and which 
others excluded, little is said. 

However, two general principles are often evoked. First, it 
is made clear that the conjugal relation must not be foreign to 
Eros, to that love which some philosophers wished to reserve 
for boys; but neither must it ignore or exclude Aphrodite. 
Musonius, in the text where he shows that marriage, far from 
being a hindrance, is an obligation for the philosopher, affirms 
the greatness and value of the marital state. He invokes the 
three great deities who watch over it: Hera, whom “we address 
as the patroness of wedlock”; Aphrodite, since people have 
called “Aphrodision ergon the joining of wife and husband”; 
and Eros (to what indeed could the name be better applied 
“than to the lawful union of man and wife”?). Together, these

three powers have the function of “bringing together man and 
woman for the procreation of children.” 1 It is in the same 
manner that Plutarch will affirm the role of Aphrodite and 
Eros in that which properly constitutes the conjugal relation¬ 
ship. 2 

In correlation with this presence of amorous passion and 
physical pleasures in marriage, another principle, opposite to 
the first one but also quite general, is brought into play; 
namely, that one must not treat one’s wife as a mistress and 
one should behave as a husband rather than as a lover. 3 It is 
only logical that the old principle of conjugal decency will 
become all the more important as marriage tends to constitute 
the only licit context for the pleasures of sex. Aphrodite and 
Eros must be present in marriage and nowhere else. Moreover, 
the conjugal relationship needs to be different from the rela¬ 
tionship of lovers. One encounters the principle in several 
forms. In the form of a (doubtless quite traditional) counsel 
of prudence: by introducing one’s wife to overly intense pleas¬ 
ures one risks giving her lessons she will put to bad use and 
which one will regret having taught her. 4 Or in the form of 
advice given to both spouses: let them find a middle way 
between an excessive austerity and a conduct too close to that
