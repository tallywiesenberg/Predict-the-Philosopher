As for the notions of “tolerance” or “intolerance,” they too 
would be completely inadequate to account for the complexity 
of the phenomena we are considering.To love boys was a 
“free” practice in the sense that it was not only permitted by 
the laws (except in particular circumstances), it was accepted 
by opinion.Moreover, it found solid support in different (mili¬ 
tary or educational) institutions.It had religious guarantees in 
rites and festivals where the protection of the divine powers 
was invoked on its behalf.12 And finally, it was a cultural 
practice that enjoyed the prestige of a whole literature that 
sang of it and a body of reflection that vouched for its excel¬ 
lence.
