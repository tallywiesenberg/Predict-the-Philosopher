Mixed in with all this, however, there were some quite 
different attitudes: a contempt for young men who were too 
“easy,” or too self-interested; a disqualification of effeminate 
men, who were so often mocked by Aristophanes and the

such as that of the catamites, which Callicles could not bear 
to talk about despite his boldness and plainness of speech, and 
which he saw as the proof that not every pleasure could be 
good and honorable.* Indeed, it seems that this practice— 
though it was common and accepted—was surrounded by a 
diversity of judgments, that it was subjected to an interplay of 
positive and negative appraisals so complex as to make the 
ethics that governed it difficult to decipher.And there was a 
clear awareness of this complexity at the time; at least, that 
is what emerges from the passage in Pausanias’ speech where 
he shows how hard it is to know if people in Athens are in 
favor of or hostile to that form of love.On one hand, it was 
accepted so well—better still: it was valued so highly—that 
certain kinds of behavior on the part of male lovers were 
honored which were judged to be folly or dishonesty on the 
part of anyone else: the prayers, the entreaties, the stubborn 
wooings, all their false vows.
