The Use of Pleasure 


specific questions did it raise and what debate was it brought 
into?In short, given that it was a widespread practice, and the 
laws in no way condemned it, and its attraction was com¬ 
monly recognized, why was it the object of a special—and 
especially intense—moral preoccupation?So much so that it 
was invested with values, imperatives, demands, rules, advice, 
and exhortations that were as numerous as they were em¬ 
phatic and singular.To put things in a very schematic way: we tend nowadays 
to think that practices aimed at pleasure, when they are car¬ 
ried out between two partners of the same sex, are governed 
by a desire whose structure is particular; but we agree—if we 
are “tolerant”—that this is not a reason to refer them to a 
moral standard, to say nothing of a legislation, different from 
the one that is shared by all.
