It would be less than ade¬ 
quate if we saw in this discursive activity only the immediate 
and spontaneous representation of a free practice that chanced 
to express itself naturally in this fashion, as if all that was 
needed for a behavior to become a domain of inquiry or a focus 
of theoretical and moral concerns was that it not be prohib¬ 
ited.But we would be just as remiss if we assumed that these 
texts were only an attempt to clothe the love one could direct 
to boys in an honorable justification: such an undertaking 
would presuppose condemnations or disqualifications, which 
in fact were declared much later.Rather, we must try and 
learn how and why this practice gave rise to an extraordinarily 
complex problematization.Very little remains of what Greek philosophers wrote on the 
subject of love and on the subject of that love in particular.The idea that one can justifiably form concerning these reflec¬ 
tions and their general thematics is bound to be rather uncer¬ 
tain considering that such a limited number of texts have been 
preserved; moreover, nearly all these belong to the Socratic- 
Platonic tradition, while we do not have, for example, the 
works that Diogenes Laertius mentions, by Antisthenes, Di¬ 
ogenes the Cynic, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Zeno, Chrysippus, 
and Crantor.
