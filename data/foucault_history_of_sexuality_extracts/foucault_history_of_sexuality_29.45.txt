The attention and concern was concentrated on relations in 
which one can tell that much was at stake: relations that could 
be established between an older male who had finished his 
education—and who was expected to play the socially, mor¬ 
ally, and sexually active role—and a younger one, who had 
not yet achieved his definitive status and who was in need of 
assistance, advice, and support.This disparity was at the heart 
of the relationship; in fact, it was what made it valuable and 
conceivable.Because of it, the relationship was considered in 
a positive light, made a subject of reflection; and where it was 
not apparent, people sought to discover it.Thus, one liked to 
talk about the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus, trying 
to determine what differentiated them from one another and 
which of the two had precedence over the other (since 
Homer’s text was ambiguous on this point).* A male relation¬ 
ship gave rise to a theoretical and moral interest when it was 
based on a rather pronounced difference on either side of the 
threshold separating adolescence from manhood.
