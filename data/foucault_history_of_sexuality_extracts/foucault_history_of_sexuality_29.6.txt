these practices did not have the complexity found in other arts 
of loving such as those that would be developed in the Middle 
Ages.But by the same token, they were something quite differ¬ 
ent from the formalities that one observed in order to qualify 
for the hand of a young lady.They defined a whole set of 
conventional and appropriate behaviors, making this relation a 
culturally and morally overloaded domain.These practices— 
the reality of which has been amply documented by K. J. 
Dover 20 —defined the mutual behavior and the respective 
strategies that both partners should observe in order to give 
their relations a “beautiful” form; that is, one that was aestheti¬ 
cally and morally valuable.They determined the role of the 
erastes and that of the eromenos.
