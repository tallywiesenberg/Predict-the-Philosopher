But, more important, the game was also open in that one 
could not exercise any statutory authority over the boy, as 
long as he was not slaveborn—he was free in his choices, in 
what he accepted or rejected, in his preferences or his deci¬ 
sions.In order to get from him something that he always had 
the right to refuse, one had to be able to persuade him; anyone 
who wished to remain his favorite had, in his eyes, to outshine 
such rivals as might present themselves, and for this it was 
necessary to highlight one’s achievements, one’s qualities, or 
one’s presents; but the decision was the boy’s alone to make: 
in this game that one had initiated, one was never sure of 
winning.And yet this was the very thing that made it interest¬ 
ing.Nothing illustrates this better than the charming com¬ 
plaint of Hiero the tyrant, as reported by Xenophon.22 Being 
a tyrant, he explains, does not make things pleasant either in 
regard to a wife or in regard to a boy.
