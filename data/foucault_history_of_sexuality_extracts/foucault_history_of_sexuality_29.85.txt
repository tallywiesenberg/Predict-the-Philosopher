In this problematization of relationships with adoles¬ 
cent boys, the question of timing was important, but it was 
raised in a singular fashion; what mattered was not, as in 
dietetics, the opportune moment for the act, nor, as in eco¬ 
nomics, the continual maintenance of a relational structure; 
rather, it was the difficult question of precarious time and 
fugitive passage.It was expressed in different ways—as a prob¬ 
lem of “limit” first of all: what was the age limit after which 
a boy ought to be considered too old to be an honorable 
partner in a love relation?At what age was it no longer good 
for him to accept this role, nor for his lover to want to assign 
it to him?This involved the familiar casuistry of the signs of 
manhood.These were supposed to mark a threshold, one that 
was all the more intangible in theory as it must have very often 
been crossed in practice and as it offered the possibility of 
finding fault with those who had done so.
