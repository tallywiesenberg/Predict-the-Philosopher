26 But in the sphere 
of sexual ethics, it was the juvenile body with its peculiar 
charm that was regularly suggested as the “right object’’ of 
pleasure.And it would be a mistake to think that its traits 
were valued because of what they shared with feminine 
beauty.They were appreciated in themselves or in their juxta¬ 
position with the signs and guarantees of a developing virility.Strength, endurance, and spirit also formed part of this 
beauty; hence it was good in fact if exercises, gymnastics, 
competitions, and hunting expeditions reinforced these quali¬ 
ties, guaranteeing that this gracefulness would not degenerate 
into softness and effeminization.27 The feminine ambiguity 
that would be perceived later (and already in the course of 
antiquity, even) as a component—more exactly, as the secret 
cause—of the adolescent’s beauty, was, in the classical period, 
more something from which the boy needed to protect himself 
and be protected.
