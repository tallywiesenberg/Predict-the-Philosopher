of profligates, and let the husband always remind himself that 
“I cannot have the society of the same woman as wife and 
paramour” (hos gamete kai hos hetaira ). 5 Or, further, in the 
form of a general thesis: behaving too ardently with one’s wife 
amounts to treating her as an adulteress. 6 The theme is impor¬ 
tant, for it will be reencountered in the Christian tradition, 
where it will appear very early (Clement of Alexandria refers 
to it in the Stromateis ), and where it will persist for a very long 
time (Saint Francis of Sales works out its implications in the 
Introduction to the Devout Life ). 7 It is no doubt necessary, if 
we are to understand its meaning for the Stoics who formulate 
it, to bear in mind that the natural and rational principle of 
marriage ordains that it combine two existences, that it pro¬ 
duce descendants, that it be useful to the city and beneficial 
to the entire human race. To make the enjoyment of pleasur-

able sensations the most important thing in marriage would 
be to violate the law, reverse the order of ends, and transgress 
the principle that should join a man and a woman into a 
couple. 

More concretely, though, one faces the problem of deter¬ 
mining what status and what forms the practice of pleasure 
ought to assume in marital relations, and on what principles 
the precepts of its internal limitation can be based. Given that 
marriage demands a conjugal tie that must be at the same time 
a highly valued personal relationship and the exclusive locus 
of relations of pleasure, relations a man was heretofore rather 
freely permitted on the fringes of his marriage, how is this 
matrimonial structure to play its role as a principle of regula¬ 
tion? What austerity will be exacted in this marriage, if it must 
be at once the strongest of individual ties and the only place 
for lawful pleasures? The formulations are, more often than 
not, rather vague, a little like those one finds in the Latin text 
that is supposed to be Book III of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle. The author asks the husband to approach his wife 
“in an honorable way” (cum honestate), “full of self-restraint 
and awe” (cum multa modestia et timore). He recommends 
that “in his conversation with her, he should use the words of 
a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are them¬ 
selves lawful and honorable.” He advises him to treat his 
spouse with “respect and modesty” (verecundia et pudore). % 

In a more precise way, intraconjugal austerity will be jus¬ 
tified by the two great natural and rational finalities that will 
be ascribed to marriage. The first, of course, is procreation. 
One must not—Seneca stresses this, but we have also seen that 
there were physicians who called attention to it—make plea¬ 
sure the goal of an act that Nature has designed for procrea¬ 
tion. If the desires of love were given to men, this was not in 
order that they might enjoy sensual pleasure, but that they 
might propagate their kind (non voluptatis causa, sed propa- 
gandi generis). 9 From this general principle, Musonius draws 
the conclusion that sexual relations can rightfully take place 
only if they have propagation as their goal. As for those rela-

tions which only seek pleasure as an end, they are “unjust and 
unlawful, even in marriage.” 10 This rule, which one also finds 
in the neo-Pythagoreans, seems to have served to justify cer¬ 
tain traditional prohibitions forbidding sexual intercourse 
during menstruation (which, according to physicians, might 
carry away the semen) and during the time of pregnancy (not 
only because it would be unproductive, but above all because 
it might endanger the life of the embryo). But, apart from 
these general recommendations, it does not seem that there 
was, despite the identity of principle, the kind of interrogation 
that will be encountered in Christian teaching concerning the 
lawfulness of sexual relations in case of recognized sterility or 
after the age of menopause, and concerning the intentions that 
both partners may have before or even during the act. The 
exclusion of pleasure as an end does seem, in the most rigorous 
of the moral philosophers, to have been an exigency. But this 
exigency was more a statement of principle than a schema 
enabling a regulation of behaviors and a precise codification 
of their permitted or forbidden forms. 

The second great finality of marriage—making a life to¬ 
gether, a life entirely shared—constitutes the other principle 
that calls for austerity in conjugal relations. Like the procrea¬ 
tive finality, this principle does not trace a clear dividing line 
between what is permitted and what is forbidden. But certain 
authors—and foremost among them Plutarch—have it play, 
in the linking of pleasure relations to the conjugal relationship, 
a more subtle and complex role. Thus, on the one hand, the
