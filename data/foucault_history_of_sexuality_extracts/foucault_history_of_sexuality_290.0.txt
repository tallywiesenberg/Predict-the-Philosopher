of profligates, and let the husband always remind himself that 
“I cannot have the society of the same woman as wife and 
paramour” (hos gamete kai hos hetaira ). 5 Or, further, in the 
form of a general thesis: behaving too ardently with one’s wife 
amounts to treating her as an adulteress. 6 The theme is impor¬ 
tant, for it will be reencountered in the Christian tradition, 
where it will appear very early (Clement of Alexandria refers 
to it in the Stromateis ), and where it will persist for a very long 
time (Saint Francis of Sales works out its implications in the 
Introduction to the Devout Life ). 7 It is no doubt necessary, if 
we are to understand its meaning for the Stoics who formulate 
it, to bear in mind that the natural and rational principle of 
marriage ordains that it combine two existences, that it pro¬ 
duce descendants, that it be useful to the city and beneficial 
to the entire human race. To make the enjoyment of pleasur-

able sensations the most important thing in marriage would 
be to violate the law, reverse the order of ends, and transgress 
the principle that should join a man and a woman into a 
couple. 

More concretely, though, one faces the problem of deter¬ 
mining what status and what forms the practice of pleasure 
ought to assume in marital relations, and on what principles 
the precepts of its internal limitation can be based. Given that 
marriage demands a conjugal tie that must be at the same time 
a highly valued personal relationship and the exclusive locus 
of relations of pleasure, relations a man was heretofore rather 
freely permitted on the fringes of his marriage, how is this 
matrimonial structure to play its role as a principle of regula¬ 
tion? What austerity will be exacted in this marriage, if it must 
be at once the strongest of individual ties and the only place 
for lawful pleasures? The formulations are, more often than 
not, rather vague, a little like those one finds in the Latin text 
that is supposed to be Book III of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle. The author asks the husband to approach his wife 
“in an honorable way” (cum honestate), “full of self-restraint 
and awe” (cum multa modestia et timore). He recommends 
that “in his conversation with her, he should use the words of 
a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are them¬ 
selves lawful and honorable.” He advises him to treat his 
spouse with “respect and modesty” (verecundia et pudore). %
