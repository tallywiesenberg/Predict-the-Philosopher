In a more precise way, intraconjugal austerity will be jus¬ 
tified by the two great natural and rational finalities that will 
be ascribed to marriage. The first, of course, is procreation. 
One must not—Seneca stresses this, but we have also seen that 
there were physicians who called attention to it—make plea¬ 
sure the goal of an act that Nature has designed for procrea¬ 
tion. If the desires of love were given to men, this was not in 
order that they might enjoy sensual pleasure, but that they 
might propagate their kind (non voluptatis causa, sed propa- 
gandi generis). 9 From this general principle, Musonius draws 
the conclusion that sexual relations can rightfully take place 
only if they have propagation as their goal. As for those rela-

tions which only seek pleasure as an end, they are “unjust and 
unlawful, even in marriage.” 10 This rule, which one also finds 
in the neo-Pythagoreans, seems to have served to justify cer¬ 
tain traditional prohibitions forbidding sexual intercourse 
during menstruation (which, according to physicians, might 
carry away the semen) and during the time of pregnancy (not 
only because it would be unproductive, but above all because 
it might endanger the life of the embryo). But, apart from 
these general recommendations, it does not seem that there 
was, despite the identity of principle, the kind of interrogation 
that will be encountered in Christian teaching concerning the 
lawfulness of sexual relations in case of recognized sterility or 
after the age of menopause, and concerning the intentions that 
both partners may have before or even during the act. The 
exclusion of pleasure as an end does seem, in the most rigorous 
of the moral philosophers, to have been an exigency. But this 
exigency was more a statement of principle than a schema 
enabling a regulation of behaviors and a precise codification 
of their permitted or forbidden forms. 

The second great finality of marriage—making a life to¬ 
gether, a life entirely shared—constitutes the other principle 
that calls for austerity in conjugal relations. Like the procrea¬ 
tive finality, this principle does not trace a clear dividing line 
between what is permitted and what is forbidden. But certain 
authors—and foremost among them Plutarch—have it play, 
in the linking of pleasure relations to the conjugal relationship, 
a more subtle and complex role. Thus, on the one hand, the
