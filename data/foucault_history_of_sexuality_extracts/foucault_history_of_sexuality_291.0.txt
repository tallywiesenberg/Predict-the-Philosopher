obligation to make the wife a companion to whom one opens 
one’s soul requires that one have a respect for her directed not 
just to her rank and status, but to her personal dignity. The 
regimen of the aphrodisia must therefore take this obligation 
as a principle of internal limitation. On the other hand, if 
married life must have the purpose of forming a perfect com¬ 
munity—a true “fusion of existences”—it is also clear that 
sexual relations and pleasures, if they are shared and enjoyed 
in common, constitute a factor of rapprochement between 
husband and wife. The formation and strengthening of a solid

bond are, in the practice of the aphrodisia, not only a guaran¬ 
tee, but also an element in favor of the aphrodisia. Hence there 
is a valorization of sexual pleasures (provided they are incor¬ 
porated into the matrimonial relationship and well integrated 
within it), combined with the recommendation of an austerity 
in their practice, which enables them actually to play this 
positive role in the conjugal union. 

This spiraling process of necessary austerity and desirable 
intensity is clearly apparent in the Marriage Precepts; in fact 
it constitutes one of that work’s guiding threads. The text 
reiterates some of the old familiar principles concerning the 
modesty and secrecy that should surround not only the pro- 
creative act but also the simple acts of pleasure such as kissing 
and caressing." It also recalls to mind, transforming a well- 
known saying of Herodotus, that a woman’s modesty should 
not fall along with the gown that she lays aside, 12 nor should 
darkness cover any licentiousness whatever. Recalling the ex¬ 
ample of a woman who tried to get away from Philip by 
pointing out to him that all women are the same once the 
lights are out, Plutarch notes that the wife, on the contrary, 
does not have to be like the others. Hidden by the night, 
without one’s being able to see her body, she must cause what 
is virtuous in her (to sophron autes) to shine forth. Now, what 
is virtuous in her is also what attaches her exclusively to her 
husband and makes her his own; it is “her constancy and her 
affection.” 13 

Around this principle of gracious reserve, a modesty that 
signifies the exclusiveness of an attachment, Plutarch extends 
a number of recommendations that exclude both a supercil¬ 
ious austerity and an unrestrained facility, and this on the part 
of the husband and the wife alike. No doubt, like the young 
Spartan whose example he cites, a good wife must not herself 
make advances to her husband; 14 but neither must she show 
annoyance at his advances. The first attitude would have 
something brash about it that smacks of the courtesan, but 
there would be an unfriendly disdain in the second. 15 Here we 
have, still in a very nebulous way, the outline of those rules

fixing the forms of the respective initiatives and the signs to 
be exchanged on which the pastoral ministry will later set such 
a high value. Plutarch attaches a good deal of importance to 
the dangers that can compromise, in a married couple’s first 
sexual relations, subsequent mutual understanding and the 
solidity of the bond to be formed. He draws attention to the 
risk of bad experiences that the bride may have. He advises her 
not to dwell on them, for the benefits of marriage may appear 
later: not to behave like those who “submit to the bees’ stings, 
but abandon the honeycomb.” 16 But he also fears that too 
intense a physical pleasure experienced at the outset of mar¬ 
riage may cause the affection to be lost when this pleasure 
disappears. It is better for the love to owe its vitality to the 
spouses’ character and disposition. 17 It is also necessary, 
throughout married life, to bring into play anything that 
might benefit conjugal friendship in sexual relations between 
husband and wife. Specific examples of this function of affec¬ 
tive reactivation—to which one of the interlocutors of the 
Dialogue on Love explicitly refers 18 —are given in the Marriage 
Precepts : avoid quarrels, especially those that might take place 
in the bedroom, because “the disagreements, recriminations, 
and angry passions which the bed generates are not easily 
settled in another place and at another time”; 19 or, further, 
when you are in the habit of occupying the same bed, don’t 
go to a separate bedroom because of an angry disagreement. 
On the contrary, this is the right time to invoke Aphrodite, 
“who is the best physician for such disorders.” 20 

The theme holds a relatively important place in Plutarch 
himself. We will encounter it again in the Dialogue on Love, 
where it will serve as a basic discriminant between the love of 
women, in which pleasure is integrable with a positive role in 
the spiritual relation, and the love of boys, in which physical
