obligation to make the wife a companion to whom one opens 
one’s soul requires that one have a respect for her directed not 
just to her rank and status, but to her personal dignity. The 
regimen of the aphrodisia must therefore take this obligation 
as a principle of internal limitation. On the other hand, if 
married life must have the purpose of forming a perfect com¬ 
munity—a true “fusion of existences”—it is also clear that 
sexual relations and pleasures, if they are shared and enjoyed 
in common, constitute a factor of rapprochement between 
husband and wife. The formation and strengthening of a solid

bond are, in the practice of the aphrodisia, not only a guaran¬ 
tee, but also an element in favor of the aphrodisia. Hence there 
is a valorization of sexual pleasures (provided they are incor¬ 
porated into the matrimonial relationship and well integrated 
within it), combined with the recommendation of an austerity 
in their practice, which enables them actually to play this 
positive role in the conjugal union. 

This spiraling process of necessary austerity and desirable 
intensity is clearly apparent in the Marriage Precepts; in fact 
it constitutes one of that work’s guiding threads. The text 
reiterates some of the old familiar principles concerning the 
modesty and secrecy that should surround not only the pro- 
creative act but also the simple acts of pleasure such as kissing 
and caressing." It also recalls to mind, transforming a well- 
known saying of Herodotus, that a woman’s modesty should 
not fall along with the gown that she lays aside, 12 nor should 
darkness cover any licentiousness whatever. Recalling the ex¬ 
ample of a woman who tried to get away from Philip by 
pointing out to him that all women are the same once the 
lights are out, Plutarch notes that the wife, on the contrary, 
does not have to be like the others. Hidden by the night, 
without one’s being able to see her body, she must cause what 
is virtuous in her (to sophron autes) to shine forth. Now, what 
is virtuous in her is also what attaches her exclusively to her 
husband and makes her his own; it is “her constancy and her 
affection.” 13 

Around this principle of gracious reserve, a modesty that 
signifies the exclusiveness of an attachment, Plutarch extends 
a number of recommendations that exclude both a supercil¬
