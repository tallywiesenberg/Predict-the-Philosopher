pleasure (assumed to be nonreciprocal) can figure only as a 
favorable factor within the relationship. This theme is also 
evoked in the Dinner of the Seven Wise Men, where it is a 
question of sexual pleasures in connection with the two other 
physical pleasures with which they are often associated: intox-

ication and music. The interlocutor—Mnesiphilus—observes 
that in every art or craft the work is not in the manipulation 
of tools or materials but in what one aims to make: the ergon 
of the architect does not consist of the mortar he mixes but of 
the temple he constructs; the Muses, when they employ them¬ 
selves with the lyre or the flute, have no other task than “the 
development of characters and the soothing of the emo¬ 
tions .” 21 In the same way, and just as the task of Dionysus is 
not in the fact of drinking intoxicating wine, the task of 
Aphrodite (ergon Aphrodites) is not in the mere relating and 
conjoining of bodies (synousia, meixis); it is in the feeling of 
friendship (philosophrosyne), the longing (pothos), the associa¬ 
tion (homilia), and the intimacy (synetheia) between two peo¬ 
ple. Sexual intercourse, in married life, ought to serve as an 
instrument for the formation and development of symmetrical 
and reciprocal affective relations. “Aphrodite,” says Plutarch, 
“is the artisan who creates concord and friendship [homophro- 
synes kai philias demiourgos] between men and women, for 
through their bodies, under the influence of pleasure, she at 
the same time unites and welds together their souls.” 22 * 

This advice may appear rather crude. Nevertheless, it 
figures among the preliminaries of a long history: that of the 
codification of moral relations between spouses, in the dual 
form of a general recommendation of reserve and a complex 
lesson of affective communication through sexual pleasure. 

A “monopolistic” principle: no sexual relations outside 
marriage. A requirement of “dehedonization”: sexual inter¬ 
course between spouses should not be governed by an econ¬ 
omy of pleasure. A procreative finalization : its goal should be 
the birth of offspring. These are three fundamental traits 
marking the ethics of conjugal existence that certain moralists 

*Babut points out that Antipater, Musonius, and Hierocles “are more interested in 
marriage than love; they seem to want above all to establish that marriage does not
