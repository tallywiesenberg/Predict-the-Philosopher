pleasure (assumed to be nonreciprocal) can figure only as a 
favorable factor within the relationship. This theme is also 
evoked in the Dinner of the Seven Wise Men, where it is a 
question of sexual pleasures in connection with the two other 
physical pleasures with which they are often associated: intox-

ication and music. The interlocutor—Mnesiphilus—observes 
that in every art or craft the work is not in the manipulation 
of tools or materials but in what one aims to make: the ergon 
of the architect does not consist of the mortar he mixes but of 
the temple he constructs; the Muses, when they employ them¬ 
selves with the lyre or the flute, have no other task than “the 
development of characters and the soothing of the emo¬ 
tions .” 21 In the same way, and just as the task of Dionysus is 
not in the fact of drinking intoxicating wine, the task of 
Aphrodite (ergon Aphrodites) is not in the mere relating and 
conjoining of bodies (synousia, meixis); it is in the feeling of 
friendship (philosophrosyne), the longing (pothos), the associa¬ 
tion (homilia), and the intimacy (synetheia) between two peo¬ 
ple. Sexual intercourse, in married life, ought to serve as an 
instrument for the formation and development of symmetrical 
and reciprocal affective relations. “Aphrodite,” says Plutarch, 
“is the artisan who creates concord and friendship [homophro- 
synes kai philias demiourgos] between men and women, for 
through their bodies, under the influence of pleasure, she at 
the same time unites and welds together their souls.” 22 * 

This advice may appear rather crude. Nevertheless, it 
figures among the preliminaries of a long history: that of the 
codification of moral relations between spouses, in the dual 
form of a general recommendation of reserve and a complex 
lesson of affective communication through sexual pleasure. 

A “monopolistic” principle: no sexual relations outside 
marriage. A requirement of “dehedonization”: sexual inter¬ 
course between spouses should not be governed by an econ¬ 
omy of pleasure. A procreative finalization : its goal should be 
the birth of offspring. These are three fundamental traits 
marking the ethics of conjugal existence that certain moralists 

*Babut points out that Antipater, Musonius, and Hierocles “are more interested in 
marriage than love; they seem to want above all to establish that marriage does not 
prevent one from leading the philosophical life; in them one finds no trace of one of 
the important ideas of the Amatorius, namely, that the woman is just as capable as 
the man of inspiring amorous passion .” 21

developed at the beginning of the imperial epoch, an ethics 
whose elaboration owes a great deal to late Stoicism. But these 
traits are not peculiar to it. We have found similar exigencies 
in the rules enjoined by Plato on the citizens of his Republic. 
We shall find them again in a later period, in what the Church 
demanded of a good Christian married couple. Much more 
than an innovation of Stoic rigor, much more than a project 
specific to the moral philosophy of that epoch, these three 
principles did not cease, for centuries, to characterize the 
role that marriage was expected to play as a focus of sexual 
austerity. 

But the constancy of these three phenomena should not be 
taken as evidence of a pure and simple identity. A certain 
more or less Stoicizing ethics of the imperial epoch did not 
merely carry forward, from the Platonic utopia to Christian¬ 
ity, the code of a “monopolistic” marriage dedicated to pro¬ 
creation and distrustful of pleasure. It contributed a number 
of particular inflections that derived from the forms taken at 
the time by the development of the cultivation of the self. 

It should be noted first that in Plato the obligation to inte¬ 
grate all sexual pleasure into the matrimonial structure had 
for one of its chief justifications the need to supply the city 
with the children it required to survive and maintain its 
strength. In Christianity, on the other hand, the link between 
sexual intercourse and marriage will be justified by the fact 
that the former bears the marks of sin, the Fall, and evil, and 
that only the latter can give it a legitimacy that still may not 
exculpate it entirely. Now, in Musonius, Seneca, Plutarch, or 
Hierocles, although utility has its part to play, although dis¬ 
trust of the transports of pleasure is very strong, the link 
between marriage and the aphrodisia is not really established 
by positing the primacy of the social and political objectives 
of marriage, or by postulating an original evil intrinsic to 
pleasure, but by affirming a natural, rational, and essential 
relationship between them. In order to make allowance for the 
differences of position and doctrinal variants, let us say that
