developed at the beginning of the imperial epoch, an ethics 
whose elaboration owes a great deal to late Stoicism. But these 
traits are not peculiar to it. We have found similar exigencies 
in the rules enjoined by Plato on the citizens of his Republic. 
We shall find them again in a later period, in what the Church 
demanded of a good Christian married couple. Much more 
than an innovation of Stoic rigor, much more than a project 
specific to the moral philosophy of that epoch, these three 
principles did not cease, for centuries, to characterize the 
role that marriage was expected to play as a focus of sexual 
austerity. 

But the constancy of these three phenomena should not be 
taken as evidence of a pure and simple identity. A certain 
more or less Stoicizing ethics of the imperial epoch did not 
merely carry forward, from the Platonic utopia to Christian¬ 
ity, the code of a “monopolistic” marriage dedicated to pro¬ 
creation and distrustful of pleasure. It contributed a number 
of particular inflections that derived from the forms taken at 
the time by the development of the cultivation of the self. 

It should be noted first that in Plato the obligation to inte¬ 
grate all sexual pleasure into the matrimonial structure had 
for one of its chief justifications the need to supply the city 
with the children it required to survive and maintain its 
strength. In Christianity, on the other hand, the link between 
sexual intercourse and marriage will be justified by the fact 
that the former bears the marks of sin, the Fall, and evil, and 
that only the latter can give it a legitimacy that still may not 
exculpate it entirely. Now, in Musonius, Seneca, Plutarch, or 
Hierocles, although utility has its part to play, although dis¬ 
trust of the transports of pleasure is very strong, the link 
between marriage and the aphrodisia is not really established 
by positing the primacy of the social and political objectives 
of marriage, or by postulating an original evil intrinsic to 
pleasure, but by affirming a natural, rational, and essential 
relationship between them. In order to make allowance for the 
differences of position and doctrinal variants, let us say that
