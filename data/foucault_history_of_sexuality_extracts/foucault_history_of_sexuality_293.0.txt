The Care of the Self 


the sexual monopoly that tends to be claimed for marriage in 
this form of ethics centers less on the “external” utilities of 
marriage or the “internal” negativity of pleasure than on an 
attempt to bring a certain number of relations into coinci¬ 
dence: the union of two sexual partners, the dual tie of hus¬ 
band and wife, and the social role of the family—while 
achieving as perfect a congruence as possible with the relation 
to the self. 

Here we touch on an important difference. The obligation 
to keep the use of pleasure within the bounds of marriage was 
also, for Plato’s guardian, Isocrates’ leader, or Aristotle’s citi¬ 
zen, a way of exercising self-mastery, a mastery made neces¬ 
sary by one’s status or by the authority one had to exercise in 
the city. The principle of a perfect conjugal fidelity will be, in 
the pastoral ministry, an unconditional duty for anyone con¬ 
cerned about his salvation. By contrast, in this ethics inspired 
by Stoicism, it is in order to satisfy the specific requirements 
of the relation to oneself, not to violate one’s natural and 
essential being, and to honor oneself as a reasonable being that 
one must keep one’s practice of sexual pleasure within mar¬ 
riage and in conformity with its objectives. Doubtless this 
principle, which tends to exclude, even for men, sexual inter¬ 
course outside marriage, and to authorize it only for certain 
definite purposes, will be one of the anchor points for a subse¬ 
quent “juridification” of marital relations and sexual prac¬ 
tices. Like that of women, the sexual activity of married men 
will, in theory at least, risk coming within the provisions of the 
law. Even within marriage, a precise code will say what one 
is permitted or forbidden to do, to want, or even to think. But 
this juridification—which will be so pronounced in later times 
—is tied to Christian pastoral practice, to its own peculiar 
structure. Even in the most detailed texts on the life of the 
couple, such as those of Plutarch, what is proposed is not a 
regulation that would draw a division between permitted and 
forbidden acts. It is instead a mode of being, a style of rela¬ 
tions. The ethics of marriage and the advice on conjugal life 
are at the same time universally valid principles and rules for
