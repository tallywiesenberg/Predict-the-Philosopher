The Wife

those who wish to give their existence an honorable and noble 
form. It is the lawless universality of an aesthetics of existence 
that in any case is practiced only by a few. 

The conjugalization of sexual activities that tends to localize 
legitimacy within marriage alone obviously results in their 
manifest limitation (at least for the husband, since this limita¬ 
tion has long been required of the married woman). Moreover, 
the insistence on a dissociation between the practice of plea¬ 
sure and the hedonic finality will tend toward an internal 
disqualification of this activity itself. But it needs to be un¬ 
derstood as well that these restrictions and this disqualifica¬ 
tion are accompanied by another process: an intensification of 
the value and meaning of sexual relations within marriage. On 
the one hand, in fact, intramarital sexual relations are no 
longer simply the consequence and manifestation of a right. 
They must be placed within a cluster of relations character¬ 
ized by affection, attachment, and reciprocity. And on the 
other hand, while pleasure must be eliminated as a goal, it is, 
at least in certain of the most subtle formulations of this ethics, 
to be used as an element (at once an instrument and a guaran¬ 
tee) in the interplay of affective expressions between spouses. 

And it is precisely on behalf of this intensification of the 
value of the aphrodisia in marital relations, by reason of the 
role it is assigned in the communication between husband and 
wife, that one begins to question, in an increasingly doubtful 
mode, the privileges that used to be granted to the love of boys.

Boys 




In the first centuries of our era, compared with the lofty 
formulations of the classical period, reflection on the love of 
boys lost some of its intensity, its seriousness, its vitality, if not 
its topicality. Where it appears, it has a facile, repetitive sound. 
Playing on ancient themes, often those of Platonism, it partici¬ 
pates in the reactivation of classical culture, but in a dull way.
