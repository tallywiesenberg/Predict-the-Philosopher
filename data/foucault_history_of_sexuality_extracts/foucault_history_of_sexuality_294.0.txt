Even when philosophy tries to restore to the figure of Socrates 
some of its former prestige, the love of boys, with the problems 
it poses, does not constitute an active and vital focus of reflec¬ 
tion (the four speeches of Maximus of Tyre cannot furnish 
an argument to the contrary). 

This does not mean that the practice disappeared or that it 
became the object of a disqualification. All the texts plainly 
show that it was still common and still regarded as a natural 
thing. What seems to have changed is not the taste for boys, 
or the value judgment that was brought to bear on those who 
had this partiality, but the way in which one questioned one¬ 
self about it. An obsolescence not of the thing itself, but of the 
problem; a decline in the interest one took in it; a fading of the 
importance it was granted in philosophical and moral debate. 
There are no doubt many reasons for this “deproblematiza- 
tion.” Certain of them can be traced to the influence of Roman 
culture. It is not that the Romans were more insensitive than 
the Greeks to this sort of pleasure; but the difficult question 
of boys as objects of pleasure was posed, in the context of their

institutions, with less acuity than in the Greek city. In the first 
place, children of good birth were well “protected” by paren¬ 
tal right and by public laws. Fathers were determined that the 
power they exercised over their sons would be respected; and 
the famous Lex Scantinia, which, as Boswell has shown, did 
not prohibit homosexuality, defended the free adolescent from 
abuse and violence . 1 Second, and doubtless by way of a conse¬ 
quence, love for boys was practiced for the most part with 
young slaves, about whose status there was no reason to 
worry. “In Rome the freeborn ephebe was replaced by the 
slave,” says Paul Veyne . 2 Hellenized though it was, and satu¬ 
rated with philosophy, Rome, whose poets were so fond of 
singing of adolescents, offered few echoes of the great specula¬ 
tion of the Greeks on the love of boys. 

Further, the forms taken by pedagogical practice and its 
modes of institutionalization made it much more difficult to 
valorize the relationship with adolescents in terms of educa¬ 
tional efficacy. When Quintilian speaks of the moment when
