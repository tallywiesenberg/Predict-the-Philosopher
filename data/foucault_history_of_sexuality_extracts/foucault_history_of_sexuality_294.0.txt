Even when philosophy tries to restore to the figure of Socrates 
some of its former prestige, the love of boys, with the problems 
it poses, does not constitute an active and vital focus of reflec¬ 
tion (the four speeches of Maximus of Tyre cannot furnish 
an argument to the contrary). 

This does not mean that the practice disappeared or that it 
became the object of a disqualification. All the texts plainly 
show that it was still common and still regarded as a natural 
thing. What seems to have changed is not the taste for boys, 
or the value judgment that was brought to bear on those who 
had this partiality, but the way in which one questioned one¬ 
self about it. An obsolescence not of the thing itself, but of the 
problem; a decline in the interest one took in it; a fading of the 
importance it was granted in philosophical and moral debate. 
There are no doubt many reasons for this “deproblematiza- 
tion.” Certain of them can be traced to the influence of Roman 
culture. It is not that the Romans were more insensitive than 
the Greeks to this sort of pleasure; but the difficult question 
of boys as objects of pleasure was posed, in the context of their

institutions, with less acuity than in the Greek city. In the first 
place, children of good birth were well “protected” by paren¬ 
tal right and by public laws. Fathers were determined that the 
power they exercised over their sons would be respected; and 
the famous Lex Scantinia, which, as Boswell has shown, did 
not prohibit homosexuality, defended the free adolescent from 
abuse and violence . 1 Second, and doubtless by way of a conse¬ 
quence, love for boys was practiced for the most part with 
young slaves, about whose status there was no reason to 
worry. “In Rome the freeborn ephebe was replaced by the 
slave,” says Paul Veyne . 2 Hellenized though it was, and satu¬ 
rated with philosophy, Rome, whose poets were so fond of 
singing of adolescents, offered few echoes of the great specula¬ 
tion of the Greeks on the love of boys. 

Further, the forms taken by pedagogical practice and its 
modes of institutionalization made it much more difficult to 
valorize the relationship with adolescents in terms of educa¬ 
tional efficacy. When Quintilian speaks of the moment when 
a boy should be entrusted to the rhetoric teacher, he empha¬ 
sizes the need to make sure of the latter’s “morals”: “Pupils 
are transferred to the school of rhetoric when they are practi¬ 
cally grown up, and they continue there when they are young 
men; accordingly, we must at this stage exercise even greater 
care that the stainless character of the teacher may preserve 
their more tender years from harm and that the weight of his 
authority may deter their bolder age from excess.” The 
teacher must therefore “adopt the attitude of a parent toward 
his pupils and consider that he is taking the place of those who 
entrust their children to him .” 3 In a more general way, a 
certain lessening of the importance of personal relations of 
philia, together with the valorization of marriage, no doubt 
had much to do with the fact that the love relation between 
men ceased to be the focus of an intense theoretical and moral 
discussion. 

Three important texts remain nevertheless: Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue on love, the later dialogue attributed to Lucian, and the 
four lectures by Maximus of Tyre on Socratic love. We can

leave aside this last text: not because of its rhetorical and 
artificial character—Pseudo-Lucian’s Affairs of the Heart are 
scarcely less so, and the reactivation of ancient themes in 
academic exercises was a feature characteristic of the epoch. 
But the text by Maximus of Tyre is essentially devoted—this 
is what constitutes its traditionalism—to the distinction and 
comparison, in male relations, between two sorts of love: the 
love that is fine and just and the love that is not . 4 Conforming 
to the Socratic tradition, Maximus of Tyre has this distinction 
coincide with the opposition between true love and the love 
that is only a simulation. Starting from this point, he develops 
a systematic and traditional comparison of the two loves. In 
terms of the qualities that belong to each: the first comprises 
virtue, friendship, modesty, candor, stability; the second com¬ 
prises excess, hatred, immodesty, infidelity. In terms of the 
ways of being that characterize them: the one is Hellenic and 
virile; the other is effeminate and barbaric. And lastly, in terms 
of the behaviors in which they are manifested: with the first, 
the lover takes care of the beloved, accompanies him to the 
gymnasium, goes hunting with him, into battle with him; he 
will be with him in death; and it is not in darkness or solitude
