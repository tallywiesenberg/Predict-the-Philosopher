a boy should be entrusted to the rhetoric teacher, he empha¬ 
sizes the need to make sure of the latter’s “morals”: “Pupils 
are transferred to the school of rhetoric when they are practi¬ 
cally grown up, and they continue there when they are young 
men; accordingly, we must at this stage exercise even greater 
care that the stainless character of the teacher may preserve 
their more tender years from harm and that the weight of his 
authority may deter their bolder age from excess.” The 
teacher must therefore “adopt the attitude of a parent toward 
his pupils and consider that he is taking the place of those who 
entrust their children to him .” 3 In a more general way, a 
certain lessening of the importance of personal relations of 
philia, together with the valorization of marriage, no doubt 
had much to do with the fact that the love relation between 
men ceased to be the focus of an intense theoretical and moral 
discussion. 

Three important texts remain nevertheless: Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue on love, the later dialogue attributed to Lucian, and the 
four lectures by Maximus of Tyre on Socratic love. We can

leave aside this last text: not because of its rhetorical and 
artificial character—Pseudo-Lucian’s Affairs of the Heart are 
scarcely less so, and the reactivation of ancient themes in 
academic exercises was a feature characteristic of the epoch. 
But the text by Maximus of Tyre is essentially devoted—this 
is what constitutes its traditionalism—to the distinction and 
comparison, in male relations, between two sorts of love: the 
love that is fine and just and the love that is not . 4 Conforming 
to the Socratic tradition, Maximus of Tyre has this distinction 
coincide with the opposition between true love and the love 
that is only a simulation. Starting from this point, he develops 
a systematic and traditional comparison of the two loves. In 
terms of the qualities that belong to each: the first comprises 
virtue, friendship, modesty, candor, stability; the second com¬ 
prises excess, hatred, immodesty, infidelity. In terms of the 
ways of being that characterize them: the one is Hellenic and 
virile; the other is effeminate and barbaric. And lastly, in terms 
of the behaviors in which they are manifested: with the first, 
the lover takes care of the beloved, accompanies him to the 
gymnasium, goes hunting with him, into battle with him; he 
will be with him in death; and it is not in darkness or solitude
