that he seeks his company; with the second, on the other hand, 
the lover flees the sun, seeks darkness and solitude, and avoids 
being seen with the one he loves . 5 

Plutarch’s and Pseudo-Lucian’s dialogues on love are con¬ 
structed quite differently. Their erotics is also binary and com¬ 
parative: it is still a matter of distinguishing two forms of love 
and of contrasting their value. But this time, instead of operat¬ 
ing within an Eros that is dominated, if not entirely repre¬ 
sented, by masculine love, in order to isolate two morally 
unequal forms of the latter, the comparison starts from two 
forms of relations that are naturally distinct: the relation with 
boys and the relation with women (and more specifically the 
relation that one may have with one’s lawful wife in the con¬ 
text of marriage). It is to these two distinct forms that the 
question of value, beauty, and moral superiority will be di¬ 
rected. This will have various consequences, which will mod-

The Care of the Self 


ify the question of erotics considerably: love for women and, 
particularly, marriage will belong indisputably to the domain 
of Eros and its problematization. The latter will rest on the 
natural opposition between love for one’s own sex and love for 
the other sex. Finally, the ethical valorization of love will no 
longer be able to be carried out through the elision of physical 
pleasure. 

This is the paradox: it was around the question of pleasure 
that reflection on pederasty developed in Greek antiquity; it 
is around this same question that it will go into decline. Mar¬ 
riage, as an individual tie capable of integrating relations of 
pleasure and of giving them a positive value, will constitute the 
most active focus for defining a stylistics of moral life. The 
love of boys will not become a doomed figure for all that. It 
will find many other ways of expressing itself in poetry and art. 
But it will undergo a kind of philosophical “disinvestment.” 
When it is examined, instead of asking it to reveal one of the 
highest possible forms of love, one will criticize it for a radical 
inadequacy, for its inability to accommodate relations of 
pleasure. The difficulty of accounting for the relations between 
this form of love and the use of the aphrodisia had long been 
the cause of its philosophical valorization. Now the difficulty 
becomes the reason for seeing it as a taste, a practice, a prefer¬ 
ence, which may have their tradition, but which are incapable 
of defining a style of living, an aesthetics of behavior, and a 
whole modality of relation to oneself, to others, and to truth. 

Plutarch’s dialogue and that of Pseudo-Lucian attest both 
to the legitimacy that is still granted to the love of boys and 
to its increasing decline as a vital theme of a stylistics of 
existence.

Plutarch 


Plutarch’s Dialogue on Love opens and closes under the sign 
of marriage. Shortly after their wedding, Plutarch has come 
with his wife on a pilgrimage to Thespiae. They wish to offer 
a sacrifice to the god and to ask him to bless this union, which 
a quarrel between their families has placed under unfavorable 
auspices. On arriving at their host’s, they find themselves in 
the midst of a minor commotion: Should the young Bacchon, 
a coveted ephebe, marry the woman who is pursuing him? 
Debate, turn of events, abduction. The dialogue ends with 
everyone preparing to form a procession for this new married 
couple and to offer a sacrifice to the benevolent god. The 
dialogue unfolds between one marriage and the other.* 

It also unfolds under the sign of Eros, during the time of the 
Erotidia, the holidays that were celebrated at Thespiae every 
four years, “in honor of Eros as well as the Muses.” He is the 
god whom Plutarch was anxious to ask for protection for his 
marriage. He is also the god who will be invoked for the 
contested marriage of Bacchon with Ismenodora, for it seems 
that he “approves and is graciously present at this affair .” 2 
Meanwhile, Plutarch will have had time to sing a long eulogy 
of Eros, of his divinity, of his antiquity, of his power, of his 


*H. Martin remarks that the dialogue does not explicitly differentiate between hetero¬ 
sexual love and marriage. Comparing the Dialogue on Love and the Marriage Pre¬ 
cepts, L. Goessler calls attention to the connection, emphasized by Plutarch, between 
gamos and eros, and to what is new about this in the traditional question of marriage.'
