that he seeks his company; with the second, on the other hand, 
the lover flees the sun, seeks darkness and solitude, and avoids 
being seen with the one he loves . 5 

Plutarch’s and Pseudo-Lucian’s dialogues on love are con¬ 
structed quite differently. Their erotics is also binary and com¬ 
parative: it is still a matter of distinguishing two forms of love 
and of contrasting their value. But this time, instead of operat¬ 
ing within an Eros that is dominated, if not entirely repre¬ 
sented, by masculine love, in order to isolate two morally 
unequal forms of the latter, the comparison starts from two 
forms of relations that are naturally distinct: the relation with 
boys and the relation with women (and more specifically the 
relation that one may have with one’s lawful wife in the con¬ 
text of marriage). It is to these two distinct forms that the 
question of value, beauty, and moral superiority will be di¬ 
rected. This will have various consequences, which will mod-

The Care of the Self 


ify the question of erotics considerably: love for women and, 
particularly, marriage will belong indisputably to the domain 
of Eros and its problematization. The latter will rest on the 
natural opposition between love for one’s own sex and love for 
the other sex. Finally, the ethical valorization of love will no 
longer be able to be carried out through the elision of physical 
pleasure. 

This is the paradox: it was around the question of pleasure 
that reflection on pederasty developed in Greek antiquity; it 
is around this same question that it will go into decline. Mar¬ 
riage, as an individual tie capable of integrating relations of 
pleasure and of giving them a positive value, will constitute the 
most active focus for defining a stylistics of moral life. The 
love of boys will not become a doomed figure for all that. It 
will find many other ways of expressing itself in poetry and art. 
But it will undergo a kind of philosophical “disinvestment.” 
When it is examined, instead of asking it to reveal one of the 
highest possible forms of love, one will criticize it for a radical 
inadequacy, for its inability to accommodate relations of 
pleasure. The difficulty of accounting for the relations between 
this form of love and the use of the aphrodisia had long been 
the cause of its philosophical valorization. Now the difficulty 
becomes the reason for seeing it as a taste, a practice, a prefer¬
