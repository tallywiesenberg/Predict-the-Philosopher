of defining a style of living, an aesthetics of behavior, and a 
whole modality of relation to oneself, to others, and to truth. 

Plutarch’s dialogue and that of Pseudo-Lucian attest both 
to the legitimacy that is still granted to the love of boys and 
to its increasing decline as a vital theme of a stylistics of 
existence.

Plutarch’s Dialogue on Love opens and closes under the sign 
of marriage. Shortly after their wedding, Plutarch has come 
with his wife on a pilgrimage to Thespiae. They wish to offer 
a sacrifice to the god and to ask him to bless this union, which

cepts, L. Goessler calls attention to the connection, emphasized by Plutarch, between 
gamos and eros, and to what is new about this in the traditional question of marriage.'
