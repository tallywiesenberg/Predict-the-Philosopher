good works, of the force by which he elevates and attracts 
souls. In this way Plutarch will have contributed to the wor¬ 
ship of the god who is being celebrated throughout the festive 
city. Eros and Gamos, the strength of love and the marriage 
bond in their mutual relations: such is the theme of the dia¬ 
logue. The purpose of the religious rites that serve as its back¬ 
ground is clear: that the power of Eros, invoked for the 
protection of the couple, may triumph over the misunder¬ 
standing of families; that he may appease dissensions between 
friends and ensure the happiness of conjugal lives. The theo¬ 
retical aim of the debate is in harmony with this devotional 
practice. It will provide the rational justification for the latter: 
to show that the conjugal relationship, more than any other, 
is capable of accommodating the force of love, and that, 
among humans, love has its privileged place in the couple. 

The pretext for the conversation and the external peripeteia 
that give rise to its successive developments are recounted in 
a solemn and ironic fashion. A “pathetic” situation has arisen, 
which “merely wants a chorus to sympathize and lacks a 
stage, for no other element of drama is wanting .” 3 In reality, 
what has transpired is a little comic episode. Bacchon, the 
desirable adolescent—he is handsome and virtuous—is pur¬ 
sued by an erastes, but also by a widow, who is much older 
than he. She had been commissioned to find a suitable wife for 
him, but she didn’t find anyone better than herself. She tries 
to seduce the boy, chases after him, abducts him, already 
organizes the wedding under the nose of his male lover, who 
is furious, then resigned. The dialogue begins when the plans 
of the formidable widow are already known, but before she has 
carried out her coup de force. The boy is therefore still torn 
between the two suitors. He doesn’t know which path to 
choose. As he has entrusted the decision to his elders, the 
latter will deliberate on the matter. The debate thus takes 
place between the advocates of the love of boys, Protogenes 
and Pisias, and two advocates of the love of women, Anthem- 
ion and Daphnaeus. It unfolds in front of Plutarch, who soon 
abandons the role of witness, takes charge of the discussion,

and leads it in the direction of a general theory of love. The 
first champions of the two loves having disappeared by then, 
his interlocutors and adversaries will be Pemptides and espe¬ 
cially Zeuxippus, who have a materialistic conception of mar¬ 
riage and an aggressively critical idea which Plutarch will 
need to answer. 

Here we touch on one of the notable features of the dia¬ 
logue. It starts from the traditional schema—be it in the myth¬ 
ical figures or in the moral casuistry—of the crossroads. There 
are two paths: Which does one choose, that of love for boys 
or that of love for women? Now, in actual fact the debate does 
not exactly raise this problem. Whereas in the Platonic texts 
the noble, masculine Eros is contrasted with the facile, multi¬ 
ple, physical, “pandemian” Eros (which, clearly, is the love 
that can be practiced with boys and with girls outside mar¬ 
riage), in Plutarch the choice is between boys on the one hand 
and marriage on the other, as if it were in the latter that the 
relationship with women is fulfilled. 

Another distinctive element in Plutarch’s dialogue is the 
personage of the woman who is pursuing the boy. All the traits 
that characterize her are significant. She is older than the boy, 
while being still young; she is richer than he; she has a more 
important social status; her past life has already given her 
experience . 4 This kind of situation was not unusual in Greece 
—both because of the scarcity of women and because of the 
strategy of marriages. But people nevertheless felt a certain 
reticence with regard to this kind of union. The younger and 
poorer husband was in a somewhat awkward position with 
respect to his wife, seeing that the preeminence of the husband 
was statutory in marital relations. Moreover, one finds numer¬ 
ous remarks concerning these drawbacks. Plutarch, in the Life 
of Solon, advises the magistrate who discovers a young man 
zealously attending an old woman, “like a cock-partridge in 
her service,” to have him removed to the house of a young 
woman in need of a husband . 5 Nor will Pisias fail to recall 
these habitual fears to the advocates of Bacchon’s marriage . 6 
Without being totally exceptional, this was a paradoxical and
