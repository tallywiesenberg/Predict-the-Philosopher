and leads it in the direction of a general theory of love. The 
first champions of the two loves having disappeared by then, 
his interlocutors and adversaries will be Pemptides and espe¬ 
cially Zeuxippus, who have a materialistic conception of mar¬ 
riage and an aggressively critical idea which Plutarch will 
need to answer. 

Here we touch on one of the notable features of the dia¬ 
logue. It starts from the traditional schema—be it in the myth¬ 
ical figures or in the moral casuistry—of the crossroads. There 
are two paths: Which does one choose, that of love for boys 
or that of love for women? Now, in actual fact the debate does 
not exactly raise this problem. Whereas in the Platonic texts 
the noble, masculine Eros is contrasted with the facile, multi¬ 
ple, physical, “pandemian” Eros (which, clearly, is the love 
that can be practiced with boys and with girls outside mar¬ 
riage), in Plutarch the choice is between boys on the one hand 
and marriage on the other, as if it were in the latter that the 
relationship with women is fulfilled. 

Another distinctive element in Plutarch’s dialogue is the 
personage of the woman who is pursuing the boy. All the traits 
that characterize her are significant. She is older than the boy, 
while being still young; she is richer than he; she has a more 
important social status; her past life has already given her 
experience . 4 This kind of situation was not unusual in Greece 
—both because of the scarcity of women and because of the 
strategy of marriages. But people nevertheless felt a certain 
reticence with regard to this kind of union. The younger and 
poorer husband was in a somewhat awkward position with 
respect to his wife, seeing that the preeminence of the husband 
was statutory in marital relations. Moreover, one finds numer¬ 
ous remarks concerning these drawbacks. Plutarch, in the Life 
of Solon, advises the magistrate who discovers a young man 
zealously attending an old woman, “like a cock-partridge in 
her service,” to have him removed to the house of a young 
woman in need of a husband . 5 Nor will Pisias fail to recall 
these habitual fears to the advocates of Bacchon’s marriage . 6 
Without being totally exceptional, this was a paradoxical and
