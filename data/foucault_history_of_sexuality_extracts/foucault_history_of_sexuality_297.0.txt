dangerous union, where the interests of one party and the 
appetites of the other were too salient for it to hold the promise 
of a happy and reasonable existence. What Bacchon sees him¬ 
self being offered—in opposition to pederastic love—is there¬ 
fore not the best but the least good of all possible marriages. 
The value of the discussion that will justify it and of the 
outcome that will see it triumph will be only increased by this 
fact. 

But still another paradoxical trait should be noted. Is- 
menodora, the passionate widow, is a woman full of good 
qualities: she is virtuous, she leads a “life of decorum.” She 
commands the respect of public opinion. There has never been 
“a word of censure” concerning her. Never “did any hint of 
wrongdoing leave a stain on her house .” 7 Yet she has shame¬ 
lessly set out in pursuit of the boy. He had been entrusted to 
her so that she might promote his marriage; but after hearing 
so many good things said about him, after seeing his beauty 
and his qualities with her own eyes, she loves him in turn. 
What is more, she chases after him. Being unable to accom¬ 
pany him to the gymnasium, she watches for him when he 
returns. And with the collusion of some friends, she “kidnaps” 
him. We know that such “kidnappings”—in part “real,” in 
part arranged also—were a frequent element if not in reality 
itself, at least, certainly, in pederastic literature. Many mythi¬ 
cal and historical narratives revolve around one of these epi¬ 
sodes of violence. The Love Stories attributed to Plutarch and 
those Lectures of Maximus of Tyre that are devoted to So- 
cratic love make reference to them . 8 If a person as virtuous as 
Ismenodora gives way to such an assault, this is because she 
has been possessed by “some divine impulse, more powerful 
than human reason.” Now all these traits (the age difference, 
the acknowledged merit, the interest taken in the moral quali¬ 
ties and good reputation of the beloved, the initiative of the 
pursuit, the violence of divine inspiration) are easily recogniz¬ 
able. They are those which characterize the lover of boys in 
the traditional pederastic model. Ismenodora, in Plutarch’s 
description, is exactly in the position of the erastes. So that,
