two fundamentally different forms of love—the love that can 
develop between a gifted young man and an older man who 
is interested in the beauty of his friend, and the love that can 
be established between a husband and a wife with a view to 
managing an estate and rearing children—but between two 
forms of the same love, the only difference being that in one 
case it is love of a man and in the other, love of a woman. 
Plutarch makes it quite clear, in one of his statements in favor 
of the marriage with Ismenodora, that the same type of rela¬ 
tionship is involved. No one, he says, can do without author¬ 
ity, or be perfect by himself; “the ephebe is ruled by the 
gymnasiarch, the young man by the erastes, the adult by the 
law and by the strategus. . . . Since this is so, what is there 
dreadful about a sensible older woman piloting the life of her 
young husband? She will be useful because of her superior 
understanding [toi phronein mallon]\ she will be sweet and 
affectionate [toiphilein] because she loves him .” 9 

One sees two movements running beneath Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue. First, there is the shift resulting from the discussion 
itself; the question of the choice the beloved must make be¬ 
tween his two lovers surreptitiously becomes the question of 
love in its two possible forms—for boys and for girls. And 
second, the shift, made possible by the paradoxical situation 
of the intrigue, which confers on the relationship with a 
woman the same ethical potential as the relationship with a 
man. The objective of the entire debate is clearly visible in the 
little drama that underlies the vicissitudes of the dialogue: 
what is wanted is to form a conception of a single love. This 
conception will not reject the characteristic values of pederas- 
tic love. Instead, it will include them in a broader, more com¬ 
plete form, which ultimately only the relationship with 
women, and more precisely with the wife, will be able to put 
into practice. 

One is tempted to see in this dialogue by Plutarch one of the 
numerous rhetorical contests that staged an encounter, with 
a winner declared at the end, between the love of women and

the love of boys. Viewed in this way, it can pass for one of 
the most fervent pleas in favor of conjugal affection and the 
pleasures of marriage. It is legitimate to place it alongside the
