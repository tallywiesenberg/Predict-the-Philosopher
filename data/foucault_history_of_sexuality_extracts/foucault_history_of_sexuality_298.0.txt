Stoic treatises on marriage. It has many themes and formula¬ 
tions in common with them. But we are dealing, in this text, 
with something quite different from an argumentation in favor 
of marriage and against pederasty. We can see in it the first 
shape of an important change in the old erotics. This transfor¬ 
mation can be summed up briefly: whereas scarcely any dis¬ 
continuity, impassable boundary, or important difference of 
values was recognized in the practice of the aphrodisia, in 
return the elaboration of the erotics was clearly dualistic. This 
dualism was, moreover, double and, in itself, rather complex. 
On the one hand, common love (that love in which sensual 
acts are preponderant) was opposed to noble, pure, elevated, 
heavenly love (in which the presence of these same acts are, 
if not disallowed, at least veiled). On the other hand, the 
specificity of the love for boys was stressed, the aspiration, 
form, goals, and effects of which were supposed—at least 
provided one acted in conformity with its true nature—to be 
different from those found in the other loves. Furthermore, 
these two dualisms tended to overlap, since it was held that 
“true” love for boys could only be a pure love, a love free of 
the vulgar pursuit of the aphrodisia (which actuates the desire 
for women or the corrupt appetite for boys). A continuous 
domain of the aphrodisia, and an erotics with a binary struc¬ 
ture: it is this configuration that begins to be reversed here. 
Plutarch’s Dialogue may bear witness to a movement that will 
not actually be completed until much later, when an abso¬ 
lutely unitary conception of love will be constructed, while the 
practice of pleasure will be divided by a strict boundary: the 
one that separates the conjoinings of one sex with the other 
and relations within the same sex. It is roughly this order of 
things which is still ours today, solidified as it is by a unitary 
conception of sexuality, which enables one to delimit strictly 
the dimorphism of relations and the differential structure of 
desire.

In Plutarch’s Dialogue, one sees the effort to constitute a 
unitary erotics, very clearly organized on the model of the 
man-woman, and even husband-wife, relationship. In compar¬ 
ison with this single love (it is supposed to be the same, 
whether it is directed to women or to boys), the pederastic 
attachment will in fact be disqualified, but without a rigid line 
of demarcation being drawn, as it will be later, between
