Stoic treatises on marriage. It has many themes and formula¬ 
tions in common with them. But we are dealing, in this text, 
with something quite different from an argumentation in favor 
of marriage and against pederasty. We can see in it the first 
shape of an important change in the old erotics. This transfor¬ 
mation can be summed up briefly: whereas scarcely any dis¬ 
continuity, impassable boundary, or important difference of 
values was recognized in the practice of the aphrodisia, in 
return the elaboration of the erotics was clearly dualistic. This 
dualism was, moreover, double and, in itself, rather complex. 
On the one hand, common love (that love in which sensual 
acts are preponderant) was opposed to noble, pure, elevated, 
heavenly love (in which the presence of these same acts are, 
if not disallowed, at least veiled). On the other hand, the 
specificity of the love for boys was stressed, the aspiration, 
form, goals, and effects of which were supposed—at least 
provided one acted in conformity with its true nature—to be 
different from those found in the other loves. Furthermore, 
these two dualisms tended to overlap, since it was held that 
“true” love for boys could only be a pure love, a love free of 
the vulgar pursuit of the aphrodisia (which actuates the desire 
for women or the corrupt appetite for boys). A continuous 
domain of the aphrodisia, and an erotics with a binary struc¬ 
ture: it is this configuration that begins to be reversed here. 
Plutarch’s Dialogue may bear witness to a movement that will 
not actually be completed until much later, when an abso¬ 
lutely unitary conception of love will be constructed, while the 
practice of pleasure will be divided by a strict boundary: the 
one that separates the conjoinings of one sex with the other 
and relations within the same sex. It is roughly this order of 
things which is still ours today, solidified as it is by a unitary 
conception of sexuality, which enables one to delimit strictly 
the dimorphism of relations and the differential structure of 
desire.

In Plutarch’s Dialogue, one sees the effort to constitute a 
unitary erotics, very clearly organized on the model of the 
man-woman, and even husband-wife, relationship. In compar¬ 
ison with this single love (it is supposed to be the same, 
whether it is directed to women or to boys), the pederastic 
attachment will in fact be disqualified, but without a rigid line 
of demarcation being drawn, as it will be later, between 
“homo-” and “heterosexual” acts. The whole burden of the 
text bears on this unification of erotics. The latter is carried 
out through a critical discussion (that of “dualism”), through 
the working out of a unitary theory (that of love), and through 
the bringing into play of a fundamental concept (that of charis, 
grace). 

1. The exposition and criticism of the traditional “dual¬ 
ism” can be quickly summarized. This dualism is of course 
defended by the partisans of the love of boys. Moreover, 
Protogenes and Pisias will very soon leave the stage—as soon 
as one learns of Bacchon’s abduction. They were there long 
enough to celebrate differential erotics one last time. Accord¬ 
ing to this erotics, the love of boys is both different from the 
attraction to women and superior to it, for two reasons: one 
has to do with their respective positions relative to nature, and 
the other concerns the role played, in each of them, by plea¬ 
sure. 

The advocates of the love of boys do refer briefly to the 
frequent argument that contrasts everything that is artificial 
about women (adornments and perfumes for some; razors, 
philters, and makeup for the most shameless) with the natural¬ 
ness of the boys one sees at the palestrae. 10 But their main 
argument against love for women is that it is nothing more 
than a natural inclination. In reality, it is nature, says Proto¬ 
genes, that has placed an appetite (orexis) in us that draws the 
two sexes to each other. Indeed, it was necessary that we be 
induced to procreate, just as we are prompted to feed our¬ 
selves. But it is clear that this same type of appetite is found 
in flies for milk and in bees for honey. It will be found, too,

in cooks for their fowls and their calves. Protogenes would not 
think to give the name “Love” to all these appetites. 11 The 
naturalness of the attraction to the other sex obviously does 
not condemn the indispensable practice that brings men into 
union with women. But it restricts the value of this practice 
to that of a behavior found everywhere in the animal world, 
a behavior whose reason for being is basic necessity. The 
natural character of relations with women is put forward by 
Protogenes in order to underscore its defectiveness and to 
show how it differs from a love of boys, which scorns such
