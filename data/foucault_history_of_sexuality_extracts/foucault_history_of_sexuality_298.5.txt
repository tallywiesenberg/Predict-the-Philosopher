“homo-” and “heterosexual” acts. The whole burden of the 
text bears on this unification of erotics. The latter is carried 
out through a critical discussion (that of “dualism”), through 
the working out of a unitary theory (that of love), and through 
the bringing into play of a fundamental concept (that of charis, 
grace). 

1. The exposition and criticism of the traditional “dual¬ 
ism” can be quickly summarized. This dualism is of course 
defended by the partisans of the love of boys. Moreover, 
Protogenes and Pisias will very soon leave the stage—as soon 
as one learns of Bacchon’s abduction. They were there long 
enough to celebrate differential erotics one last time. Accord¬ 
ing to this erotics, the love of boys is both different from the 
attraction to women and superior to it, for two reasons: one 
has to do with their respective positions relative to nature, and 
the other concerns the role played, in each of them, by plea¬ 
sure. 

The advocates of the love of boys do refer briefly to the 
frequent argument that contrasts everything that is artificial 
about women (adornments and perfumes for some; razors, 
philters, and makeup for the most shameless) with the natural¬ 
ness of the boys one sees at the palestrae. 10 But their main 
argument against love for women is that it is nothing more 
than a natural inclination. In reality, it is nature, says Proto¬ 
genes, that has placed an appetite (orexis) in us that draws the 
two sexes to each other. Indeed, it was necessary that we be 
induced to procreate, just as we are prompted to feed our¬ 
selves. But it is clear that this same type of appetite is found 
in flies for milk and in bees for honey. It will be found, too,

in cooks for their fowls and their calves. Protogenes would not 
think to give the name “Love” to all these appetites. 11 The 
naturalness of the attraction to the other sex obviously does 
not condemn the indispensable practice that brings men into 
union with women. But it restricts the value of this practice 
to that of a behavior found everywhere in the animal world, 
a behavior whose reason for being is basic necessity. The 
natural character of relations with women is put forward by 
Protogenes in order to underscore its defectiveness and to 
show how it differs from a love of boys, which scorns such
