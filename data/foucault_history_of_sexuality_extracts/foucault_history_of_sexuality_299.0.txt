necessities and aims much higher. Actually he does not ex¬ 
plain what he understands by this love that is beyond nature. 
It is Plutarch who will take up these Platonic themes, but only 
to integrate them, against the apologists of boys, into a unitary 
conception of love. 

The other difference is marked by the role of pleasure. The 
fondness for women cannot be detached from pleasure. The 
love for boys, on the contrary, does not truly accord with its 
own essence unless it frees itself of pleasure. The argumenta¬ 
tion used by Protogenes and Pisias in support of this principle 
is Stoic, if anything. They observe that intercourse with 
women was indeed designed by nature for the conservation of 
the species. But things were arranged in such a way that 
pleasure is associated with this act. For this reason, the appe¬ 
tite and the impulse (orexis, horme) that induce us to perform 
it are always apt to become violent and unrestrained; in this 
case, they are transformed into desire (epithumia). Thus we 
are led in two ways toward that natural object which a woman 
constitutes: by the appetite, a natural movement, which looks 
to the survival of the generations as its reasonable goal and 
uses pleasure as a means; and by desire, a violent movement, 
with no internal regulation, which has “pleasure and enjoy¬ 
ment as its goal.” 12 It is clear that neither the one nor the other 
can be love in its true form: not the first, because it is common 
to all the animals; not the second, because it exceeds reason¬ 
able limits and attaches the soul to sensual pleasures. 

It is only logical, then, to rule out the very possibility of 



Boys

Eros in relations between men and women. “True love has 
nothing to do with the women’s quarters,” says Protogenes in 
a turn of phrase that is given two meanings by the adherents 
of boys: first, the nature of desire, which attaches a man to a 
woman “by their sexual parts,” like a dog to his female, ex¬ 
cludes love; second, it would not be proper for a sober-minded 
and chaste woman to feel “love” for her husband and to accept 
“being loved” by him (eran, erastai). 13 Hence there is only one 
true love, the love of boys, because unworthy pleasures are 
absent from it and because it necessarily implies a friendship 
that is indissociable from virtue. If, moreover, the erastes finds 
that his love does not give rise to friendship and virtue in the 
other, then he abjures his attention and his fidelity. 14 

To this traditional line of argument, there will be an ex¬ 
pected reply: Daphnaeus’ denunciation of pederastic hypoc¬ 
risy. As if a tearful Achilles had not evoked the thighs of 
Patroclus, as if Solon, apropos of boys in the flower of their 
youth, had not praised “the sweetness of their thighs and their 
lips,” the fancier of boys likes to pose as a philosopher and a 
sage. But undoubtedly he waits only for an opportunity. At 
night when all is quiet, “sweet is the harvest when the guard 
is away.” One sees the dilemma: either the aphrodisia are 
incompatible with friendship and love, and in this case the 
lovers of boys who enjoy in secret the bodies they desire have 
fallen from the heights of love; or one admits that sensual 
pleasures have a place in friendship and love, and so there is 
no reason to exclude from the latter relationships with women. 
But Daphnaeus does not stop there. He also recalls the other 
great disjunction, which was often cited as an objection to the 
conduct of lovers and to the pleasure they tried to take: if the 
eromenos is virtuous, one cannot obtain this pleasure except 
by subjecting him to violence; and if he consents, one has to 
recognize that one is consorting with an effeminate. 15 Hence 
the primary model of all love is not to be sought in the fond¬ 
ness for boys. The latter should be thought of, rather, as “one 
come late and untimely to the world, illegitimate and ill- 
favored, [who] drives out the legitimate and older love”; un-

less, as Daphnaeus suggests, the fondness for boys and the 
fondness for women are basically one and the same thing. 16 

But the real working out of the general theory of love is 
done after the departure of the first adversaries and outside 
their presence—as if it were necessary, in order to reach the 
main object of the debate, to take leave of this familiar con¬ 
frontation. Up to this point, remarks Pemptides, the debate 
has focused on personal questions; it needs to be directed 
toward general themes.

Love in the traditional manner of praising a god; his truly 
divine nature is thereby established. Here Plutarch opposes 
the Epicurean-inspired argument outlined by Pemptides, ac¬
