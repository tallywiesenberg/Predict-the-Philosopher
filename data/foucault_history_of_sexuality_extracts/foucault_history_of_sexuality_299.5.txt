other, then he abjures his attention and his fidelity. 14 

To this traditional line of argument, there will be an ex¬ 
pected reply: Daphnaeus’ denunciation of pederastic hypoc¬ 
risy. As if a tearful Achilles had not evoked the thighs of 
Patroclus, as if Solon, apropos of boys in the flower of their 
youth, had not praised “the sweetness of their thighs and their 
lips,” the fancier of boys likes to pose as a philosopher and a 
sage. But undoubtedly he waits only for an opportunity. At 
night when all is quiet, “sweet is the harvest when the guard 
is away.” One sees the dilemma: either the aphrodisia are 
incompatible with friendship and love, and in this case the 
lovers of boys who enjoy in secret the bodies they desire have 
fallen from the heights of love; or one admits that sensual 
pleasures have a place in friendship and love, and so there is 
no reason to exclude from the latter relationships with women. 
But Daphnaeus does not stop there. He also recalls the other 
great disjunction, which was often cited as an objection to the 
conduct of lovers and to the pleasure they tried to take: if the 
eromenos is virtuous, one cannot obtain this pleasure except 
by subjecting him to violence; and if he consents, one has to 
recognize that one is consorting with an effeminate. 15 Hence 
the primary model of all love is not to be sought in the fond¬ 
ness for boys. The latter should be thought of, rather, as “one 
come late and untimely to the world, illegitimate and ill- 
favored, [who] drives out the legitimate and older love”; un-

less, as Daphnaeus suggests, the fondness for boys and the 
fondness for women are basically one and the same thing. 16 

But the real working out of the general theory of love is 
done after the departure of the first adversaries and outside 
their presence—as if it were necessary, in order to reach the 
main object of the debate, to take leave of this familiar con¬ 
frontation. Up to this point, remarks Pemptides, the debate 
has focused on personal questions; it needs to be directed 
toward general themes.

Love in the traditional manner of praising a god; his truly 
divine nature is thereby established. Here Plutarch opposes 
the Epicurean-inspired argument outlined by Pemptides, ac¬
