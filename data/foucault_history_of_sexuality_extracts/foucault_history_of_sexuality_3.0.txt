bring into coexistence concepts which the fear of ridicule or 
the bitterness of history prevents most of us from putting side 
by side: revolution and happiness; or revolution and a differ¬ 
ent body, one that is newer and more beautiful; or indeed, 
revolution and pleasure. What sustains our eagerness to 
speak of sex in terms of repression is doubtless this opportu¬ 
nity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths 
and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation, 
and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that com¬ 
bines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change 
the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights. 
This is perhaps what also explains the market value at¬ 
tributed not only to what is said about sexual repression, but 
also to the mere fact of lending an ear to those who would 
eliminate the effects of repression. Ours is, after all, the only 
civilization in which officials are paid to listen to all and 
sundry impart the secrets of their sex: as if the urge to talk 
about it, and the interest one hopes to arouse by doing so, 
have far surpassed the possibilities of being heard, so that 
some individuals have even offered their ears for hire. 

But it appears to me that the essential thing is not this 
economic factor, but rather the existence in our era of a 
discourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturn¬ 
ing of global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come, 
and the promise of a certain felicity are linked together. 
Today it is sex that serves as a support for the ancient form 
—so familiar and important in the West—of preaching. A 
great sexual sermon—which has had its subtle theologians 
and its popular voices—has swept through our societies over 
the last decades; it has chastised the old order, denounced

The History of Sexuality 


hypocrisy, and praised the rights of the immediate and the 
real; it has made people dream of a New City. The Francis¬ 
cans are called to mind. And we might wonder how it is 
possible that the lyricism and religiosity that long accom¬ 
panied the revolutionary project have, in Western industrial 
societies, been largely carried over to sex. 

The notion of repressed sex is not, therefore, only a theo¬ 
retical matter. The affirmation of a sexuality that has never 
been more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the 
hypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled 
with the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal 
the truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, sub¬ 
vert the law that governs it, and change its future. The 
statement of oppression and the form of the sermon refer 
back to one another; they are mutually reinforcing. To say 
that sex is not repressed, or rather that the relationship be¬ 
tween sex and power is not characterized by repression, is to 
risk falling into a sterile paradox. It not only runs counter to 
a well-accepted argument, it goes against the whole economy 
and all the discursive “interests” that underlie this argument. 

This is the point at which I would like to situate the series 
of historical analyses that will follow, the present volume 
being at the same time an introduction and a first attempt at 
an overview: it surveys a few historically significant points 
and outlines certain theoretical problems. Briefly, my aim is 
to examine the case of a society which has been loudly casti¬ 
gating itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which 
speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate 
in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it 
exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws 
that have made it function. I would like to explore not only 
these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the 
strategic intention that supports them. The question I would 
like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why 
do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment 
against our most recent past, against our present, and against

ourselves, that we are repressed? By what spiral did we come 
to affirm that sex is negated? What led us to show, ostenta¬ 
tiously, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something 
we silence? And we do all this by formulating the matter in 
the most explicit terms, by trying to reveal it in its most 
naked reality, by affirming it in the positivity of its power and 
its effects. It is certainly legitimate to ask why sex was as¬ 
sociated with sin for such a long time—although it would 
remain to be discovered how this association was formed, 
and one would have to be careful not to state in a summary 
and hasty fashion that sex was “condemned”—but we must 
also ask why we burden ourselves today with so much guilt 
for having once made sex a sin. What paths have brought us
