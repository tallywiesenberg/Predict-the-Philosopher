bring into coexistence concepts which the fear of ridicule or 
the bitterness of history prevents most of us from putting side 
by side: revolution and happiness; or revolution and a differ¬ 
ent body, one that is newer and more beautiful; or indeed, 
revolution and pleasure. What sustains our eagerness to 
speak of sex in terms of repression is doubtless this opportu¬ 
nity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths 
and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation, 
and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that com¬ 
bines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change 
the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights. 
This is perhaps what also explains the market value at¬ 
tributed not only to what is said about sexual repression, but 
also to the mere fact of lending an ear to those who would 
eliminate the effects of repression. Ours is, after all, the only 
civilization in which officials are paid to listen to all and 
sundry impart the secrets of their sex: as if the urge to talk 
about it, and the interest one hopes to arouse by doing so, 
have far surpassed the possibilities of being heard, so that 
some individuals have even offered their ears for hire. 

But it appears to me that the essential thing is not this 
economic factor, but rather the existence in our era of a 
discourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturn¬ 
ing of global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come, 
and the promise of a certain felicity are linked together. 
Today it is sex that serves as a support for the ancient form 
—so familiar and important in the West—of preaching. A 
great sexual sermon—which has had its subtle theologians 
and its popular voices—has swept through our societies over 
the last decades; it has chastised the old order, denounced

real; it has made people dream of a New City. The Francis¬ 
cans are called to mind. And we might wonder how it is 
possible that the lyricism and religiosity that long accom¬ 
panied the revolutionary project have, in Western industrial 
societies, been largely carried over to sex. 

The notion of repressed sex is not, therefore, only a theo¬ 
retical matter. The affirmation of a sexuality that has never 
been more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the
