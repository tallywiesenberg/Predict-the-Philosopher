The Repressive Hypothesis

apparatuses everywhere for listening and recording, proce¬ 
dures for observing, questioning, and formulating.Sex was 
driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive 
existence.From the singular imperialism that compels every¬ 
one to transform their sexuality into a perpetual discourse, 
to the manifold mechanisms which, in the areas of economy, 
pedagogy, medicine, and justice, incite, extract, distribute, 
and institutionalize the sexual discourse, an immense verbos¬ 
ity is what our civilization has required and organized.Surely no other type of society has ever accumulated—and 
in such a relatively short span of time—a similar quantity of 
discourses concerned with sex.It may well be that we talk 
about sex more than anything else; we set our minds to the 
task; we convince ourselves that we have never said enough 
on the subject, that, through inertia or submissiveness, we 
conceal from ourselves the blinding evidence, and that what 
is essential always eludes us, so that we must always start out 
once again in search of it.
