So it is not simply in terms of a continual extension that we 
must speak of this discursive growth; it should be seen rather 
as a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated, 
a diversification of their forms, and the complex deployment 
of the network connecting them.Rather than the uniform 
concern to hide sex, rather than a general prudishness of 
language, what distinguishes these last three centuries is the 
variety, the wide dispersion of devices that were invented for 
speaking about it, for having it be spoken about, for inducing 
it to speak of itself, for listening, recording, transcribing, and 
Redistributing what is said about it: around sex, a whole 
network of varying, specific, and coercive transpositions into 
discourse.Rather than a massive censorship, beginning with 
the verbal proprieties imposed by the Age of Reason, what 
was involved was a regulated and polymorphous incitement 
to discourse.The objection will doubtless be raised that if so many 
stimulations and constraining mechanisms were necessary in 
order to speak of sex, this was because there reigned over 
everyone a certain fundamental prohibition; only definite 
necessities—economic pressures, political requirements— 
were able to lift this prohibition and open a few approaches 
to the discourse on sex, but these were limited and carefully 
coded; so much talk about sex, so many insistent devices 
contrived for causing it to be talked about—but under strict 
conditions: does this not prove that it was an object of se¬ 
crecy, and more important, that there is still an attempt to 
keep it that way?But this often-stated theme, that sex is 
outside of discourse and that only the removing of an obsta¬ 
cle, the breaking of a secret, can clear the way leading to it, 
is precisely what needs to be examined.
