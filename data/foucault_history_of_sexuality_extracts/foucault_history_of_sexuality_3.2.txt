Does it not partake

to mirror, at the outer limit of every actual discourse, some¬ 
thing akin to a secret whose discovery is imperative, a thing 
abusively reduced to silence, and at the same time difficult 
and necessary, dangerous and precious to divulge?We must 
not forget that by making sex into that which, above all else, 
had to be confessed, the Christian pastoral always presented 
it as the disquieting enigma: not a thing which stubbornly 
shows itself, but one which always hides, the insidious pres¬ 
ence that speaks in a voice so muted and often disguised that 
one risks remaining deaf to it.Doubtless the secret does not 
reside in that basic reality in relation to which all the incite¬ 
ments to speak of sex are situated—whether they try to force 
the secret, or whether in some obscure way they reinforce it 
by the manner in which they speak of it.It is a question 
rather of a theme that forms part of the very mechanics of 
these incitements: a way of giving shape to the requirement 
to speak about the matter, a fable that is indispensable to the 
endlessly proliferating economy of the discourse on sex.
