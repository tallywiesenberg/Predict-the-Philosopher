They determined, 
each in its own way, the division between licit and illicit.They were all centered on matrimonial relations: the marital 
obligation, the ability to fulfill it, the manner in which one 
complied with it, the requirements and violences that accom¬ 
panied it, the useless or unwarranted caresses for which it 
was a pretext, its fecundity or the way one went about mak¬ 
ing it sterile, the moments when one demanded it (dangerous 
periods of pregnancy or breast-feeding, forbidden times of 
Lent or abstinence), its frequency or infrequency, and so on.It was this domain that was especially saturated with pre¬ 
scriptions.The sex of husband and wife was beset by rules 
and recommendations.The marriage relation was the most 
intense focus of constraints; it was spoken of more than 
anything else; more than any other relation, it was required 
to give a detailed accounting of itself.
