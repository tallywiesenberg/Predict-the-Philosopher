What was taken into account in the civil and religious juris¬ 
dictions alike was a general unlawfulness.Doubtless acts 
“contrary to nature” were stamped as especially abominable, 
but they were perceived simply as an extreme form of acts 
“against the law”; they were infringements of decrees which 
were just as sacred as those of marriage, and which had been 
established for governing the order of things and the plan of 
beings.Prohibitions bearing on sex were essentially of a 
juridical nature.The “nature” on which they were based was 
still a kind of law.For a long time hermaphrodites were 
criminals, or crime’s offspring, since their anatomical dispo¬ 
sition, their very being, confounded the law that distin¬ 
guished the sexes and prescribed their union.
