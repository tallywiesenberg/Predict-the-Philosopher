The discursive explosion of the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries caused this system centered on legitimate alliance 
to undergo two modifications.First, a centrifugal movement 
with respect to heterosexual monogamy.Of course, the array 
of practices and pleasures continued to be referred to it as 
their internal standard; but it was spoken of less and less, or 
in any case with a growing moderation.Efforts to find out 
its secrets were abandoned; nothing further was demanded 
of it than to define itself from day to day.The legitimate 
couple, with its regular sexuality, had a right to more discreÂ¬ 
tion.
