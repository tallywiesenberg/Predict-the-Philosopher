hypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled 
with the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal 
the truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, sub¬ 
vert the law that governs it, and change its future. The 
statement of oppression and the form of the sermon refer 
back to one another; they are mutually reinforcing. To say 
that sex is not repressed, or rather that the relationship be¬ 
tween sex and power is not characterized by repression, is to 
risk falling into a sterile paradox. It not only runs counter to 
a well-accepted argument, it goes against the whole economy 
and all the discursive “interests” that underlie this argument. 

This is the point at which I would like to situate the series 
of historical analyses that will follow, the present volume 
being at the same time an introduction and a first attempt at 
an overview: it surveys a few historically significant points 
and outlines certain theoretical problems. Briefly, my aim is 
to examine the case of a society which has been loudly casti¬ 
gating itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which 
speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate 
in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it 
exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws 
that have made it function. I would like to explore not only 
these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the 
strategic intention that supports them. The question I would 
like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why 
do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment 
against our most recent past, against our present, and against

ourselves, that we are repressed? By what spiral did we come 
to affirm that sex is negated? What led us to show, ostenta¬ 
tiously, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something 
we silence? And we do all this by formulating the matter in 
the most explicit terms, by trying to reveal it in its most 
naked reality, by affirming it in the positivity of its power and 
its effects. It is certainly legitimate to ask why sex was as¬ 
sociated with sin for such a long time—although it would 
remain to be discovered how this association was formed, 
and one would have to be careful not to state in a summary 
and hasty fashion that sex was “condemned”—but we must 
also ask why we burden ourselves today with so much guilt 
for having once made sex a sin. What paths have brought us
