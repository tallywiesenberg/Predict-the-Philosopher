This kind of activity 
assumed an autonomy with regard to the other condemned 
forms such as adultery or rape (and the latter were con¬ 
demned less and less): to marry a close relative or practice 
sodomy, to seduce a nun or engage in sadism, to deceive 
one’s wife or violate cadavers, became things that were essen¬ 
tially different.The area covered by the Sixth Command¬ 
ment began to fragment.Similarly, in the civil order, the 
confused category of “debauchery,” which for more than a 
century had been one of the most frequent reasons for ad¬ 
ministrative confinement, came apart.From the debris, there 
appeared on the one hand infractions against the legislation 
(or morality) pertaining to marriage and the family, and on 
the other, offenses against the regularity of a natural function 
(offenses which, it must be added, the law was apt to punish).Here we have a likely reason, among others, for the prestige 
of Don Juan, which three centuries have not erased.
