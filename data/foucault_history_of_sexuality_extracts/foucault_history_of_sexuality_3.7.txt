Although not without delay and equivocation, the natural 
laws of matrimony and the immanent rules of sexuality 
began to be recorded on two separate registers.There 
emerged a world of perversion which partook of that of legal 
or moral infraction, yet was not simply a variety of the latter.An entire sub-race race was bom, different—despite certain 
kinship ties—from the libertines of the past.From the end 
of the eighteenth century to our own, they circulated through 
the pores of society; they were always hounded, but not 
always by laws; were often locked up, but not always in 
prisons; were sick perhaps, but scandalous, dangerous vic¬ 
tims, prey to a strange evil that also bore the name of vice 
and sometimes crime.They were children wise beyond their 
years, precocious little girls, ambiguous schoolboys, dubious 
servants and educators, cruel or maniacal husbands, solitary 
collectors, ramblers with bizarre impulses; they haunted the 
houses of correction, the penal colonies, the tribunals, and 
the asylums; they carried their infamy to the doctors and 
their sickness to the judges.
