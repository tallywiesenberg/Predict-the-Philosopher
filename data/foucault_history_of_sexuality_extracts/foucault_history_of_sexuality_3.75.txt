This was the numberless family 
of perverts who were on friendly terms with delinquents and 
akin to madmen.In the course of the century they succes¬ 
sively bore the stamp of “moral folly,” “genital neurosis,” 
“aberration of the genetic instinct,” “degenerescence,” or 
“physical imbalance.” 

What does the appearance of all these peripheral sexuali¬ 
ties signify?Is the fact that they could appear in broad day¬ 
light a sign that the code had become more lax?Or does the 
fact that they were given so much attention testify to a 
stricter regime and to its concern to bring them under close 
supervision?In terms of repression, things are unclear.
