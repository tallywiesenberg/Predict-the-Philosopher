of all the agencies of control and all the mechanisms of 
surveillance that were put into operation by pedagogy or 
therapeutics.It may be the case that the intervention of the 
Church in conjugal sexuality and its rejection of “frauds” 
against procreation had lost much of their insistence over the 
previous two hundred years.But medicine made a forceful 
entry into the pleasures of the couple: it created an entire 
organic, functional, or mental pathology arising out of “in¬ 
complete” sexual practices; it carefully classified all forms of 
related pleasures; it incorporated them into the notions of 
“development” and instinctual “disturbances”; and it under¬ 
took to manage them.Perhaps the point to consider is not the level of indulgence 
or the quantity of repression but the form of power that was 
exercised.
