When this whole thicket of disparate sexualities 
was labeled, as if to disentangle them from one another, was 
the object to exclude them from reality?It appears, in fact, 
that the function of the power exerted in this instance was 
not that of interdiction, and that it involved four operations 
quite different from simple prohibition.1.Take the ancient prohibitions of consanguine marriages 
(as numerous and complex as they were) or the condemna¬ 
tion of adultery, with its inevitable frequency of occurrence; 
or on the other hand, the recent controls through which, 
since the nineteenth century, the sexuality of children has 
been subordinated and their “solitary habits” interfered 
with.It is clear that we are not dealing with one and the same 
power mechanism.
