What this actually entailed, 
throughout this whole secular campaign that mobilized the 
adult world around the sex of children, was using these 
tenuous pleasures as a prop, constituting them as secrets 
(that is, forcing them into hiding so as to make possible their 
discovery), tracing them back to their source, tracking them 
from their origins to their effects, searching out everything 
that might cause them or simply enable them to exist.Wher¬ 
ever there was the chance they might appear, devices of 
surveillance were installed; traps were laid for compelling 
admissions; inexhaustible and corrective discourses were im¬ 
posed; parents and teachers were alerted, and left with the 
suspicion that all children were guilty, and with the fear of 
being themselves at fault if their suspicions were not suffi¬ 
ciently strong; they were kept in readiness in the face of this 
recurrent danger; their conduct was prescribed and their 
pedagogy recodified; an entire medico-sexual regime took 
hold of the family milieu.The child’s “vice” was not so much 
an enemy as a support; it may have been designated as the 
evil to be eliminated, but the extraordinary effort that went 
into the task that was bound to fail leads one to suspect that 
what was demanded of it was to persevere, to proliferate to 
the limits of the visible and the invisible, rather than to 
disappear for good.Always relying on this support, power 
advanced, multiplied its relays and its effects, while its target 
expanded, subdivided, and branched out, penetrating further 
into reality at the same pace.In appearance, we are dealing 
with a barrier system; but in fact, all around the child, indefi¬ 
nite lines of penetration were disposed.
