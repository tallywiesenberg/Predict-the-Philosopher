to hold to as long as possible, is that these deployments of 
power and knowledge, of truth and pleasures, so unlike those 
of repression, are not necessarily secondary and derivative; 
and further, that repression is not in any case fundamental 
and overriding. We need to take these mechanisms seriously, 
therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather 
than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an 
ignorance measured against what we are supposed to know, 
we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as 
they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleas¬ 
ure, and generate power; we must investigate the conditions 
of their emergence and operation, and try to discover how 
the related facts of interdiction or concealment are dis¬ 
tributed with respect to them. In short, we must define the 
strategies of power that are immanent in this will to knowl¬ 
edge. As far as sexuality is concerned, we shall attempt to 
constitute the “political economy” of a will to knowledge. 




PART FOUR 

The Deployment 
of Sexuality 




The aim of this series of studies? To transcribe into history 
the fable of Les Bijoux indiscrets. 

Among its many emblems, our society wears that of the 
talking sex. The sex which one catches unawares and ques¬ 
tions, and which, restrained and loquacious at the same time, 
endlessly replies. One day a certain mechanism, which was 
so elfin-like that it could make itself invisible, captured this 
sex and, in a game that combined pleasure with compulsion, 
and consent with inquisition, made it tell the truth about 
itself and others as well. For many years, we have all been 
living in the realm of Prince Mangogul: under the spell of an 
immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it, with an 
insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about, quick 
to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to 
abandon its discretion. As if it were essential for us to be able 
to draw from that little piece of ourselves not only pleasure 
but knowledge, and a whole subtle interchange f rom one to 
the other: a knowledge of pleasure, a pleasure that comes of 
knowing pleasure, a knowledge-pleasure; and as if that fan¬ 
tastic animal we accommodate had itself such finely tuned
