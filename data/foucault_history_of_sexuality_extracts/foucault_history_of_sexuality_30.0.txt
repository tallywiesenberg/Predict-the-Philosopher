to hold to as long as possible, is that these deployments of 
power and knowledge, of truth and pleasures, so unlike those 
of repression, are not necessarily secondary and derivative; 
and further, that repression is not in any case fundamental 
and overriding. We need to take these mechanisms seriously, 
therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather 
than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an 
ignorance measured against what we are supposed to know, 
we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as 
they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleas¬ 
ure, and generate power; we must investigate the conditions 
of their emergence and operation, and try to discover how 
the related facts of interdiction or concealment are dis¬ 
tributed with respect to them. In short, we must define the 
strategies of power that are immanent in this will to knowl¬ 
edge. As far as sexuality is concerned, we shall attempt to 
constitute the “political economy” of a will to knowledge. 




PART FOUR 

The Deployment 
of Sexuality 




The aim of this series of studies? To transcribe into history 
the fable of Les Bijoux indiscrets. 

Among its many emblems, our society wears that of the 
talking sex. The sex which one catches unawares and ques¬ 
tions, and which, restrained and loquacious at the same time, 
endlessly replies. One day a certain mechanism, which was 
so elfin-like that it could make itself invisible, captured this 
sex and, in a game that combined pleasure with compulsion, 
and consent with inquisition, made it tell the truth about 
itself and others as well. For many years, we have all been 
living in the realm of Prince Mangogul: under the spell of an 
immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it, with an 
insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about, quick 
to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to 
abandon its discretion. As if it were essential for us to be able 
to draw from that little piece of ourselves not only pleasure 
but knowledge, and a whole subtle interchange f rom one to 
the other: a knowledge of pleasure, a pleasure that comes of 
knowing pleasure, a knowledge-pleasure; and as if that fan¬ 
tastic animal we accommodate had itself such finely tuned 
ears, such searching eyes, so gifted a tongue and mind, as to 
know much and be quite willing to tell it, provided we em¬ 
ployed a little skill in urging it to speak. Between each of us 
and our sex, the West has placed a never-ending demand for 
truth: it is up to us to extract the truth of sex, since this truth 
is beyond its grasp; it is up to sex to tell us our truth, since 
sex is what holds it in darkness. But is sex hidden from us, 
concealed by a new sense of decency, kept under a bushel by 
the grim necessities of bourgeois society? On the contrary, it 
shines forth; it is incandescent. Several centuries ago, it was

The History of Sexuality 


placed at the center of a formidable petition to know. A 
double petition, in that we are compelled to know how things 
are with it, while it is suspected of knowing how things are 
with us. 

In the space of a few centuries, a certain inclination has 
led us to direct the question of what we are, to sex. Not so 
much to sex as representing nature, but to sex as history, as 
signification and discourse. We have placed ourselves under 
the sign of sex, but in the form of a Logic of Sex, rather than 
a Physics.. We must make no mistake here: with the great 
series of binary oppositions (body/soul, flesh/spirit, instinct/ 
reason, drives/consciousness) that seemed to refer sex to a 
pure mechanics devoid of reason, the West has managed not 
only, or not so much, to annex sex to a field of rationality, 
which would not be. all that remarkable an achievement, 
seeing how accustomed we are to such “conquests” since the 
“Greeks, but to bring us almost entirely—our bodies, our 
vminds, our individuality, our history—under the sway of a 
“logic of concupiscence and desire. Whenever it is a question 
of knowing who we are, it is this logic that henceforth serves 
as our master key. It has been several decades since geneti¬ 
cists ceased to conceive of life as an organization strangely 
equipped with an additional capacity to reproduce itself; they 
see in the reproductive mechanism that very element which 
introduces the biological dimension: the matrix not only of 
the living, but of life itself. But it was centuries ago that 
countless theoreticians and practitioners of the flesh—whose 
approach was hardly “scientific,” it is true—made man the
