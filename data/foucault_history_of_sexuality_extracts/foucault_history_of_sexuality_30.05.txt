It was 
one of the frequent themes in moral reflection on this type of 
relation, that these relations needed to rid themselves of their 
precariousness: a precariousness that was due to the incon¬ 
stancy of the partners, and that was a consequence of the boy’s 
growing older and thereby losing his charm; but it was also 
a precept, since it was not good to love a boy who was past 
a certain age, just as it was not good for him to allow himself 
to be loved.This precariousness could be avoided only if, in 
the fervor of love, philia —friendship—already began to de¬ 
velop: philia, i.e., an affinity of character and mode of life, a 
sharing of thoughts and existence, mutual benevolence.28 The 
beginning of this cultivation of indestructible friendship in the 
love relation is what Xenophon is describing when he portrays 
two lovers who look into each other’s faces, converse, confide 
in one another, rejoice together or feel a common distress over 
successes and failures, and look after each other: “It is by 
conducting themselves thus that men continue to love their 
mutual affection and enjoy it down to old age.”*

felt in view of the precariousness of male love relationships, and of the role that the 
permanence of friendship was supposed to play in the scheme of things.”

fact should not lead us to conclude that for the Greeks Eros 
had no place except in this type of relation, and that it could 
not play a part in relations with a woman: Eros could unite 
human beings no matter what their sex happened to be; in 
Xenophon, one can see that Niceratus and his wife are joined 
together by the ties of Eros and Anteros.
