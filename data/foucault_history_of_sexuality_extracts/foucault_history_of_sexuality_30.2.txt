In economics and dietetics, the voluntary 
moderation of the man was based mainly on his relation to 
himself; in erotics, the game was more complicated; it implied 
self-mastery on the part of the lover; it also implied an ability 
on the part of the beloved to establish a relation of dominion 
over himself; and lastly, it implied a relationship between their 
two moderations, expressed in their deliberate choice of one 
another.One can even note a certain tendency to privilege the 
boy’s point of view.The questions that were raised had to do 
with his conduct in particular, and it was to him that one 
offered observations, advice, and precepts: as if it were impor¬ 
tant above all to constitute an erotics of the loved object, or 
at least, of the loved object insofar as he had to form himself 
as a subject of ethical behavior; this is in fact what becomes 
apparent in a text like the eulogy of Epicrates, attributed to 
Demosthenes.2 


A Boy’s Honor 


In comparison with the two great Symposiums, Plato’s and 
Xenophon’s, and with the Phaedrus, Demosthenes’ Erotic 
Essay appears rather mediocre.A formulaic speech, it is both 
the encomium of a young man and an exhortation addressed 
to him.
