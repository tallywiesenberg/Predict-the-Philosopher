This was in fact the traditional function of encomiums, 
and the function that Xenophon alludes to in the Symposium: 
“in the very act of flattering Callias, you are educating him to 
conform to the ideal.” 1 Praise and lesson at the same time, 
therefore.But despite the banality of the themes and their 
treatment—a kind of insipid Platonism—it is possible to dis¬ 
cover a few traits that were characteristic of other discourses 
on love and of the way in which the question of “pleasures” 
was posed within them.1.One preoccupation animates the entire text.It finds 
expression in a vocabulary that refers constantly to honor and 
shame.
