It was this question 
that preoccupied those who chose to reflect on young men, on 
the love that was manifested for them and the conduct they 
needed to exhibit.Pausanias, in Plato’s Symposium, calls at¬ 
tention to the diversity of morals and customs having to do 
with boys.He points out what is considered “disgraceful” or 
“good” in Elis, in Sparta, in Thebes, in Ionia or in areas under 
Persian rule, and lastly, in Athens.6 And Phaedrus recalls the 
principle that should be one’s guide in the love of young men 
as well as in life in general: “shame at what is disgraceful and 
ambition for what is noble; without these feelings neither a 
state nor an individual can accomplish anything great or 
fine.” 7 But it should be remarked that this question was not 
confined to a few exacting moralists.A young man’s behavior, 
his honor and his disgrace were also the object of much social 
curiosity; people payed attention to this, spoke about it, 
remembered it.
