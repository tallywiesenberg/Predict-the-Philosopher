Of course, there is abun¬ 
dant evidence that boys of dubious reputation could exercise 
the highest political functions; but there is also evidence that 
this very thing could be held against them—without counting 
the substantial judicial consequences that certain kinds of mis¬ 
conduct might produce: theTimarchus affair makes this clear.The author of the Erotic Essay points it out to the young 
Epicrates; part of his future, including the rank he will be able 
to occupy in the city, depends this very day on the manner, 
honorable or not, in which he conducts himself: considering 
that the city cannot call upon just anyone, it will have to take 
account of established reputations; 10 and the man who scoffs 
at good advice will be punished all his life for his blindness.Two things are necessary, therefore: to mind one’s own con¬ 
duct when one is still very young, but also to look after the 
honor of younger men, when one has grown older.This transitional age, when the young man was so desirable 
and his honor so fragile, thus constituted a trial period: a time 
when his worth was tested, in the sense that it had to be 
formed, exercised, and measured all at the same time.A few 
lines at the end of the text point up the testlike characteristics
