know much and be quite willing to tell it, provided we em¬ 
ployed a little skill in urging it to speak. Between each of us 
and our sex, the West has placed a never-ending demand for 
truth: it is up to us to extract the truth of sex, since this truth 
is beyond its grasp; it is up to sex to tell us our truth, since 
sex is what holds it in darkness. But is sex hidden from us, 
concealed by a new sense of decency, kept under a bushel by 
the grim necessities of bourgeois society? On the contrary, it 
shines forth; it is incandescent. Several centuries ago, it was

placed at the center of a formidable petition to know. A 
double petition, in that we are compelled to know how things 
are with it, while it is suspected of knowing how things are 
with us. 

In the space of a few centuries, a certain inclination has 
led us to direct the question of what we are, to sex. Not so 
much to sex as representing nature, but to sex as history, as 
signification and discourse. We have placed ourselves under 
the sign of sex, but in the form of a Logic of Sex, rather than 
a Physics.. We must make no mistake here: with the great 
series of binary oppositions (body/soul, flesh/spirit, instinct/ 
reason, drives/consciousness) that seemed to refer sex to a 
pure mechanics devoid of reason, the West has managed not 
only, or not so much, to annex sex to a field of rationality, 
which would not be. all that remarkable an achievement, 
seeing how accustomed we are to such “conquests” since the 
“Greeks, but to bring us almost entirely—our bodies, our 
vminds, our individuality, our history—under the sway of a 
“logic of concupiscence and desire. Whenever it is a question 
of knowing who we are, it is this logic that henceforth serves 
as our master key. It has been several decades since geneti¬ 
cists ceased to conceive of life as an organization strangely 
equipped with an additional capacity to reproduce itself; they 
see in the reproductive mechanism that very element which 
introduces the biological dimension: the matrix not only of 
the living, but of life itself. But it was centuries ago that 
countless theoreticians and practitioners of the flesh—whose 
approach was hardly “scientific,” it is true—made man the
