that the city will appoint you to be in 
charge of some department of her business, and in proportion

3.What exactly was being tested?And with respect to 
what type of behavior was Epicrates supposed to draw the line 
between that which was honorable and that which was dis¬ 
graceful?The test pertained to the familiar points of Greek 
education: the demeanor of the body (carefully avoid rha- 
thymia, the sluggishness which was always a defamatory 
sign); one’s gaze (in which aidos, dignity, could be read), one’s 
way of talking (don’t take the easy option of silence, but be 
able to mix serious talk with casual talk); and the quality of 
one’s acquaintances.But it was especially in the sphere of amorous conduct that 
the distinction between what was honorable and what was 
shameful operated.
