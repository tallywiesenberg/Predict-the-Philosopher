It is this point that the text empha¬ 
sizes and makes a “point of honor,” so to speak; these things 
(ta pragmata) are not, in themselves and absolutely, good or 
bad; they vary according to who practices them (para tous 
chromenous ).15 It is “use” that determines their moral value, 
according to a principle that one sees often formulated else¬ 
where; in any case, we find quite similar expressions in the 
Symposium: “The truth of the matter I believe to be this.There is, as I stated at first, no absolute right and wrong in 
love, but everything depends upon the circumstances; to yield 
to a bad man in a bad way is wrong, but to yield to a worthy 
man in a right way is right.” 16 

Now, as for knowing precisely how the distribution of 
honor is to be carried out in the love relation, one must admit 
that the text is extremely elliptical.While it does offer specifics 
regarding what Epicrates should do or has done in order to 
exercise his body and develop his courage, or to acquire the 
philosophical knowledge that he will need, nothing is said 
concerning what is acceptable or objectionable in physical 
relations.One thing is clear: not everything should be refused 
(the young man “grants his favors”), but not everything 
should be consented to: “No one finds himself disappointed of 
favors from you which it is just and fair to ask, but no one is 
permitted even to hope for such liberties as lead to shame.
