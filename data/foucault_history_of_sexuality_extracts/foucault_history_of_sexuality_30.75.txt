Without doubt, 
the Greeks would have found it improper that someone would 
call by name, in a set speech, things that were only vaguely 
alluded to even in polemics and law court addresses.One 
imagines, too, that it was hardly necessary to insist on distinc¬ 
tions that were common knowledge: everyone must have 
known what it was honorable or shamef ul f or a boy to consent 
to.But we may also recall an observation that was made in our 
discussion of dietetics and economics, where it became appar¬ 
ent that moral reflection was less concerned with specifying 
the codes to be respected and the list of acts that were permit¬ 
ted and prohibited than it was concerned with characterizing 
the type of attitude, of relationship with oneself that was 
required.4.Actually, while the text does not indicate the practical 
forms that are to be respected and the physical boundaries that 
are not to be crossed, it does at least designate the general 
principle that determines the way to conduct oneself in these 
matters.
