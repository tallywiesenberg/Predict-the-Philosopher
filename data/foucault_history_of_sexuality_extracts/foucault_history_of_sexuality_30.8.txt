The entire eulogy of Epicrates refers to an agonistic 
context in which the worth and brilliance of the young man

must affirm itself through his superiority over others.Let us 
quickly review these motifs that were so frequent in set 
speeches.The individual being eulogized is greater than the 
praise that one offers him, and the words risk being less beauti¬ 
ful than the one to whom they are addressed; or the boy 
surpasses all others in physical and moral qualities; not only 
his gifts but his conversation places him above all others; 
among all the exercises in which one can excel, he has chosen 
the most noble, the most rewarding; his soul is prepared for 
“the rivalries of ambition,” and not content to distinguish 
himself by one quality, he combines “all the qualities of which 
a man might justly feel proud.” 18 

However, the merit of Epicrates is not just in this abun¬ 
dance of qualities that enable him to outstrip all his rivals and 
bring glory to his parents; 19 it also consists in the fact that with 
respect to all those who approach him he always maintains his 
eminent worth; he does not allow himself to be dominated by 
any of them; they all want to draw him into their intimacy— 
the word synetheia has both the general meaning of living 
together and the specific meaning of sexual relations—but he 
surpasses them in such a way, he gains such an ascendancy 
over them that they derive all their pleasure from the friend¬ 
ship they feel for him.20 By not yielding, not submitting, re¬ 
maining the strongest, triumphing over suitors and lovers 
through one’s resistance, one’s firmness, one’s moderation 
(sophrosyne )—the young man proves his excellence in the 
sphere of love relations.Given this general indication, must we imagine a precise 
code based on the analogy—so familiar to the Greeks—be¬ 
tween positions in the social field (with the difference between 
“the first ones” and the others, the great who rule and those 
who obey, the masters and the servants) and the form of sexual 
relations {with dominant and subordinate positions, active 
and passive roles, penetration carried out by the man and 
undergone by his partner)?
