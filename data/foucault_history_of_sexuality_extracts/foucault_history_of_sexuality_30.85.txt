To say that one must not yield, not

where one would get the worst of it, is doubtless to exclude 
or advise against sexual practices that would be humiliating 
for the boy, putting him in a position of inferiority.21 

But it is likely that the principle of honor and maintenance 
of “superiority” refers—beyond a few precise prescriptions— 
to a kind of general style: it was not good (especially in the 
eyes of public opinion) for a boy to behave “passively,” to let 
himself be manipulated and dominated, to yield without re¬ 
sistance, to become an obliging partner in the sensual pleas¬ 
ures of the other, to indulge his whims, and to offer his body 
to whomever it pleased and however it pleased them, out of 
weakness, lust, or self-interest.This was what dishonored boys 
who accepted the first comer, who showed off unscrupulously, 
who passed from hand to hand, who granted everything to the 
highest bidder.This was what Epicrates did not and would not 
do, mindful as he was of the opinion people had of him, of the 
rank he would have to hold, and of the useful relations he 
might enter into.5.
