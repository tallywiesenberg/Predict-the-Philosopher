but not to aim at 
the improvement of the mind, which has supervision over all 
other powers.” 23 What philosophy can show, in fact, is how to 
become “stronger than oneself’ and when one has become so,

it also enables one to prevail over others.It is by nature a 
leadership principle since it alone is capable of directing 
thought: “Of the powers residing in human beings we shall 
find that thought leads all the rest and that philosophy alone 
is capable of directing it rightly and training it.” 24 It is clear 
that philosophy is an asset that is necessary for the young 
man’s wise conduct; not, however, in order to guide him to¬ 
ward another form of life, but to enable him to exercise self- 
mastery and to triumph over others in the difficult game of 
ordeals to be undergone and honor to be safeguarded.The entire Erotic Essay revolves, as we see, around the 
problem of this twofold superiority over oneself and over oth¬ 
ers in that difficult phase when the boy’s youth and beauty 
attract one man after the other, each trying to “get the best” 
of him.In dietetics, it was mainly a question of mastery over 
oneself and over the violence of a perilous act; in economics, 
it was a question of the control that one had to exercise over 
oneself in the practice of the authority that one exercised over 
one’s wife.Here, where erotics takes the boy’s point of view, 
the problem is to see how the boy is going to be able to achieve 
self-mastery in not yielding to others.
