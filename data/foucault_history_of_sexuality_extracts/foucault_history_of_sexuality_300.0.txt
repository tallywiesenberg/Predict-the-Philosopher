cording to which the gods are nothing more than our passions; 
and he shows that the Love that takes possession of us is the 
effect of a necessarily divine power. This power is compared 
to that of the other gods, an important passage because it 
shows how Eros is a necessary complement of Aphrodite. 
Without him, the work of Aphrodite would be nothing more 
than the pleasure of the senses and could be bought for a 
drachma. Contrary to what people say, he is also stronger and 
more courageous than Ares: it is out of mutual love that 
lovers, in battle, throw themselves on the enemy, fighting 
boldly to their death rather than fleeing in shame. Plutarch 
describes his action on men’s souls, which he renders “gener¬ 
ous, compassionate, and liberal, and which he pervades 
through and through, as in a divine possession.” Finally, the 
eulogy ends with a reference to Egyptian myths and an exposi¬ 
tion of the Platonic theory. 

The remarkable thing about this eulogy is that all the ele¬ 
ments stem from the traditional erotics of pederasty. Most of 
the cases are borrowed from the love of boys or from the 
example of Sappho (Alcestis and Admetus form almost the 
only exception). And in fact it is as the god of boy love that 
Eros appears in the praises addressed to him. Yet these praises 
are sung by Plutarch, who calls himself at the same time “a

chorist of feminine love.” He intends to illustrate the general 
proposition advanced by Daphnaeus: “if we have regard for 
the truth, the liking for boys and the liking for women origi¬ 
nate in one and the same Love.” 17 

This seems to be the essential business of the dialogue. The 
little drama of the “pederastic” kidnapping of Bacchon by 
Ismenodora merely serves as its immediate context and illus¬ 
tration. Everything that the erotics of boys was able to claim 
as properly belonging to that form of love (in opposition to the 
false love for women) will be reutilized here, without anything 
from the great pederastic tradition being overlooked—on the 
contrary. But it will be used as a general form capable of 
subsuming both loves. In particular, it will be applied not only 
to the fondness for women, but to the conjugal relationship 
itself.
