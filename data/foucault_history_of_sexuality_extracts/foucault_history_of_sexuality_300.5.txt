After a speech by Zeuxippus—which the manuscripts have 
not passed down to us and which is supposed to have criticized 
conjugal love, not on behalf of pederasty, but in Epicurean 
terms—Plutarch speaks again in order to establish three es¬ 
sential points. First, he observes that if Love is indeed what 
he is said to be, he will make his presence, his power, and his 
actions felt in relations between the two sexes as well as in 
relations with boys. Let us assume for a moment that the 
Epicurean argument is correct: the images which emanate 
from the loved body, which are conveyed to the eyes of the one 
who loves, which enter into his body, fill it with emotion and 
agitate it to the point where sperm is formed—there is no 
reason why this mechanism should be set in motion by boys 
and not by women. 18 On the other hand, suppose that we 
accept the Platonic argument toward which Plutarch inclines: 
if “through the freshness and grace of a body” one perceives 
the beauty of a soul, and the latter, recalling the heavenly 
spectacle, gives wings to our soul, why would the difference 
between the sexes matter here, where it is only a question of 
“beauty” and “natural excellence”? 19 Plutarch shows that this 
element of virtue, arete, by which the traditional erotics of 
boys marked one of its important differences from the fond-

ness for women, transcends any difference of sex: “They say 
that beauty is the flower of virtue; yet it would be absurd to 
deny that the female produces that flower or gives it a presen¬ 
tation of a natural bent for virtue ... all these characteristics 
belong to both sexes alike.” 20 

As for the friendship that the pederasts wish to reserve 
exclusively for the love of boys, Plutarch shows that it can also 
characterize the relationship of a man with a woman, or at 
least with his wife (this specification is obviously crucial). It 
is conjugality and it alone that engenders the form of friend¬ 
ship in the relationship between the sexes. Plutarch evokes this 
conjugality briefly here, in a few strokes reminiscent of the 
Marriage Precepts. It involves sharing a common life (Plu¬ 
tarch plays on the words stergein and stegein, “to shelter,” “to 
keep at home”); it calls for mutual kindness (eunoia); it im¬ 
plies perfect community and a oneness of souls in separate 
bodies, a unity so strong that the spouses “no longer wish to 
be separate entities, or believe that that are so” 21 ; lastly, it
