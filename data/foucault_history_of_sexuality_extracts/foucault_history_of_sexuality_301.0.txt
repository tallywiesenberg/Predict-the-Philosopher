requires reciprocal moderation, a sophrosyne that abjures any 
other liaison. It is concerning this last point that the transposi¬ 
tion of the theory of Eros to the practice of married life is most 
interesting, for it suggests an idea of the high value of marriage 
very different from that found in the Stoics. As a matter of 
fact, against the moderation that “comes from without,” 
which is nothing but obedience to laws and is imposed by 
shame and fear, Plutarch opposes the moderation that is the 
effect of Eros: it is Eros in fact, when he inflames the two 
spouses for one another, who teaches “self-control, decorum, 
and mutual trust.” Into the amorous soul of the husband and 
the wife, he introduces “modesty, silence, calm”; he bestows 
“a reserved manner” on them and makes them “attentive to 
a single being.” It is easy to recognize in this sketch the 
characteristics of the pederastic Eros, the bringer of virtue and 
measure to the souls of lovers, the source, in the more perfect 
beings like Socrates, of that self-restraint which made him 
hold his silence and keep control of his desires in the presence 
of those he loved. Plutarch transposes to the married couple

the traits that had long been reserved for the philia of lovers 
of the same sex. 

However, the elaboration of a general theory of love, 
equally valid for the relationship with women and the relation¬ 
ship with boys, is skewed: Plutarch has not gone, as Anthem- 
ion asked him to do and as he claimed to be doing, from a 
particular love to a more general love. He has borrowed from 
the erotics of boys its fundamental and traditional features in 
order to demonstrate that they can be applied, not to all forms 
of love, but to the conjugal relationship alone. 

3. Such is in fact the ultimate goal of the dialogue: to show 
that this single chain of love, which can find its perfect realiza¬ 
tion in marriage, cannot be accommodated, at least not in its 
complete form, in the relationship with boys. While this rela¬ 
tionship, with its traditional values, has been able to serve as 
a support and model for the general conception of love, it finds 
itself, in the last analysis, invalidated and fallen into disfavor: 
an imperfect love when one compares it with that of husband 
and wife. 

Where does Plutarch have this imperfection reside? So long 
as one had a dualistic erotics that distinguished true love (true 
because it was pure) from false, delusive love (false because it 
was physical), the absence of the aphrodisia was not merely 
possible, it was necessary if this was to be made the love 
relation par excellence. But the elaboration of a general erot¬ 
ics, linking Eros and Aphrodite closely together, changes the 
terms of the problem. The elision of the aphrodisia, ceasing to 
be a precondition, becomes an obstacle. Plutarch says this 
explicitly: if Aphrodite without Eros offers only a momentary 
pleasure that can be purchased for a few drachmas, Eros 
without Aphrodite, when physical pleasure is lacking, is no 
less imperfect. A love without Aphrodite is “like drunkenness 
without wine, brought on by a brew of figs and barley. No fruit 
[akarpon], no fulfillment [ateles] comes of the passion; it is 
cloying and quickly wearied of.’’ 22 

Now, can the love of a boy find a place for the aphrodisia ?

The Care of the Self 


We know the argument.* Either sexual relations will be im¬ 
posed through violence and the individual who undergoes 
them will feel only anger, hatred, and desire for revenge. Or 
they will be consented to by an individual who, because of his 
“softness,” his “femininity,” “enjoys being passive” (hedome- 
nos toi paschein), which is a “shameful,” “unnatural” thing, 
and which reduces him to the lowest condition. 24 Plutarch has 
gone back to the “dilemma of the eromenos"-. compelled, he 
feels hatred, and consenting, he becomes an object of con¬ 
tempt. The traditional adversaries of pederasty let it go at that. 
But Plutarch’s analysis goes further, attempting to define what 
is lacking in the love of boys, what prevents it from being, like 
conjugal love, a harmonious mixture of Eros and Aphrodite, 
in which the bond between souls is associated with physical 
pleasure. Plutarch designates this deficiency with one word: 
the love of boys is acharistos. 

The word charis, which appears several times in the course 
of the dialogue, seems to be one of the keys to Plutarch’s 
reflection. It is introduced with a good deal of solemnity at the 
beginning of the text, before the formulation of the great 
theory of a single love. Daphnaeus is the first to use it, as an 
“overpowering” argument in favor of his thesis: the love of
