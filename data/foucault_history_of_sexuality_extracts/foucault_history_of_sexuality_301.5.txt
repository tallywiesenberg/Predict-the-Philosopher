Where does Plutarch have this imperfection reside? So long 
as one had a dualistic erotics that distinguished true love (true 
because it was pure) from false, delusive love (false because it 
was physical), the absence of the aphrodisia was not merely 
possible, it was necessary if this was to be made the love 
relation par excellence. But the elaboration of a general erot¬ 
ics, linking Eros and Aphrodite closely together, changes the 
terms of the problem. The elision of the aphrodisia, ceasing to 
be a precondition, becomes an obstacle. Plutarch says this 
explicitly: if Aphrodite without Eros offers only a momentary 
pleasure that can be purchased for a few drachmas, Eros 
without Aphrodite, when physical pleasure is lacking, is no 
less imperfect. A love without Aphrodite is “like drunkenness 
without wine, brought on by a brew of figs and barley. No fruit 
[akarpon], no fulfillment [ateles] comes of the passion; it is 
cloying and quickly wearied of.’’ 22 

Now, can the love of a boy find a place for the aphrodisia ?

The Care of the Self 


We know the argument.* Either sexual relations will be im¬ 
posed through violence and the individual who undergoes 
them will feel only anger, hatred, and desire for revenge. Or 
they will be consented to by an individual who, because of his 
“softness,” his “femininity,” “enjoys being passive” (hedome- 
nos toi paschein), which is a “shameful,” “unnatural” thing, 
and which reduces him to the lowest condition. 24 Plutarch has 
gone back to the “dilemma of the eromenos"-. compelled, he 
feels hatred, and consenting, he becomes an object of con¬ 
tempt. The traditional adversaries of pederasty let it go at that. 
But Plutarch’s analysis goes further, attempting to define what 
is lacking in the love of boys, what prevents it from being, like 
conjugal love, a harmonious mixture of Eros and Aphrodite, 
in which the bond between souls is associated with physical 
pleasure. Plutarch designates this deficiency with one word: 
the love of boys is acharistos. 

The word charis, which appears several times in the course 
of the dialogue, seems to be one of the keys to Plutarch’s 
reflection. It is introduced with a good deal of solemnity at the 
beginning of the text, before the formulation of the great 
theory of a single love. Daphnaeus is the first to use it, as an 
“overpowering” argument in favor of his thesis: the love of
