women is special, he says, in that through the practice of such 
sexual relations as nature has established, it can lead to friend¬ 
ship (eis philian) by way of charis. 25 And Daphnaeus attaches 
so much importance to this term that he immediately under¬ 
takes to define it and to give it a few great poetic sponsors: 
charis is the consent that a woman willingly grants to a man, 
a consent that can appear only with nubility, according to 
Sappho, and the absence of which can result, according to 
Pindar, in ungraceful births; thus Hephaestus was born from 
Hera “aneu chariton. ” 2A The role that is assigned to this acqui¬ 
escence is clear: to integrate sexual relations, with their two 
naturally defined poles of activity and passivity, into recipro-

cal relations of kindness and to bring physical pleasure into 
friendship. 

After this preliminary presentation, and once the unitary 
doctrine of love is established, the question of charis becomes 
preponderant at the end of the dialogue. It will serve as a 
discriminant between the love of women and the love of boys, 
only the former being able to engender that complete form in 
which are joined, owing to the gentleness of consent, the plea¬ 
sure of Aphrodite and the virtue of friendship. Now Plutarch 
does not conceive of this junction simply as a tolerance that 
could concede, in the conjugal relationship, a more or less 
utilitarian place (e.g., for procreation) to sexual acts. On the 
contrary, he makes the latter the starting point of the whole 
relation of affection that should animate the relationship. 
Physical pleasure, precisely insofar as the gentleness of con¬ 
sent excludes everything in the way of violence, deceit, or base 
compliance, can be at the very origin of the affectionate reci¬ 
procities that marriage requires: “Physical union with a lawful 
wife is the beginning of friendship, a sharing, as it were, in 
great mysteries.” Sensual pleasure is a small matter (this is 
even a traditional expression among the enemies of physical 
pleasure); but, Plutarch immediately adds, “it is like the seed 
out of which mutual respect [time], kindness [charis], affec¬ 
tion [agapesis], and loyalty [p/vt/s] daily grow between hus¬ 
band and wife.” 27 

To this fundamental role and this germinative function of 
physical pleasure, Plutarch gives a solemn historical sanction. 
He finds it in the legislation by Solon, which prescribed that 
husbands must have intercourse with their wives “not less 
than three times a month.” In the Life of Solon, he also 
referred to this law, pointing out that it applied only to the 
marriage of heiress girls. The reason for it was the need for 
offspring to whom one could leave the estate. But, Plutarch 
added, this was not the only reason: for this regular inter¬ 
course, even when “it does not result in children,” “is a mark 
of esteem and affection which a man should pay to a chaste

wife; it always removes the many annoyances which develop, 
and prevents their being altogether estranged by their differ¬ 
ences.” 28 To this role of sexual intercourse as an inducement 
to regular intimacy and a guarantee of good understanding, 
Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, lends an even more solemn 
formulation. He makes it a way to put new life into the conju¬ 
gal relationship, similar to the way in which one renews an 
agreement: “As cities renew their mutual agreements from 
time to time, just so he [Solon] must have wished this to be 
a renewal of marriage and with such an act of tenderness to 
wipe out the complaints that accumulate in everyday living.” 29 
Sexual pleasure is therefore at the heart of the matrimonial 
relation as a source and a token of the relationship of love and 
friendship. It founds the relationship, or in any case, reaffirms 
it as a covenant of existence. And if Plutarch acknowledges 
that the sexual relations at the beginning of marriage may be 
“wounding” to the wife, he also explains how this very “bite” 
is necessary for the formation of a vital, solid, and durable 
conjugal unity. He resorts to three metaphors: that of a plant 
that is grafted and must be well incised if it is to form, with 
the graft, a tree that will bear the desired fruit; that of a child 
or young man in whom one must inculcate, not without pain 
for him, the rudiments of a knowledge he will later turn to 
advantage and profit; that, lastly, of one liquid that is poured 
into another—after a period of effervescence and agitation, a 
mixture is produced, resulting in that di' ho Ion krasis to which 
the Marriage Precepts also made reference, 30 and together they 
form a new liquid whose two components can no longer be 
separated. A certain suffering, agitation, and disorder are inev¬ 
itable at the beginning of conjugal relations; but this is the
