To this fundamental role and this germinative function of 
physical pleasure, Plutarch gives a solemn historical sanction. 
He finds it in the legislation by Solon, which prescribed that 
husbands must have intercourse with their wives “not less 
than three times a month.” In the Life of Solon, he also 
referred to this law, pointing out that it applied only to the 
marriage of heiress girls. The reason for it was the need for 
offspring to whom one could leave the estate. But, Plutarch 
added, this was not the only reason: for this regular inter¬ 
course, even when “it does not result in children,” “is a mark 
of esteem and affection which a man should pay to a chaste

wife; it always removes the many annoyances which develop, 
and prevents their being altogether estranged by their differ¬ 
ences.” 28 To this role of sexual intercourse as an inducement 
to regular intimacy and a guarantee of good understanding, 
Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, lends an even more solemn 
formulation. He makes it a way to put new life into the conju¬ 
gal relationship, similar to the way in which one renews an 
agreement: “As cities renew their mutual agreements from 
time to time, just so he [Solon] must have wished this to be 
a renewal of marriage and with such an act of tenderness to 
wipe out the complaints that accumulate in everyday living.” 29 
Sexual pleasure is therefore at the heart of the matrimonial 
relation as a source and a token of the relationship of love and 
friendship. It founds the relationship, or in any case, reaffirms 
it as a covenant of existence. And if Plutarch acknowledges 
that the sexual relations at the beginning of marriage may be 
“wounding” to the wife, he also explains how this very “bite” 
is necessary for the formation of a vital, solid, and durable 
conjugal unity. He resorts to three metaphors: that of a plant 
that is grafted and must be well incised if it is to form, with 
the graft, a tree that will bear the desired fruit; that of a child 
or young man in whom one must inculcate, not without pain 
for him, the rudiments of a knowledge he will later turn to 
advantage and profit; that, lastly, of one liquid that is poured 
into another—after a period of effervescence and agitation, a 
mixture is produced, resulting in that di' ho Ion krasis to which 
the Marriage Precepts also made reference, 30 and together they 
form a new liquid whose two components can no longer be 
separated. A certain suffering, agitation, and disorder are inev¬ 
itable at the beginning of conjugal relations; but this is the
