necessary condition for a new, stable unity to be formed. 

And Plutarch thus arrives at the basic formulation: “To 
love is a greater boon thah to be loved.” 31 The statement is 
important given that in every love relation, the traditional 
erotics laid strong emphasis on the polarity of the lover and 
the beloved and on the necessary dissymmetry between them. 
Here it is the double activity of loving, by the husband and the

wife, that forms the essential element. And for reasons that are 
easily determined. This double activity of loving is a source of 
reciprocity. It is because each of the two spouses loves the 
other that they consent to receive the tokens of the other’s 
love, that they like to be loved. The activity therefore is a 
source of faithfulness as well, since each of the two can take 
the love they feel for the other as a guide for their conduct and 
a reason for limiting their desires. “Love rescues us from all 
errors that wreck or impair wedlock.” 32 This union owes its 
value and its stability to the schema of a double love in which 
each partner is, from the standpoint of Eros, always an active 
subject. Owing to this reciprocity in the act of loving, sexual 
relations can have their place in the form of mutual affection 
and consent. In terms of this relational model, pederasty can 
only be inadequate in view of the strongly marked difference 
between the erastes and the eromenos, the dilemma of passiv¬ 
ity, and the necessary fragility that is due to the age factor. It 
lacks the double and symmetrical activity of loving, hence it 
lacks the internal regulation and the stability of the couple. It 
is wanting in that “grace” which makes it possible for the 
aphrodisia to be combined with friendship in order to consti¬ 
tute the complete and perfect form of Eros. Pederasty, Plu¬ 
tarch might say, is a love that lacks “grace.” 

In sum, Plutarch’s text testifies to the formation of an erot¬ 
ics that, on certain essential points, differs from the erotics 
Greek civilization had known and developed. It is not entirely 
different, since, as the great central passage devoted to the 
eulogy of Eros shows, the traditional notions continue to play 
an essential role. But this Platonizing erotics is used by Plu¬ 
tarch to produce effects different from those with which it was 
usually associated. For a long time it had served to mark the 
existence of two distinct and antithetical loves (the first one
