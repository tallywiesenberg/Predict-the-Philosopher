necessary condition for a new, stable unity to be formed. 

And Plutarch thus arrives at the basic formulation: “To 
love is a greater boon thah to be loved.” 31 The statement is 
important given that in every love relation, the traditional 
erotics laid strong emphasis on the polarity of the lover and 
the beloved and on the necessary dissymmetry between them. 
Here it is the double activity of loving, by the husband and the

wife, that forms the essential element. And for reasons that are 
easily determined. This double activity of loving is a source of 
reciprocity. It is because each of the two spouses loves the 
other that they consent to receive the tokens of the other’s 
love, that they like to be loved. The activity therefore is a 
source of faithfulness as well, since each of the two can take 
the love they feel for the other as a guide for their conduct and 
a reason for limiting their desires. “Love rescues us from all 
errors that wreck or impair wedlock.” 32 This union owes its 
value and its stability to the schema of a double love in which 
each partner is, from the standpoint of Eros, always an active 
subject. Owing to this reciprocity in the act of loving, sexual 
relations can have their place in the form of mutual affection 
and consent. In terms of this relational model, pederasty can 
only be inadequate in view of the strongly marked difference 
between the erastes and the eromenos, the dilemma of passiv¬ 
ity, and the necessary fragility that is due to the age factor. It 
lacks the double and symmetrical activity of loving, hence it 
lacks the internal regulation and the stability of the couple. It 
is wanting in that “grace” which makes it possible for the 
aphrodisia to be combined with friendship in order to consti¬ 
tute the complete and perfect form of Eros. Pederasty, Plu¬ 
tarch might say, is a love that lacks “grace.” 

In sum, Plutarch’s text testifies to the formation of an erot¬ 
ics that, on certain essential points, differs from the erotics 
Greek civilization had known and developed. It is not entirely 
different, since, as the great central passage devoted to the 
eulogy of Eros shows, the traditional notions continue to play 
an essential role. But this Platonizing erotics is used by Plu¬ 
tarch to produce effects different from those with which it was 
usually associated. For a long time it had served to mark the 
existence of two distinct and antithetical loves (the first one 
common, oriented toward the aphrodisia; the second one ele¬ 
vated, spiritual, oriented toward the care of souls), but also to 
reestablish between them a kind of unity since only the second 
was considered genuine, the other being only its earthly

shadow and simulacrum. Plutarch brings these same Platonic 
notions into play in an erotics that seeks to form a single Eros 
capable of accounting for the love of women and the love of 
boys, and to integrate the aphrodisia into it. But in the inter¬ 
ests of such a unity, this erotics ultimately excludes the love 
of boys, for it lacks charis. Starting from a dualistic erotics 
traversed.by the question of truth and semblance, and in¬ 
tended essentially to provide a rational foundation for the love 
of boys, but at the cost of an elision of the aphrodisia, one sees, 
in Plutarch, a new stylistics of love being formed. It is monistic 
in that it includes the aphrodisia, but it makes this inclusion 
a criterion allowing it to keep only conjugal love and to ex¬ 
clude relations with boys because of the deficiency that char¬ 
acterizes them. There can no longer be a place for them in this 
great unitary and integrative chain in which love is revitalized 
by the reciprocity of pleasure.

Pseudo-Lucian 


The Affairs of the Heart, attributed to Lucian, is manifestly 
a later text.* It is presented in the quite customary form of in¬ 
terlocking dialogues. Theomnestus, whose loves—for women 
or for boys—reappear more numerous than the heads of 
Hydra, almost before they have ended, complains of Aphro¬ 
dite. From the time when as a child he became an ephebe, the 
wrath of the goddess has been pursuing him. And yet, he is 
not a child of the Sun, nor does he have the boorish contempt 
of Hippolytus. He feels equally inclined toward both kinds of 
love, without managing to decide which of the two is more 
deserving of his attention. He asks Lycinus—who is not 
affected by either of these two passions—to serve as an impar¬
