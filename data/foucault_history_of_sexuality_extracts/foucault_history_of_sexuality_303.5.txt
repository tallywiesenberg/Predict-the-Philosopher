notions into play in an erotics that seeks to form a single Eros 
capable of accounting for the love of women and the love of 
boys, and to integrate the aphrodisia into it. But in the inter¬ 
ests of such a unity, this erotics ultimately excludes the love 
of boys, for it lacks charis. Starting from a dualistic erotics

tended essentially to provide a rational foundation for the love 
of boys, but at the cost of an elision of the aphrodisia, one sees, 
in Plutarch, a new stylistics of love being formed. It is monistic 
in that it includes the aphrodisia, but it makes this inclusion 
a criterion allowing it to keep only conjugal love and to ex¬ 
clude relations with boys because of the deficiency that char¬ 
acterizes them. There can no longer be a place for them in this 
great unitary and integrative chain in which love is revitalized 
by the reciprocity of pleasure.

The Affairs of the Heart, attributed to Lucian, is manifestly 
a later text.* It is presented in the quite customary form of in¬ 
terlocking dialogues. Theomnestus, whose loves—for women 
or for boys—reappear more numerous than the heads of 
Hydra, almost before they have ended, complains of Aphro¬ 
dite. From the time when as a child he became an ephebe, the 
wrath of the goddess has been pursuing him. And yet, he is 
not a child of the Sun, nor does he have the boorish contempt 
of Hippolytus. He feels equally inclined toward both kinds of 
love, without managing to decide which of the two is more 
deserving of his attention. He asks Lycinus—who is not 
affected by either of these two passions—to serve as an impar¬
