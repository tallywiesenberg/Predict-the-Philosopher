tial judge and to tell him which is the better choice. Fortu¬ 
nately, Lycinus has preserved, as if engraved in his memory, 
the dialogue of two men on this very subject. One of them 
loved only boys, considering the female Aphrodite to be only 
“an abyss.” The other was passionately fond of women. So he 
will relate their discussion. But Theomnestus should make no 
mistake—he was able, for his part, to pose the question in jest; 
Charicles and Callicratidas, whose views are about to be 
heard, spoke very seriously indeed. 

Needless to say, this last piece of information is not to be 
taken at face value. The two adversaries are certainly serious,

it is from the second century . 1

The Care of the Self 


but Pseudo-Lucian is being ironic when he writes the em¬ 
phatic and weighty demonstrations he attributes to them. 
There is an element of pastiche in these pieces of bravura. 
Taken together, they constitute the typical discourse of the 
Advocate of Women and the Devotee of Boys. Traditional 
arguments, obligatory quotations, references to great philo¬ 
sophical ideas, rhetorical flourishes—the author smiles in re¬ 
porting the speeches of these imperturbable disputants. And, 
from this point of view, it should be noted that the pederastic 
discourse is much more ponderous, pretentious, and “ba¬ 
roque” than the one spoken in favor of women, which is 
plainer, more Stoicizing. The final irony—Theomnestus will 
observe that what it all comes down to is just a matter of 
kisses, caresses, and hands that wander beneath tunics—will 
be mainly at the expense of the eulogy of the love of boys. But 
this very irony indicates the seriousness of the problem that 
is raised. And whatever enjoyment Pseudo-Lucian may have 
had in sketching the “theoretical-discursive” portrait of these 
two devotees—their rhetorical profile, in rather heavy strokes 
—one can see in it a contemporary example, displaying the 
most prominent features, of that “contest of loves” which had 
such a long career in Hellenic culture.
