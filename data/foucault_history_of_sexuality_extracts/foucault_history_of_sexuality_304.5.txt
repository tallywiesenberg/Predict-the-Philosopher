There is something surprising at the beginning of the dia¬ 
logue reported by Lycinus in order to enlighten his friend who 
is undecided between the two loves: this dialogue, which will 
be concluded (not without some ambiguity) in favor of the 
love of boys, is not placed under the sign of Eros, who is 
regarded as the guardian of this form of attachment, but under 
that of Aphrodite. The scene that Lycinus is supposed to recall 
in its smallest details unfolds at Cnidus, near the temple of 
the goddess, where the famous statue sculpted by Praxiteles 
stands. This does not, however, prevent the advocate of boys 
from invoking Eros, as tradition demands, in the course of the 
dialogue: Eros, “the heavenly spirit,” “hierophant of the mys¬ 
teries of Love.” As for the one who speaks for female plea¬ 
sures, it is naturally to Aphrodite that he will appeal for 
support. The fact that the goddess of Cnidus may be said to

preside over this debate where she is made to vie with Eros, 
her traditional partner-adversary, is easily explained. The rea¬ 
son is that the problem of physical pleasure traverses the entire 
dialogue. This is what the perplexity expressed by Theomnes- 
tus, equally susceptible to the charm of girls and the beauty 
of boys, is about; it is a question of the aphrodisia. It is 
physical pleasure that will have the last word and dismiss the 
prudish speeches with a peal of laughter. And it is physical 
pleasure that serves as a pretext for the debate between Chari- 
cles and Callicratidas—in the form of a meaningful anecdote: 
a young man, enamored of the marble by Praxiteles, had let 
himself be locked in the temple at night, and he had sullied 
the statue, but as if it had been a boy. 2 The telling of this story 
—a very traditional one—occasions the debate. Since the sac¬ 
rilegious act was addressed to Aphrodite, was it an homage to 
the goddess who presides over female pleasures? But given the 
form in which it was carried out, was it not a testimonial 
against that particular Aphrodite? An ambiguous act. Should 
this impious homage, this profanatory reverence, be ac¬ 
counted to the love of women, or of boys? 

And the question that runs through the whole dialogue, 
even if it appears forgotten in the most ethereal statements, 
will be this: What place, what form, should be given to sexual 
pleasure in the two loves? The answer to this question will 
serve as a discriminant, offering to the love of boys, in the
