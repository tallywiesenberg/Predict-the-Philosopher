heaven of philosophy, a moment’s victory, which the irony of 
reality will soon compromise. 

The debate has a rigid composition. Each of the two orators 
speaks in turn, and pleads, in a continuous discourse, the 
cause of the love he prefers. A silent witness (Lycinus) will 
judge the contest and determine the winner. Although the 
“boy-favoring” discourse of Callicratidas is longer and more 
ornate than that of Charicles, the two speeches have the same 
structure. The arguments are arranged in the same order and 
in such a way that one corresponds exactly to the other. Both 
discourses comprise two parts. The first replies to the ques¬ 
tion: What of the nature of the love being considered, what of

its origin and its place in the natural order? The second replies 
to the question: What of the pleasure that one enjoys in this 
love, or in the other? What should its form be, and what value 
might it have? Rather than follow each of the two expositions 
in its continuity, we shall examine these two questions in turn 
in order to see how the partisan of the love of women and the 
advocate of the love of boys reply to them, each in his own 
way. 

1. The “pro-women” discourse of Charicles is based on a 
conception of the world that is doubtless Stoic in tone. 3 * Na¬ 
ture is defined as the power that, by blending the elements, 
brought life to everything by giving it a soul. It was she as well, 
Charicles continues, repeating a familiar lesson in well-known 
words, who provided for the succession of the generations. 5 
Knowing very well that living beings were made “from perish¬ 
able matter,” and since the time allotted to each being was 
brief, she contrived (emechanesato) things in such a way that 
the death of one would be the birth of another. Thus, through 
the process of succession, we can live forever. To accomplish 
this, she also contrived the division of the sexes, one being 
designed to ejaculate semen, the other to receive it. And she 
imbued each with an appetite (pothos) for the other. From the 
intercourse of these two sexes can come the succession of the 
generations, but never from the intercourse between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex. In this way Charicles anchors the 
proper nature of each sex, and the pleasure that befits each, 
firmly in the order of the universe, where death, generation, 
and eternity are interconnected. The “female” must not be¬ 
come unnaturally male, nor “the male be unbecomingly soft.” 
By defying this determination, one not only transgresses the 
proper attributes of the individual, one interferes with the 
concatenation of universal necessity. 

The second criterion of naturalness used in Charicles’ dis¬ 
course is the state of mankind at its beginnings. 6 A closeness

passage. R. Bloch notes the presence of neo-Pythagorean themes in it . 4

to the gods through virtue, a desire to behave heroically, 
marriage at a suitable age, and a noble progeny: these were the 
four traits that characterized that lofty existence and ensured 
its accord with nature. Then came the fall, which was gradual. 
It seems that Charicles distinguishes, as stages in this degener¬ 
ation, the time when, pleasure leading humans to the depths, 
people sought “strange and extraordinary paths to enjoy¬ 
ment” (Should this be taken to mean non procreative forms of 
sexual relations or pleasures alien to marriage?), then the time 
when they came to “transgress the laws of Nature herself,” a 
bold development whose basic form—the only one in any case 
which is mentioned in the text—consists in treating a man like 
a woman. Now, in order for an act so alien to Nature to be 
possible, it was necessary that what enables one to do violence 
and to deceive—tyrannical power and the art of persuasion— 
be brought into relations between men. 

Charicles finds the third mark of naturalness in the animal 
world 7 —“the laws of nature” rule over them without restric¬ 
tion or division: neither lions, nor bulls, nor rams, nor boars, 
nor wolves, nor fish seek out their own sex. For them, “the 
decisions of Providence are unchangeable.” To this chaste 
animality, Pseudo-Lucian’s orator opposes the “perverse bes¬ 
tiality” of men, which makes them lower than other creatures 
whereas they were meant to be superior to the highest of them. 
Several significant terms are employed in Charicles’ speech to 
characterize this “bestiality” on the part of men: passion, but 
also “strange infection,” “blind insensibility” (anaisthesia), 
inability to hit the mark, so that they neglect what should be 
pursued and pursue what should be left alone. In contrast to
