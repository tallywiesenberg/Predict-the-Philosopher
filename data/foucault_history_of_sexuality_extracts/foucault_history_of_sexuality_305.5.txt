and eternity are interconnected. The “female” must not be¬ 
come unnaturally male, nor “the male be unbecomingly soft.” 
By defying this determination, one not only transgresses the 
proper attributes of the individual, one interferes with the 
concatenation of universal necessity. 

The second criterion of naturalness used in Charicles’ dis¬ 
course is the state of mankind at its beginnings. 6 A closeness

to the gods through virtue, a desire to behave heroically, 
marriage at a suitable age, and a noble progeny: these were the 
four traits that characterized that lofty existence and ensured 
its accord with nature. Then came the fall, which was gradual. 
It seems that Charicles distinguishes, as stages in this degener¬ 
ation, the time when, pleasure leading humans to the depths, 
people sought “strange and extraordinary paths to enjoy¬ 
ment” (Should this be taken to mean non procreative forms of 
sexual relations or pleasures alien to marriage?), then the time 
when they came to “transgress the laws of Nature herself,” a 
bold development whose basic form—the only one in any case 
which is mentioned in the text—consists in treating a man like 
a woman. Now, in order for an act so alien to Nature to be 
possible, it was necessary that what enables one to do violence 
and to deceive—tyrannical power and the art of persuasion— 
be brought into relations between men. 

Charicles finds the third mark of naturalness in the animal 
world 7 —“the laws of nature” rule over them without restric¬ 
tion or division: neither lions, nor bulls, nor rams, nor boars, 
nor wolves, nor fish seek out their own sex. For them, “the 
decisions of Providence are unchangeable.” To this chaste 
animality, Pseudo-Lucian’s orator opposes the “perverse bes¬ 
tiality” of men, which makes them lower than other creatures 
whereas they were meant to be superior to the highest of them. 
Several significant terms are employed in Charicles’ speech to 
characterize this “bestiality” on the part of men: passion, but 
also “strange infection,” “blind insensibility” (anaisthesia), 
inability to hit the mark, so that they neglect what should be 
pursued and pursue what should be left alone. In contrast to
