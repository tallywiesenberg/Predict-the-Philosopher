the conduct of the animals, who obey the law and aim for the 
goal that is assigned to them, men who have sex with men 
evince all the signs traditionally ascribed to the passional state: 
uncontrolled violence, a sickly condition, blindness to the real¬ 
ity of things, an incapacity for attaining the goals set for 
human nature. 

In sum, the love of boys is placed in turn on the three axes 
of nature, as the general order of the world, the original state

of mankind, and a behavior that is reasonably adapted to 
natural ends. It disturbs the orderly progression of things; 
it gives rise to violent and deceitful conduct. Finally, it is 
pernicious from the standpoint of human objectives. Cosmo- 
logically, “politically,” and morally, this type of relation 
transgresses nature. 

In the part of his discourse that replies to these assertions, 
Callicratidas does not so much advance arguments that refute 
his adversary, as put forward a different conception of the 
world, the human race, its history, and the noblest ties that 
can connect men to each other. To the idea of nature as a 
provident “mechanic” who, by means of sex, arranged for 
procreation and the succession of generations so as to give the 
human race an eternity that individuals are denied, he opposes 
the vision of a world formed out of chaos. It was the demiurgic 
Eros who conquered this primeval disorder by creating all 
things that have a soul and all that do not, by instilling the 
principle of harmony in the body of men, and by attaching 
them to one another through “the holy sentiment of friend¬ 
ship.” Charicles saw, in relations between men and woman, an 
artful Nature who established temporal succession in order to 
circumvent death. Callicratidas recognizes, in the love of boys, 
the strength of the bond that, by attaching and combining, 
triumphs over chaos. 8 

From this perspective, the history of the world should not 
be read as an early disregard for the laws of nature and a 
plunge into “the depths of pleasure,” but rather as a gradual 
release from the primary necessities. 9 In the beginning, man 
was pressed by needs. The arts and skills (technai and epis- 
temai) made it possible for him to escape from these pressures 
and to provide for himself in a better fashion. People learned 
to weave garments and build houses. Now, as the weaver’s art 
is to the use of animal skins, and as the builder’s art is to caves 
for shelter, the love of boys is to intercourse with women. The 
latter, in early times, was necessary in order that the race 
might not disappear. The love of boys, on the other hand, 
came into existence very late, not, as Charicles maintained,

because there was a degeneration, but because, on the con¬ 
trary, there was an elevation toward more curiosity and 
knowledge. Indeed, when men, after having learned so many 
useful skills, began to “leave nothing unexplored,” philosophy 
appeared and with it pederasty. Pseudo-Lucian’s orator does 
not really explain this twin birth, but his speech contains 
enough familiar references so that it would have been readily 
understandable to any reader. It rests implicitly on the opposi¬ 
tion between the imparting of life through intercourse with the 
other sex and the imparting of “techniques” and “knowl¬ 
edges” through teaching, learning, and the relationship of 
disciple with master. When, emerging from the particular arts, 
philosophy began to inquire concerning all things, it found, as 
a means of transmitting the wisdom it obtains, the love of boys 
—which is also the love of noble souls, capable of virtue. One 
understands, then, how Callicratidas can reply with laughter 
to the animal lesson presented by his adversary: 10 What ex¬ 
actly is proved by the fact that lions do not love the males of 
their species, and that he-bears are not enamored of he-bears? 
Not that men have corrupted a nature that remains intact 
among the animals, but that animals do not know what it 
means to “philosophize,” and they are ignorant of the beauty 
that friendship can produce. 

The arguments of Callicratidas are evidently no more origi¬ 
nal than those of Charicles. Commonplaces of a vulgarized 
Stoicism, on the one hand, and a mixture of Platonic and 
Epicurean elements on the other?* No doubt. One cannot help 
but recognize, in this comparison of the two loves, an excuse 
for oratorical variations on the texture of traditional argu¬ 
ments. The banality (nicely embellished in places) of Chari¬ 
cles’ and Callicratidas’ explanations shows rather clearly that 
they were meant to function as philosophical escutcheons: the 
enthusiast of boys, on the Platonizing side, under the colors
