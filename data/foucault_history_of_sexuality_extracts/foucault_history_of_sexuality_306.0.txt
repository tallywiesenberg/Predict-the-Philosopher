the conduct of the animals, who obey the law and aim for the 
goal that is assigned to them, men who have sex with men 
evince all the signs traditionally ascribed to the passional state: 
uncontrolled violence, a sickly condition, blindness to the real¬ 
ity of things, an incapacity for attaining the goals set for 
human nature. 

In sum, the love of boys is placed in turn on the three axes 
of nature, as the general order of the world, the original state

of mankind, and a behavior that is reasonably adapted to 
natural ends. It disturbs the orderly progression of things; 
it gives rise to violent and deceitful conduct. Finally, it is 
pernicious from the standpoint of human objectives. Cosmo- 
logically, “politically,” and morally, this type of relation 
transgresses nature. 

In the part of his discourse that replies to these assertions, 
Callicratidas does not so much advance arguments that refute 
his adversary, as put forward a different conception of the 
world, the human race, its history, and the noblest ties that 
can connect men to each other. To the idea of nature as a 
provident “mechanic” who, by means of sex, arranged for 
procreation and the succession of generations so as to give the 
human race an eternity that individuals are denied, he opposes 
the vision of a world formed out of chaos. It was the demiurgic 
Eros who conquered this primeval disorder by creating all 
things that have a soul and all that do not, by instilling the 
principle of harmony in the body of men, and by attaching 
them to one another through “the holy sentiment of friend¬ 
ship.” Charicles saw, in relations between men and woman, an 
artful Nature who established temporal succession in order to 
circumvent death. Callicratidas recognizes, in the love of boys, 
the strength of the bond that, by attaching and combining, 
triumphs over chaos. 8 

From this perspective, the history of the world should not 
be read as an early disregard for the laws of nature and a 
plunge into “the depths of pleasure,” but rather as a gradual 
release from the primary necessities. 9 In the beginning, man 
was pressed by needs. The arts and skills (technai and epis- 
temai) made it possible for him to escape from these pressures
