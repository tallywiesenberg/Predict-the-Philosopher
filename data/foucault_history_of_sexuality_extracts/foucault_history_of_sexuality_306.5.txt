and to provide for himself in a better fashion. People learned 
to weave garments and build houses. Now, as the weaver’s art 
is to the use of animal skins, and as the builder’s art is to caves 
for shelter, the love of boys is to intercourse with women. The 
latter, in early times, was necessary in order that the race 
might not disappear. The love of boys, on the other hand, 
came into existence very late, not, as Charicles maintained,

because there was a degeneration, but because, on the con¬ 
trary, there was an elevation toward more curiosity and 
knowledge. Indeed, when men, after having learned so many 
useful skills, began to “leave nothing unexplored,” philosophy 
appeared and with it pederasty. Pseudo-Lucian’s orator does 
not really explain this twin birth, but his speech contains 
enough familiar references so that it would have been readily 
understandable to any reader. It rests implicitly on the opposi¬ 
tion between the imparting of life through intercourse with the 
other sex and the imparting of “techniques” and “knowl¬ 
edges” through teaching, learning, and the relationship of 
disciple with master. When, emerging from the particular arts, 
philosophy began to inquire concerning all things, it found, as 
a means of transmitting the wisdom it obtains, the love of boys 
—which is also the love of noble souls, capable of virtue. One 
understands, then, how Callicratidas can reply with laughter 
to the animal lesson presented by his adversary: 10 What ex¬ 
actly is proved by the fact that lions do not love the males of 
their species, and that he-bears are not enamored of he-bears? 
Not that men have corrupted a nature that remains intact 
among the animals, but that animals do not know what it 
means to “philosophize,” and they are ignorant of the beauty 
that friendship can produce. 

The arguments of Callicratidas are evidently no more origi¬ 
nal than those of Charicles. Commonplaces of a vulgarized 
Stoicism, on the one hand, and a mixture of Platonic and 
Epicurean elements on the other?* No doubt. One cannot help 
but recognize, in this comparison of the two loves, an excuse 
for oratorical variations on the texture of traditional argu¬ 
ments. The banality (nicely embellished in places) of Chari¬ 
cles’ and Callicratidas’ explanations shows rather clearly that 
they were meant to function as philosophical escutcheons: the 
enthusiast of boys, on the Platonizing side, under the colors
