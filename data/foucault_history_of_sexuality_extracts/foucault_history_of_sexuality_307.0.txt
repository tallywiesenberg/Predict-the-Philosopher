The Care of the Self 


the exacting sign of Nature. Which does not mean, obviously, 
that the Stoics condemned a pederasty that Platonism justified 
while rejecting marriage. We know that, from the viewpoint 
of doctrines, this is not the way things were—or in any case, 
things were far from being so simple. But one cannot fail to 
notice, in the documents we have, the presence of what might 
be called “a privileged association.” We have seen in the 
preceding part that the art of conjugal life was understood 
largely in terms of a Stoic mode of reflection, and in reference 
to a certain conception of nature, of its basic necessities, of the 
place and function ordained by it for all beings, of a general 
scheme of successive procreations, and of a state of original 
perfection from which the human race was estranged owing 
to a perverse decadence. Moreover, it is from a similar concep¬ 
tion that Christianity will amply draw when it decides to 
construct an ethics of the marital relationship. In the same 
way, the love of boys, practiced as a way of life, consolidated 
and reproduced for centuries a rather different theoretical 
landscape: a cosmic and individual force of love, an upward 
movement that enables man to escape from immediate neces¬ 
sities, the acquisition and transmission of knowledge through 
the intense forms and secret ties of friendship. The debate 
between the love of women and the love of boys is more than 
a literary joust. It is not, however, the conflict of two forms 
of sexual desire struggling for supremacy or for their respec¬ 
tive right to expression. It is the confrontation of two forms 
of life, of two ways of stylizing one’s pleasure, and of the two 
philosophical discourses that accompany these choices. 

2. After the theme of “nature,” both of these discourses— 
that of Charicles and that of Callicratidas—develop the ques¬ 
tion of pleasure. A question that, as we have seen, always 
constitutes a difficult point for a pederastic practice that is 
reflected in the form of friendship, affection, and the beneficial 
action of one soul on another. To speak of “pleasure” to the 
lover of boys is already to raise an objection. This is clearly
