The Care of the Self 


the exacting sign of Nature. Which does not mean, obviously, 
that the Stoics condemned a pederasty that Platonism justified 
while rejecting marriage. We know that, from the viewpoint 
of doctrines, this is not the way things were—or in any case, 
things were far from being so simple. But one cannot fail to 
notice, in the documents we have, the presence of what might 
be called “a privileged association.” We have seen in the 
preceding part that the art of conjugal life was understood 
largely in terms of a Stoic mode of reflection, and in reference 
to a certain conception of nature, of its basic necessities, of the 
place and function ordained by it for all beings, of a general 
scheme of successive procreations, and of a state of original 
perfection from which the human race was estranged owing 
to a perverse decadence. Moreover, it is from a similar concep¬ 
tion that Christianity will amply draw when it decides to 
construct an ethics of the marital relationship. In the same 
way, the love of boys, practiced as a way of life, consolidated 
and reproduced for centuries a rather different theoretical 
landscape: a cosmic and individual force of love, an upward 
movement that enables man to escape from immediate neces¬ 
sities, the acquisition and transmission of knowledge through 
the intense forms and secret ties of friendship. The debate 
between the love of women and the love of boys is more than 
a literary joust. It is not, however, the conflict of two forms 
of sexual desire struggling for supremacy or for their respec¬ 
tive right to expression. It is the confrontation of two forms 
of life, of two ways of stylizing one’s pleasure, and of the two 
philosophical discourses that accompany these choices. 

2. After the theme of “nature,” both of these discourses— 
that of Charicles and that of Callicratidas—develop the ques¬ 
tion of pleasure. A question that, as we have seen, always 
constitutes a difficult point for a pederastic practice that is 
reflected in the form of friendship, affection, and the beneficial 
action of one soul on another. To speak of “pleasure” to the 
lover of boys is already to raise an objection. This is clearly 
how Charicles understands the matter. He begins the debate

on this theme with a traditional denunciation of pederastic 
hypocrisy: You pretend to be disciples of Socrates who are not 
enamored of bodies but of souls. How is it then that you do 
not pursue old men full of wisdom, but rather children, who 
are unable to reason? If it’s a matter of virtue, why love, as 
Plato did, a Phaedrus who betrayed Lysias, or, as Socrates did, 
an impious Alcibiades, an enemy of his country, eager to 
become a tyrant? One would do well, therefore, despite the 
claims of this love of souls, “to descend,” along with Chari- 
cles, to the question of pleasure, and to compare “the practice 
of boys” with the “practice of women.” 

Among the arguments that Charicles employs to differenti¬ 
ate between these two “practices” and the place that pleasure 
occupies in each, the first is that of age and transience. 12 Until 
the threshold of old age, a woman preserves her charms—even 
if she must lend them the support of her long experience. A 
boy, for his part, is agreeable only for a moment. And Chari¬ 
cles contrasts the body of a woman—who, with her ringlets 
of hair, her skin always smooth and “not a hair growing on 
it,” remains an object of desire—with the body of a boy, which 
very soon becomes hairy and muscled. But from this differ¬ 
ence, Charicles does not conclude, as is often done, that one 
can love a boy only for a very short time, and that one is very 
soon led to abandon him. Rather, he evokes the man who goes 
on loving a boy past twenty. What he pursues in this case is 
an “equivocal Aphrodite,” a love in which he plays the passive 
part. The physical modification of boys is here invoked as a 
cause not of the transience of feelings but of an inversion of 
sexual roles. 

A second reason in favor of the “female practice” is reci¬ 
procity. 13 This is doubtless the most interesting part of Chari¬ 
cles’ discourse. He first refers to the princple that man, a 
rational being, is not made to live alone. From this he does not, 
however, deduce the necessity of having a family or of belong¬ 
ing to a city, but the impossibility of “passing one’s time” all 
alone and the need for a “community of affection” (philetairos 
koindnia), which makes good things more pleasant and pain-
