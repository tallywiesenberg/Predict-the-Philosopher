on this theme with a traditional denunciation of pederastic 
hypocrisy: You pretend to be disciples of Socrates who are not 
enamored of bodies but of souls. How is it then that you do 
not pursue old men full of wisdom, but rather children, who 
are unable to reason? If it’s a matter of virtue, why love, as 
Plato did, a Phaedrus who betrayed Lysias, or, as Socrates did, 
an impious Alcibiades, an enemy of his country, eager to 
become a tyrant? One would do well, therefore, despite the 
claims of this love of souls, “to descend,” along with Chari- 
cles, to the question of pleasure, and to compare “the practice 
of boys” with the “practice of women.” 

Among the arguments that Charicles employs to differenti¬ 
ate between these two “practices” and the place that pleasure 
occupies in each, the first is that of age and transience. 12 Until 
the threshold of old age, a woman preserves her charms—even 
if she must lend them the support of her long experience. A 
boy, for his part, is agreeable only for a moment. And Chari¬ 
cles contrasts the body of a woman—who, with her ringlets 
of hair, her skin always smooth and “not a hair growing on 
it,” remains an object of desire—with the body of a boy, which 
very soon becomes hairy and muscled. But from this differ¬ 
ence, Charicles does not conclude, as is often done, that one 
can love a boy only for a very short time, and that one is very 
soon led to abandon him. Rather, he evokes the man who goes 
on loving a boy past twenty. What he pursues in this case is 
an “equivocal Aphrodite,” a love in which he plays the passive 
part. The physical modification of boys is here invoked as a 
cause not of the transience of feelings but of an inversion of 
sexual roles. 

A second reason in favor of the “female practice” is reci¬ 
procity. 13 This is doubtless the most interesting part of Chari¬ 
cles’ discourse. He first refers to the princple that man, a 
rational being, is not made to live alone. From this he does not, 
however, deduce the necessity of having a family or of belong¬ 
ing to a city, but the impossibility of “passing one’s time” all 
alone and the need for a “community of affection” (philetairos 
koindnia), which makes good things more pleasant and pain-
