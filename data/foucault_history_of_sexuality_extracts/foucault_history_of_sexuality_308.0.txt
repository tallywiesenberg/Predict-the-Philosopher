The Care of the Self 


ful things more bearable. That the shared life has this role is 
an idea that is regularly found in the Stoic treatises on mar¬ 
riage. Here it is applied to the specific domain of physical 
pleasures. Charicles first evokes the meals and banquets that 
one enjoys with others, because, according to him, shared 
pleasures are made more intense. Then he speaks of the sexual 
pleasures. According to the traditional assertion, the boy who 
is passive, hence more or less violated (hubrismenos), cannot 
experience pleasure; no one “could be so mad” as to state the 
contrary. When he no longer cries and suffers, the other 
becomes a nuisance to him. The lover of a boy takes his 
pleasure and leaves; he gives none in return. With women, 
things are completely different. Charicles first states the fact, 
then the rule. In sexual intercourse with a woman, there is, he 
affirms, “an equal exchange of enjoyment”; and the two part¬ 
ners separate after having given each other an equal amount 
of pleasure. To this fact of nature corresponds a principle of 
conduct: it is good not to seek a selfish enjoyment (philautos 
apolausai), not to try and have all the pleasure oneself, but to 
share it by supplying the other with as much of it as one 
experiences. To be sure, this reciprocity of pleasure is already 
a well-known theme, which amatory or erotic literature has 
used quite often. But it is interesting to see it used here at the 
same time to give a “natural” characterization of intercourse 
with women, to define a rule of behavior in the practice of the 
aphrodisia, and to designate what there might be that is non¬ 
natural, violent, hence unjust and bad, in the intercourse of a 
man with a boy. Reciprocity of pleasure in an exchange where 
one shows concern for the other’s enjoyment, while observing 
as strict an equality as possible of the two partners, inscribes 
within sexual practice an ethics that extends the ethics of 
communal existence. 

To this serious bit of reasoning, Charicles adds two argu¬ 
ments that are less so, although they both relate to the ex¬ 
change of pleasures. One refers to a theme that was common 
in erotic literature: women, for anyone who knows how to use 
them, are capable of offering all the pleasures that boys can
