The Care of the Self 


ful things more bearable. That the shared life has this role is 
an idea that is regularly found in the Stoic treatises on mar¬ 
riage. Here it is applied to the specific domain of physical 
pleasures. Charicles first evokes the meals and banquets that 
one enjoys with others, because, according to him, shared 
pleasures are made more intense. Then he speaks of the sexual 
pleasures. According to the traditional assertion, the boy who 
is passive, hence more or less violated (hubrismenos), cannot 
experience pleasure; no one “could be so mad” as to state the 
contrary. When he no longer cries and suffers, the other 
becomes a nuisance to him. The lover of a boy takes his 
pleasure and leaves; he gives none in return. With women, 
things are completely different. Charicles first states the fact, 
then the rule. In sexual intercourse with a woman, there is, he 
affirms, “an equal exchange of enjoyment”; and the two part¬ 
ners separate after having given each other an equal amount 
of pleasure. To this fact of nature corresponds a principle of 
conduct: it is good not to seek a selfish enjoyment (philautos 
apolausai), not to try and have all the pleasure oneself, but to 
share it by supplying the other with as much of it as one 
experiences. To be sure, this reciprocity of pleasure is already 
a well-known theme, which amatory or erotic literature has 
used quite often. But it is interesting to see it used here at the 
same time to give a “natural” characterization of intercourse 
with women, to define a rule of behavior in the practice of the 
aphrodisia, and to designate what there might be that is non¬ 
natural, violent, hence unjust and bad, in the intercourse of a 
man with a boy. Reciprocity of pleasure in an exchange where 
one shows concern for the other’s enjoyment, while observing 
as strict an equality as possible of the two partners, inscribes 
within sexual practice an ethics that extends the ethics of 
communal existence. 

To this serious bit of reasoning, Charicles adds two argu¬ 
ments that are less so, although they both relate to the ex¬ 
change of pleasures. One refers to a theme that was common 
in erotic literature: women, for anyone who knows how to use 
them, are capable of offering all the pleasures that boys can

give, but the latter cannot provide the pleasure that is held 
exclusively by the female sex. 14 Women are thus capable of 
giving all the forms of sensual delight, including those most 
pleasing to the lovers of boys. According to the other argu¬ 
ment, if one finds love between men acceptable, one should 
also accept intercourse between women. 15 This polemical sym¬ 
metry invoked here between intermale relations and inter¬ 
female relations is interesting: first, because it denies, as does 
the second part of Charicles’ discourse, the cultural, moral, 
affective, and sexual specificity of the love of boys, bringing 
it back into the general category of relations between male 
individuals; second, because, in order to compromise the 
latter, it uses the traditionally more scandalous love—one is 
“ashamed” even to talk about it—between women; and third, 
because Charicles, reversing this hierarchy, suggests that it is 
even more shameful for a man to be passive like a woman than 
for a woman to take the male role.* 

The part of Callicratidas’ discourse that replies to this criti¬ 
cism is by far the longest. Even more so than in the rest of the 
debate, the characteristic features of a “piece of rhetoric” are 
visible here. Engaging, apropos of sexual pleasure, the most 
problematic element of the love of boys, the pederastic ar- 
gumentarium is fully deployed, with all its resources and its 
most noble references. But they are brought into play in re¬ 
sponse to the question that Charicles has stated very clearly: 
the reciprocity of pleasure. On this point both adversaries 
refer to a simple and coherent conception: for Charicles, and 
the “adherents of female love,” it is the fact of being able to 
occasion the other’s pleasure, to be attentive to it, and to take 
pleasure in it oneself—it is this charis, as Plutarch says,f that 
legitimates pleasure in intercourse between a man and a 
woman, and allows it to be integrated into Eros; it is the 
absence of charis, on the other hand, that marks and dis¬ 
qualifies intercourse with boys. As the tradition of this other 

•Is it not better that a woman should play the role of a man “than that the nobility 
of the male sex should become effeminate and play the part of a woman”? 16 
tCharicles does not himself use this word.
