give, but the latter cannot provide the pleasure that is held 
exclusively by the female sex. 14 Women are thus capable of 
giving all the forms of sensual delight, including those most 
pleasing to the lovers of boys. According to the other argu¬ 
ment, if one finds love between men acceptable, one should 
also accept intercourse between women. 15 This polemical sym¬ 
metry invoked here between intermale relations and inter¬ 
female relations is interesting: first, because it denies, as does 
the second part of Charicles’ discourse, the cultural, moral, 
affective, and sexual specificity of the love of boys, bringing 
it back into the general category of relations between male 
individuals; second, because, in order to compromise the 
latter, it uses the traditionally more scandalous love—one is 
“ashamed” even to talk about it—between women; and third, 
because Charicles, reversing this hierarchy, suggests that it is 
even more shameful for a man to be passive like a woman than 
for a woman to take the male role.* 

The part of Callicratidas’ discourse that replies to this criti¬ 
cism is by far the longest. Even more so than in the rest of the 
debate, the characteristic features of a “piece of rhetoric” are 
visible here. Engaging, apropos of sexual pleasure, the most 
problematic element of the love of boys, the pederastic ar- 
gumentarium is fully deployed, with all its resources and its 
most noble references. But they are brought into play in re¬ 
sponse to the question that Charicles has stated very clearly: 
the reciprocity of pleasure. On this point both adversaries 
refer to a simple and coherent conception: for Charicles, and 
the “adherents of female love,” it is the fact of being able to 
occasion the other’s pleasure, to be attentive to it, and to take 
pleasure in it oneself—it is this charis, as Plutarch says,f that 
legitimates pleasure in intercourse between a man and a 
woman, and allows it to be integrated into Eros; it is the 
absence of charis, on the other hand, that marks and dis¬ 
qualifies intercourse with boys. As the tradition of this other 

•Is it not better that a woman should play the role of a man “than that the nobility 
of the male sex should become effeminate and play the part of a woman”? 16 
tCharicles does not himself use this word.
