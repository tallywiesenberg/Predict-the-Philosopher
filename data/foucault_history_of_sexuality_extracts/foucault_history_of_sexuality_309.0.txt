The Care of the Self 


love prescribes, Callicratidas cites as its keystone not charis 
but arete —virtue. It is virtue that should ensure between part¬ 
ners both an honorable, wisely apportioned pleasure and the 
commonality that is indispensable to the relationship between 
two individuals. Let us say, to be brief, that to the “gracious 
reciprocity” that only pleasure with women is capable of pro¬ 
viding, according to its proponents, its adversaries oppose the 
“virtuous commonality” that is the exclusive privilege of the 
love of boys. Callicratidas’. demonstration consists first of all 
in criticizing, as illusory, that reciprocity of pleasure which 
the love of women claims as its specific trait, and in setting 
against it, as the only relationship capable of truth, the virtu¬ 
ous relationship with boys. Thus, in a single stroke, the privi¬ 
lege of reciprocal pleasure attributed to male-female relations 
will be contested, and the theme that the love of boys is 
unnatural will be turned around. 

In a display of rancor, Callicratidas reels off a series of 
commonplaces against women. 17 One only has to look closely 
to see that women are intrinsically “ugly,” “truly” (alethos) 
so: their bodies are “unshapely” and their faces are as ill- 
favored as those of monkeys. They must take great pains to 
mask this reality: makeup, fancy clothes, coiffures, jewels, 
adornments. For the benefit of spectators they give themselves 
a spurious beauty, which a careful gaze suffices to dissipate. 
And then they have a liking for secret cults, which allow them 
to envelop their debauches in mystery. There is no need to 
recall all the satirical themes that are echoed, rather flatly, by 
this passage. One could find many other examples, with simi¬ 
lar arguments, in the eulogies of pederasty. Thus Achilles 
Tatius, in Leucippe and Clitophon, has one of his characters, 
a lover of boys, say: “False are the ways of a woman, words 
and deeds alike; and although she may seem fair to behold, it 
is all the result of the laborious use of pigments, and her 
beauty is all of myrrh, hair dye and makeup; and if she is 
stripped of all these many devices, she is like the jackdaw that 
was plucked of its feathers in the fable.” 18 

A woman’s world is deceptive because it is a secret world.

The social separation between the group of men and that of 
women, their different ways of life, the careful division be¬ 
tween female activities and male activities—all this probably 
did much to heighten, in the experience of Hellenic men, this 
apprehension of women as mysterious and deceptive objects. 
One could be deceived about a woman’s body, which was 
hidden by adornments and which might be disappointing 
when it was uncovered. One was apt to suspect it of cleverly 
masked imperfections. One was afraid of discovering some 
repellent defect. The female body, with its secrecy and its 
particular characteristics, was charged with ambiguous pow¬ 
ers. Do you wish, says Ovid, to rid yourself of a passion? Look 
a little more closely at the body of your mistress. 19 * One could 
be deceived, too, regarding morals, with that secret life which 
women led, a life enclosed in disturbing mysteries. In the 
argumentation that Pseudo-Lucian attributes to Callicratidas, 
these themes have a precise significance: they enable him to 
question the principle of reciprocity of pleasure in intercourse 
with women. How could there be such a reciprocity if women 
are deceptive, if they have their own pleasure, if, unbeknown 
to men, they indulge in secret debauchery? How could there 
be a valid exchange if the pleasures their appearance lets one 
imagine are nothing but false promises? So that the objection 
usually made to intercourse with boys—that it does not ac¬ 
cord with nature—can just as easily be applied to women, even 
more seriously in their case, since by choosing to mask the 
truth of their nature, they deliberately introduce falsehood. 
The makeup argument may seem to us to carry little force in 
this debate on the two loves. For the ancients, however, it is 
based on two serious considerations: the apprehension that 
derives from the female body, and the philosophical and moral 
principle that a pleasure is legitimate only if the object that 
gives rise to it is genuine. In the pederastic argumentation, 

•Or these verses: “Open the windows wide, all of them, draw back the curtains, / Let 
the light make clear parts that are ugly to see.” After lovemaking, “note down in your 
mind her every blemish of body, / Keep your eyes on her faults, memorize every 
defect.” 20

pleasure with a woman cannot be reciprocal because it is 
accompanied by too much falseness.
