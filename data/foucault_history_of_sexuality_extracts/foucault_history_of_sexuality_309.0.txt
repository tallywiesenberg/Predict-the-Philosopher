The Care of the Self 


love prescribes, Callicratidas cites as its keystone not charis 
but arete —virtue. It is virtue that should ensure between part¬ 
ners both an honorable, wisely apportioned pleasure and the 
commonality that is indispensable to the relationship between 
two individuals. Let us say, to be brief, that to the “gracious 
reciprocity” that only pleasure with women is capable of pro¬ 
viding, according to its proponents, its adversaries oppose the 
“virtuous commonality” that is the exclusive privilege of the 
love of boys. Callicratidas’. demonstration consists first of all 
in criticizing, as illusory, that reciprocity of pleasure which 
the love of women claims as its specific trait, and in setting 
against it, as the only relationship capable of truth, the virtu¬ 
ous relationship with boys. Thus, in a single stroke, the privi¬ 
lege of reciprocal pleasure attributed to male-female relations 
will be contested, and the theme that the love of boys is 
unnatural will be turned around. 

In a display of rancor, Callicratidas reels off a series of 
commonplaces against women. 17 One only has to look closely 
to see that women are intrinsically “ugly,” “truly” (alethos) 
so: their bodies are “unshapely” and their faces are as ill- 
favored as those of monkeys. They must take great pains to 
mask this reality: makeup, fancy clothes, coiffures, jewels, 
adornments. For the benefit of spectators they give themselves 
a spurious beauty, which a careful gaze suffices to dissipate. 
And then they have a liking for secret cults, which allow them 
to envelop their debauches in mystery. There is no need to 
recall all the satirical themes that are echoed, rather flatly, by 
this passage. One could find many other examples, with simi¬ 
lar arguments, in the eulogies of pederasty. Thus Achilles 
Tatius, in Leucippe and Clitophon, has one of his characters, 
a lover of boys, say: “False are the ways of a woman, words 
and deeds alike; and although she may seem fair to behold, it 
is all the result of the laborious use of pigments, and her 
beauty is all of myrrh, hair dye and makeup; and if she is 
stripped of all these many devices, she is like the jackdaw that 
was plucked of its feathers in the fable.” 18 

A woman’s world is deceptive because it is a secret world.
