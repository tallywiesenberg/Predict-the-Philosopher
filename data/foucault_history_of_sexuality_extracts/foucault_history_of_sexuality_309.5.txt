The social separation between the group of men and that of 
women, their different ways of life, the careful division be¬ 
tween female activities and male activities—all this probably 
did much to heighten, in the experience of Hellenic men, this 
apprehension of women as mysterious and deceptive objects. 
One could be deceived about a woman’s body, which was 
hidden by adornments and which might be disappointing 
when it was uncovered. One was apt to suspect it of cleverly 
masked imperfections. One was afraid of discovering some 
repellent defect. The female body, with its secrecy and its 
particular characteristics, was charged with ambiguous pow¬ 
ers. Do you wish, says Ovid, to rid yourself of a passion? Look 
a little more closely at the body of your mistress. 19 * One could 
be deceived, too, regarding morals, with that secret life which 
women led, a life enclosed in disturbing mysteries. In the 
argumentation that Pseudo-Lucian attributes to Callicratidas, 
these themes have a precise significance: they enable him to 
question the principle of reciprocity of pleasure in intercourse 
with women. How could there be such a reciprocity if women 
are deceptive, if they have their own pleasure, if, unbeknown 
to men, they indulge in secret debauchery? How could there 
be a valid exchange if the pleasures their appearance lets one 
imagine are nothing but false promises? So that the objection 
usually made to intercourse with boys—that it does not ac¬ 
cord with nature—can just as easily be applied to women, even 
more seriously in their case, since by choosing to mask the 
truth of their nature, they deliberately introduce falsehood. 
The makeup argument may seem to us to carry little force in 
this debate on the two loves. For the ancients, however, it is 
based on two serious considerations: the apprehension that 
derives from the female body, and the philosophical and moral 
principle that a pleasure is legitimate only if the object that 
gives rise to it is genuine. In the pederastic argumentation, 

•Or these verses: “Open the windows wide, all of them, draw back the curtains, / Let 
the light make clear parts that are ugly to see.” After lovemaking, “note down in your 
mind her every blemish of body, / Keep your eyes on her faults, memorize every 
defect.” 20

pleasure with a woman cannot be reciprocal because it is 
accompanied by too much falseness.
