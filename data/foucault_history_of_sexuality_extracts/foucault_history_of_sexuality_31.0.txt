offspring of an imperious and intelligible sex. Sex, the expla¬ 
nation for everything. 

It is pointless to ask: Why then is sex so secret? What is 
this force that so long reduced it to silence and has only 
recently relaxed its hold somewhat, allowing us to question 
it perhaps, but always in the context of and through its 
repression? In reality, this question, so often repeated nowa¬ 
days, is but the recent form of a considerable affirmation and

a secular prescription: there is where the truth is; go see if 
you can uncover it. Acheronto movebo: an age-old decision. 

Ye wise men, highly, deeply learned, 

Who think it out and know. 

How, when, and where do all things pair? 

Why do they kiss and love? 

Ye men of lofty wisdom, say 
What happened to me then; 

Search out and tell me where, how, when 
And why it happened thus . 1 

It is reasonable therefore to ask first of all: What is this 
injunction? Why this great chase after the truth of sex, the 
truth in sex? 

In Diderot’s tale, the good genie Cucufa discovers at the 
bottom of his pocket, in the midst of worthless things— 
consecrated seeds, little pagodas made of lead, and moldy 
sugar-coated pills—the tiny silver ring whose stone, when 
turned, makes the sexes one encounters speak. He gives it to 
the curious sultan. Our problem is to know what marvelous 
ring confers a similar power on us, and on which master’s 
finger it has been placed; what game of power it makes 
possible or presupposes, and how it is that each one of us has 
become a sort of attentive and imprudent sultan with respect 
to his own sex and that of others. It is this magical ring, this 
jewel which is so indiscreet when it comes to making others 
speak, but so ineloquent concerning one’s own mechanism, 
that we need to render loquacious in its turn; it is what we 
have to talk about. We must write the history of this will to 
truth, this petition to know that for so many centuries has 
kept us enthralled by sex: the history of a stubborn and 
relentless effort. What is it that we demand of sex, beyond 
its possible pleasures, that makes us so persistent? What is 
this patience or eagerness to constitute it as the secret, the

omnipotent cause, the hidden meaning, the unremitting fear? 
And why was the task of discovering this difficult truth 
finally turned into an invitation to eliminate taboos and 
break free of what binds us? Was the labor then so arduous 
that it had to be enchanted by this promise? Or had this 
knowledge become so costly—in political, economic, and 
ethical terms—that in order to subject everyone to its rule, 
it was necessary to assure them, paradoxically, that their 
liberation was at stake? 

In order to situate the investigations that will follow, let 
me put forward some general propositions concerning the 
objective, the method, the domain to be covered, and the 
periodizations that one can accept in a provisory way.

Why these investigations? I am well aware that an uncer¬ 
tainty runs through the sketches I have drawn thus far, one 
that threatens to invalidate the more detailed inquiries that 
I have projected. I have repeatedly stressed that the history 
of the last centuries in Western societies did not manifest the
