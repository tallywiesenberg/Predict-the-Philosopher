The point at issue is not 
the sense of measure that one brings to one’s own power, but 
the best way to measure one’s strength against the power of 
others while ensuring one’s own mastery over self.In this 
regard, a brief narration that appears in the middle of the 
speech acquires a symbolic value.It is a commonplace account 
of a chariot race, but a direct relation is established between 
the little sports drama that is reported and the public test that 
the young man undergoes in his behavior with his suitors.We 
see Epicrates driving his team (a likely reference to the Phae- 
drus)\ he is on the verge of defeat, his chariot is about to be 
smashed to pieces by an opposing team; the crowd, despite the 
taste it ordinarily has for accidents, cheers for the hero, while 
he, “stronger even than the vigor of his team, manages to win 
the victory over the most favored of his rivals.” 25 

This prosaic address to Epicrates is certainly not one of the

highest forms of Greek reflection on love.But in its very 
banality it does bring out some important aspects of “the 
Greek problem of boys.” The young man—between the end 
of childhood and the age when he attained manly status— 
constituted a delicate and difficult factor for Greek ethics and 
Greek thought.
