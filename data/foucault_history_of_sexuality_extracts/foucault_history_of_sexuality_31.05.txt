His youth with its particular beauty (to which 
every man was believed to be naturally sensitive) and the 
status that would be his (and for which, with the help and 
protection of his entourage, he must prepare himself) formed 
a “strategic” point around which a complex game was re¬ 
quired; his honor—which depended in part on the use he 
made of his body and which would also partly determine his 
future role and reputation—was an important stake in the 
game.For him, there was a test in all this, one that demanded 
diligence and training; there was also, for others, an occasion 
for care and concern.At the very end of his eulogy of Epi- 
crates, the author declares that the life of the boy, his bios, 
must be a “common” work; and, as if it were a matter of a 
work of art to be finished, he urges all who know Epicrates to 
give this future figure “the greatest possible brilliance.” 

Later, in European culture, girls or married women, with 
their behavior, their beauty, and their feelings, were to become 
themes of special concern; a new art of courting them, a 
literature that was basically romantic in form, an exacting 
morality that was attentive to the integrity of their bodies and 
the solidity of their matrimonial commitment—all this would 
draw curiosity and desires around them.No matter what 
inferior position may have been reserved for them in the fam¬ 
ily or in society, there would be an accentuation, a valoriza¬ 
tion, of the “problem” of women.Their nature, their conduct, 
the feelings they inspired or experienced, the permitted or 
forbidden relationship that one might have with them were to 
become themes of reflection, knowledge, analysis, and pre¬ 
scription.
