What this means is that sexual 
relations—always conceived in terms of the model act of pene¬ 
tration, assuming a polarity that opposed activity and passiv¬ 
ity—were seen as being of the same type as the relationship 
between a superior and a subordinate, an individual who 
dominates and one who is dominated, one who commands and 
one who complies, one who vanquishes and one who is van¬ 
quished.Pleasure practices were conceptualized using the 
same categories as those in the field of social rivalries and 
hierarchies: an analogous agonistic structure, analogous oppo¬ 
sitions and differentiations, analogous values attributed to the 
respective roles of the partners.And this suggests that in 
sexual behavior there was one role that was intrinsically hon¬ 
orable and valorized without question: the one that consisted 
in being active, in dominating, in penetrating, in asserting 
one’s superiority.This principle had several consequences relating to the sta¬
