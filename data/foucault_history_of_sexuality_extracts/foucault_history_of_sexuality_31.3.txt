And while the moral 
education of women is important, seeing that they constitute 
half the free population, that of male children is more so, for 
it concerns future citizens who will participate in the govern¬ 
ment of the city.2 We can see, therefore, that the specific 
nature of the boy’s position, the particular form of his depen¬ 
dence, and the manner in which he is to be treated, even in 
the space where the considerable power of the patriarch is 
exercised, were marked by the status that would be his in 
future years.The same held true up to a point in the game of sexual 
relations.Among the various legitimate “objects,” the boy 
occupied a special position.He was definitely not a forbidden 
object; in Athens, certain laws protected free children (from 
adults, who at least for a time did not have the right to go into 
the schools; from slaves, who incurred the death penalty if 
they tried corrupting them; and from their fathers or tutors, 
who were punished if they prostituted them); 3 but nothing 
prevented or prohibited an adolescent from being the openly 
recognized sexual partner of a man.
