* Further, he could not address the 
council or the assembly, even though he were “the most elo¬ 
quent orator in Athens.” 4 Hence this law made male prostitu¬ 
tion an instance of atimia —of public disgrace—that excluded 
a citizen from certain responsibilities.t But the way in which 
Aeschines conducts his prosecution, and tries through a 
strictly juridical discussion to compromise his adversary, 
points up the relation of incompatibility—ethical as much as 
legal—that was recognized as existing between certain sexual 
roles assumed by boys and certain social roles assumed by 
adults.Aeschines’ legal argumentation, which is based on Timar- 
chus’ “bad conduct” as alleged via rumors, gossip, and testi¬

notes that this disqualification is fictitious, a rhetorical maneuver by Aeschines.
