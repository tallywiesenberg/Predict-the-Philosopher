He describes Timarchus as a man who in the course of 
his youth placed himself and showed himself to everyone, in 
the inferior and humiliating position of a pleasure object for 
others; he wanted this role, he sought it, took pleasure in it,

his audience see as morally and politically incompatible with 
civic responsibilities and the exercise of political power.A 
man who has been marked by this role which he was pleased 
to assume in his youth would not now be able to play, without 
provoking indignation, the role of a man who is over others 
in the city, who provides them with friends, counsels them in 
their decisions, leads them and represents them.What was 
hard for Athenians to accept—and this is the feeling that 
Aeschines tries to play upon in the speech against Timarchus 
—was not that they might be governed by someone who loved 
boys, or who as a youth was loved by a man; but that they 
might come under the authority of a leader who once iden¬ 
tified with the role of pleasure object for others.It is this feeling, moreover, that Aristophanes had appealed 
to so often in his comedies; the point of mockery and the thing 
that was meant to be scandalous were that these orators, these 
leaders who were followed and loved, these citizens who
