And Aristophanes spoke ironically of an Athenian 
democracy where one’s chances of being heard in the assembly 
were greater the more one had a taste for pleasures of this 
sort .7 In the same way and the same spirit, Diogenes made fun 
of Demosthenes and the morals he had while pretending to be 
the leader (demagogos) of the Athenian people .8 When one 
played the role of subordinate partner in the game of pleasure 
relations, one could not be truly dominant in the game of civic 
and political activity.The extent to which these criticisms and satires may have 
been justified in reality matters little.There is at least one 
thing that they show clearly by their mere existence: namely, 
the difficulty caused, in this society that accepted sexual rela¬ 
tions between men, by the juxtaposition of an ethos of male 
superiority and a conception of all sexual intercourse in terms 
of the schema of penetration and male domination.
