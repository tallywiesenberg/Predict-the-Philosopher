Hence the problem that we may call the “antinomy of the 
boy” in the Greek ethics of aphrodisia.On the one hand, 
young men were recognized as objects of pleasure—and even 
as the only honorable and legitimate objects among the possi¬ 
ble male partners of men: no one would ever reproach a man 
for loving a boy, for desiring and enjoying him, provided that 
the laws and proprieties were respected.But on the other 
hand, the boy, whose youth must be a training for manhood, 
could not and must not identify with that role.He could not 
of his own accord, in his own eyes, and for his own sake, be 
that object of pleasure, even though the man was quite natu¬ 
rally fond of appointing him as an object of pleasure.In short, 
to delight in and be a subject of pleasure with a boy did not 
cause a problem for the Greeks; but to be an object of pleasure 
and to acknowledge oneself as such constituted a major diffi¬ 
culty for the boy.
