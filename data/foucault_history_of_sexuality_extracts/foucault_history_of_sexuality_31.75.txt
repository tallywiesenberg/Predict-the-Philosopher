And yet it is not unusual to find the assertion that 
relations between men, or more generally, between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex, is para physin, beside nature.Of 
course one can infer that these two views indicate two different 
attitudes, one favorable and the other hostile to that kind of

love.But the very possibility of these two opinions was proba¬ 
bly owing to the fact that while people deemed it quite natural 
that one might find pleasure with a boy, it was much harder 
to accept as natural that which made a boy an object of 
pleasure.So that one could take exception to the very act that 
was carried out between two male individuals on the grounds 
that it was para physin —because it feminized one of the part¬ 
ners, whereas the desire that one could have for beauty was 
nevertheless regarded as natural.The Cynics were not against 
the love of boys, even though they heaped sarcasm on all those 
boys whose passivity caused them to accept being estranged 
from their own nature, thus becoming “worse than they 
were.” 9 As for Plato, there is no reason to suppose that, having 
been a believer in male love as a youth, he later “got wise” to 
the extent that he condemned it as being a relationship “con¬ 
trary to nature.” It should be noted, rather, that at the begin¬ 
ning of the Lam, when he draws a contrast between relations 
with women as an element of nature and relations between 
men (or between women) as an effect of incontinence 
(akrasia), he is referring to the act of copulation itself (pro¬ 
vided for by nature for procreation) and he is thinking of 
institutions that are likely to promote or on the other hand 
pervert citizens’ morals.
