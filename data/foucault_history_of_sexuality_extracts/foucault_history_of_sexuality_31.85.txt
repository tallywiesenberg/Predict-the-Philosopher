This “denial” should be interpre¬ 
ted both as the affirmation that such a pleasure could not exist 
and as the prescription that it ought not to be experienced.Having to explain why love so often turns into hatred when 
it is mediated by physical relations, Socrates, in Xenophon’s 
Symposium, speaks of the unpleasant feelings that may arise 
in a youth because of his relationship (homilein) with an aging 
man.But he immediately adds as a general principle: “A 
youth does not share in the pleasure of the intercourse as a 
woman does, but looks on, sober, at another in love’s intoxica¬ 
tion.” 16 Between the man and the boy, there is not—there 
cannot and should not be—a community of pleasure.The 
author of the Problems admits the possibility only for a few 
individuals and only in the case of an anatomical irregularity.And no one was more severely criticized than boys who 
showed by their willingness to yield, by their many relation¬ 
ships, or by their dress, their makeup, their adornments or 
their perfumes, that they might enjoy playing that role.
