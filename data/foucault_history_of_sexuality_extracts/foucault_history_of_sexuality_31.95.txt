Sexual relations thus demanded particular behaviors on the 
part of both partners.A consequence of the fact that the boy 
could not identify with the part he had to play; he was sup¬ 
posed to refuse, resist, flee, escape.18 He was also supposed to 
make his consent, if he finally gave it, subject to conditions 
relating to the man to whom he yielded (his merit, his status, 
his virtue) and to the benefit he could expect to gain from him 
(a benefit that was rather shameful if it was only a question 
of money, but honorable if it involved training for manhood, 
social connections for the future, or a lasting friendship).And 
in fact it was benefits of this kind that the lover was supposed 
to be able to provide, in addition to the customary gifts, which 
depended more on status considerations (and whose impor¬ 
tance and value varied with the condition of the partners).So 
that the sexual act, in the relation between a man and a boy, 
needed to be taken up in a game of refusals, evasions, and 
escapes that tended to postpone it as long as possible, but also 
in a process of exchanges that determined the right time and 
the right conditions for it to take place.
