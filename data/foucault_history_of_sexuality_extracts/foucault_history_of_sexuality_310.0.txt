In contrast, pleasure with boys is placed under the sign of 
truth. 21 The beauty of a young man is real because it is uncon¬ 
trived. As Achilles Tatius has one of his characters say: “The 
beauty of a boy is not fostered by the odor of myrrh perfumes, 
nor yet by cunning and foreign unguents. And the fresh natu¬ 
ral odor of a boy has a sweeter smell than all the anointings 
and perfumery of a woman.” 22 Callicratidas contrasts the de¬ 
ceptive enticements of the female dressing table with a descrip¬ 
tion of the boy who gives no thougnt to any preparations: he 
jumps out of bed at dawn and washes with pure water. He has 
no need of a mirror, he doesn’t use a comb. He throws his 
chlamys on his shoulder and hurries off to school. At the 
palestra he exercises vigorously, works up a sweat, and bathes 
quickly. And once the lessons of wisdom he is given have been 
understood, he quickly falls asleep as a result of the day’s 
beneficial exertions. 

How could one not wish to share one’s whole life with this 
guileless boy? 23 One would like to “pass one’s time sitting 
opposite this dear friend,” enjoying his pleasant conversation, 
and “sharing every activity with him.” A sensible pleasure 
that will last not just for the fleeting time of youth. Since it 
does not take as its object the physical grace that fades away, 
it can endure all through life: old age, sickness, death, the 
tomb even, everything can be experienced in common; “to 
unite my bones with his and not to keep even our dumb ashes 
apart.” It was a traditional theme, certainly, that friendships 
could grow out of youthful love affairs and sustain life, until 
the moment of death, through a lasting manly affection. This 
passage from Pseudo-Lucian appears to be a variation on one 
of the themes developed in Xenophon’s Symposium. The ideas 
are the same, presented in an analogous order and expressed 
in similar words: the pleasure of looking at each other, the 
conversation, the sharing of feelings in success or failure, the 
care given when one of the two falls ill—in this way, affection

can reign between the two friends through to old age. 24 Pseu¬ 
do-Lucian’s text gives particular emphasis to one important 
point concerning this affection that continues after adoles¬ 
cence. It is a matter of forming a bond in which the equality 
is so perfect, or the reversibility so complete, that the role of 
the erastes and that of the eromenos can no longer be distin¬ 
guished. This is how things were, says Callicratidas, between 
Orestes and Pylades, about whom it was traditional to won¬ 
der, as in the case of Achilles and Patroclus, who was the lover 
and who the beloved. Pylades was the lover, it seems. But as 
they grew older, and when the time of trial came—the two 
friends had to decide which one would face death—the be¬ 
loved behaved as the lover. One should see a model in this. It 
is in this way, says Callicratidas, that the zealous and serious 
love one bears for a young boy (the famous spoudaios erds) 
must be transformed. It must become the manly form (an- 
drousthai) with the coming of that age when a youth is at last 
capable of reason. In this masculine affection, the one who had 
been loved “gives love in return,” and to such an extent that 
it becomes difficult to know “which of the two is the erastes 
the affection of the one who loves is returned to him by the 
beloved the way an image is reflected in a mirror. 25 

The return by the beloved of the affection he has received 
had always been a part of pederastic ethics, whether this was 
in the form of help in misfortune, care in old age, companion¬ 
ship in lif e, or unexpected sacrifice. But Pseudo-Lucian’s insis¬ 
tence on the equality of the two lovers and his use of words 
that characterize conjugal reciprocity seem to show a concern 
to adapt male love to the descriptive and prescriptive model 
of marriage. After enumerating everything that is simple, nat¬ 
ural, and free of all artifice in the body of a young man, and 
hence after establishing the “truthfulness” of the pleasure he 
is capable of providing, the author of the text relates the 
spiritual bond, not to pedagogical action, or to the formative 
effect of this attachment, but entirely to the exact reciprocity 
of an equal exchange. In proportion as the description of the

male and female bodies sets them in contrast, in this speech 
by Callicratidas, the ethics of living as a couple seems to draw 
manly affection closer to the marriage tie. 

But there is still a basic difference. For, while the love of 
boys is defined as the only love in which virtue and pleasure 
can be combined, pleasure is never designated as sexual plea¬ 
sure. There is the charm of that juvenile body, without 
makeup or deception, of that regular, disciplined life, of the
