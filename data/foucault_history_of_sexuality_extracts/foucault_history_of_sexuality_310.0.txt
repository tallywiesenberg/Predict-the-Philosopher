In contrast, pleasure with boys is placed under the sign of 
truth. 21 The beauty of a young man is real because it is uncon¬ 
trived. As Achilles Tatius has one of his characters say: “The 
beauty of a boy is not fostered by the odor of myrrh perfumes, 
nor yet by cunning and foreign unguents. And the fresh natu¬ 
ral odor of a boy has a sweeter smell than all the anointings 
and perfumery of a woman.” 22 Callicratidas contrasts the de¬ 
ceptive enticements of the female dressing table with a descrip¬ 
tion of the boy who gives no thougnt to any preparations: he 
jumps out of bed at dawn and washes with pure water. He has 
no need of a mirror, he doesn’t use a comb. He throws his 
chlamys on his shoulder and hurries off to school. At the 
palestra he exercises vigorously, works up a sweat, and bathes 
quickly. And once the lessons of wisdom he is given have been 
understood, he quickly falls asleep as a result of the day’s 
beneficial exertions. 

How could one not wish to share one’s whole life with this 
guileless boy? 23 One would like to “pass one’s time sitting 
opposite this dear friend,” enjoying his pleasant conversation, 
and “sharing every activity with him.” A sensible pleasure 
that will last not just for the fleeting time of youth. Since it 
does not take as its object the physical grace that fades away, 
it can endure all through life: old age, sickness, death, the 
tomb even, everything can be experienced in common; “to 
unite my bones with his and not to keep even our dumb ashes 
apart.” It was a traditional theme, certainly, that friendships 
could grow out of youthful love affairs and sustain life, until 
the moment of death, through a lasting manly affection. This 
passage from Pseudo-Lucian appears to be a variation on one 
of the themes developed in Xenophon’s Symposium. The ideas 
are the same, presented in an analogous order and expressed 
in similar words: the pleasure of looking at each other, the 
conversation, the sharing of feelings in success or failure, the 
care given when one of the two falls ill—in this way, affection

can reign between the two friends through to old age. 24 Pseu¬ 
do-Lucian’s text gives particular emphasis to one important 
point concerning this affection that continues after adoles¬ 
cence. It is a matter of forming a bond in which the equality 
is so perfect, or the reversibility so complete, that the role of
