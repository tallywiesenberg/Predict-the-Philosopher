the erastes and that of the eromenos can no longer be distin¬ 
guished. This is how things were, says Callicratidas, between 
Orestes and Pylades, about whom it was traditional to won¬ 
der, as in the case of Achilles and Patroclus, who was the lover 
and who the beloved. Pylades was the lover, it seems. But as 
they grew older, and when the time of trial came—the two 
friends had to decide which one would face death—the be¬ 
loved behaved as the lover. One should see a model in this. It 
is in this way, says Callicratidas, that the zealous and serious 
love one bears for a young boy (the famous spoudaios erds) 
must be transformed. It must become the manly form (an- 
drousthai) with the coming of that age when a youth is at last 
capable of reason. In this masculine affection, the one who had 
been loved “gives love in return,” and to such an extent that 
it becomes difficult to know “which of the two is the erastes 
the affection of the one who loves is returned to him by the 
beloved the way an image is reflected in a mirror. 25 

The return by the beloved of the affection he has received 
had always been a part of pederastic ethics, whether this was 
in the form of help in misfortune, care in old age, companion¬ 
ship in lif e, or unexpected sacrifice. But Pseudo-Lucian’s insis¬ 
tence on the equality of the two lovers and his use of words 
that characterize conjugal reciprocity seem to show a concern 
to adapt male love to the descriptive and prescriptive model 
of marriage. After enumerating everything that is simple, nat¬ 
ural, and free of all artifice in the body of a young man, and 
hence after establishing the “truthfulness” of the pleasure he 
is capable of providing, the author of the text relates the 
spiritual bond, not to pedagogical action, or to the formative 
effect of this attachment, but entirely to the exact reciprocity 
of an equal exchange. In proportion as the description of the

male and female bodies sets them in contrast, in this speech 
by Callicratidas, the ethics of living as a couple seems to draw 
manly affection closer to the marriage tie. 

But there is still a basic difference. For, while the love of 
boys is defined as the only love in which virtue and pleasure 
can be combined, pleasure is never designated as sexual plea¬ 
sure. There is the charm of that juvenile body, without 
makeup or deception, of that regular, disciplined life, of the
