amical conversation, of the affection that is returned—true. 
But the the text makes it quite clear: in his bed, the boy is 
“without a companion”; he looks at no one when he is on his 
way to school; in the evening, tired from his work, he goes 
right to sleep. And Callicratidas gives some unequivocal ad¬ 
vice to the lovers of such boys: Remain as chaste as Socrates 
when he slept beside Alcibiades. Approach them with temper¬ 
ance (sophronos). Don’t squander a lasting affection for the 
sake of a brief pleasure. And it is this very lesson which will 
be drawn, once the debate is concluded, when, with an ironic 
solemnity, Lycinus awards the prize; it goes to the speech that 
praised the love of boys, insofar as the latter is practiced by 
“philosophers” and insofar as it pledges itself to ties of friend¬ 
ship that are “just and undefiled.” 

The debate between Charicles and Callicratidas thus ends 
with a “victory” of the love of boys. A victory conforming to 
a traditional schema that reserves for philosophers a pederasty 
in which physical pleasure is evaded. A victory, however, that 
gives everyone not only the right but also the duty to marry 
(according to a formula we have encountered in the Stoics: 
pantapasi gameteon). This is in effect a syncretic conclusion, 
which superimposes on the universality of marriage the privi¬ 
lege of a love of boys reserved for those who, being philoso¬ 
phers, are capable of a “perfect virtue.” But one should not 
forget that this debate, whose traditional and rhetorical char¬ 
acter is emphasized in the text itself, is embedded in another 
dialogue: that of Lycinus with Theomnestus, who asks his 
opinion on which of the two loves he should choose, since he 
feels equally drawn to both. So Lycinus has just reported to

Theomnestus the “verdict” he gave to Charicles and Calli- 
cratidas. But Theomnestus immediately waxes ironic about 
the crucial point of the debate and about the deciding factor 
in the victory of pederastic love: the latter won because it was 
linked to philosophy, to virtue, and hence to the elimination 
of physical pleasure. Is one expected to believe that this is 
really the way in which one loves boys? Theomnestus does not 
become indignant, as did Charicles, at the hypocrisy of such 
a discourse. Whereas, in order to link together pleasure and 
virtue, the advocates of boys stressed the absence of any sexual 
act, he reinstates the physical contact that one enjoys, the 
kisses, the caresses, and the gratification, as the real reason for 
the existence of this love. Seriously, he says, they can’t make 
us believe that the whole pleasure of this relationship is in 
looking into each other’s eyes and in being enchanted by 
friendly conversation. Looking is agreeable, certainly, but it is 
only the first stage. After that comes touching, which thrills 
the whole body. Then kissing, which is timid at first but soon 
becomes eager. The hand does not remain idle during this 
time; it glides down under the clothing, squeezes the breasts 
for a moment, descends the length of the firm belly, reaches 
the “flower of puberty,” and finally strikes the target . 26 For 
Theomnestus, and doubtless for the author as well, this de¬ 
scription does not amount to a rejection of an inadmissible 
practice. It is a reminder that it is not possible—without re¬ 
sorting to violence—to keep the aphrodisia outside the do¬ 
main of love and its justifications. Pseudo-Lucian’s irony is not 
a way of denouncing this pleasure which one can take in boys, 
a pleasure he evokes with a smile. It is a fundamental objection 
to the very old line of argument of Greek pederasty, which, 
in order to conceptualize, formulate, and discourse about the 
latter and to supply it with reasons, was obliged to evade the 
manifest presence of physical pleasure. He does not say that 
the love of women is better. But he demonstrates the essential 
weakness of a discourse on love that makes no allowance for 
the aphrodisia and for the relations they engage.

A New Erotics 


During this period in which one notes that reflection on the 
love of boys manifests its sterility, one sees some of the ele¬ 
ments of a new erotics coming to the fore. Its privileged place 
is not in philosophical texts, and it does not borrow its major 
themes from the love of boys. It develops in reference to the 
relationship between a man and a woman, and it finds expres¬ 
sion in romances, of which the chief surviving examples are 
the adventures of Chaereas and Callirhoe, written by Chariton 
of Aphrodisias; those of Leucippe and Clitophon, recounted by 
Achilles Tatius; and the Ethiopica, by Heliodorus. It is true 
that many uncertainties remain in connection with this litera¬ 
ture, relative to the circumstances of its emergence and suc¬ 
cess, the date of the texts, and their possible allegorical and 
spiritual significance. 1 But one can nonetheless call attention 
to the presence, in these long narratives with their countless 
episodes, of some of the themes that will subsequently charac¬
