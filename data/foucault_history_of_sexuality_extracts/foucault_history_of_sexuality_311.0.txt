amical conversation, of the affection that is returned—true. 
But the the text makes it quite clear: in his bed, the boy is 
“without a companion”; he looks at no one when he is on his 
way to school; in the evening, tired from his work, he goes 
right to sleep. And Callicratidas gives some unequivocal ad¬ 
vice to the lovers of such boys: Remain as chaste as Socrates 
when he slept beside Alcibiades. Approach them with temper¬ 
ance (sophronos). Don’t squander a lasting affection for the 
sake of a brief pleasure. And it is this very lesson which will 
be drawn, once the debate is concluded, when, with an ironic 
solemnity, Lycinus awards the prize; it goes to the speech that 
praised the love of boys, insofar as the latter is practiced by 
“philosophers” and insofar as it pledges itself to ties of friend¬ 
ship that are “just and undefiled.” 

The debate between Charicles and Callicratidas thus ends 
with a “victory” of the love of boys. A victory conforming to 
a traditional schema that reserves for philosophers a pederasty 
in which physical pleasure is evaded. A victory, however, that 
gives everyone not only the right but also the duty to marry 
(according to a formula we have encountered in the Stoics: 
pantapasi gameteon). This is in effect a syncretic conclusion, 
which superimposes on the universality of marriage the privi¬ 
lege of a love of boys reserved for those who, being philoso¬ 
phers, are capable of a “perfect virtue.” But one should not 
forget that this debate, whose traditional and rhetorical char¬ 
acter is emphasized in the text itself, is embedded in another 
dialogue: that of Lycinus with Theomnestus, who asks his 
opinion on which of the two loves he should choose, since he 
feels equally drawn to both. So Lycinus has just reported to

Theomnestus the “verdict” he gave to Charicles and Calli- 
cratidas. But Theomnestus immediately waxes ironic about 
the crucial point of the debate and about the deciding factor 
in the victory of pederastic love: the latter won because it was 
linked to philosophy, to virtue, and hence to the elimination 
of physical pleasure. Is one expected to believe that this is 
really the way in which one loves boys? Theomnestus does not 
become indignant, as did Charicles, at the hypocrisy of such 
a discourse. Whereas, in order to link together pleasure and 
virtue, the advocates of boys stressed the absence of any sexual 
act, he reinstates the physical contact that one enjoys, the
