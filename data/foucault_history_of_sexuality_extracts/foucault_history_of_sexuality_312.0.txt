terize erotics, both religious and profane: the existence of a 
“heterosexual” relation marked by a male-female polarity, the 
insistence on an abstention that is modeled much more on 
virginal integrity than on the political and virile domination 
of desires; and finally, the fulfillment and reward of this purity 
in a union that has the form and value of a spiritual marriage. 
In this sense, and whatever may have been the influence of 
Platonism on this erotics, it is clearly far removed from an

erotics that referred essentially to the temperate love of boys 
and to its perfection in the lasting form of friendship. 

It is true that the love of boys is not completely absent from 
this romantic literature. Not only does it occupy an important 
place, certainly, in the tales of Petronius or Apuleius, which 
attests to the frequency and quite general acceptance of the 
practice. But it is also present in certain tales of virginity, 
betrothal, and marriage. Thus in Leucippe and Clitophon, two 
characters represent it, and in a completely positive manner: 
Clinias, who tries to dissuade his own male lover from mar¬ 
riage, nevertheless gives the hero of the tale some excellent 
advice for making progress in the love of girls . 2 Menelaus, for 
his part, offers a charming theory of a boy’s kiss—not cunning, 
or soft, or licentious, like that of a woman; a kiss that is the 
product not of art but of nature: a glaze of nectar become lips, 
such is the simple kiss of a boy at the gymnasium . 3 But these 
are only episodic and marginal themes. The love of a boy is 
never the principal object of the narrative. The whole focus of 
attention is centered on the relationship of the boy and the 
girl. This relationship always begins with a revelation that 
strikes them both and makes them love each other with an 
equal intensity. Except in the novel by Chariton of Aphro- 
disias, Chaereas and Callirhoe, this love does not immediately 
result in their union: the novel recounts a long series of adven¬ 
tures, which separate the two young people and prevent both 
marriage and the consummation of pleasure until the last 
moment. * These adventures are, insofar as possible, symmet¬ 
rical. Everything that happens to the one has its counterpart 
in the changes of fortune the other is made to undergo, which
