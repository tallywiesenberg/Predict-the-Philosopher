terize erotics, both religious and profane: the existence of a 
“heterosexual” relation marked by a male-female polarity, the 
insistence on an abstention that is modeled much more on 
virginal integrity than on the political and virile domination 
of desires; and finally, the fulfillment and reward of this purity 
in a union that has the form and value of a spiritual marriage. 
In this sense, and whatever may have been the influence of 
Platonism on this erotics, it is clearly far removed from an

erotics that referred essentially to the temperate love of boys 
and to its perfection in the lasting form of friendship. 

It is true that the love of boys is not completely absent from 
this romantic literature. Not only does it occupy an important 
place, certainly, in the tales of Petronius or Apuleius, which 
attests to the frequency and quite general acceptance of the 
practice. But it is also present in certain tales of virginity, 
betrothal, and marriage. Thus in Leucippe and Clitophon, two 
characters represent it, and in a completely positive manner: 
Clinias, who tries to dissuade his own male lover from mar¬ 
riage, nevertheless gives the hero of the tale some excellent 
advice for making progress in the love of girls . 2 Menelaus, for 
his part, offers a charming theory of a boy’s kiss—not cunning, 
or soft, or licentious, like that of a woman; a kiss that is the 
product not of art but of nature: a glaze of nectar become lips, 
such is the simple kiss of a boy at the gymnasium . 3 But these 
are only episodic and marginal themes. The love of a boy is 
never the principal object of the narrative. The whole focus of 
attention is centered on the relationship of the boy and the 
girl. This relationship always begins with a revelation that 
strikes them both and makes them love each other with an 
equal intensity. Except in the novel by Chariton of Aphro- 
disias, Chaereas and Callirhoe, this love does not immediately 
result in their union: the novel recounts a long series of adven¬ 
tures, which separate the two young people and prevent both 
marriage and the consummation of pleasure until the last 
moment. * These adventures are, insofar as possible, symmet¬ 
rical. Everything that happens to the one has its counterpart 
in the changes of fortune the other is made to undergo, which 
allows them to show the same courage, the same endurance, 
the same fidelity. This is because the primary significance of 
these adventures and their ability to sustain one’s interest until 
the denouement have to do with the fact that in the midst of 


*In Chaereas and Callirhoe, the separation occurs immediately after marriage; but 
the two spouses preserve their love, their purity, and their faithfulness throughout 
their adventures.

them the two characters hold strictly to a reciprocal sexual 
fidelity. A fidelity where the protagonists are married, as in the 
case of Chaereas and Callirhoe; a virginity in other tales, 
where the adventures and misfortunes come after the discov¬ 
ery of love and before marriage. Now it must be understood 
that this virginity is not simply an abstention resulting from 
a pledge. It is a choice of lives, which in the Ethiopica even 
appears to be prior to love. Chariclea, carefully schooled by 
her adoptive father in the quest for “the best of lives,” refused 
even to entertain the idea of marriage. The father had com¬ 
plained of this, moreover, after suggesting an honorable candi¬ 
date: “Neither by kind attentions, nor by promises, nor by 
appeals to reason, have I been able to persuade her. Hardest 
blow of all, she has aimed, as they say, my own shafts against 
me, and brandishes over me her accomplishment in the arts 
of speech—the subtleties of which I have imparted to her 
. . . glorifying the virgin state, which, she declares, is next to 
the immortal.” 4 Symmetrically, Theagenes had never had re¬ 
lations with a woman: “He affirmed with many oaths that he 
had never yet had intimacy with a woman. He had spurned 
all women, and marriage itself, and many love affairs that were 
mentioned to him, until the beauty of Chariclea had proved 
to him that he was not by nature obdurate. But up to the 
previous day he had never beheld a woman worthy of being 
loved.” 5 

We see then that virginity is not simply abstention as a 
preliminary to sexual practice. It is a choice, a style of life, a 
lofty form of existence that the hero chooses out of the regard 
that he has for himself. When the most extraordinary occur¬ 
rences separate the two protagonists and expose them to the 
worst dangers, the gravest will of course be that of falling prey
