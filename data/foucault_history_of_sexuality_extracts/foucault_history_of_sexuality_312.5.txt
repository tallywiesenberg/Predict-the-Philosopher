allows them to show the same courage, the same endurance, 
the same fidelity. This is because the primary significance of 
these adventures and their ability to sustain one’s interest until 
the denouement have to do with the fact that in the midst of

them the two characters hold strictly to a reciprocal sexual 
fidelity. A fidelity where the protagonists are married, as in the 
case of Chaereas and Callirhoe; a virginity in other tales, 
where the adventures and misfortunes come after the discov¬ 
ery of love and before marriage. Now it must be understood 
that this virginity is not simply an abstention resulting from 
a pledge. It is a choice of lives, which in the Ethiopica even 
appears to be prior to love. Chariclea, carefully schooled by 
her adoptive father in the quest for “the best of lives,” refused 
even to entertain the idea of marriage. The father had com¬ 
plained of this, moreover, after suggesting an honorable candi¬ 
date: “Neither by kind attentions, nor by promises, nor by 
appeals to reason, have I been able to persuade her. Hardest 
blow of all, she has aimed, as they say, my own shafts against 
me, and brandishes over me her accomplishment in the arts 
of speech—the subtleties of which I have imparted to her 
. . . glorifying the virgin state, which, she declares, is next to 
the immortal.” 4 Symmetrically, Theagenes had never had re¬ 
lations with a woman: “He affirmed with many oaths that he 
had never yet had intimacy with a woman. He had spurned 
all women, and marriage itself, and many love affairs that were 
mentioned to him, until the beauty of Chariclea had proved 
to him that he was not by nature obdurate. But up to the 
previous day he had never beheld a woman worthy of being 
loved.” 5 

We see then that virginity is not simply abstention as a 
preliminary to sexual practice. It is a choice, a style of life, a 
lofty form of existence that the hero chooses out of the regard 
that he has for himself. When the most extraordinary occur¬ 
rences separate the two protagonists and expose them to the 
worst dangers, the gravest will of course be that of falling prey
