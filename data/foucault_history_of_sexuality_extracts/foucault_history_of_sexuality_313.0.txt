to the sexual cupidity of others. The greatest test of their own 
worth and their mutual love will be that of resisting at all costs 
and of saving that virginity which is essential to the relation¬ 
ship with themselves and essential to the relationship with 
each other. Thus the novel by Achilles Tatius unfolds as a 
kind of odyssey of double virginity. A virginity exposed, as-

sailed, doubted, slandered, safeguarded—except for an honor¬ 
able, minor lapse that Clitophon allowed himself—and finally 
justified and certified in a sort of divine ordeal, which makes 
it possible to proclaim concerning the girl, “she is still the 
same, up to the present day, as when you sent her away from 
Byzantium; it is to be put down to her credit that she remained 
a virgin when surrounded by a gang of pirates, and overcame 
the worst of them.” And speaking of himself, Clitophon can 
also say, in a symmetrical fashion: “You will find that I have 
imitated your virginity, if there be any virginity in men .” 6 

But if love and sexual abstention thus coincide during the 
entire adventure, one has to understand that it is not simply 
a question of defending oneself against outsiders. This preser¬ 
vation of virginity holds within the love relation as well. The 
lovers save themselves for each other until the time when love 
and virginity find their fulfillment in marriage. So that 
premarital chastity, which brings the two fiances together in 
spirit so long as they are separated and being put to the test 
by others, keeps them self-restrained and makes them abstain 
when they are finally reunited after many twists of fate. Find¬

and Chariclea “took their fill of ardent embraces and kisses. 
In a moment they were oblivious of everything else. For a long 
time they clung to each other as though grown into one per¬ 
son, satiating themselves with a devout, virginal love, com¬ 
muning with one another through the flow of hot tears, and 
commingling only by the chaste means of their kisses. For 
Chariclea, when she found Theagenes making some too im¬ 
pulsive advance of manly ardor, restrained him by recalling 
his oaths, and his attempt was easily checked. It was a light 
matter for him to be temperate, for although mastered by love 
he could be master of his pleasures .” 7 This virginity is not to 
be understood, then, as an attitude that is set against all sexual 
relations, even if they take place within marriage. It is much
