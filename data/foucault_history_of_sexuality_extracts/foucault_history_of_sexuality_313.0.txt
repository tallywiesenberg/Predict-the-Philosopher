to the sexual cupidity of others. The greatest test of their own 
worth and their mutual love will be that of resisting at all costs 
and of saving that virginity which is essential to the relation¬ 
ship with themselves and essential to the relationship with 
each other. Thus the novel by Achilles Tatius unfolds as a 
kind of odyssey of double virginity. A virginity exposed, as-

sailed, doubted, slandered, safeguarded—except for an honor¬ 
able, minor lapse that Clitophon allowed himself—and finally 
justified and certified in a sort of divine ordeal, which makes 
it possible to proclaim concerning the girl, “she is still the 
same, up to the present day, as when you sent her away from 
Byzantium; it is to be put down to her credit that she remained 
a virgin when surrounded by a gang of pirates, and overcame 
the worst of them.” And speaking of himself, Clitophon can 
also say, in a symmetrical fashion: “You will find that I have 
imitated your virginity, if there be any virginity in men .” 6 

But if love and sexual abstention thus coincide during the 
entire adventure, one has to understand that it is not simply 
a question of defending oneself against outsiders. This preser¬ 
vation of virginity holds within the love relation as well. The 
lovers save themselves for each other until the time when love 
and virginity find their fulfillment in marriage. So that 
premarital chastity, which brings the two fiances together in 
spirit so long as they are separated and being put to the test 
by others, keeps them self-restrained and makes them abstain 
when they are finally reunited after many twists of fate. Find¬ 
ing themselves alone in a cave, left to themselves, Theagenes 
and Chariclea “took their fill of ardent embraces and kisses. 
In a moment they were oblivious of everything else. For a long 
time they clung to each other as though grown into one per¬ 
son, satiating themselves with a devout, virginal love, com¬ 
muning with one another through the flow of hot tears, and 
commingling only by the chaste means of their kisses. For 
Chariclea, when she found Theagenes making some too im¬ 
pulsive advance of manly ardor, restrained him by recalling 
his oaths, and his attempt was easily checked. It was a light 
matter for him to be temperate, for although mastered by love 
he could be master of his pleasures .” 7 This virginity is not to 
be understood, then, as an attitude that is set against all sexual 
relations, even if they take place within marriage. It is much 
more the test preparatory to that union, the movement that 
leads to it and in which it will find its fulfillment. Love, virgin¬ 
ity, and marriage form a whole: the two lovers have to pre-

serve their physical integrity, but also their purity of heart, 
until the moment of their union, which is to be understood in 
the physical but also the spiritual sense. 

Thus there begins to develop an erotics different from the 
one that had taken its starting point in the love of boys, even 
though abstention from the sexual pleasures plays an impor¬ 
tant part in both. This new erotics organizes itself around the 
symmetrical and reciprocal relationship of a man and a 
woman, around the high value attributed to virginity, and 
around the complete union in which it finds perfection. 





A whole corpus of moral reflection on sexual activity and 
its pleasures seems to mark, in the first centuries of our era, 
a certain strengthening of austerity themes. Physicians worry 
about the effects of sexual practice, unhesitatingly recommend 
abstention, and declare a preference for virginity over the use 
of pleasure. Philosophers condemn any sexual relation that 
might take place outside marriage and prescribe a strict 
fidelity between spouses, admitting no exceptions. Further¬ 
more, a certain doctrinal disqualification seems to bear on the 
love for boys. 

Does this mean that one must recognize, in the schema thus 
constituted, the lineaments of a future ethics, the ethics that 
one will find in Christianity, when the sexual act itself will be 
considered an evil, when it will no longer be granted legiti¬ 
macy except within the conjugal relationship, and when the 
love of boys will be condemned as unnatural? Must one sup¬ 
pose that certain thinkers, in the Greco-Roman world, already 
had a presentiment of this model of sexual austerity which, in 
Christian societies, will be given a legal framework and an 
institutional support? One would thus find, formulated by a 
few austere philosophers isolated in the midst of a world that
