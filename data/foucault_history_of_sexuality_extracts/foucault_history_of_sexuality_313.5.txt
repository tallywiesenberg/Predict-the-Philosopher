more the test preparatory to that union, the movement that 
leads to it and in which it will find its fulfillment. Love, virgin¬

serve their physical integrity, but also their purity of heart, 
until the moment of their union, which is to be understood in 
the physical but also the spiritual sense. 

Thus there begins to develop an erotics different from the 
one that had taken its starting point in the love of boys, even 
though abstention from the sexual pleasures plays an impor¬ 
tant part in both. This new erotics organizes itself around the 
symmetrical and reciprocal relationship of a man and a 
woman, around the high value attributed to virginity, and 
around the complete union in which it finds perfection. 





A whole corpus of moral reflection on sexual activity and 
its pleasures seems to mark, in the first centuries of our era, 
a certain strengthening of austerity themes. Physicians worry 
about the effects of sexual practice, unhesitatingly recommend 
abstention, and declare a preference for virginity over the use 
of pleasure. Philosophers condemn any sexual relation that 
might take place outside marriage and prescribe a strict 
fidelity between spouses, admitting no exceptions. Further¬ 
more, a certain doctrinal disqualification seems to bear on the 
love for boys. 

Does this mean that one must recognize, in the schema thus 
constituted, the lineaments of a future ethics, the ethics that 
one will find in Christianity, when the sexual act itself will be 
considered an evil, when it will no longer be granted legiti¬ 
macy except within the conjugal relationship, and when the 
love of boys will be condemned as unnatural? Must one sup¬ 
pose that certain thinkers, in the Greco-Roman world, already 
had a presentiment of this model of sexual austerity which, in 
Christian societies, will be given a legal framework and an 
institutional support? One would thus find, formulated by a 
few austere philosophers isolated in the midst of a world that
