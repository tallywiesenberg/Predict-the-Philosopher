did not itself appear to be austere, the outline of a new ethics, 
destined, in the following centuries, to take more stringent 
forms and to gain a more general validity. 

The question is important, and it has a long tradition behind

it. Since the Renaissance, it has laid down, in Catholicism and 
Protestantism alike, relatively similar dividing lines. On the 
one side, a certain ancient ethics closely related to Christianity 
(this is the thesis of the Manuductio ad stoicam philosophiam 
by Justus Lipsius, which Karl Barth radicalized by making 
Epictetus into a true Christian; it is, later, on behalf of the 
Catholics, the thesis of J.-P. Camus and, most notably, of the 
Epictete chretien by Jean-Marie de Bordeaux). On the other 
side, those for whom Stoicism was just another philosophy, 
one that was virtuous, certainly, but indelibly pagan (thus 
Salmasius among the Protestants, and Arnauld or Tillemont 
among the Catholics). The point at issue, however, was not 
just to bring certain of the ancient philosophers within the 
bounds of the Christian faith or to preserve the latter from any 
pagan contamination; the problem was also to determine what 
foundation to give to an ethics whose prescriptive elements 
seemed to be shared, up to a point, by Greco-Roman philoso¬ 
phy and the Christian religion. The debate that developed at 
the end of the nineteenth century is not unconnected with this 
problematic either, even if it sets up an interference with prob¬ 
lems of historical method. Zahn, in his famous address, did 
not try to make a Christian of Epictetus, but to call attention 
to the signs of a knowledge of Christianity and to the traces 
of its influence. 1 Bonhoffer’s work, which replied to Zahn, 
sought to establish the unity of philosophy without there being 
the need to appeal to the disparate elements of an external 
action in order to explain this or that aspect of it. 2 But it was 
also a matter of knowing where to look for the basis of 
the moral imperative and whether it was possible to detach 
Christianity from a certain type of ethics that had long been 
associated with it. Now, in this debate it seems that the partici¬ 
pants granted, in a relatively confused way, three presupposi¬ 
tions: according to the first, the essential component of an 
ethics is to be sought in the code elements it contains; accord¬
