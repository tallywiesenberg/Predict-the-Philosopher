did not itself appear to be austere, the outline of a new ethics, 
destined, in the following centuries, to take more stringent 
forms and to gain a more general validity. 

The question is important, and it has a long tradition behind

it. Since the Renaissance, it has laid down, in Catholicism and 
Protestantism alike, relatively similar dividing lines. On the 
one side, a certain ancient ethics closely related to Christianity 
(this is the thesis of the Manuductio ad stoicam philosophiam 
by Justus Lipsius, which Karl Barth radicalized by making 
Epictetus into a true Christian; it is, later, on behalf of the 
Catholics, the thesis of J.-P. Camus and, most notably, of the 
Epictete chretien by Jean-Marie de Bordeaux). On the other 
side, those for whom Stoicism was just another philosophy, 
one that was virtuous, certainly, but indelibly pagan (thus 
Salmasius among the Protestants, and Arnauld or Tillemont 
among the Catholics). The point at issue, however, was not 
just to bring certain of the ancient philosophers within the 
bounds of the Christian faith or to preserve the latter from any 
pagan contamination; the problem was also to determine what 
foundation to give to an ethics whose prescriptive elements 
seemed to be shared, up to a point, by Greco-Roman philoso¬ 
phy and the Christian religion. The debate that developed at 
the end of the nineteenth century is not unconnected with this 
problematic either, even if it sets up an interference with prob¬ 
lems of historical method. Zahn, in his famous address, did 
not try to make a Christian of Epictetus, but to call attention 
to the signs of a knowledge of Christianity and to the traces 
of its influence. 1 Bonhoffer’s work, which replied to Zahn, 
sought to establish the unity of philosophy without there being 
the need to appeal to the disparate elements of an external 
action in order to explain this or that aspect of it. 2 But it was 
also a matter of knowing where to look for the basis of 
the moral imperative and whether it was possible to detach 
Christianity from a certain type of ethics that had long been 
associated with it. Now, in this debate it seems that the partici¬ 
pants granted, in a relatively confused way, three presupposi¬ 
tions: according to the first, the essential component of an 
ethics is to be sought in the code elements it contains; accord¬ 
ing to the second, the philosophical ethics of late antiquity 
resembled Christianity in its severe precepts, which repre¬ 
sented an almost complete break with the previous tradition;

lastly, according to the third presupposition, it was in terms 
of loftiness and purity that Christian ethics could best be 
compared with the ethics that, in certain philosophers of an¬ 
tiquity, prepared the way for it. 

It is hardly possible, however, to let the matter remain 
there. One has to bear in mind, first, that the principles of 
sexual austerity were not defined for the first time in the 
philosophy of the imperial epoch. We have encountered in 
Greek thought of the fourth century b.c. formulations that 
were not much less demanding. After all, as we have seen, the 
sexual act appears to have been regarded for a very long time 
as dangerous, difficult to master, and costly; a precise calcula¬ 
tion of its acceptable practice and its inclusion in a careful 
regimen had been required for quite some time. Plato, Isoc¬ 
rates, and Aristotle recommended, each in his own way, at 
least some forms of conjugal fidelity. And the love of boys 
could be held in the highest esteem. But the practice of absten¬ 
tion was demanded of it as well, so that it might preserve the 
spiritual value expected of it. Hence a very long time had 
passed during which concern for the body and for health, the 
relation to wives and to marriage, and the relationship with 
boys had been motifs for the elaboration of a severe ethics. 
And in a certain way, the sexual austerity that one encounters 
in the philosophers of the first centuries of our era has its roots 
in this ancient tradition. It is true that one should not ignore 
the carefully maintained continuity and the conscious reacti¬ 
vation evident in this thought of the first centuries, so mani¬ 
festly haunted by classical culture. Hellenistic philosophy and 
ethics experienced what Henri Marrou called “a long sum¬ 
mer.” But the fact remains that several modifications are 
perceptible: they prevent one from considering the moral 
philosophy of Musonius or that of Plutarch simply as the 
accentuation of the lessons of Xenophon, Plato, Isocrates, or 
Aristotle; they also prevent one from considering the recom¬ 
mendations of Soranus or Rufus of Ephesus as variations on 
the principles of Hippocrates or Diodes.
