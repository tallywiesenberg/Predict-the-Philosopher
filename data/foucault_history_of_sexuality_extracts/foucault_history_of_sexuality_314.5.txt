ing to the second, the philosophical ethics of late antiquity

lastly, according to the third presupposition, it was in terms 
of loftiness and purity that Christian ethics could best be 
compared with the ethics that, in certain philosophers of an¬ 
tiquity, prepared the way for it. 

It is hardly possible, however, to let the matter remain 
there. One has to bear in mind, first, that the principles of 
sexual austerity were not defined for the first time in the 
philosophy of the imperial epoch. We have encountered in 
Greek thought of the fourth century b.c. formulations that 
were not much less demanding. After all, as we have seen, the 
sexual act appears to have been regarded for a very long time 
as dangerous, difficult to master, and costly; a precise calcula¬ 
tion of its acceptable practice and its inclusion in a careful 
regimen had been required for quite some time. Plato, Isoc¬ 
rates, and Aristotle recommended, each in his own way, at 
least some forms of conjugal fidelity. And the love of boys 
could be held in the highest esteem. But the practice of absten¬ 
tion was demanded of it as well, so that it might preserve the 
spiritual value expected of it. Hence a very long time had 
passed during which concern for the body and for health, the 
relation to wives and to marriage, and the relationship with 
boys had been motifs for the elaboration of a severe ethics. 
And in a certain way, the sexual austerity that one encounters 
in the philosophers of the first centuries of our era has its roots 
in this ancient tradition. It is true that one should not ignore 
the carefully maintained continuity and the conscious reacti¬ 
vation evident in this thought of the first centuries, so mani¬ 
festly haunted by classical culture. Hellenistic philosophy and 
ethics experienced what Henri Marrou called “a long sum¬ 
mer.” But the fact remains that several modifications are 
perceptible: they prevent one from considering the moral 
philosophy of Musonius or that of Plutarch simply as the 
accentuation of the lessons of Xenophon, Plato, Isocrates, or 
Aristotle; they also prevent one from considering the recom¬ 
mendations of Soranus or Rufus of Ephesus as variations on 
the principles of Hippocrates or Diodes.
