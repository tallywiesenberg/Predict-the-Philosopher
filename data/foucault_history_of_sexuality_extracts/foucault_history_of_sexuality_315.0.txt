The Care of the Self 


the change is marked by an increased apprehension, a broader 
and more detailed definition of the correlations between the 
sexual act and the body, a closer attention to the ambivalence 
of its effects and its disturbing consequences. And this is not 
just a greater preoccupation with the body; it is also a different 
way of thinking about sexual activity, and of fearing it because 
of its many connections with disease and with evil. With re¬ 
gard to wives and to the problematization of marriage, the 
modification mainly concerns the valorization of the conjugal 
bond and the dual relation that constitutes it; the husband’s 
right conduct and the moderation he needs to enjoin on him¬ 
self are not justified merely by considerations of status, but by 
the nature of the relationship, its universal form and the mu¬ 
tual obligations that derive from it. Finally, as regards boys, 
the need for abstinence is less and less perceived as a way of 
giving the highest spiritual values to the forms of love, and 
more and more as the sign of an imperfection that is specific 
to sexual activity. 

Now, in these modifications of preexisting themes one can 
see the development of an art of existence dominated by self¬ 
preoccupation. This art of the self no longer focuses so much 
on the excesses that one can indulge in and that need to be 
mastered in order to exercise one’s domination over others. It 
gives increasing emphasis to the frailty of the individual faced 
with the manifold ills that sexual activity can give rise to. It 
also underscores the need to subject that activity to a universal 
form by which one is bound, a form grounded in both nature 
and reason, and valid for all human beings. It likewise empha¬ 
sizes the importance of developing all the practices and all the 
exercises by which one can maintain self-control and even¬ 
tually arrive at a pure enjoyment of oneself. It is not the ac¬ 
centuation of the forms of prohibition that is behind these 
modifications in sexual ethics. It is the development of an art 
of existence that revolves around the question of the self, of 
its dependence and independence, of its universal form and of 
the connection it can and should establish with others, of the 
procedures by which it exerts its control over itself, and of

the way in which it can establish a complete supremacy over 
itself. 

And it is in this context that a dual phenomenon, character¬ 
istic of this ethics of pleasure, occurs. On the one hand, a more 
active attention to sexual practice is required, an attention to 
its effects on the organism, to its place and function within 
marriage, to its value and its difficulties in the relationship 
with boys. But at the same time as one dwells on it, and as the 
interest that one brings to bear on it is intensified, it increas¬ 
ingly appears to be dangerous and capable of compromising 
the relation with oneself that one is trying to establish. It 
seems more and more necessary to distrust it, to confine it, 
insofar as possible, to marital relations—even at the cost of 
charging it with more intense meanings within that conjugal 
relationship. Problematization and apprehension go hand in 
hand; inquiry is joined to vigilance. A certain style of sexual 
conduct is thus suggested by this whole movement of moral, 
medical, and philosophical reflection. It is different from the 
style that had been delineated in the fourth century, but it is 
also different from the one that will be found in Christianity. 
Here sexual activity is linked to evil by its form and its effects, 
but in itself and substantially, it is not an evil. It finds its 
natural fulfillment in marriage, but—with certain exceptions 
—marriage is not an express, indispensable condition for it to 
cease being an evil. It has trouble finding its place in the love 
of boys, but the latter is not therefore condemned as being 
contrary to nature. 

Thus, as the arts of living and the care of the self are refined, 
some precepts emerge that seem to be rather similar to those 
that will be formulated in the later moral systems. But one 
should not be misled by the analogy. Those moral systems will 
define other modalities of the relation to self: a characteriza¬ 
tion of the ethical substance based on finitude, the Fall, and 
evil; a mode of subjection in the form of obedience to a general 
law that is at the same time the will of a personal god; a type 
of work on oneself that implies a decipherment of the soul and 
a purificatory hermeneutics of the desires; and a mode of
