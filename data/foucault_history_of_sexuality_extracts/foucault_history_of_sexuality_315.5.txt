the way in which it can establish a complete supremacy over 
itself. 

And it is in this context that a dual phenomenon, character¬ 
istic of this ethics of pleasure, occurs. On the one hand, a more 
active attention to sexual practice is required, an attention to 
its effects on the organism, to its place and function within 
marriage, to its value and its difficulties in the relationship 
with boys. But at the same time as one dwells on it, and as the 
interest that one brings to bear on it is intensified, it increas¬ 
ingly appears to be dangerous and capable of compromising 
the relation with oneself that one is trying to establish. It 
seems more and more necessary to distrust it, to confine it, 
insofar as possible, to marital relations—even at the cost of 
charging it with more intense meanings within that conjugal 
relationship. Problematization and apprehension go hand in 
hand; inquiry is joined to vigilance. A certain style of sexual 
conduct is thus suggested by this whole movement of moral, 
medical, and philosophical reflection. It is different from the 
style that had been delineated in the fourth century, but it is 
also different from the one that will be found in Christianity. 
Here sexual activity is linked to evil by its form and its effects, 
but in itself and substantially, it is not an evil. It finds its 
natural fulfillment in marriage, but—with certain exceptions 
—marriage is not an express, indispensable condition for it to 
cease being an evil. It has trouble finding its place in the love 
of boys, but the latter is not therefore condemned as being 
contrary to nature. 

Thus, as the arts of living and the care of the self are refined, 
some precepts emerge that seem to be rather similar to those 
that will be formulated in the later moral systems. But one 
should not be misled by the analogy. Those moral systems will 
define other modalities of the relation to self: a characteriza¬ 
tion of the ethical substance based on finitude, the Fall, and 
evil; a mode of subjection in the form of obedience to a general 
law that is at the same time the will of a personal god; a type 
of work on oneself that implies a decipherment of the soul and 
a purificatory hermeneutics of the desires; and a mode of
