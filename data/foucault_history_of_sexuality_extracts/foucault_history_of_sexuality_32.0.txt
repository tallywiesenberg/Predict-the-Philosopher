movement of a power that was essentially repressive. I based 
my argument on the disqualification of that notion while 
feigning ignorance of the fact that a critique has been 
mounted from another quarter and doubtless in a more radi¬ 
cal fashion: a critique conducted at the level of the theory of 
desire. In point of fact, the assertion that sex is not “re¬ 
pressed” is not altogether new. Psychoanalysts have been 
saying the same thing for some time. They have challenged 
the simple little machinery that comes to mind when one 
speaks of repression; the idea of a rebellious energy that must 
be throttled has appeared to them inadequate for deciphering 
the manner in which power and desire are joined to one 
another; they consider them to be linked in a more complex 
and primary way than through the interplay of a primitive, 
natural, and living energy welling up from below, and a 
higher order seeking to stand in its way; thus one should not 
think that desire is repressed, for the simple reason that the 
law is what constitutes both desire and the lack on which it 
is predicated. Where there is desire, the power relation is 
already present: an illusion, then, to denounce this relation

for a repression exerted after the event; but vanity as well, 
to go questing after a desire that is beyond the reach of 
power. 

But, in an obstinately confused way, I sometimes spoke, 
as though I were dealing with equivalent notions, of repres¬ 
sion, and sometimes of law, of prohibition or censorship. 
Through stubbornness or neglect, I failed to consider every¬ 
thing that can distinguish their theoretical implications. And 
I grant that one might justifiably say to me: By constantly 
referring to positive technologies of power, you are playing 
a double game where you hope to win on all counts; you 
confuse your adversaries by appearing to take the weaker 
position, and, discussing repression alone, you would have us 
believe, wrongly, that you have rid yourself of the problem 
of law; and yet you keep the essential practical consequence 
of the principle of power-as-law, namely the fact that there 
is no escaping from power, that it is always-already present, 
constituting that very thing which one attempts to counter 
it with. As to the idea of a power-repression, you have re¬ 
tained its most fragile theoretical element, and this in order 
to criticize it; you have retained the most sterilizing political 
consequence of the idea of power-law, but only in order to 
preserve it for your own use. 

The aim of the inquiries that will follow is to move less 
toward a “theory” of power than toward an “analytics” of 
power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain 
formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of 
the instruments that will make possible its analysis. How¬ 
ever, it seems to me that this analytics can be constituted 
only if it frees itself completely from a certain representation 
of power that I would term—it will be seen later why— 
“juridico-discursive.” It is this conception that governs both 
the thematics of repression and the theory of the law as 
constitutive of desire. In other words, what distinguishes the 
analysis made in terms of the repression of instincts from 
that made in terms of the law of desire is clearly the way in

which they each conceive of the nature and dynamics of the 
drives, not the way in which they conceive of power. They 
both rely on a common representation of power which, de¬ 
pending on the use made of it and the position it is accorded 
with respect to desire, leads to two contrary results: either to 
the promise of a “liberation,” if power is seen as having only 
an external hold on desire, or, if it is constitutive of desire 
itself, to the affirmation: you are always-already trapped. 
Moreover, one must not imagine that this representation is 
peculiar to those who are concerned with the problem of the 
relations of power with sex. In fact it is much more general; 
one frequently encounters it in political analyses of power, 
and it is deeply rooted in the history of the West. 

These are some of its principal features: 

— The negative relation. It never establishes any connec¬ 
tion between power and sex that is not negative: rejection, 
exclusion, refusal, blockage, concealment, or mask. Where 
sex and pleasure are concerned, power can “do” nothing but 
say no to them; what it produces, if anything, is absences and 
gaps; it overlooks elements, introduces discontinuities, sepa¬
