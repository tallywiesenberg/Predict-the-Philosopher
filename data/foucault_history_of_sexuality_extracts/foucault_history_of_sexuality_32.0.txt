movement of a power that was essentially repressive. I based 
my argument on the disqualification of that notion while 
feigning ignorance of the fact that a critique has been 
mounted from another quarter and doubtless in a more radi¬ 
cal fashion: a critique conducted at the level of the theory of 
desire. In point of fact, the assertion that sex is not “re¬ 
pressed” is not altogether new. Psychoanalysts have been 
saying the same thing for some time. They have challenged 
the simple little machinery that comes to mind when one 
speaks of repression; the idea of a rebellious energy that must 
be throttled has appeared to them inadequate for deciphering 
the manner in which power and desire are joined to one 
another; they consider them to be linked in a more complex 
and primary way than through the interplay of a primitive, 
natural, and living energy welling up from below, and a 
higher order seeking to stand in its way; thus one should not 
think that desire is repressed, for the simple reason that the 
law is what constitutes both desire and the lack on which it 
is predicated. Where there is desire, the power relation is 
already present: an illusion, then, to denounce this relation

for a repression exerted after the event; but vanity as well, 
to go questing after a desire that is beyond the reach of 
power. 

But, in an obstinately confused way, I sometimes spoke, 
as though I were dealing with equivalent notions, of repres¬ 
sion, and sometimes of law, of prohibition or censorship. 
Through stubbornness or neglect, I failed to consider every¬ 
thing that can distinguish their theoretical implications. And 
I grant that one might justifiably say to me: By constantly 
referring to positive technologies of power, you are playing 
a double game where you hope to win on all counts; you 
confuse your adversaries by appearing to take the weaker 
position, and, discussing repression alone, you would have us 
believe, wrongly, that you have rid yourself of the problem 
of law; and yet you keep the essential practical consequence 
of the principle of power-as-law, namely the fact that there 
is no escaping from power, that it is always-already present, 
constituting that very thing which one attempts to counter
