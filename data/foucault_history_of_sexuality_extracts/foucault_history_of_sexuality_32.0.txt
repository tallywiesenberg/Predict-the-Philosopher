Thus, the boy was expected to give—out of kindness and

marked in Greek reflection on the love of boys: how was this 
relation to be integrated into a larger whole and enabled to 
transform itself into another type of relationship, a stable 
relationship where physical relations would no longer be im¬ 
portant and where the two partners would be able to share the 
same feelings and the same possessions?The love of boys 
could not be morally honorable unless it comprised (as a result 
of the reasonable gifts and services of the lover and the re¬ 
served compliance of the beloved) the elements that would 
form the basis of a transformation of this love into a definitive 
and socially valuable tie, that of philia.One would be quite mistaken to think that since the Greeks 
did not prohibit this kind of relationship, they did not worry 
about its implications.It “interested” them more than any 
other sexual relation, and there is every indication that they 
were anxious about it.
