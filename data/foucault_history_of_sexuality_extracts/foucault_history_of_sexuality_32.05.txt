But we can say that in a thinking such 
as ours, the relationship between two individuals of the same 
sex is questioned primarily from the viewpoint of the subject 
of desire: how can it be that in a man a desire forms whose 
object is another man?And we know very well that it is in a 
certain structuring of this desire (in its ambivalence, or in 
what it lacks) that the rudiments of an answer will be sought.The preoccupation of the Greeks, on the other hand, did not 
concern the desire that might incline an individual to this kind 
of relationship, nor did it concern the subject of this desire; 
their anxiety was focused on the object of pleasure, or more 
precisely, on that object insofar as he would have to become 
in turn the master in the pleasure that was enjoyed with others 
and in the power that was exercised over oneself.It was here, at this point of problematization (how to make 
the object of pleasure into a subject who was in control of his 
pleasures), that philosophical erotics, or in any case Socratic- 
Platonic reflection on love, was to take its point of departure.PART FIVE 

True Love 





Erotics, as a purposeful art of love (the love of boys in 
particular), will be our topic in this section as well.
