But this 
time it will be treated as a developmental context for the 
fourth of the great austerity themes that have run through the 
ethics of pleasure over the entire course of its history in the 
Western world.After the relation to the body and to health, 
after the relation to wives and to the institution of marriage, 
and after the relation to boys, to their freedom and their 
virility—three motifs in the problematization of sexual activ¬ 
ity—I would like now to consider the relation to truth.For it 
is one of the most remarkable aspects of Greek reflection on 
the love of boys that not only does it show how—for reasons 
we have seen—this love constituted a sensitive point that de¬ 
manded an elaboration of behavior and a rather delicate styli¬ 
zation of the use of the aphrodisia, but it was around this issue 
that the question of the relations between the use of pleasures 
and access to truth was developed, in the form of an inquiry 
into the nature of true love.In the Christian and modern cultures these same questions 
—of truth, of love, and of pleasure—were to be framed, rather, 
in terms of the constituent elements of the man-woman rela¬ 
tionship: the themes of virginity, of spiritual matrimony, of 
the soul-wife soon marked the shift from a basically masculine 
scene—occupied by the erastes and the eromenos —to one 
dominated by the figures of femininity and of the relationship 
between the two sexes.* Much later, Faust would be an exam¬ 
ple of the way in which the question of pleasure and that of 
access, to knowledge would be linked to the theme of love for
