The Use of Pleasure 


woman, for her virginity, her purity, her fall, and her redemp¬ 
tive power.With the Greeks, on the other hand, reflection on 
the reciprocal ties between access to truth and sexual austerity 
seems to have been developed primarily in connection with the 
love of boys.Of course we have to make allowance for the fact 
that little has survived of the things that may have been said 
and recommended, in the Pythagorean circles of the period, 
concerning the relations between purity and knowledge.We 
also have to allow for the fact that we do not have the treatises 
on love that were written by Antisthenes, Diogenes the Cynic, 
Aristotle, or Theophrastus.It would be unwise, therefore, to 
generalize the particular features of the Socratic-Platonic doc¬ 
trine, as if the latter provided a compendium of all the forms 
the philosophy of Eros may have taken in classical Greece.
