All 
the same, it did remain a pole of reflection for a very long time, 
as texts such as Plutarch’s dialogue, Lucian’s Affairs of the 
Heart, or the speeches of Maximus of Tyre show very well.As it appears in the Symposium or the Phaedrus in any case, 
and considering the references it makes to other ways of dis¬ 
coursing on love, we can see the distance that separates this 
doctrine from the ordinary erotics that posed questions con¬ 
cerning the reciprocal good behavior of the young man and his 
suitor, and concerning the way in which behavior could accord 
with honor.We can also see how, while being deeply rooted in 
the habitual themes of the ethics of pleasure, it broached 
questions that would later have a very great importance for the 
transformation of this ethics into a morality of renunciation 
and for the constitution of a hermeneutics of desire.An entire large section of the Symposium and of the Phae¬ 
drus is devoted to the “reproduction”—imitation or pastiche 
—of what was customarily said in speeches on love.The “ref¬ 
erence speeches” of Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus, and 
Agathon in the Symposium; that of Lysias in the Phaedrus; 
and the first counter-speech by Socrates are of this type.
