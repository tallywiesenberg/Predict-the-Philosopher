A question characteristic 
of an erotics conceived as an art of give and take between the 
one who courts and the one who is courted.It is this question that appears in the form of an absolutely 
general and amusingly tautological principle in the first speech 
of the Symposium at Agathon’s house: “shame [aischyne] at 
what is disgraceful [aischrois] and ambition for what is 
noble”; 2 but Pausanias immediately takes up the principle in 
a more serious way, differentiating between two loves, the one 
“whose only aim is the satisfaction of its desires,” and the 
other which desires above all to test the soul.3 We may also 
note that in the Phaedrus the first two speeches—both of 
which will be dismissed, the first becoming the object of an 
ironic recapitulation, and the second, that of a reparative 
palinode—pose, each in its own way, the question of “to 
whom should one yield?”; and that they answer the question 
by saying that one must yield to the person who loves.And 
all these first speeches appeal to a common thematics: that of 
transitory loves that disintegrate when the beloved comes of 
age, leaving him stranded; 4 that of dishonorable relations that 
place the boy under the domination of the lover, 5 compromise 
him in the eyes of everyone, and alienate him from his family 
or from honorable relations from which he could benefit; 6 that 
of the feelings of disgust and contempt the lover might have 
for the boy due to the satisfactions the latter grants him, or 
the feelings of hatred the young man might experience for the 
aging man who imposes disagreeable relations on him; 7 that 
of the feminine role the boy is led to assume, and the effects 
of physical and moral deterioration that this kind of relation 
invites; 8 that of the often burdensome compensations, benefits,

The Use of Pleasure 


and services that the lover must impose on himself, obligations 
that he tries to escape by abandoning his erstwhile companion 
to shame and solitude.9 All of that constituted the elementary 
problematics of the pleasures and their use in the love of boys.
