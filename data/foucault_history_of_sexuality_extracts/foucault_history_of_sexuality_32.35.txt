It was these difficulties that the customs, courtship practices, 
and regulated games of love attempted to overcome.One might think that Aristophanes’ speech in the Sympo¬ 
sium constituted an exception: in telling of the bisection of 
primeval human beings due to the wrath of the gods, their 
separation into two halves (males and females, or both halves 
being of the same sex, depending on whether the original 
individual was androgynous or entirely male or female), it 
seems to go far beyond the problems of the art of courtship.It raises the question of the nature of love; and it could pass 
for an amusing approach—ironically placed in the mouth of 
Aristophanes, the old adversary of Socrates—to the theses of 
Plato himself.Doesn’t it speak of lovers who are searching for 
their lost half, just as Plato’s souls remember and long for 
what used to be their homeland?However, restricting our¬ 
selves to the parts of the speech that concern male love, it is 
clear that Aristophanes also tends to answer the question of 
consent.
