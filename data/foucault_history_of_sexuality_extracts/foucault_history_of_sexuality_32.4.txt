And the thing that makes his speech and his irony 
unusual and a bit scandalous is that his answer is completely 
affirmative.Moreover, his mythical tale upsets the generally 
accepted principle of dissymmetry of age, feelings, and behav¬ 
ior between the lover and the beloved.He posits a symmetry 
and equality between the two, since he has them originate in 
the division of a single being; the same pleasure and the same 
desire attract the erastes and the eromenos to one another.A 
boy will naturally love men if he is half a male being: he will 
“take pleasure” in “lying beside males” and in “being ent¬ 
wined with them” (sympeplegmenoi ).10 And far from revealing 
a feminine nature, this shows that he is the mere “tally” of a 
being that is entirely male.
