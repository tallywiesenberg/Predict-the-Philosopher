in public life.” 11 In their youth they gave themselves to men 
because they were looking for their male half; for the same 
reason, once they are adults they will pursue boys.“Loving 
boys” and “cherishing lovers” (to be paiderastes and phileras- 
tes) n are the two sides of the same being.Hence, to the tradi¬ 
tional question of consent, Aristophanes gives an answer that 
is direct, simple, and entirely affirmative, and he thereby 
abolishes the game of dissymmetries that structured the com¬ 
plex relations between man and boy: the whole question of 
love and right conduct thus becomes nothing more than the 
problem of finding one’s lost half.Now, Socratic-Platonic erotics is radically different: not 
only because of the solution it proposes, but also and especially 
because it tends to frame the question in very different terms.Knowing the nature of true love will no longer be a matter of 
answering the question: who must one love and under what 
conditions can love be honorable both for the beloved and for 
the lover?
