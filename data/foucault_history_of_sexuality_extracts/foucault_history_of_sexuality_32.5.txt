it with. As to the idea of a power-repression, you have re¬ 
tained its most fragile theoretical element, and this in order 
to criticize it; you have retained the most sterilizing political 
consequence of the idea of power-law, but only in order to 
preserve it for your own use. 

The aim of the inquiries that will follow is to move less 
toward a “theory” of power than toward an “analytics” of 
power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain 
formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of 
the instruments that will make possible its analysis. How¬ 
ever, it seems to me that this analytics can be constituted 
only if it frees itself completely from a certain representation 
of power that I would term—it will be seen later why— 
“juridico-discursive.” It is this conception that governs both 
the thematics of repression and the theory of the law as 
constitutive of desire. In other words, what distinguishes the 
analysis made in terms of the repression of instincts from 
that made in terms of the law of desire is clearly the way in

which they each conceive of the nature and dynamics of the 
drives, not the way in which they conceive of power. They 
both rely on a common representation of power which, de¬ 
pending on the use made of it and the position it is accorded 
with respect to desire, leads to two contrary results: either to 
the promise of a “liberation,” if power is seen as having only 
an external hold on desire, or, if it is constitutive of desire 
itself, to the affirmation: you are always-already trapped. 
Moreover, one must not imagine that this representation is 
peculiar to those who are concerned with the problem of the 
relations of power with sex. In fact it is much more general; 
one frequently encounters it in political analyses of power, 
and it is deeply rooted in the history of the West. 

These are some of its principal features: 

— The negative relation. It never establishes any connec¬ 
tion between power and sex that is not negative: rejection, 
exclusion, refusal, blockage, concealment, or mask. Where 
sex and pleasure are concerned, power can “do” nothing but 
say no to them; what it produces, if anything, is absences and 
gaps; it overlooks elements, introduces discontinuities, sepa¬
