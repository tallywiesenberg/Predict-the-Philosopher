Or at least, all these questions will be subordinated 
to another, primary and fundamental question: what is love in 
its very being?13 

In order to measure the Platonic elaboration and the dis¬ 
tance that separates it from the prevailing erotics, it may be 
useful to recall the way in which Xenophon replies to this 
same question.He stresses the traditional elements: the oppo¬ 
sition between the love that seeks only the pleasure of the lover 
and that which also manifests a concern for the beloved him¬ 
self; the necessity of transforming ephemeral love into a mu¬ 
tual, egalitarian, and lasting friendship.Inth t Symposium and 
the Memorabilia, Xenophon presents a Socrates who draws a 
strict dividing line between love of the soul and love of the 
body, disqualifies the love of the body in his own person, 
makes love of the soul the true love and seeks in friendship 
(philia) the principle that gives value to every relation (sy- 
nousia ).14 It follows that to join love of the soul to love of the

body is not sufficient; one must rid every attachment of its 
physical dimensions (when one loves “the body and the soul 
at the same time,” it is the first that will dominate, and the 
fading of youth causes friendship itself to wither away);' 3 one 
should follow the example of Socrates and shun all contact, 
forgo the kisses that are likely to hinder the soul, and even take 
care that one’s body doesn’t touch another’s, and doesn’t feel 
its “bite.” 16 In positive terms, every relationship must be based 
on the constituent elements of friendship: benefits and services 
rendered, efforts for the improvement of the boy one loves, 
mutual affection, a permanent bond established once and for 
all.
