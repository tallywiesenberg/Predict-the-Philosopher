17 Does this mean that for Xenophon (or for the Socrates 
that Xenophon portrays) there should not be any eros between 
two men, but only a relationship of philia?This is in fact the 
ideal that Xenophon claims to recognize in the Sparta of 
Lycurgus.18 According to him, Spartan men who were at¬ 
tracted to the bodies of boys were declared “vile,” whereas 
people praised and encouraged “honest” adults who loved 
nothing but the soul of youths and aspired only to become 
friends with them; so that in Sparta “lovers were no less 
restrained in their love for children than were fathers with 
respect to their sons, or brothers with respect to their broth¬ 
ers.” But in the Symposium, Xenophon gives a less schematic 
image of this division.He outlines a conception of eros and its 
pleasures that would have friendship itself as the goal.Friend¬ 
ship, insofar as it implies a life in commott, reciprocal atten¬ 
tion, kindness to one another, and shared feelings, is not made 
a substitute for love or something that would take over from 
it in due time.
