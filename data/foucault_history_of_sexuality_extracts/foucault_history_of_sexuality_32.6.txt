Xenophon makes it the very thing lovers should 
be enamored of: erontes tes philias, he says, employing a char¬ 
acteristic expression that makes it possible to save eros, to 
maintain its force, but without giving it a concrete content 
apart from the behavior that results from the mutual and 
lasting affection of friendship.19 

Platonic erotics is constructed very differently, even if the 
starting point of reflection is in the familiar question of the

place to assign the aphrodisia in the love relation.For in fact 
Plato takes up these traditional questions only in order to 
show how, in the hasty replies that are given to them, the basic 
problem is overlooked.The first two speeches of the Phaedrus, the naive speech 
of Lysias and the facetious speech of Socrates, argue that a 
boy should not yield to the one who loves him.Such talk, 
Socrates remarks, cannot tell the truth: “False is the tale [ 
ouk esti etymos logos] which says that because the lover is 
mad and the non-lover sane the non-lover should be given 
the preference when one might have a lover.” 20 In contrary 
fashion, and out of a concern to praise love instead of offend¬ 
ing it, the beginning speeches of the Symposium assert that it 
is fine to yield provided one does so in the right way, to a 
noble lover, 21 that there is nothing indecent or shameful in it, 
and that under the law of love “where there is mutual con¬ 
sent there is what the law proclaims to be right.” 22 These 
speeches are more respectf ul of love, but that does not make 
them any more etymoi than those of Lysias and his ironic 
fault-finder in the Phaedrus.
