Counterposed to them, the words of Diotima, reported in 
the Symposium, and the great fable of the Phaedrus, nar¬ 
rated by Socrates himself, stand as discourses etymoi: true 
discourses, and related by their origin to the truth that they 
tell.What makes them such?How are they different from 
the panegyrics or disqualifications that preceded them?The 
difference is not in the fact that Diotima or Socrates are 
more rigorous or more austere than the other interlocutors; 
they do not oppose these other speeches because the latter 
are too accommodating, making too much allowance for the 
body and the pleasures in a love that should be directed only 
to souls.They set themselves apart because they do not pose 
the problem in the same way; they carry out a certain num¬ 
ber of basic transformations and displacements with regard 
to the game of questions that were traditional in discussions 
about love.
