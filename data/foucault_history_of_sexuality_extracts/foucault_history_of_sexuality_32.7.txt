The Use of Pleasure 


1.From the question of amorous behavior to an inquiry into 
the nature of love.In the debate as it is formulated in the 
other speeches, love and the intense and forceful movement 
that takes hold of the lover are presupposed; this love “being 
granted,” 23 the main point of preoccupation is in knowing how 
the two partners ought to conduct themselves; how, in what 
form, to what extent, with the help of what means of persua¬ 
sion or by giving what assurances of friendship, should the 
lover seek to attain “that to which he aspires”; and how, in 
what conditions, after what resistances and tests, should the 
beloved yield?A question of conduct, grounded in a preexist¬ 
ing love.Now, the subject of Diotima and Socrates’ inquiry 
is the very being of this love, its nature and its origin, that 
which makes it strong, and that which moves it so stubbornly 
or so madly toward its object: “What is the essential nature 
of Love, what are his characteristics, and then what are his 
works?” 24 An ontological inquiry and no longer a question of 
deontology.
