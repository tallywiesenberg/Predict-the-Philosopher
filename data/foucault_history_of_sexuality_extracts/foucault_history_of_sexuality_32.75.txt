All the other interlocutors orient their speeches 
toward praise or criticism, toward the division between good 
and bad love, toward the delimitation of what one should and 
should not do; in the customary thematics with its search for 
appropriateness and its elaboration of an art of courtship, the 
primary object of reflection is conduct or the game of recipro¬ 
cal conducts.Plato puts this question aside, at least provision¬ 
ally, and, going beyond the division of good and bad, he raises 
the question of what it means to love.* 

Now, to state the question in this way implies, first of all, 
a displacement of the very object of discourse.Diotima re¬ 
proaches Socrates—and in fact all the authors of the preceding 
encomiums—for having looked to the “beloved” object (ton 
eromenon) for the principle of what needed to be said about 
love; they thus let themselves be blinded by the charm, beauty, 
and perfection of the beloved boy, and they mistakenly at¬ 
tributed his merits to love itself; the latter will manifest its 

‘After Phaedrus’ speeches, Socrates points out that there has to be in the mind of 
the speaker “knowledge of the truth about the subject of the speech.”"

and not in its object.So it is necessary to leave off thinking 
about the beloved and redirect one’s inquiry to the one who 
loves (to eron), questioning him in his own condition.
