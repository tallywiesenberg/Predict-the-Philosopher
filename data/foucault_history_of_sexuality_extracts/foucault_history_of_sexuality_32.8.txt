via the theory of souls.But as a result of this displacement, 
the discourse on love will have to face the risk of being nothing 
more than an “encomium” (in the composite form of praise 
addressed both to love and to the beloved); it will have to 
speak—as in the Symposium —of the “intermediate” nature of 
love, the deficiency that characterizes it (since it does not 
possess the beautiful things that it desires), the parentage of 
poverty and contrivance, of ignorance and knowledge from 
which it is born; it will also have to speak, as in the Sympo¬ 
sium, of the way in which forgetfulness and remembrance of 
the supracelestial vision are mixed in love, and of the long 
road of suffering that will lead it finally to its goal.2.From the question of the boy's honor to that of love of truth.To say, as Diotima does, that it is better to turn one’s thoughts 
from the beloved object to the loving principle does not mean 
that the question of the object is no longer posed: on the 
contrary, the whole development that follows that basic for¬ 
mulation is devoted to determining what is loved when there 
is love.
