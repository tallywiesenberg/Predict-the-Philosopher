Beyond the 
different beautiful objects that the amorous individual may 
become attached to, Diotima shows Socrates that love seeks 
to beget spiritual children, and to contemplate “absolute 
beauty” in its true nature, in its unalloyed purity, and in the 
“oneness of its form.” And in the Phaedrus, it is Socrates 
himself who shows how the soul, if it has a strong enough 
memory of what it has seen beyond the heavens, if it is ener¬ 
getically driven, and if it does not allow impure appetites to 
rob it of its momentum, will attach itself to the beloved object 
only insofar as the latter reflects and imitates beauty itself.One does find in Plato the theme that love should be di¬ 
rected to the soul of boys rather than to their bodies.But he 
was not the first or the only one to say this.It was a theme 
that ran through the traditional discussions on love, with 
consequences that varied in their rigor.Attributing the theme 
to Socrates, Xenophon gives it a radical form.
