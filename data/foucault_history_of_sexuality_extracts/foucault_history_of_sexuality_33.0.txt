rates what is joined, and marks off boundaries. Its effects take 
the general form of limit and lack. 

— The insistence of the rule. Power is essentially what 
dictates its law to sex. Which means first of all that sex is 
placed by power in a binary system: licit and illicit, permitted 
and forbidden. Secondly, power prescribes an “order” for sex 
that operates at the same time as a form of intelligibility: sex 
is to be deciphered on the basis of its relation to the law. And 
finally, power acts by laying down the rule: power’s hold on 
sex is maintained through language, or rather through the 
act of discourse that creates, from the very fact that it is 
articulated, a rule of law. It speaks, and that is the rule. The 
pure form of power resides in the function of the legislator; 
and its mode of action with regard to sex is of a juridico- 
discursive character.

The History of Sexuality 


—The cycle of prohibition: thou shalt not go near, thou 
shalt not touch, thou shalt not consume, thou shalt not 
experience pleasure, thou shalt not speak, thou shalt not 
show thyself; ultimately thou shalt not exist, except in dark¬ 
ness and secrecy. To deal with sex, power employs nothing 
more than a law of prohibition. Its objective: that sex re¬ 
nounce itself. Its instrument: the threat of a punishment that 
is nothing other than the suppression of sex. Renounce your¬ 
self or suffer the penalty of being suppressed; do not appear 
if you do not want to disappear. Your existence will be 
maintained only at the cost of your nullification. Power con¬ 
strains sex only through a taboo that plays on the alternative 
between two nonexistences. 

— The logic of censorship. This interdiction is thought to 
take three forms: affirming that such a thing is not permitted, 
preventing it from being said, denying that it exists. Forms 
that are difficult to reconcile. But it is here that one imagines 
a sort of logical sequence that characterizes censorship 
mechanisms: it links the inexistent, the illicit, and the inex¬ 
pressible in such a way that each is at the same time the 
principle and the effect of the others: one must not talk about 
what is forbidden until it is annulled in reality; what is inex¬ 
istent has no right to show itself, even in the order of speech 
where its inexistence is declared; and that which one must 
keep silent about is banished from reality as the thing that 
is tabooed above all else. The logic of power exerted on sex 
is the paradoxical logic of a law that might be expressed as 
an injunction of nonexistence, nonmanifestation, and silence. 

—The uniformity of the apparatus. Power over sex is exer¬ 
cised in the same way at all levels. From top to bottom, in 
its over-all decisions and its capillary interventions alike, 
whatever the devices or institutions on which it relies, it acts 
in a uniform and comprehensive manner; it operates accord¬ 
ing to the simple and endlessly reproduced mechanisms of 
law, taboo, and censorship: from state to family, from prince 
to father, from the tribunal to the small change of everyday

punishments, from the agencies of social domination to the 
structures that constitute the subject himself, one finds a 
general form of power, varying in scale alone. This form is 
the law of transgression and punishment, with its interplay 
of licit and illicit. Whether one attributes to it the form of the 
prince who formulates rights, of the father who forbids, of 
the censor who enforces silence, or of the master who states 
the law, in any case one schematizes power in a juridical 
form, and one defines its effects as obedience. Confronted by 
a power that is law, the subject who is constituted as subject 
—who is “subjected”—is he who obeys. To the formal 
homogeneity of power in these various instances corresponds 
the general form of submission in the one who is constrained 
by it—whether the individual in question is the subject oppo¬ 
site the monarch, the citizen opposite the state, the child 
opposite the parent, or the disciple opposite the master. A 
legislative power on one side, and an obedient subject on the 
other. 

Underlying both the general theme that power represses 
sex and the idea that the law constitutes desire, one encoun¬ 
ters the same putative mechanics of power. It is defined in 
a strangely restrictive way, in that, to begin with, this power 
is poor in resources, sparing of its methods, monotonous in 
the tactics it utilizes, incapable of invention, and seemingly 
doomed always to repeat itself. Further, it is a power that 
only has the force of the negative on its side, a power to say 
no; in no condition to produce, capable only of posting limits,
