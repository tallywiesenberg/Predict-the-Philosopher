rates what is joined, and marks off boundaries. Its effects take 
the general form of limit and lack. 

— The insistence of the rule. Power is essentially what 
dictates its law to sex. Which means first of all that sex is 
placed by power in a binary system: licit and illicit, permitted 
and forbidden. Secondly, power prescribes an “order” for sex 
that operates at the same time as a form of intelligibility: sex 
is to be deciphered on the basis of its relation to the law. And 
finally, power acts by laying down the rule: power’s hold on 
sex is maintained through language, or rather through the 
act of discourse that creates, from the very fact that it is 
articulated, a rule of law. It speaks, and that is the rule. The 
pure form of power resides in the function of the legislator; 
and its mode of action with regard to sex is of a juridico- 
discursive character.

The History of Sexuality 


—The cycle of prohibition: thou shalt not go near, thou 
shalt not touch, thou shalt not consume, thou shalt not 
experience pleasure, thou shalt not speak, thou shalt not 
show thyself; ultimately thou shalt not exist, except in dark¬ 
ness and secrecy. To deal with sex, power employs nothing 
more than a law of prohibition. Its objective: that sex re¬ 
nounce itself. Its instrument: the threat of a punishment that 
is nothing other than the suppression of sex. Renounce your¬ 
self or suffer the penalty of being suppressed; do not appear 
if you do not want to disappear. Your existence will be 
maintained only at the cost of your nullification. Power con¬ 
strains sex only through a taboo that plays on the alternative 
between two nonexistences. 

— The logic of censorship. This interdiction is thought to 
take three forms: affirming that such a thing is not permitted, 
preventing it from being said, denying that it exists. Forms 
that are difficult to reconcile. But it is here that one imagines 
a sort of logical sequence that characterizes censorship 
mechanisms: it links the inexistent, the illicit, and the inex¬ 
pressible in such a way that each is at the same time the 
principle and the effect of the others: one must not talk about 
what is forbidden until it is annulled in reality; what is inex¬ 
istent has no right to show itself, even in the order of speech 
where its inexistence is declared; and that which one must
