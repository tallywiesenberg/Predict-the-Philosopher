But the nature of 
this response was problematic: it could not be exactly symmet¬ 
rical to that which gave rise to it; more than the lover’s desire 
and pleasure, it was his benevolence, his good turns, his tender 
care, and his example that the boy was supposed to recipro¬ 
cate, and it was necessary to await the time when the tran¬ 
sports of love would cease and age would calm the passions 
and so remove the dangers before the two friends could

object in relation to the other’s love, simply waiting to receive, 
by the terms of the exchange to which he is entitled (since he 
is loved), the counsel he needs and the knowledge to which he 
aspires.It is right that he should actually become a subject in 
this love relation.In fact, this is the reason for the reversal,

changes the focus of the discussion from the lover to the one 
who is loved.
