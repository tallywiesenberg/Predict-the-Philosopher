Socrates has described the journey, the fervor, 
and the suffering of the one who loves, and the hard struggle 
he has had to conduct in order to gain control of his team.Now he turns his attention to the loved one: the young boy’s 
companions have perhaps made him think that it is not good 
to yield to a lover; nevertheless he begins to accept the com¬ 
pany of his lover; the latter’s presence excites him to distrac¬ 
tion; he in his turn feels uplifted by the rising wave of desire, 
wings and plumage start to grow in his soul.29 Of course, he 
still does not know the true nature of that which he longs for, 
and he finds no words with which to name it; but he “throws 
his arms” around his lover and “gives him kisses.” 30 This 
moment is important: unlike what occurs in the art of court¬ 
ship, the “dialectic of love” in this case calls for two move¬ 
ments exactly alike on the part of the two lovers; the love is 
the same for both of them, since it is the motion that carries 
them toward truth.4.From the virtue of the loved boy to the master's love and 
wisdom.
