In the art of courtship, it fell to the lover to do the 
wooing; and even though he was expected to keep control of

relation to truth which now structures it, a new figure makes 
its appearance: that of the master, coming to take the place of

mastery that he exercises over himself, will turn the game 
upside down, reverse the roles, establish the principle of a 
renunciation of the aphrodisia, and become, for all young men 
who are eager for truth, an object of love.This is doubtless the meaning that should be given to the 
description, in the last pages of the Symposium, of the rela¬ 
tions that Socrates maintains not only with Alcibiades, but 
also with Charmides, the son of Glaucon; with Euthydemus, 
the son of Diodes; and with many others in addition.
