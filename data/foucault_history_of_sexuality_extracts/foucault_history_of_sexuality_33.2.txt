distribution of roles is completely reversed: it is the young 
boys—those who are beautiful, with many suitors—who are 
enamored of Socrates; they dog his footsteps, they try to se¬ 
duce him, they would like very much to grant him their favors 
—that is, for him to communicate the treasure of his wisdom.They are in the position of erastes, and he, the old man with 
the ugly body, is in the position of eromenos.But what they 
are not aware of, and what Alcibiades discovers in the course 
of the famous “test,” is that Socrates is loved by them only to 
the extent that he is able to resist their seduction; which does 
not mean that he feels no love or desire for them, but that he 
is moved by the force of true love, and that he knows how 
truly to love the truth that must be loved.Diotima had said 
this before: it was he who was wisest of all on the subject of
