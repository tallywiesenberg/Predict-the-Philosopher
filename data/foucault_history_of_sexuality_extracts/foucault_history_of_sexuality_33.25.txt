But it should be understood that these powers are operative 
here in the quite particular game of Eros; they ensure the 
domination that Socrates is able to exercise over himself in the 
game; and hence they qualify him as the highest object of love 
to which young men might appeal, but at the same time, as 
the only one who can guide their love all the way to truth.Into 
the lover’s game where different dominations confronted one 
another (that of the lover seeking to get control of the beloved, 
that of the beloved seeking to escape, and seeking, by means 
of his resistance, to enslave the lover), Socrates introduces 
another type of domination: that which is exercised by the 
master of truth and for which he is qualified by the dominion 
he exercises over himself.Platonic erotics can thus be considered from three view¬ 
points.First, it is a way of responding to an inherent diffi¬ 
culty, for Greek culture, in relationships between men and 
boys: namely, the question of what status to give the latter as 
objects of pleasure.From this angle, Plato’s answer seems 
only more complex and more elaborate than those that 
might have been put forward in the various “debates” on 
love, or—by “Socrates”—in the texts of Xenophon.
