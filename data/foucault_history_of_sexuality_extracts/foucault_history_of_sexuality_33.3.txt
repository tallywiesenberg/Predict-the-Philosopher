Actu¬ 
ally, Plato resolves the difficulty of the object of pleasure by 
bringing the question of the loved individual back to the na¬ 
ture of love itself; by structuring the love relation as a rela¬

loved as well as in the one who is in love; and by reversing 
the role of the loved young man, making him a lover of the 
master of truth.In this sense, one can say that it meets the

latter a true content.It shows how it is indeed the same love 
which, in the same movement, can make a man both paide-

according to a completely different movement, by taking a 
completely different form, and by imposing a quite different 
game: that of a process in which the master of truth teaches 
the boy the meaning of wisdom.But it becomes apparent that Platonic erotics—and this is 
the other side of it—thereby introduces the question of truth 
into the love relation as a fundamental question.
