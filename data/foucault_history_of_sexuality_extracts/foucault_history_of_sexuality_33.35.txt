And this is 
in an altogether different form from that of the logos to which 
it is necessary to submit one’s appetites in the use of pleasures.The lover’s task, the accomplishment of which will in fact 
enable him to reach his goal, is to recognize the true nature 
of the love that has seized him.And here the answer to the 
challenge of Aristophanes transforms the answer the latter 
gave: it is not the other half of himself that the individual seeks 
in the other person; it is the truth to which his soul is related.Hence the ethical work he will have to do will be to discover 
and hold fast, without ever letting go, to that relation to truth 
which was the hidden medium of his love.And one thus sees 
how Platonic reflection tends to detach itself from a common 
problematization that revolved around the object and the sta¬ 
tus that ought to be given to him, in order to open a line of 
inquiry concerning love, which will revolve around the subject 
and the truth he is capable of.
