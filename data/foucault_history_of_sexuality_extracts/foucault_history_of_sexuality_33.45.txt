The inquiry is thereby displaced: 
in reflection on the chresis aphrodision, it dealt with pleasure 
and its dynamics, the just practice and the right distribution 
of which were to be ensured through self-mastery.In the 
Platonic reflection on love, the inquiry concerns the desire 
that must be led to its true object (which is truth) by recog¬ 
nizing it for what it truly is.The life of moderation, of so- 
phrosyne, as it is described in the Laws, is a life “that is mild 
in every way, with gentle pains and gentle pleasures, a life 
characterized by desires that are mild [eremaiai hedonai, 
malakai epithumiai] and loves that are not mad [erotes ouk 
emmaneis ]”; 33 this statement speaks of an economy of pleas¬ 
ures ensured by the control that is exercised by oneself over 
oneself.To.the soul whose voyage and amorous strivings are 
described by the Phaedrus, it is also recommended, if she is 
to receive her reward beyond the heavens, to practice “an 
orderly regimen” (tetagmene diaite) that is possible because 
she is “mistress of herself’ and she is “heedful of measure,” 
she has “subjected the power of evil” and “liberated the 
power of virtue.” 34 But the struggle she has been able to sus¬ 
tain against the violence of her appetites, she would not have 
been able to conduct it without a twofold relation to truth: a 
relation to her own desire questioned in its being, and a rela¬ 
tion to the object of her desire recognized as a true being.
