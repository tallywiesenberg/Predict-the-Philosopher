keep silent about is banished from reality as the thing that 
is tabooed above all else. The logic of power exerted on sex 
is the paradoxical logic of a law that might be expressed as 
an injunction of nonexistence, nonmanifestation, and silence. 

—The uniformity of the apparatus. Power over sex is exer¬ 
cised in the same way at all levels. From top to bottom, in 
its over-all decisions and its capillary interventions alike, 
whatever the devices or institutions on which it relies, it acts 
in a uniform and comprehensive manner; it operates accord¬ 
ing to the simple and endlessly reproduced mechanisms of 
law, taboo, and censorship: from state to family, from prince 
to father, from the tribunal to the small change of everyday

punishments, from the agencies of social domination to the 
structures that constitute the subject himself, one finds a 
general form of power, varying in scale alone. This form is 
the law of transgression and punishment, with its interplay 
of licit and illicit. Whether one attributes to it the form of the 
prince who formulates rights, of the father who forbids, of 
the censor who enforces silence, or of the master who states 
the law, in any case one schematizes power in a juridical 
form, and one defines its effects as obedience. Confronted by 
a power that is law, the subject who is constituted as subject 
—who is “subjected”—is he who obeys. To the formal 
homogeneity of power in these various instances corresponds 
the general form of submission in the one who is constrained 
by it—whether the individual in question is the subject oppo¬ 
site the monarch, the citizen opposite the state, the child 
opposite the parent, or the disciple opposite the master. A 
legislative power on one side, and an obedient subject on the 
other. 

Underlying both the general theme that power represses 
sex and the idea that the law constitutes desire, one encoun¬ 
ters the same putative mechanics of power. It is defined in 
a strangely restrictive way, in that, to begin with, this power 
is poor in resources, sparing of its methods, monotonous in 
the tactics it utilizes, incapable of invention, and seemingly 
doomed always to repeat itself. Further, it is a power that 
only has the force of the negative on its side, a power to say 
no; in no condition to produce, capable only of posting limits,
