To this male love, and more precisely to 
this love of young boys and adolescents—a love that was later 
to be so severely condemned for such a long time—the Greeks 
granted a legitimacy, which we are fond of seeing as proof of 
the freedom they granted themselves in this domain.And yet 
it was in connection with this love, much more than with 
health (which also preoccupied them) and much more than 
with women and marriage (the orderliness of which they 
nevertheless sought to maintain), that they spoke of the need 
to practice the strictest austerities.To be sure, except in a few 
instances, they did not condemn it or prohibit it.And yet it 
is in the reflection on love of boys that one sees the principle 
of “indefinite abstention” formulated; the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion, which Socrates exemplifies by his faultless resistance of 
temptation; and the theme that this renunciation has a high 
spiritual value by itself.In a way that may be surprising at 
first, one sees the formation, in Greek culture and in connec¬ 
tion with the love of boys, of some of the major elements of 
a sexual ethics that will renounce that love by appealing to the 
above principle: the requirement of a symmetry and reciproc¬ 
ity in the love relationship; the necessity of a long and arduous 
struggle with oneself; the gradual purification of a love that is 
addressed only to being per se, in its truth; and man’s inquiry 
into himself as a subject of desire.
