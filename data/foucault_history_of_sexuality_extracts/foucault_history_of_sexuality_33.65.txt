One would find in the literature that they have left us 
much evidence of other themes and preoccupations.But re¬ 
stricting oneself, as I have tried to do here, to the prescriptive 
discourses by which they attempted to reflect on and regulate 
their sexual conduct, these three focuses of problematization 
appear to have been the most important ones by far.Around 
them, the Greeks developed arts of living, of conducting them¬ 
selves, and of “using pleasures” according to austere and de¬ 
manding principles.At first glance, one can have the impression that these three 
different forms of reflection bear a close resemblance to the 
forms of austerity that will be found later, in the Western, 
Christian societies.In any case, one may be tempted to correct 
the still rather commonly accepted notion of an opposition 
between a pagan thought that “tolerated” the practice of “sex¬ 
ual freedom” and the gloomy and restrictive moralities that 
succeeded it.
