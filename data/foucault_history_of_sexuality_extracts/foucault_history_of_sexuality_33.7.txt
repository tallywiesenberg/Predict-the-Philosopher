In fact, though, it is important to recognize that 
the principle of a rigorous and diligently practiced sexual

the fourth century, one finds very clearly formulated the idea 
that sexual activity is sufficiently hazardous and costly in 
itself, and sufficiently linked to the loss of the vital substance, 
to require a meticulous economy that would discourage un¬

nial relationship that would demand a similar abstention from 
all “extramarital” pleasure by either spouse.Furthermore, 
one finds the theme of the man’s renunciation of all physical 
relations with a boy.A general principle of moderation, a 
suspicion that sexual pleasure might be an evil, the schema of 
a strict monogamous fidelity, the ideal of an absolute chastity: 
obviously it was not according to such a model that the Greeks 
lived; but isn’t it the case that the philosophical, moral, and 
medical thought that formed in their midst formulated some 
of the basic principles that later ethics—and particularly those 
found in the Christian societies—seem to have only had to 
revive?
