If one wanted to assign an origin to those few great 
themes that shaped our sexual morality (the idea that pleasure 
belongs to the dangerous domain of evil, the obligation to 
practice monogamous fidelity, the exclusion of partners of the 
same sex), not only would it be a mistake to attribute them to 
that fiction called “Judeo-Christian” morality, it would be a 
bigger mistake to look behind them for the timeless operation 
of prohibition, or the permanent form of law.The sexual 
austerity that was prematurely recommended by Greek phi¬ 
losophy is not rooted in the timelessness of a law that would 
take the historically diverse forms of repression, one after the 
other.It belongs to a history that is more decisive for compre¬ 
hending the transformations of moral experience than the 
history of codes: a history of “ethics,” understood as the elabo¬ 
ration of a form of relation to self that enables an individual 
to fashion himself into a subject of ethical conduct.Further, each of the three great arts of self-conduct, the 
three major techniques of the self, that were developed in 
Greek thought—dietetics, economics, and erotics—proposed, 
if not a particular sexual ethics, then at least a singular modu¬ 
lation of sexual conduct.In this elaboration of the demands 
of austerity, not only did the Greeks not seek to define a code 
of conducts binding everyone, neither did they seek to orga¬ 
nize sexual behavior as a domain governed in all its aspects by 
one and the same set of principles.
