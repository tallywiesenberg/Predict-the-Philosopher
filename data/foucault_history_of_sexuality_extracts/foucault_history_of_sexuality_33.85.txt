In dietetics, one finds a form of moderation defined by the 
measured and timely use of the aphrodisia; the practice of this 
moderation called for an attention centered mainly on the 
question of “the right time” and on the correlation between 
the variable states of the body and the changing proprieties of 
the seasons.And at the core of this preoccupation there was 
manifested a fear of violence, a dread of exhaustion, and a 
twofold anxiety about the survival of the individual and the 
maintenance of the species.In economics, one finds a form of 
moderation defined not by the mutual faithfulness of marriage

partners, but by a certain privilege, which the husband 
upholds on behalf of the lawf ul wife over whom he exercises 
his authority; the temporal objective in this case is not to seize 
the opportune moment, but to maintain, throughout life, a 
certain hierarchical structure appropriate to the household; it 
is with a view to ensuring this permanence that the man must 
fear all excess and practice self-control in the control he exer¬ 
cises over others.Lastly, the moderation that is required by 
erotics is of another type still, for even though it does not call 
for pure and simple abstention, we have seen that it tends in 
that direction and that it carries with it the ideal of a renuncia¬ 
tion of all physical relations with boys.This erotics is linked 
to a perception of time that is very different from that found 
in connection with the body and with marriage: it experiences 
a fleeting time that leads ineluctably to an end that is near.
