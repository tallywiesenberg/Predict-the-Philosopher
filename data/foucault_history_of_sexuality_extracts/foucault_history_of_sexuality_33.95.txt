Their sexual ethics, from 
which our own derives in part, rested on a very harsh system 
of inequalities and constraints (particularly in connection with 
women and slaves); but it was problematized in thought as the 
relationship, for a free man, between the exercise of his free¬ 
dom, the forms of his power, and his access to truth.Taking a very schematic, bird’s-eye view of the history of 
this ethics and its transformations over a long period of time, 
one notes first of all a shift of emphasis.It is clear that in 
classical Greek thought it was the relationship with boys that 
constituted the most delicate point, and the most active focus 
of reflection and elaboration; it was here that the problemati- 
zation called for the most subtle forms of austerity.Now, 
surveying the course of a very slow evolution, we can see this 
focus move elsewhere: it is around women that, little by little, 
the problems come to be centered.This does not mean that the 
love of boys will no longer be practiced, nor that it will cease 
to be expressed, nor that people will no longer raise questions 
about it.
