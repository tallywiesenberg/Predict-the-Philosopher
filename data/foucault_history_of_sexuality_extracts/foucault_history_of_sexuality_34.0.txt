it is basically anti-energy. This is the paradox of its effective¬ 
ness: it is incapable of doing anything, except to render what 
it dominates incapable of doing anything either, except for 
what this power allows it to do. And finally, it is a power 
whose model is essentially juridical, centered on nothing 
more than the statement of the law and the operation of 
taboos. All the modes of domination, submission, and subju¬ 
gation are ultimately reduced to an effect of obedience.

Why is this juridical notion of power, involving as it does 
the neglect of everything that makes for its productive effec¬ 
tiveness, its strategic resourcefulness, its positivity, so readily 
accepted? In a society such as ours, where the devices of 
power are so numerous, its rituals so visible, and its instru¬ 
ments ultimately so reliable, in this society that has been 
more imaginative, probably, than any other in creating devi¬ 
ous and supple mechanisms of power, what explains this 
tendency not to recognize the latter except in the negative 
and emaciated form of prohibition? Why are the deploy¬ 
ments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law 
of interdiction? 

Let me offer a general and tactical reason that seems self- 
evident: power is tolerable only on condition that it mask a 
substantial part of itself. Its success is proportional to its 
ability to hide its own mechanisms. Would power be ac¬ 
cepted if it were entirely cynical? For it, secrecy is not in the 
nature of an abuse; it is indispensable to its operation. Not 
only because power imposes secrecy on those whom it domi¬ 
nates, but because it is perhaps just as indispensable to the 
latter: would they accept it if they did not see it as a mere 
limit placed on their desire, leaving a measure of freedom— 
however slight—intact? Power as a pure limit set on freedom 
is, at least in our society, the general form of its acceptability. 

There is, perhaps, a historical reason for this. The great 
institutions of power that developed in the Middle Ages— 
monarchy, the state with its apparatus—rose up on the basis 
of a multiplicity of prior powers, and to a certain extent in 
opposition to them: dense, entangled, conflicting powers, 
powers tied to the direct or indirect dominion over the land, 
to the possession of arms, to serfdom, to bonds of suzerainty
