it is basically anti-energy. This is the paradox of its effective¬ 
ness: it is incapable of doing anything, except to render what 
it dominates incapable of doing anything either, except for 
what this power allows it to do. And finally, it is a power 
whose model is essentially juridical, centered on nothing 
more than the statement of the law and the operation of 
taboos. All the modes of domination, submission, and subju¬ 
gation are ultimately reduced to an effect of obedience.

Why is this juridical notion of power, involving as it does 
the neglect of everything that makes for its productive effec¬ 
tiveness, its strategic resourcefulness, its positivity, so readily 
accepted? In a society such as ours, where the devices of 
power are so numerous, its rituals so visible, and its instru¬ 
ments ultimately so reliable, in this society that has been 
more imaginative, probably, than any other in creating devi¬ 
ous and supple mechanisms of power, what explains this 
tendency not to recognize the latter except in the negative 
and emaciated form of prohibition? Why are the deploy¬ 
ments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law 
of interdiction? 

Let me offer a general and tactical reason that seems self- 
evident: power is tolerable only on condition that it mask a 
substantial part of itself. Its success is proportional to its 
ability to hide its own mechanisms. Would power be ac¬ 
cepted if it were entirely cynical? For it, secrecy is not in the 
nature of an abuse; it is indispensable to its operation. Not 
only because power imposes secrecy on those whom it domi¬ 
nates, but because it is perhaps just as indispensable to the 
latter: would they accept it if they did not see it as a mere 
limit placed on their desire, leaving a measure of freedom— 
however slight—intact? Power as a pure limit set on freedom 
is, at least in our society, the general form of its acceptability. 

There is, perhaps, a historical reason for this. The great 
institutions of power that developed in the Middle Ages— 
monarchy, the state with its apparatus—rose up on the basis 
of a multiplicity of prior powers, and to a certain extent in 
opposition to them: dense, entangled, conflicting powers, 
powers tied to the direct or indirect dominion over the land, 
to the possession of arms, to serfdom, to bonds of suzerainty 
and vassalage. If these institutions were able to implant 
themselves, if, by profiting from a whole series of tactical 
alliances, they were able to gain acceptance, this was because 
they presented themselves as agencies of regulation, arbitra¬ 
tion, and demarcation, as a way of introducing order in the

midst of these powers, of establishing a principle that would 
temper them and distribute them according to boundaries 
and a fixed hierarchy. Faced with a myriad of clashing 
forces, these great forms of power functioned as a principle 
of right that transcended all the heterogeneous claims, mani¬ 
festing the triple distinction of forming a unitary regime, of 
identifying its will with the law, and of acting through mech¬ 
anisms of interdiction and sanction. The slogan of this re¬ 
gime, pax et justitia, in keeping with the function it laid claim 
to, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private 
wars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling 
of lawsuits. Doubtless there was more to this development of 
great monarchic institutions than a pure and simple juridical 
edifice. But such was the language of power, the representa¬ 
tion it gave of itself, and the entire theory of public law that 
was constructed in the Middle Ages, or reconstructed from 
Roman law, bears witness to the fact. Law was not simply 
a weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the mo¬ 
narchic system’s mode of manifestation and the form of its 
acceptability. In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the 
exercise of power has always been formulated in terms of 
law. 

A tradition dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth 
century has accustomed us to place absolute monarchic 
power on the side of the unlawful: arbitrariness, abuse, ca¬ 
price, willfulness, privileges and exceptions, the traditional 
continuance of accomplished facts. But this is to overlook a 
fundamental historical trait of Western monarchies: they 
were constructed as systems of law, they expressed them¬ 
selves through theories of law, and they made their mech¬ 
anisms of power work in the form of law. The old reproach 
that Boulainvilliers directed at the French monarchy—that 
it used the law and jurists to do away with rights and to bring 
down the aristocracy—was basically warranted by the facts.
