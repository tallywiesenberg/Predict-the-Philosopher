and vassalage. If these institutions were able to implant 
themselves, if, by profiting from a whole series of tactical 
alliances, they were able to gain acceptance, this was because 
they presented themselves as agencies of regulation, arbitra¬ 
tion, and demarcation, as a way of introducing order in the

midst of these powers, of establishing a principle that would 
temper them and distribute them according to boundaries 
and a fixed hierarchy. Faced with a myriad of clashing 
forces, these great forms of power functioned as a principle 
of right that transcended all the heterogeneous claims, mani¬ 
festing the triple distinction of forming a unitary regime, of 
identifying its will with the law, and of acting through mech¬ 
anisms of interdiction and sanction. The slogan of this re¬ 
gime, pax et justitia, in keeping with the function it laid claim 
to, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private 
wars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling 
of lawsuits. Doubtless there was more to this development of 
great monarchic institutions than a pure and simple juridical 
edifice. But such was the language of power, the representa¬ 
tion it gave of itself, and the entire theory of public law that 
was constructed in the Middle Ages, or reconstructed from 
Roman law, bears witness to the fact. Law was not simply 
a weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the mo¬ 
narchic system’s mode of manifestation and the form of its 
acceptability. In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the 
exercise of power has always been formulated in terms of 
law. 

A tradition dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth 
century has accustomed us to place absolute monarchic 
power on the side of the unlawful: arbitrariness, abuse, ca¬ 
price, willfulness, privileges and exceptions, the traditional 
continuance of accomplished facts. But this is to overlook a 
fundamental historical trait of Western monarchies: they 
were constructed as systems of law, they expressed them¬ 
selves through theories of law, and they made their mech¬ 
anisms of power work in the form of law. The old reproach 
that Boulainvilliers directed at the French monarchy—that 
it used the law and jurists to do away with rights and to bring 
down the aristocracy—was basically warranted by the facts.
