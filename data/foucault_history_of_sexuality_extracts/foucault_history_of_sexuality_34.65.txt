On the dangers of music, see Plato, Republic, III, 398e (the 
Lydian modes are harmful even to women, let alone men).On 
the mnemonic role of odors and of the visual image, see ArisÂ¬ 
totle, Nicomachean Ethics, III, 10, 1118a.10.One finds a reproach of this kind repeated much later in the 
Affairs of the Heart (attributed to Lucian), 53.11.
