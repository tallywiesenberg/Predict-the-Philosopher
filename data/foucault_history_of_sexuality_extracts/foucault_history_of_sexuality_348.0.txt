About the Author 

Michel Foucault was born in Poitiers, France, in 1926. He 
lectured in many universities throughout the world and 
served as director at the Institut Frangais in Hamburg, 
and the Institut de Philosophic at the Faculte des Lettres 
in the University of Clermont-Ferrand. He wrote fre¬ 
quently for French newspapers and reviews, and held a 
chair at France’s most prestigious institution, the College 
de France. 

In addition to his classic study, Madness and Civiliza¬ 
tion, Foucault has written The Order of Things, The Ar¬ 
chaeology of Knowledge, The Birth of the Clinic, Discipline 
and Punish, and The History of Sexuality, of which this 
book is the third volume.
