by no means adequate to describe the manner in which 
power was and is exercised, but it is the code according to 
which power presents itself and prescribes that we conceive 
of it. The history of the monarchy went hand in hand with 
the covering up of the facts and procedures of power by 
juridico-political discourse. 

Yet, despite the efforts that were made to disengage the 
juridical sphere from the monarchic institution and to free 
the political from the juridical, the representation of power 
remained caught within this system. Consider the two fol¬ 
lowing examples. Criticism of the eighteenth-century mo¬ 
narchic institution in France was not directed against the 
juridico-monarchic sphere as such, but was made on behalf 
of a pure and rigorous juridical system to which all the 
mechanisms of power could conform, with no excesses or 
irregularities, as opposed to a monarchy which, notwith¬ 
standing its own assertions, continuously overstepped the 
legal framework and set itself above the laws. Political criti¬ 
cism availed itself, therefore, of all the juridical thinking that 
had accompanied the development of the monarchy, in order 
to condemn the latter; but it did not challenge the principle 
which held that law had to be the very form of power, and 
that power always had to be exercised in the form of law. 
Another type of criticism of political institutions appeared in 
the nineteenth century, a much more radical criticism in that 
it was concerned to show not only that real power escaped 
the rules of jurisprudence, but that the legal system itself was 
merely a way of exerting violence, of appropriating that 
violence for the benefit of the few, and of exploiting the 
dissymmetries and injustices of domination under cover of 
general law. But this critique of law is still carried out on the 
assumption that, ideally and by nature, power must be exer¬ 
cised in accordance with a fundamental lawfulness. 

At bottom, despite the differences in epochs and objec¬ 
tives, the representation of power has remained under the 
spell of monarchy. In political thought and analysis, we still

have not cut off the head of the king. Hence the importance 
that the theory of power gives to the problem of right and 
violence, law and illegality, freedom and will, and especially 
the state and sovereignty (even if the latter is questioned 
insofar as it is personified in a collective being and no longer 
a sovereign individual). To conceive of power on the basis of 
these problems is to conceive of it in terms of a historical 
form that is characteristic of our societies: the juridical mon¬ 
archy. Characteristic yet transitory. For while many of its 
forms have persisted to the present, it has gradually been 
penetrated by quite new mechanisms of power that are prob¬ 
ably irreducible to the representation of law. As we shall see, 
these power mechanisms are, at least in part, those that, 
beginning in the eighteenth century, took charge of men’s 
existence, men as living bodies. And if it is true that the 
juridical system was useful for representing, albeit in a 
nonexhaustive way, a power that was centered primarily 
around deduction (prelevement) and death, it is utterly in¬ 
congruous with the new methods of power whose operation 
is not ensured by right but by technique, not by law but by 
normalization, not by punishment but by control, methods 
that are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond 
the state and its apparatus. We have been engaged for centu¬ 
ries in a type of society in which the juridical is increasingly 
incapable of coding power, of serving as its system of repre¬ 
sentation. Our historical gradient carries us further and fur¬ 
ther away from a reign of law that had already begun to 
recede into the past at a time when the French Revolution 
and the accompanying age of constitutions and codes seemed 
to destine it for a future that was at hand. 

It is this juridical representation that is still at work in 
recent analyses concerning the relationships of power to sex. 
But the problem is not to know whether desire is alien to 
power, whether it is prior to the law as is often thought to 
be the case, when it is not rather the law that is perceived as 
constituting it. This question is beside the point. Whether
