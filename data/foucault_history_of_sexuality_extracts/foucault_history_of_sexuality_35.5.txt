have not cut off the head of the king. Hence the importance 
that the theory of power gives to the problem of right and 
violence, law and illegality, freedom and will, and especially 
the state and sovereignty (even if the latter is questioned 
insofar as it is personified in a collective being and no longer 
a sovereign individual). To conceive of power on the basis of 
these problems is to conceive of it in terms of a historical 
form that is characteristic of our societies: the juridical mon¬ 
archy. Characteristic yet transitory. For while many of its 
forms have persisted to the present, it has gradually been 
penetrated by quite new mechanisms of power that are prob¬ 
ably irreducible to the representation of law. As we shall see, 
these power mechanisms are, at least in part, those that, 
beginning in the eighteenth century, took charge of men’s 
existence, men as living bodies. And if it is true that the 
juridical system was useful for representing, albeit in a 
nonexhaustive way, a power that was centered primarily 
around deduction (prelevement) and death, it is utterly in¬ 
congruous with the new methods of power whose operation 
is not ensured by right but by technique, not by law but by 
normalization, not by punishment but by control, methods 
that are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond 
the state and its apparatus. We have been engaged for centu¬ 
ries in a type of society in which the juridical is increasingly 
incapable of coding power, of serving as its system of repre¬ 
sentation. Our historical gradient carries us further and fur¬ 
ther away from a reign of law that had already begun to 
recede into the past at a time when the French Revolution 
and the accompanying age of constitutions and codes seemed 
to destine it for a future that was at hand. 

It is this juridical representation that is still at work in 
recent analyses concerning the relationships of power to sex. 
But the problem is not to know whether desire is alien to 
power, whether it is prior to the law as is often thought to 
be the case, when it is not rather the law that is perceived as 
constituting it. This question is beside the point. Whether
