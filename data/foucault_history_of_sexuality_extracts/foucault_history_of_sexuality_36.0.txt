The History of Sexuality 


desire is this or that, in any case one continues to conceive 
of it in relation to a power that is always juridical and discur¬ 
sive, a power that has its central point in the enunciation of 
the law. One remains attached to a certain image of power- 
law, of power-sovereignty, which was traced out by the 
theoreticians of right and the monarchic institution. It is this 
image that we must break free of, that is, of the theoretical 
privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power 
within the concrete and historical framework of its opera¬ 
tion. We must construct an analytics of power that no longer 
takes law as a model and a code. 

This history of sexuality, or rather this series of studies 
concerning the historical relationships of power and the dis¬ 
course on sex, is, I realize, a circular project in the sense that 
it involves two endeavors that refer back to one another. We 
shall try to rid ourselves of a juridical and negative represen¬ 
tation of power, and cease to conceive of it in terms of law, 
prohibition, liberty, and sovereignty. But how then do we 
analyze what has occurred in recent history with regard to 
this thing—seemingly one of the most forbidden areas of our 
lives and bodies—that is sex? How, if not by way of prohibi¬ 
tion and blockage, does power gain access to it? Through 
which mechanisms, or tactics, or devices? But let us assume 
in turn that a somewhat careful scrutiny will show that 
power in modern societies has not in fact governed sexuality 
through law and sovereignty; let us suppose that historical 
analysis has revealed the presence of a veritable “technol¬ 
ogy” of sex, one that is much more complex and above all 
much more positive than the mere effect of a “defense” could 
be; this being the case, does this example—which can only 
be considered a privileged one, since power seemed in this 
instance, more than anywhere else, to function as prohibition 
—not compel one to discover principles for analyzing power 
which do not derive from the system of right and the form 
of law? Hence it is a question of forming a different grid of 
historical decipherment by starting from a different theory of
