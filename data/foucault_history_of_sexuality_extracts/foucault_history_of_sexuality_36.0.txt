The History of Sexuality 


desire is this or that, in any case one continues to conceive 
of it in relation to a power that is always juridical and discur¬ 
sive, a power that has its central point in the enunciation of 
the law. One remains attached to a certain image of power- 
law, of power-sovereignty, which was traced out by the 
theoreticians of right and the monarchic institution. It is this 
image that we must break free of, that is, of the theoretical 
privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power 
within the concrete and historical framework of its opera¬ 
tion. We must construct an analytics of power that no longer 
takes law as a model and a code. 

This history of sexuality, or rather this series of studies 
concerning the historical relationships of power and the dis¬ 
course on sex, is, I realize, a circular project in the sense that 
it involves two endeavors that refer back to one another. We 
shall try to rid ourselves of a juridical and negative represen¬ 
tation of power, and cease to conceive of it in terms of law, 
prohibition, liberty, and sovereignty. But how then do we 
analyze what has occurred in recent history with regard to 
this thing—seemingly one of the most forbidden areas of our 
lives and bodies—that is sex? How, if not by way of prohibi¬ 
tion and blockage, does power gain access to it? Through 
which mechanisms, or tactics, or devices? But let us assume 
in turn that a somewhat careful scrutiny will show that 
power in modern societies has not in fact governed sexuality 
through law and sovereignty; let us suppose that historical 
analysis has revealed the presence of a veritable “technol¬ 
ogy” of sex, one that is much more complex and above all 
much more positive than the mere effect of a “defense” could 
be; this being the case, does this example—which can only 
be considered a privileged one, since power seemed in this 
instance, more than anywhere else, to function as prohibition 
—not compel one to discover principles for analyzing power 
which do not derive from the system of right and the form 
of law? Hence it is a question of forming a different grid of 
historical decipherment by starting from a different theory of

power; and, at the same time, of advancing little by little 
toward a different conception of power through a closer 
examination of an entire historical material. We must at the 
same time conceive of sex without the law, and power with¬ 
out the king.

Hence the objective is to analyze a certain form of knowl¬ 
edge regarding sex, not in terms of repression or law, but in 
terms of power. But the word power is apt to lead to a 
number of misunderstandings—misunderstandings with re¬ 
spect to its nature, its form, and its unity. By power, I do not 
mean “Power” as a group of institutions and mechanisms 
that ensure the subservience of the citizens of a given state. 
By power, I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation 
which, in contrast to violence, has the form of the rule. 
Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of domi¬ 
nation exerted by one group over another, a system whose 
effects, through successive derivations, pervade the entire 
social body. The analysis, made in terms of power, must not 
assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law, 
or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset; 
rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes. It 
seems to me that power must be understood in the first 
instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the 
sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own 
organization; as the process which, through ceaseless strug¬ 
gles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses 
them; as the support which these force relations find in one 
another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the con¬ 
trary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them 
from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they

take effect, whose general design or institutional crystalliza¬ 
tion is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation 
of the law, in the various social hegemonies. Power’s condi¬
