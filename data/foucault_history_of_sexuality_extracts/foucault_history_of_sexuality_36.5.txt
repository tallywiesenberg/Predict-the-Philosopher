toward a different conception of power through a closer 
examination of an entire historical material. We must at the 
same time conceive of sex without the law, and power with¬ 
out the king.

Hence the objective is to analyze a certain form of knowl¬ 
edge regarding sex, not in terms of repression or law, but in 
terms of power. But the word power is apt to lead to a 
number of misunderstandings—misunderstandings with re¬ 
spect to its nature, its form, and its unity. By power, I do not 
mean “Power” as a group of institutions and mechanisms 
that ensure the subservience of the citizens of a given state. 
By power, I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation 
which, in contrast to violence, has the form of the rule. 
Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of domi¬ 
nation exerted by one group over another, a system whose 
effects, through successive derivations, pervade the entire 
social body. The analysis, made in terms of power, must not 
assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law, 
or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset; 
rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes. It 
seems to me that power must be understood in the first 
instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the 
sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own 
organization; as the process which, through ceaseless strug¬ 
gles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses 
them; as the support which these force relations find in one 
another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the con¬ 
trary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them 
from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they

of the law, in the various social hegemonies. Power’s condi¬
