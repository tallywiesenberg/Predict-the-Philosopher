tion of possibility, or in any case the viewpoint which permits 
one to understand its exercise, even in its more “peripheral” 
effects, and which also makes it possible to use its mech¬ 
anisms as a grid of intelligibility of the social order, must not 
be sought in the primary existence of a central point, in a 
unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and de¬ 
scended forms would emanate; it is the moving substrate of 
force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly 
engender states of power, but the latter are always local and 
unstable. The omnipresence of power: not because it has the 
privilege of consolidating everything under its invincible 
unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the 
next, at every point, or rather in every relation from one 
point to another. Power is everywhere; not because it em¬ 
braces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. 
And “Power,” insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert, 
and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that 
emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that 
rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their move¬ 
ment. One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not 
an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain 
strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attrib¬ 
utes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society. 

Should we turn the expression around, then, and say that 
politics is war pursued by other means? If we still wish to 
maintain a separation between war and politics, perhaps we 
should postulate rather that this multiplicity of force rela¬ 
tions can be coded—in part but never totally—either in the 
form of “war,” or in the form of “politics”; this would imply 
two different strategies (but the one always liable to switch 
into the other) for integrating these unbalanced, heterogene¬ 
ous, unstable, and tense force relations.

Continuing this line of discussion, we can advance a cer¬ 
tain number of propositions: 

—Power is not something that is acquired, seized, or shared, 
something that one holds on to or allows to slip away; 
power is exercised from innumerable points, in the inter¬ 
play of nonegalitarian and mobile relations.
