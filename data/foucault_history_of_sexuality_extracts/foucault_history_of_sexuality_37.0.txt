tion of possibility, or in any case the viewpoint which permits 
one to understand its exercise, even in its more “peripheral” 
effects, and which also makes it possible to use its mech¬ 
anisms as a grid of intelligibility of the social order, must not 
be sought in the primary existence of a central point, in a 
unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and de¬ 
scended forms would emanate; it is the moving substrate of 
force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly 
engender states of power, but the latter are always local and 
unstable. The omnipresence of power: not because it has the 
privilege of consolidating everything under its invincible 
unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the 
next, at every point, or rather in every relation from one 
point to another. Power is everywhere; not because it em¬ 
braces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. 
And “Power,” insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert, 
and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that 
emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that 
rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their move¬ 
ment. One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not 
an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain 
strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attrib¬ 
utes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society. 

Should we turn the expression around, then, and say that 
politics is war pursued by other means? If we still wish to 
maintain a separation between war and politics, perhaps we 
should postulate rather that this multiplicity of force rela¬ 
tions can be coded—in part but never totally—either in the 
form of “war,” or in the form of “politics”; this would imply 
two different strategies (but the one always liable to switch 
into the other) for integrating these unbalanced, heterogene¬ 
ous, unstable, and tense force relations.

Continuing this line of discussion, we can advance a cer¬ 
tain number of propositions: 

—Power is not something that is acquired, seized, or shared, 
something that one holds on to or allows to slip away; 
power is exercised from innumerable points, in the inter¬ 
play of nonegalitarian and mobile relations. 

—Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority with 
respect to other types of relationships (economic proc¬ 
esses, knowledge relationships, sexual relations), but are 
immanent in the latter; they are the immediate effects of 
the divisions, inequalities, and disequilibriums which 
occur in the latter, and conversely they are the internal 
conditions of these differentiations; relations of power are 
not in superstructural positions, with merely a role of 
prohibition or accompaniment; they have a directly pro¬ 
ductive role, wherever they come into play. 

—Power comes from below; that is, there is no binary and 
all-encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at 
the root of power relations, and serving as a general matrix 
—no such duality extending from the top down and react¬ 
ing on more and more limited groups to the very depths 
of the social body. One must suppose rather that the mani¬ 
fold relationships of force that take shape and come into 
play in the machinery of production, in families, limited 
groups, and institutions, are the basis for wide-ranging 
effects of cleavage that run through the social body as a 
whole. These then form a general line of force that trav¬ 
erses the local oppositions and links them together; to be 
sure, they also bring about redistributions, realignments, 
homogenizations, serial arrangements, and convergences 
of the force relations. Major dominations are the hege¬ 
monic effects that are sustained by all these confronta¬ 
tions. 

—Power relations are both intentional and nonsubjective. If 
in fact they are intelligible, this is not because they are the

effect of another instance that “explains” them, but rather 
because they are imbued, through and through, with cal¬ 
culation: there is no power that is exercised without a 
series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that 
it results from the choice or decision of an individual 
subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides 
over its rationality; neither the caste which governs, nor 
the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those 
who make the most important economic decisions direct
