—Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority with 
respect to other types of relationships (economic proc¬ 
esses, knowledge relationships, sexual relations), but are 
immanent in the latter; they are the immediate effects of 
the divisions, inequalities, and disequilibriums which 
occur in the latter, and conversely they are the internal 
conditions of these differentiations; relations of power are 
not in superstructural positions, with merely a role of 
prohibition or accompaniment; they have a directly pro¬ 
ductive role, wherever they come into play. 

—Power comes from below; that is, there is no binary and 
all-encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at 
the root of power relations, and serving as a general matrix 
—no such duality extending from the top down and react¬ 
ing on more and more limited groups to the very depths 
of the social body. One must suppose rather that the mani¬ 
fold relationships of force that take shape and come into 
play in the machinery of production, in families, limited 
groups, and institutions, are the basis for wide-ranging 
effects of cleavage that run through the social body as a 
whole. These then form a general line of force that trav¬ 
erses the local oppositions and links them together; to be 
sure, they also bring about redistributions, realignments, 
homogenizations, serial arrangements, and convergences 
of the force relations. Major dominations are the hege¬ 
monic effects that are sustained by all these confronta¬ 
tions. 

—Power relations are both intentional and nonsubjective. If 
in fact they are intelligible, this is not because they are the

because they are imbued, through and through, with cal¬ 
culation: there is no power that is exercised without a 
series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that 
it results from the choice or decision of an individual 
subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides 
over its rationality; neither the caste which governs, nor 
the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those 
who make the most important economic decisions direct
