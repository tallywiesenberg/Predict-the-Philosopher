(and makes it function); the rationality of power is charac¬ 
terized by tactics that are often quite explicit at the re¬ 
stricted level where they are inscribed (the local cynicism 
of power), tactics which, becoming connected to one an¬ 
other, attracting and propagating one another, but finding 
their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by 
forming comprehensive systems: the logic is perfectly 
clear, the aims decipherable, and yet it is often the case 
that no one is there to have invented them, and few who 
can be said to have formulated them: an implicit charac¬ 
teristic of the great anonymous, almost unspoken strate¬ 
gies which coordinate the loquacious tactics whose “in¬ 
ventors” or decisionmakers are often without hypocrisy. 

—Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or 
rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position 
of exteriority in relation to power. Should it be said that 
one is always “inside” power, there is no “escaping” it, 
there is no absolute outside where it is concerned, because 
one is subject to the law in any case? Or that, history being 
the ruse of reason, power is the ruse of history, always 
emerging the winner? This would be to misunderstand the 
strictly relational character of power relationships. Their 
existence depends on a multiplicity of points of resistance: 
these play the role of adversary, target, support, or handle 
in power relations. These points of resistance are present 
everywhere in the power network. Hence there is no single

locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all 
rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary. Instead there 
is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case: 
resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others 
that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted, ram¬ 
pant, or violent; still others that are quick to compromise, 
interested, or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist 
in the strategic field of power relations. But this does not 
mean that they are only a reaction or rebound, forming 
with respect to the basic domination an underside that is 
in the end always passive, doomed to perpetual defeat. 
Resistances do not derive from a few heterogeneous prin¬ 
ciples; but neither are they a lure or a promise that is of 
necessity betrayed. They are the odd term in relations of
