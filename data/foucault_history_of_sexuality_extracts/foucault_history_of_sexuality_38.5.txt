power; they are inscribed in the latter as an irreducible 
opposite. Hence they too are distributed in irregular fash¬ 
ion: the points, knots, or focuses of resistance are spread 
over time and space at varying densities, at times mobiliz¬ 
ing groups or individuals in a definitive way, inflaming 
certain points of the body, certain moments in life, certain 
types of behavior. Are there no great radical ruptures, 
massive binary divisions, then? Occasionally, yes. But 
more often one is dealing with mobile and transitory 
points of resistance, producing cleavages in a society that 
shift about, fracturing unities and effecting regroupings, 
furrowing across individuals themselves, cutting them up 
and remolding them, marking off irreducible regions in 
them, in their bodies and minds. Just as the network of 
power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes 
through apparatuses and institutions, without being ex¬ 
actly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of 
resistance traverses social stratifications and individual 
unities. And it is doubtless the strategic codification of 
these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible, 
somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on 
the institutional integration of power relationships.

It is in this sphere of force relations that we must try to 
analyze the mechanisms of power. In this way we will escape 
from the system of Law-and-Sovereign which has captivated 
political thought for such a long time. And if it is true that 
Machiavelli was among the few—and this no doubt was the 
scandal of his “cynicism”—who conceived the power of the 
Prince in terms of force relationships, perhaps we need to go 
one step further, do without the persona of the Prince, and 
decipher power mechanisms on the basis of a strategy that 
is immanent in force relationships. 

To return to sex and the discourses of truth that have 
taken charge of it, the question that we must address, then, 
is not: Given a specific state structure, how and why is it that 
power needs to establish a knowledge of sex? Neither is the 
question: What over-all domination was served by the con¬ 
cern, evidenced since the eighteenth century, to produce true 
discourses on sex? Nor is it: What law presided over both the 
regularity of sexual behavior and the conformity of what was
