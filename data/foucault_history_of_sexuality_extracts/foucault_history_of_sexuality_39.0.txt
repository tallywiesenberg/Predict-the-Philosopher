said about it? It is rather: In a specific type'of discourse on 
sex, in a specific form of extortion of truth, appearing histori¬ 
cally and in specific places (around the child’s body, apropos 
of women’s sex, in connection with practices restricting 
births, and so on), what were the most immediate, the most 
local power relations at work? How did they make possible 
these kinds of discourses, and conversely, how were these 
discourses used to support power relations? How was the 
action of these power relations modified by their very exer¬ 
cise, entailing a strengthening of some terms and a weaken¬ 
ing of others, with effects of resistance and counterinvest¬ 
ments, so that there has never existed one type of stable 
subjugation, given once and for all? How were these power 
relations linked to one another according to the logic of a 
great strategy, which in retrospect takes on the aspect of a 
unitary and voluntarist politics of sex? In general terms: 
rather than referring all the infinitesimal violences that are 
exerted on sex, all the anxious gazes that are directed at it,

The History of Sexuality 


and all the hiding places whose discovery is made into an 
impossible task, to the unique form of a great Power, we 
must immerse the expanding production of discourses on sex 
in the field of multiple and mobile power relations. 

Which leads us to advance, in a preliminary way, four 
rules to follow. But these are not intended as methodological 
imperatives; at most they are cautionary prescriptions. 

1. Rule of immanence 

One must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of 
sexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and 
disinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mech¬ 
anisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or 
ideological requirements of power. If sexuality was con¬ 
stituted as an area of investigation, this was only because 
relations of power had established it as a possible object; and 
conversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was 
because techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis¬ 
course were capable of investing it. Between techniques of 
knowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, 
even if they have specific roles and are linked together on the
