said about it? It is rather: In a specific type'of discourse on 
sex, in a specific form of extortion of truth, appearing histori¬ 
cally and in specific places (around the child’s body, apropos 
of women’s sex, in connection with practices restricting 
births, and so on), what were the most immediate, the most 
local power relations at work? How did they make possible 
these kinds of discourses, and conversely, how were these 
discourses used to support power relations? How was the 
action of these power relations modified by their very exer¬ 
cise, entailing a strengthening of some terms and a weaken¬ 
ing of others, with effects of resistance and counterinvest¬ 
ments, so that there has never existed one type of stable 
subjugation, given once and for all? How were these power 
relations linked to one another according to the logic of a 
great strategy, which in retrospect takes on the aspect of a 
unitary and voluntarist politics of sex? In general terms: 
rather than referring all the infinitesimal violences that are 
exerted on sex, all the anxious gazes that are directed at it,

The History of Sexuality 


and all the hiding places whose discovery is made into an 
impossible task, to the unique form of a great Power, we 
must immerse the expanding production of discourses on sex 
in the field of multiple and mobile power relations. 

Which leads us to advance, in a preliminary way, four 
rules to follow. But these are not intended as methodological 
imperatives; at most they are cautionary prescriptions. 

1. Rule of immanence 

One must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of 
sexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and 
disinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mech¬ 
anisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or 
ideological requirements of power. If sexuality was con¬ 
stituted as an area of investigation, this was only because 
relations of power had established it as a possible object; and 
conversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was 
because techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis¬ 
course were capable of investing it. Between techniques of 
knowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, 
even if they have specific roles and are linked together on the 
basis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what 
might be called “local centers” of power-knowledge: for ex¬ 
ample, the relations that obtain between penitents and 
confessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience. 
Here, guided by the theme of the “flesh” that must be mas¬ 
tered, different forms of discourse—self-examination, ques¬ 
tionings, admissions, interpretations, interviews—were the 
vehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of 
forms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge. Similarly, 
the body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his 
cradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of 
parents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten¬ 
tive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted, 
particularly since the eighteenth century, another “local cen¬ 
ter” of power-knowledge.

2. Rules of continual variations 

We must not look for who has the power in the order of 
sexuality (men, adults, parents, doctors) and who is deprived 
of it (women, adolescents, children, patients); nor for who 
has the right to know and who is forced to remain ignorant. 
We must seek rather the pattern of the modifications which 
the relationships of force imply by the very nature of their 
process. The “distributions of power” and the “appropria¬ 
tions of knowledge” never represent only instantaneous 
slices taken from processes involving, for example, a cumula¬ 
tive reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal of 
relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase of two terms. 
Relations of power-knowledge are not static forms of distri¬ 
bution, they are “matrices of transformations.” The nine¬ 
teenth-century grouping made up of the father, the mother, 
the educator, and the doctor, around the child and his sex, 
was subjected to constant modifications, continual shifts. 
One of the more spectacular results of the latter was a strange 
reversal: whereas to begin with the child’s sexuality had been 
problematized within the relationship established between 
doctor and parents (in the form of advice, or recommenda¬ 
tions to keep the child under observation, or warnings of 
future dangers), ultimately it was in the relationship of the 
psychiatrist to the child that the sexuality of adults them¬ 
selves was called into question.
