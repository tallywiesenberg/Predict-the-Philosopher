basis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what 
might be called “local centers” of power-knowledge: for ex¬ 
ample, the relations that obtain between penitents and 
confessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience. 
Here, guided by the theme of the “flesh” that must be mas¬ 
tered, different forms of discourse—self-examination, ques¬ 
tionings, admissions, interpretations, interviews—were the 
vehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of 
forms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge. Similarly, 
the body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his 
cradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of 
parents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten¬ 
tive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted, 
particularly since the eighteenth century, another “local cen¬ 
ter” of power-knowledge. 



The Deployment of Sexuality

2. Rules of continual variations 

We must not look for who has the power in the order of 
sexuality (men, adults, parents, doctors) and who is deprived 
of it (women, adolescents, children, patients); nor for who 
has the right to know and who is forced to remain ignorant. 
We must seek rather the pattern of the modifications which 
the relationships of force imply by the very nature of their 
process. The “distributions of power” and the “appropria¬ 
tions of knowledge” never represent only instantaneous 
slices taken from processes involving, for example, a cumula¬ 
tive reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal of 
relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase of two terms. 
Relations of power-knowledge are not static forms of distri¬ 
bution, they are “matrices of transformations.” The nine¬ 
teenth-century grouping made up of the father, the mother, 
the educator, and the doctor, around the child and his sex, 
was subjected to constant modifications, continual shifts. 
One of the more spectacular results of the latter was a strange 
reversal: whereas to begin with the child’s sexuality had been 
problematized within the relationship established between 
doctor and parents (in the form of advice, or recommenda¬ 
tions to keep the child under observation, or warnings of 
future dangers), ultimately it was in the relationship of the 
psychiatrist to the child that the sexuality of adults them¬ 
selves was called into question.
