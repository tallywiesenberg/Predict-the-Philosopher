to the point where we are “at fault” with respect to our own 
sex? And how have we come to be a civilization so peculiar 
as to tell itself that, through an abuse of power which has not 
ended, it has long “sinned” against sex? How does one ac¬ 
count for the displacement which, while claiming to free us 
from the sinful nature of sex, taxes us with a great historical 
wrong which consists precisely in imagining that nature to 
be blameworthy and in drawing disastrous consequences 
from that belief? 

It will be said that if so many people today affirm this 
repression, the reason is that it is historically evident. And 
if they speak of it so abundantly, as they have for such a long 
time now, this is because repression is so firmly anchored, 
having solid roots and reasons, and weighs so heavily on sex 
that more than one denunciation will be required in order to 
free ourselves from it; the job will be a long one. All the 
longer, no doubt, as it is in the nature of power—particularly 
the kind of power that operates in our society—to be repres¬ 
sive, and to be especially careful in repressing useless 
energies, the intensity of pleasures, and irregular modes of 
behavior. We must not be surprised, then, if the effects of 
liberation vis-a-vis this repressive power are so slow to mani¬ 
fest themselves; the effort to speak freely about sex and ac-

The History of Sexuality 


cept it in its reality is so alien to a historical sequence that 
has gone unbroken for a thousand years now, and so inimical 
to the intrinsic mechanisms of power, that it is bound to 
make little headway for a long time before succeeding in its 
mission. 

One can raise three serious doubts concerning what I shall 
term the “repressive hypothesis.” First doubt: Is sexual re¬ 
pression truly an established historical fact? Is what first 
comes into view—and consequently permits one to advance 
an initial hypothesis—really the accentuation or even the 
establishment of a regime of sexual repression beginning in 
the seventeenth century? This is a properly historical ques¬ 
tion. Second doubt: Do the workings of power, and in partic¬ 
ular those mechanisms that are brought into play in societies 
such as ours, really belong primarily to the category of re¬ 
pression? Are prohibition, censorship, and denial truly the
