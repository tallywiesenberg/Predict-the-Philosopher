It was everywhere present in him: at the root of all his 
actions because it was their insidious and indefinitely active 
principle; written immodestly on his face and body because 
it was a secret that always gave itself away.It was consub- 
stantial with him, less as a habitual sin than as a singular 
nature.We must not forget that the psychological, psychiat¬ 
ric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from 
the moment it was characterized—Westphal’s famous article 
of 1870 on “contrary sexual sensations” can stand as its date 
of birth 1 —less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain 
quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the 
masculine and the feminine in oneself.Homosexuality ap¬ 
peared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was tran¬ 
sposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior 
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul.The sodomite had 
been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a 
species.
