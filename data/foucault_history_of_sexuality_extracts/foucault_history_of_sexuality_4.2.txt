Imbedded in bod¬ 
ies, becoming deeply characteristic of individuals, the oddi¬ 
ties of sex relied on a technology of health and pathology.And conversely, since sexuality was a medical and medicaliz- 
able object, one had to try and detect it—as a lesion, a 
dysfunction, or a symptom—in the depths of the organism, 
or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of 
behavior.The power which thus took charge of sexuality set 
about contacting bodies, caressing them with its eyes, inten¬ 
sifying areas, electrifying surfaces, dramatizing troubled mo¬ 
ments.It wrapped the sexual body in its embrace.There was 
undoubtedly an increase in effectiveness and an extension of 
the domain controlled; but also a sensualization of power and 
a gain of pleasure.
