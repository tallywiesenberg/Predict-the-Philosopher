The medical examination, the psychiatric investigation, 
the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the 
over-all and apparent objective of saying no to all wayward 
or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function 
as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power.The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions, 
monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to 
light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at 
having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty 
it.The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is 
pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleasÂ¬ 
ure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting.Capture and 
seduction, confrontation and mutual reinforcement: parents 
and children, adults and adolescents, educator and students, 
doctors and patients, the psychiatrist with his hysteric and 
his perverts, all have played this game continually since the 
nineteenth century.These attractions, these evasions, these 
circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes, 
not boundaries not to be crossed, but perpetual spirals of 
power and pleasure.
