Was the nineteenth-century fam¬ 
ily really a monogamic and conjugal cell?Perhaps to a cer¬ 
tain extent.But it was also a network of pleasures and powers 
linked together at multiple points and according to trans¬ 
formable relationships.The separation of grown-ups and 
children, the polarity established between the parents’ bed¬ 
room and that of the children (it became routine in the 
course of the century when working-class housing construc¬ 
tion was undertaken), the relative segregation of boys and 
girls, the strict instructions as to the care of nursing infants 
(maternal breast-feeding, hygiene), the attention focused on 
infantile sexuality, the supposed dangers of masturbation, 
the importance attached to puberty, the methods of surveil¬ 
lance suggested to parents, the exhortations, secrets, and 
fears, the presence—both valued and feared—of servants: all 
this made the family, even when brought down to its smallest 
dimensions, a complicated network, saturated with multiple, 
fragmentary, and mobile sexualities.To reduce them to the 
conjugal relationship, and then to project the latter, in the 
form of a forbidden desire, onto the children, cannot account 
for this apparatus which, in relation to these sexualities, was 
less a principle of inhibition than an inciting and multiplying 
mechanism.
