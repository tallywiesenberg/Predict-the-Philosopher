At issue, rather, is the type of power it brought to bear on 
the body and on sex.In point of fact, this power had neither 
the form of the law, nor the effects of the taboo.On the 
contrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities.It 
did not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various 
forms of sexuality, pursuing them according to lines of indefiÂ¬ 
nite penetration.It did not exclude sexuality, but included it 
in the body as a mode of specification of individuals.
