forms through which power is exercised in a general way, if 
not in every society, most certainly in our own? This is a 
historico-theoretical question. A third and final doubt: Did 
the critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come 
to act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had ope¬ 
rated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part 
of the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and 
doubtless misrepresents) by calling it “repression”? Was 
there really a historical rupture between the age of repression 
and the critical analysis of repression? This is a historico- 
political question. My purpose in introducing these three 
doubts is not merely to construct counterarguments that are 
symmetrical and contrary to those outlined above; it is not 
a matter of saying that sexuality, far from being repressed in 
capitalist and bourgeois societies, has on the contrary benefit- 
ted from a regime of unchanging liberty; nor is it a matter 
of saying that power in societies such as ours is more tolerant 
than repressive, and that the critique of repression, while it 
may give itself airs of a rupture with the past, actually forms 
part of a much older process and, depending on how one 



We “Other Victorians'’ 11 

chooses to understand this process, will appear either as a 
new episode in the lessening of prohibitions, or as a more 
devious and discreet form of power. 

The doubts I would like to oppose to the repressive hy¬ 
pothesis are aimed less at showing it to be mistaken than at 
putting it back within a general economy of discourses on sex 
in modern societies since the seventeenth century. Why has 
sexuality been so widely discussed, and what has been said 
about it? What were the effects of power generated by what 
was said? What are the links between these discourses, these 
effects of power, and the pleasures that were invested by 
them? What knowledge (savoir) was formed as a result of this 
linkage? The object, in short, is to define the regime of power- 
knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human 
sexuality in our part of the world. The central issue, then (at 
least in the first instance), is not to determine whether one 
says yes or no to sex, whether one formulates prohibitions or 
permissions, whether one asserts its importance or denies its 
effects, or whether one refines the words one uses to designate 
it; but to account for the fact that it is spoken about, to 
discover who does the speaking, the positions and viewpoints 
from which they speak, the institutions which prompt people 
to speak about it and which store and distribute the things 
that are said. What is at issue, briefly, is the over-all “discur¬
