Yet the impression remains that all this has by and large 
played only a defensive role.By speaking about it so much, 
by discovering it multiplied, partitioned off, and specified 
precisely where one had placed it, what one was seeking 
essentially was simply to conceal sex: a screen-discourse, a 
dispersion-avoidance.Until Freud at least, the discourse on 
sex—the discourse of scholars and theoreticians—never 
ceased to hide the thing it was speaking about.We could take 
all these things that were said, the painstaking precautions 
and detailed analyses, as so many procedures meant to evade 
the unbearable, too hazardous truth of sex.And the mere 
fact that one claimed to be speaking about it from the rarefied 
and neutral viewpoint of a science is in itself significant.
