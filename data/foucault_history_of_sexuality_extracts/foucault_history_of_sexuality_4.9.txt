In France, doctors like Gamier, Pouillet, 
and Ladoucette were its unglorified scribes and Rollinat its 
poet.But beyond these troubled pleasures, it assumed other 
powers; it set itself up as the supreme authority in matters 
of hygienic necessity, taking up the old fears of venereal 
affliction and combining them with the new themes of asep¬ 
sis, and the great evolutionist myths with the recent institu¬ 
tions of public health; it claimed to ensure the physical vigor 
and the moral cleanliness of the social body; it promised to 
eliminate defective individuals, degenerate and bastardized 
populations.In the name of a biological and historical ur¬ 
gency, it justified the racisms of the state, which at the time 
were on the horizon.It grounded them in “truth.” 

When we compare these discourses on human sexuality 
with what was known at the time about the physiology of 
animal and plant reproduction, we are struck by the incon¬ 
gruity.Their feeble content from the standpoint of elemen¬ 
tary rationality, not to mention scientificity, earns them a 
place apart in the history of knowledge.
