They form a 
strangely muddled zone.Throughout the nineteenth cen¬ 
tury, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very 
distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction, 
which developed continuously according to a general scien¬ 
tific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite 
different rules of formation.From one to the other, there was

no real exchange, no reciprocal structuration; the role of the 
first with respect to the second was scarcely more than as a 
distant and quite fictitious guarantee: a blanket guarantee 
under cover of which moral obstacles, economic or political 
options, and traditional fears could be recast in a scientific- 
sounding vocabulary.It is as if a fundamental resistance 
blocked the development of a rationally formed discourse 
concerning human sex, its correlations, and its effects.A 
disparity of this sort would indicate that the aim of such a 
discourse was not to state the truth but to prevent its very 
emergence.
