No “local center,” no “pattern of transformation” could 
function if, through a series of sequences, it did not eventu¬ 
ally enter into an over-all strategy. And inversely, no strategy 
could achieve comprehensive effects if did not gain support 
from precise and tenuous relations serving, not as its point 
of application or final outcome, but as its prop and anchor 
point. There is no discontinuity between them, as if one were 
dealing with two different levels (one microscopic and the

other macroscopic); but neither is there homogeneity (as if 
the one were only the enlarged projection or the miniaturiza¬ 
tion of the other); rather, one must conceive of the double 
conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tac¬ 
tics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them 
work. Thus the father in the family is not the “representa¬ 
tive” of the sovereign or the state; and the latter are not 
projections of the father on a different scale. The family does 
not duplicate society, just as society does not imitate the 
family. But the family organization, precisely to the extent 
that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the 
other power mechanisms, was used to support the great 
“maneuvers” employed for the Malthusian control of the 
birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicali- 
zation of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms. 

4. Rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses 

What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the 
surface of projection of these power mechanisms. Indeed, it 
is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together. 
And for this very reason, we must conceive discourse as a 
series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is 
neither uniform nor stable. To be more precise, we must not 
imagine a world of discourse divided between accepted dis¬ 
course and excluded discourse, or between the dominant 
discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of 
discursive elements that can come into play in various strate¬ 
gies. It is this distribution that we must reconstruct, with the 
things said and those concealed, the enunciations required 
and those forbidden, that it comprises; with the variants and 
different effects—according to who is speaking, his position 
of power, the institutional context in which he happens to be 
situated—that it implies; and with the shifts and reutiliza¬ 
tions of identical formulas for contrary objectives that it also 
includes. Discourses are not once and for all subservient to

power or raised up against it, any more than silences are. We 
must make allowance for the complex and unstable process 
whereby discourse can be both an instrument and an effect 
of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of 
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Dis¬ 
course transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but 
also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes 
it possible to thwart it. In like manner, silence and secrecy 
are a shelter for power, anchoring its prohibitions; but they 
also loosen its holds and provide for relatively obscure areas 
of tolerance. Consider for example the history of what was 
once “the” great sin against nature. The extreme discretion 
of the texts dealing with sodomy—that utterly confused cate¬ 
gory—and the nearly universal reticence in talking about it 
made possible a twofold operation: on the one hand, there 
was an extreme severity (punishment by fire was meted out 
well into the eighteenth century, without there being any 
substantial protest expressed before the middle of the cen¬ 
tury), and on the other hand, a tolerance that must have been 
widespread (which one can deduce indirectly from the infre¬ 
quency of judicial sentences, and which one glimpses more 
directly through certain statements concerning societies of 
men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts). 
There is no question that the appearance in nineteenth-cen¬ 
tury psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole se¬ 
ries of discourses on the species and subspecies of homosexu¬ 
ality, inversion, pederasty, and “psychic hermaphrodism” 
made possible a strong advance of social controls into this 
area of “perversity”; but it also made possible the formation 
of a “reverse” discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its 
own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or “naturality” be 
acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same 
categories by which it was medically disqualified. There is 
not, on the one side, a discourse of power, and opposite it, 
another discourse that runs counter to it. Discourses are
