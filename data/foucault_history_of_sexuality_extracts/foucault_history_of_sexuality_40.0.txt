No “local center,” no “pattern of transformation” could 
function if, through a series of sequences, it did not eventu¬ 
ally enter into an over-all strategy. And inversely, no strategy 
could achieve comprehensive effects if did not gain support 
from precise and tenuous relations serving, not as its point 
of application or final outcome, but as its prop and anchor 
point. There is no discontinuity between them, as if one were 
dealing with two different levels (one microscopic and the

other macroscopic); but neither is there homogeneity (as if 
the one were only the enlarged projection or the miniaturiza¬ 
tion of the other); rather, one must conceive of the double 
conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tac¬ 
tics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them 
work. Thus the father in the family is not the “representa¬ 
tive” of the sovereign or the state; and the latter are not 
projections of the father on a different scale. The family does 
not duplicate society, just as society does not imitate the 
family. But the family organization, precisely to the extent 
that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the 
other power mechanisms, was used to support the great 
“maneuvers” employed for the Malthusian control of the 
birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicali- 
zation of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms. 

4. Rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses 

What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the 
surface of projection of these power mechanisms. Indeed, it 
is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together. 
And for this very reason, we must conceive discourse as a 
series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is 
neither uniform nor stable. To be more precise, we must not 
imagine a world of discourse divided between accepted dis¬ 
course and excluded discourse, or between the dominant 
discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of 
discursive elements that can come into play in various strate¬ 
gies. It is this distribution that we must reconstruct, with the 
things said and those concealed, the enunciations required
