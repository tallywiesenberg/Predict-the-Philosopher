and those forbidden, that it comprises; with the variants and 
different effects—according to who is speaking, his position 
of power, the institutional context in which he happens to be

includes. Discourses are not once and for all subservient to

power or raised up against it, any more than silences are. We 
must make allowance for the complex and unstable process 
whereby discourse can be both an instrument and an effect 
of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of 
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Dis¬ 
course transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but 
also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes 
it possible to thwart it. In like manner, silence and secrecy 
are a shelter for power, anchoring its prohibitions; but they 
also loosen its holds and provide for relatively obscure areas 
of tolerance. Consider for example the history of what was 
once “the” great sin against nature. The extreme discretion 
of the texts dealing with sodomy—that utterly confused cate¬ 
gory—and the nearly universal reticence in talking about it 
made possible a twofold operation: on the one hand, there 
was an extreme severity (punishment by fire was meted out 
well into the eighteenth century, without there being any 
substantial protest expressed before the middle of the cen¬ 
tury), and on the other hand, a tolerance that must have been 
widespread (which one can deduce indirectly from the infre¬ 
quency of judicial sentences, and which one glimpses more 
directly through certain statements concerning societies of 
men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts). 
There is no question that the appearance in nineteenth-cen¬ 
tury psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole se¬ 
ries of discourses on the species and subspecies of homosexu¬ 
ality, inversion, pederasty, and “psychic hermaphrodism” 
made possible a strong advance of social controls into this 
area of “perversity”; but it also made possible the formation 
of a “reverse” discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its 
own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or “naturality” be 
acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same 
categories by which it was medically disqualified. There is 
not, on the one side, a discourse of power, and opposite it, 
another discourse that runs counter to it. Discourses are
