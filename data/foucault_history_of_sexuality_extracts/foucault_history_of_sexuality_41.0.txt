relations; there can exist different and even contradictory 
discourses within the same strategy; they can, on the con¬ 
trary, circulate without changing their form from one strat¬

discourses on sex to tell us, above all, what strategy they 
derive from, or what moral divisions they accompany, or 
what ideology—dominant or dominated—they represent;

tactical productivity (what reciprocal effects of power and 
knowledge they ensure) and their strategical integration 
(what conjunction and what force relationship make their 
utilization necessary in a given episode of the various con¬ 
frontations that occur). 

In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a concep¬ 
tion of power which replaces the privilege of the law with the 
viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with 
the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty 
with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force 
relations, wherein far-reaching, but never completely stable, 
effects of domination are produced. The strategical model, 
rather than the model based on law. And this, not out of a 
speculative choice or theoretical preference, but because in 
fact it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that 
the force relationships which for a long time had found 
expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually be¬

it entirely. It appears rather as an especially dense transfer
