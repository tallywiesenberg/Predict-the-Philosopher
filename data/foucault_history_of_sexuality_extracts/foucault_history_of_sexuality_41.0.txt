tactical elements or blocks operating in the field of force

relations; there can exist different and even contradictory 
discourses within the same strategy; they can, on the con¬ 
trary, circulate without changing their form from one strat¬ 
egy to another, opposing strategy. We must not expect the 
discourses on sex to tell us, above all, what strategy they 
derive from, or what moral divisions they accompany, or 
what ideology—dominant or dominated—they represent; 
rather we must question them on the two levels of their 
tactical productivity (what reciprocal effects of power and 
knowledge they ensure) and their strategical integration 
(what conjunction and what force relationship make their 
utilization necessary in a given episode of the various con¬ 
frontations that occur). 

In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a concep¬ 
tion of power which replaces the privilege of the law with the 
viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with 
the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty 
with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force 
relations, wherein far-reaching, but never completely stable, 
effects of domination are produced. The strategical model, 
rather than the model based on law. And this, not out of a 
speculative choice or theoretical preference, but because in 
fact it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that 
the force relationships which for a long time had found 
expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually be¬ 
came invested in the order of political power.

Sexuality must not be described as a stubborn drive, by 
nature alien and of necessity disobedient to a power which 
exhausts itself trying to subdue it and often fails to control 
it entirely. It appears rather as an especially dense transfer 
point for relations of power: between men and women, young 
people and old people, parents and offspring, teachers and 
students, priests and laity, an administration and a popula¬ 
tion. Sexuality is not the most intractable element in power 
relations, but rather one of those endowed with the greatest 
instrumentality: useful for the greatest number of maneuvers 
and capable of serving as a point of support, as a linchpin, 
for the most varied strategies. 

There is no single, all-encompassing strategy, valid for all 
of society and uniformly bearing on all the manifestations of 
sex. For example, the idea that there have been repeated 
attempts, by various means, to reduce all of sex to its repro¬ 
ductive function, its heterosexual and adult form, and its 
matrimonial legitimacy fails to take into account the mani¬ 
fold objectives aimed for, the manifold means employed in 
the different sexual politics concerned with the two sexes, the 
different age groups and social classes. 

In a first approach to the problem, it seems that we can 
distinguish four great strategic unities which, beginning in 
the eighteenth century, formed specific mechanisms of 
knowledge and power centering on sex. These did not come

into being fully developed at that time; but it was then that 
they took on a consistency and gained an effectiveness in the 
order of power, as well as a productivity in the order of 
knowledge, so that it is possible to describe them in their 
relative autonomy. 

1. A hysterization of women’s bodies: a threefold process 
whereby the feminine body was analyzed—qualified and dis¬ 
qualified—as being thoroughly saturated with sexuality; 
whereby it was integrated into the sphere of medical prac¬ 
tices, by reason of a pathology intrinsic to it; whereby, finally, 
it was placed in organic communication with the social body 
(whose regulated fecundity it was supposed to ensure), the 
family space (of which it had to be a substantial and func¬ 
tional element), and the life of children (which it produced 
and had to guarantee, by virtue of a biologico-moral respon¬
