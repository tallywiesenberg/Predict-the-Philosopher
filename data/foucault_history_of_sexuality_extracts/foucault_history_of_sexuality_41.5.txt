point for relations of power: between men and women, young 
people and old people, parents and offspring, teachers and 
students, priests and laity, an administration and a popula¬ 
tion. Sexuality is not the most intractable element in power 
relations, but rather one of those endowed with the greatest 
instrumentality: useful for the greatest number of maneuvers 
and capable of serving as a point of support, as a linchpin, 
for the most varied strategies. 

There is no single, all-encompassing strategy, valid for all 
of society and uniformly bearing on all the manifestations of 
sex. For example, the idea that there have been repeated 
attempts, by various means, to reduce all of sex to its repro¬ 
ductive function, its heterosexual and adult form, and its 
matrimonial legitimacy fails to take into account the mani¬

the different sexual politics concerned with the two sexes, the 
different age groups and social classes. 

In a first approach to the problem, it seems that we can 
distinguish four great strategic unities which, beginning in 
the eighteenth century, formed specific mechanisms of 
knowledge and power centering on sex. These did not come

they took on a consistency and gained an effectiveness in the 
order of power, as well as a productivity in the order of 
knowledge, so that it is possible to describe them in their 
relative autonomy. 

1. A hysterization of women’s bodies: a threefold process 
whereby the feminine body was analyzed—qualified and dis¬ 
qualified—as being thoroughly saturated with sexuality; 
whereby it was integrated into the sphere of medical prac¬ 
tices, by reason of a pathology intrinsic to it; whereby, finally, 
it was placed in organic communication with the social body 
(whose regulated fecundity it was supposed to ensure), the 
family space (of which it had to be a substantial and func¬ 
tional element), and the life of children (which it produced 
and had to guarantee, by virtue of a biologico-moral respon¬
