sibility lasting through the entire period of the children’s 
education): the Mother, with her negative image of “nervous 
woman,” constituted the most visible form of this hysteriza¬ 
tion. 

2. A pedagogization of children's sex: a double assertion 
that practically all children indulge or are prone to indulge 
in sexual activity; and that, being unwarranted, at the same 
time “natural” and “contrary to nature,” this sexual activity 
posed physical and moral, individual and collective dangers; 
children were defined as “preliminary” sexual beings, on this 
side of sex, yet within it, astride a dangerous dividing line. 
Parents, families, educators, doctors, and eventually psy¬ 
chologists would have to take charge, in a continuous way, 
of this precious and perilous, dangerous and endangered 
sexual potential: this pedagogization was especially evident 
in the war against onanism, which in the West lasted nearly

tributing a pathogenic value—for the individual and the spe¬

4. A psychiatrization of perverse pleasure: the sexual in¬ 
stinct was isolated as a separate biological and psychical 
instinct; a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of 
anomalies by which it could be afflicted; it was assigned a role 
of normalization or pathologization with respect to all be¬ 
havior; and finally, a corrective technology was sought for 
these anomalies. 

Four figures emerged from this preoccupation with sex, 
which mounted throughout the nineteenth century—four 
privileged objects of knowledge, which were also targets and 
anchorage points for the ventures of knowledge: the hysteri¬
