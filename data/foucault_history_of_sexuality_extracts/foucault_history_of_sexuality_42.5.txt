cal woman, the masturbating child, the Malthusian couple, 
and the perverse adult. Each of them corresponded to one of 
these strategies which, each in its own way, invested and 
made use of the sex of women, children, and men. 

What was at issue in these strategies? A struggle against 
sexuality? Or were they part of an effort to gain control of 
it? An attempt to regulate it more effectively and mask its 
more indiscreet, conspicuous, and intractable aspects? A way 
of formulating only that measure of knowledge about it that 
was acceptable or useful? In actual fact, what was involved, 
rather, was the very production of sexuality. Sexuality must 
not be thought of as a kind of natural given which power tries 
to hold in check, or as an obscure domain which knowledge 
tries gradually to uncover. It is the name that can be given 
to a historical construct: not a furtive reality that is difficult 
to grasp, but a great surface network in which the stimula¬ 
tion of bodies, the intensification of pleasures, the incitement

to discourse, the formation of special knowledges, the 
strengthening of controls and resistances, are linked to one 
another, in accordance with a few major strategies of knowl¬ 
edge and power. 

It will be granted no doubt that relations of sex gave rise, 
in every society, to a deployment of alliance: a system of 
marriage, of fixation and development of kinship ties, of 
transmission of names and possessions. This deployment of 
alliance, with the mechanisms of constraint that ensured its 
existence and the complex knowledge it often required, lost 
some of its importance as economic processes and political 
structures could no longer rely on it as an adequate instru¬ 
ment or sufficient support. Particularly from the eighteenth 
century onward, Western societies created and deployed a 
new apparatus which was superimposed on the previous one, 
and which, without completely supplanting the latter, helped 
to reduce its importance. I am speaking of the deployment of 
sexuality: like the deployment of alliance, it connects up with 
the circuit of sexual partners, but in a completely different 
way. The two systems can be contrasted term by term. The 
deployment of alliance is built around a system of rules 
defining the permitted and the forbidden, the licit and the
