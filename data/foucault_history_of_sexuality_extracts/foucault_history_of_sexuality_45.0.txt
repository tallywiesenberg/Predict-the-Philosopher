The Deployment of Sexuality

and yet they also provided an opportunity for the alliance 
system to assert its prerogatives in the order of sexuality. 
Then a pressing demand emanated from the family: a 
plea for help in reconciling these unfortunate conflicts be¬ 
tween sexuality and alliance; and, caught in the grip of 
this deployment of sexuality which had invested it from 
without, contributing to its solidification into its modern 
form, the family broadcast the long complaint of its sex¬ 
ual suffering to doctors, educators, psychiatrists, priests, 
and pastors, to all the “experts” who would listen. It was 
as if it had suddenly discovered the dreadful secret of 
what had always been hinted at and inculcated in it: the 
family, the keystone of alliance, was the germ of all the 
misfortunes of sex. And lo and behold, from the mid¬ 
nineteenth century onward, the family engaged in search¬ 
ing out the slightest traces of sexuality in its midst, 
wrenching from itself the most difficult confessions, solic¬ 
iting an audience with everyone who might know some¬ 
thing about the matter, and opening itself unreservedly to 
endless examination. The family was the crystal in the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality: it seemed to be the source of a sex¬ 
uality which it actually only reflected and diffracted. By 
virtue of its permeability, and through that process of re¬ 
flections to the outside, it became one of the most valu¬ 
able tactical components of the deployment. 

But this development was not without its tensions and 
problems. Charcot doubtless constituted a central figure in 
this as well. For many years he was the most noteworthy of 
all those to whom families, burdened down as they were with 
this sexuality that saturated them, appealed for mediation 
and treatment. On receiving parents who brought him their 
children, husbands their wives, and wives their husbands, 
from the world over, his first concern was to separate the 
“patient” from his family, and the better to observe him, he 
would pay as little attention as possible to what the family

had to say. 3 He sought to detach the sphere of sexuality from 
the system of alliance, in order to deal with it directly 
through a medical practice whose technicity and autonomy 
were guaranteed by the neurological model. Medicine thus 
assumed final responsibility, according to the rules of a spe¬ 
cific knowledge, for a sexuality which it had in fact urged 
families to concern themselves with as an essential task and 
a major danger. Moreover, Charcot noted on several occa¬ 
sions how difficult it was for families to “yield” the patient 
whom they nonetheless had brought to the doctor, how they 
laid siege to the mental hospitals where the subject was being 
kept out of view, and the ways in which they were constantly 
interfering with the doctor’s work. Their worry was unwar¬ 
ranted, however: the therapist only intervened in order to 
return to them individuals who were sexually compatible 
with the family system; and while this intervention manipu¬ 
lated the sexual body, it did not authorize the latter to define 
itself in explicit discourse. One must not speak of these “geni¬ 
tal causes”: so went the phrase—muttered in a muted voice 
—which the most famous ears of our time overheard one day 
in 1886, from the mouth of Charcot. 

This was the context in which psychoanalysis set to work; 
but not without substantially modifying the pattern of anxie¬ 
ties and reassurances. In the beginning it must have given 
rise to distrust and hostility, for, pushing Charcot’s lesson to 
the extreme, it undertook to examine the sexuality of in¬ 
dividuals outside family control; it brought this sexuality to 
light without covering it over again with the neurological 
model; more serious still, it called family relations into ques¬ 
tion in the analysis it made of them. But despite everything, 

1 Jean-Martin Charcot, Lemons de Mardi, January 7, 1888: “In order to properly 
treat a hysterical girl, one must not leave her with her father and mother; she needs 
to be placed in a mental hospital. . . . Do you know how long well-behaved little 
girls cry for their mothers after they part company? . . . Let us take the average, 
if you will; it's not very long, a half-hour or thereabouts.” 

February 21, 1888: “In the case of hysteria of young boys, what one must do is 
to separate them from their mothers. So long as they are with their mothers, nothing 
is of any use. . . . The father is sometimes just as unbearable as the mother; it is 
best, then, to get rid of them both.”
