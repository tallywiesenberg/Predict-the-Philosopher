psychoanalysis, whose technical procedure seemed to place 
the confession of sexuality outside family jurisdiction, redis¬ 
covered the law of alliance, the involved workings of mar¬ 
riage and kinship, and incest at the heart of this sexuality, as 
the principle of its formation and the key to its intelligibility. 
The guarantee that one would find the parents-children rela¬ 
tionship at the root of everyone’s sexuality made it possible 
—even when everything seemed to point to the reverse proc¬ 
ess—to keep the deployment of sexuality coupled to the 
system of alliance. There was no risk that sexuality would 
appear to be, by nature, alien to the law: it was constituted 
only through the law. Parents, do not be afraid to bring your 
children to analysis: it will teach them that in any case it is 
you whom they love. Children, you really shouldn’t com¬ 
plain that you are not orphans, that you always rediscover 
in your innermost selves your Object-Mother or the sover¬ 
eign sign of your Father: it is through them that you gain 
access to desire. Whence, after so many reticences, the enor¬ 
mous consumption of analysis in societies where the deploy¬ 
ment of alliance and the family system needed strengthening. 
For this is one of the most significant aspects of this entire 
history of the deployment of sexuality: it had its beginnings 
in the technology of the “flesh” in classical Christianity, 
basing itself on the alliance system and the rules that gov¬ 
erned the latter; but today it fills a reverse function in that 
it tends to prop up the old deployment of alliance. From the 
direction of conscience to psychoanalysis, the deployments 
of alliance and sexuality were involved in a slow process that 
had them turning about one another until, more than three 
centuries later, their positions were reversed; in the Christian 
pastoral, the law of alliance codified the flesh which was just 
being discovered and fitted it into a framework that was still 
juridical in character; with psychoanalysis, sexuality gave 
body and life to the rules of alliance by saturating them with 
desire. 

Hence the domain we must analyze in the different studies 
that will follow the present volume is that deployment of

The History of Sexuality 


sexuality: its formation on the basis of the Christian notion 
of the flesh, and its development through the four great 
strategies that were deployed in the nineteenth century: the 
sexualization of children, the hysterization of women, the 
specification of the perverted, and the regulation of popula¬ 
tions—all strategies that went by way of a family which must 
be viewed, not as a powerful agency of prohibition, but as a 
major factor of sexualization. 

The first phase corresponded to the need to form a “labor 
force” (hence to avoid any useless “expenditure,” any wasted 
energy, so that all forces were reduced to labor capacity 
alone) and to ensure its reproduction (conjugality, the regu¬ 
lated fabrication of children). The second phase corre¬ 
sponded to that epoch of Spatkapitalismus in which the 
exploitation of wage labor does not demand the same violent 
and physical constraints as in the nineteenth century, and 
where the politics of the body does not require the elision of 
sex or its restriction solely to the reproductive function; it 
relies instead on a multiple channeling into the controlled 
circuits of the economy—on what has been called a hyper- 
repressive desublimation. 

If the politics of sex makes little use of the law of the taboo 
but brings into play an entire technical machinery, if what 
is involved is the production of sexuality rather than the 
repression of sex, then our emphasis has to be placed else¬ 
where; we must shift our analysis away from the problem of 
“labor capacity” and doubtless abandon the diffuse energet¬ 
ics that underlies the theme of a sexuality repressed for eco¬ 
nomic reasons.

Periodization 


The history of sexuality supposes two ruptures if one tries 
to center it on mechanisms of repression. The first, occurring 
in the course of the seventeenth century, was characterized 
by the advent of the great prohibitions, the exclusive promo¬ 
tion of adult marital sexuality, the imperatives of decency, 
the obligatory concealment of the body, the reduction to 
silence and mandatory reticences of language. The second, a 
twentieth-century phenomenon, was really less a rupture 
than an inflexion of the curve: this was the moment when the 
mechanisms of repression were seen as beginning to loosen
