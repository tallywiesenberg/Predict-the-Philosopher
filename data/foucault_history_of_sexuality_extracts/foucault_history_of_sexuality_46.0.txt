psychoanalysis, whose technical procedure seemed to place 
the confession of sexuality outside family jurisdiction, redis¬ 
covered the law of alliance, the involved workings of mar¬ 
riage and kinship, and incest at the heart of this sexuality, as 
the principle of its formation and the key to its intelligibility. 
The guarantee that one would find the parents-children rela¬ 
tionship at the root of everyone’s sexuality made it possible 
—even when everything seemed to point to the reverse proc¬ 
ess—to keep the deployment of sexuality coupled to the 
system of alliance. There was no risk that sexuality would 
appear to be, by nature, alien to the law: it was constituted 
only through the law. Parents, do not be afraid to bring your 
children to analysis: it will teach them that in any case it is 
you whom they love. Children, you really shouldn’t com¬ 
plain that you are not orphans, that you always rediscover 
in your innermost selves your Object-Mother or the sover¬ 
eign sign of your Father: it is through them that you gain 
access to desire. Whence, after so many reticences, the enor¬ 
mous consumption of analysis in societies where the deploy¬ 
ment of alliance and the family system needed strengthening. 
For this is one of the most significant aspects of this entire 
history of the deployment of sexuality: it had its beginnings 
in the technology of the “flesh” in classical Christianity, 
basing itself on the alliance system and the rules that gov¬ 
erned the latter; but today it fills a reverse function in that 
it tends to prop up the old deployment of alliance. From the 
direction of conscience to psychoanalysis, the deployments 
of alliance and sexuality were involved in a slow process that 
had them turning about one another until, more than three 
centuries later, their positions were reversed; in the Christian 
pastoral, the law of alliance codified the flesh which was just 
being discovered and fitted it into a framework that was still 
juridical in character; with psychoanalysis, sexuality gave 
body and life to the rules of alliance by saturating them with 
desire. 

Hence the domain we must analyze in the different studies 
that will follow the present volume is that deployment of
