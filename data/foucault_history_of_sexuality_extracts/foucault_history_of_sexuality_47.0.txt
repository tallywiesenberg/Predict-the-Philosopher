their grip; one passed from insistent sexual taboos to a rela¬ 
tive tolerance with regard to prenuptial or extramarital rela¬ 
tions; the disqualification of “perverts” diminished, their 
condemnation by the law was in part eliminated; a good 
many of the taboos that weighed on the sexuality of children 
were lifted. 

We must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices: 
the inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renova¬ 
tions of previous techniques. But there is also the calendar 
of their utilization to consider, the chronology of their diffu¬ 
sion and of the effects (of subjugation and resistance) they 
produced. These multiple datings doubtless will not coincide 
with the great repressive cycle that is ordinarily situated 
between the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries.

a long way. Their point of formation must be sought in the 
penitential practices of medieval Christianity, or rather in 
the dual series constituted by the obligatory, exhaustive, and 
periodic confession imposed on all the faithful by the Lateran 
Council and by the methods of asceticism, spiritual exercise, 
and mysticism that evolved with special intensity from the 
sixteenth century on. First the Reformation, then Tridentine 
Catholicism, mark an important mutation and a schism in 
what might be called the “traditional technology of the 
flesh.” A division whose depth should not be under¬ 
estimated; but this did not rule out a certain parallelism in 
the Catholic and Protestant methods of examination of con¬ 
science and pastoral direction: procedures for analyzing 
“concupiscence” and transforming it into discourse were 
established in both instances. This was a rich, refined tech¬ 
nique which began to take shape in the sixteenth century and 
went through a long series of theoretical elaborations until, 
at the end of the eighteenth century, it became fixed in ex¬ 
pressions capable of symbolizing the mitigated strictness of 
Alfonso de’ Liguori in the one case and Wesleyan pedagogy 
in the other. 

It was during the same period—the end of the eighteenth 
century—and for reasons that will have to be determined, 
that there emerged a completely new technology of sex; new 
in that for the most part it escaped the ecclesiastical institu¬ 
tion without being truly independent of the thematics of sin. 
Through pedagogy, medicine, and economics, it made sex 
not only a secular concern but a concern of the state as well; 
to be more exact, sex became a matter that required the social 
body as a whole, and virtually all of its individuals, to place 
themselves under surveillance. New too for the fact that it 
expanded along three axes: that of pedagogy, having as its 
objective the specific sexuality of children; that of medicine, 
whose objective was the sexual physiology peculiar to 
women; and last, that of demography, whose objective was 
the spontaneous or concerted regulation of births. Thus the

“sin of youth,” “nervous disorders,” and “frauds against 
procreation” (as those “deadly secrets” were later to be 
called) designate three privileged areas of this new technol¬ 
ogy. There is no question that in each of these areas, it went 
back to methods that had already been formed by Christian¬ 
ity, but of course not without modifying them: the sexuality 
of children was already problematized in the spiritual 
pedagogy of Christianity (it is interesting to note that Molli- 
ties, the first treatise on sin, was written in the fifteenth 
century by an educator and mystic named Gerson, and that 
the Onania collection compiled by Dekker in the eighteenth 
century repeats word for word examples set forth by the 
Anglican pastoral); the eighteenth-century medicine of 
nerves and vapors took up in turn a field of analysis that had 
already been delimited when the phenomena of possession 
fomented a grave crisis in the all too indiscreet practices of 
conscience direction and spiritual examination (nervous ill¬ 
ness is certainly not the truth of possession, but the medicine 
of hysteria is not unrelated to the earlier direction of “ob¬ 
sessed” women); and the campaigns apropos of the birthrate 
took the place of the control of conjugal relations—in a 
different form and at another level—which the Christian 
penance had so persistently sought to establish through its 
examinations. A visible continuity, therefore, but one that 
did not prevent a major transformation: from that time on, 
the technology of sex was ordered in relation to the medical
