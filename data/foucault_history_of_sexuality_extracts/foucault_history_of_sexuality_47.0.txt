their grip; one passed from insistent sexual taboos to a rela¬ 
tive tolerance with regard to prenuptial or extramarital rela¬ 
tions; the disqualification of “perverts” diminished, their 
condemnation by the law was in part eliminated; a good 
many of the taboos that weighed on the sexuality of children 
were lifted. 

We must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices: 
the inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renova¬ 
tions of previous techniques. But there is also the calendar 
of their utilization to consider, the chronology of their diffu¬ 
sion and of the effects (of subjugation and resistance) they 
produced. These multiple datings doubtless will not coincide 
with the great repressive cycle that is ordinarily situated 
between the seventeenth and the twentieth centuries.

a long way. Their point of formation must be sought in the 
penitential practices of medieval Christianity, or rather in 
the dual series constituted by the obligatory, exhaustive, and 
periodic confession imposed on all the faithful by the Lateran 
Council and by the methods of asceticism, spiritual exercise, 
and mysticism that evolved with special intensity from the 
sixteenth century on. First the Reformation, then Tridentine 
Catholicism, mark an important mutation and a schism in 
what might be called the “traditional technology of the 
flesh.” A division whose depth should not be under¬ 
estimated; but this did not rule out a certain parallelism in 
the Catholic and Protestant methods of examination of con¬ 
science and pastoral direction: procedures for analyzing 
“concupiscence” and transforming it into discourse were 
established in both instances. This was a rich, refined tech¬ 
nique which began to take shape in the sixteenth century and 
went through a long series of theoretical elaborations until, 
at the end of the eighteenth century, it became fixed in ex¬ 
pressions capable of symbolizing the mitigated strictness of 
Alfonso de’ Liguori in the one case and Wesleyan pedagogy 
in the other.
