institution, the exigency of normality, and—instead of the 
question of death and everlasting punishment—the problem 
of life and illness. The flesh was brought down to the level 
of the organism. 

This mutation took place at the turn of the nineteenth 
century; it opened the way for many other transformations 
that derived from it. The first of these set apart the medicine 
of sex from the medicine of the body; it isolated a sexual 
“instinct” capable of presenting constitutive anomalies, ac¬ 
quired derivations, infirmities, or pathological processes.

The History of Sexuality 


Heinrich Kaan’s Psychopathia Sexualis, published in 1846, 
can be used as an indicator: these were the years that saw the 
correlative appearance of a medicine, an “orthopedics,” 
specific to sex: in a word, the opening up of the great medico- 
psychological domain of the “perversions,” which was 
destined to take over from the old moral categories of de¬ 
bauchery and excess. In the same period, the analysis of 
heredity was placing sex (sexual relations, venereal diseases, 
matrimonial alliances, perversions) in a position of “biologi¬ 
cal responsibility” with regard to the species: not only could 
sex be affected by its own diseases, it could also, if it was not 
controlled, transmit diseases or create others that would 
afflict future generations. Thus it appeared to be the source 
of an entire capital for the species to draw from. Whence the 
medical—but also political—project for organizing a state 
management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex 
and its fertility had to be administered. The medicine of 
perversions and the programs of eugenics were the two great 
innovations in the technology of sex of the second half of the 
nineteenth century. 

Innovations that merged together quite well, for the 
theory of “degenerescence” made it possible for them to 
perpetually refer back to one another; it explained how a 
heredity that was burdened with various maladies (it made 
little difference whether these were organic, functional, or 
psychical) ended by producing a sexual pervert (look into the 
genealogy of an exhibitionist or a homosexual: you will find 
a hemiplegic ancestor, a phthisic parent, or an uncle afflicted 
with senile dementia); but it went on to explain how a sexual
