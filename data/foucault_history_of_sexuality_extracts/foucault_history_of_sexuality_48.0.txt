institution, the exigency of normality, and—instead of the 
question of death and everlasting punishment—the problem 
of life and illness. The flesh was brought down to the level 
of the organism. 

This mutation took place at the turn of the nineteenth 
century; it opened the way for many other transformations 
that derived from it. The first of these set apart the medicine 
of sex from the medicine of the body; it isolated a sexual 
“instinct” capable of presenting constitutive anomalies, ac¬ 
quired derivations, infirmities, or pathological processes.

The History of Sexuality 


Heinrich Kaan’s Psychopathia Sexualis, published in 1846, 
can be used as an indicator: these were the years that saw the 
correlative appearance of a medicine, an “orthopedics,” 
specific to sex: in a word, the opening up of the great medico- 
psychological domain of the “perversions,” which was 
destined to take over from the old moral categories of de¬ 
bauchery and excess. In the same period, the analysis of 
heredity was placing sex (sexual relations, venereal diseases, 
matrimonial alliances, perversions) in a position of “biologi¬ 
cal responsibility” with regard to the species: not only could 
sex be affected by its own diseases, it could also, if it was not 
controlled, transmit diseases or create others that would 
afflict future generations. Thus it appeared to be the source 
of an entire capital for the species to draw from. Whence the 
medical—but also political—project for organizing a state 
management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex 
and its fertility had to be administered. The medicine of 
perversions and the programs of eugenics were the two great 
innovations in the technology of sex of the second half of the 
nineteenth century. 

Innovations that merged together quite well, for the 
theory of “degenerescence” made it possible for them to 
perpetually refer back to one another; it explained how a 
heredity that was burdened with various maladies (it made 
little difference whether these were organic, functional, or 
psychical) ended by producing a sexual pervert (look into the 
genealogy of an exhibitionist or a homosexual: you will find 
a hemiplegic ancestor, a phthisic parent, or an uncle afflicted 
with senile dementia); but it went on to explain how a sexual 
perversion resulted in the depletion of one’s line of descent 
—rickets in the children, the sterility of future generations. 
The series composed of perversion-heredity-degenerescence 
formed the solid nucleus of the new technologies of sex. And 
let it not be imagined that this was nothing more than a 
medical theory which was scientifically lacking and improp¬ 
erly moralistic. Its application was widespread and its im-

plantation went deep. Psychiatry, to be sure, but also juris¬ 
prudence, legal medicine, agencies of social control, the sur¬ 
veillance of dangerous or endangered children, all func¬ 
tioned for a long time on the basis of “degen - 
erescence” and the heredity-perversion system. An entire 
social practice, which took the exasperated but coherent 
form of a state-directed racism, furnished this technology of 
sex with a formidable power and far-reaching consequences. 

And the strange position of psychiatry at the end of the 
nineteenth century would be hard to comprehend if one did 
not see the rupture it brought about in the great system of 
degenerescence: it resumed the project of a medical technol¬ 
ogy appropriate for dealing with the sexual instinct; but it 
sought to free it from its ties with heredity, and hence from 
eugenics and the various racisms. It is very well to look back 
from our vantage point and remark upon the normalizing 
impulse in Freud; one can go on to denounce the role played 
for many years by the psychoanalytic institution; but the fact 
remains that in the great family of technologies of sex, which 
goes so far back into the history of the Christian West, of all 
those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to 
medicalize sex, it was the one that, up to the decade of the 
forties, rigorously opposed the political and institutional 
effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system. 

It is clear that the genealogy of all these techniques, with 
their mutations, their shifts, their continuities and ruptures, 
does not coincide with the hypothesis of a great repressive 
phase that was inaugurated in the course of the classical age 
and began to slowly decline in the twentieth. There was 
rather a perpetual inventiveness, a steady growth of methods 
and procedures, with two especially productive moments in 
this proliferating history: around the middle of the sixteenth
