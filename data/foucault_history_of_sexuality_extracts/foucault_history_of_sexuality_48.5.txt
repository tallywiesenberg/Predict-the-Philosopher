The series composed of perversion-heredity-degenerescence 
formed the solid nucleus of the new technologies of sex. And 
let it not be imagined that this was nothing more than a 
medical theory which was scientifically lacking and improp¬ 
erly moralistic. Its application was widespread and its im-

plantation went deep. Psychiatry, to be sure, but also juris¬ 
prudence, legal medicine, agencies of social control, the sur¬ 
veillance of dangerous or endangered children, all func¬ 
tioned for a long time on the basis of “degen - 
erescence” and the heredity-perversion system. An entire 
social practice, which took the exasperated but coherent 
form of a state-directed racism, furnished this technology of 
sex with a formidable power and far-reaching consequences. 

And the strange position of psychiatry at the end of the 
nineteenth century would be hard to comprehend if one did 
not see the rupture it brought about in the great system of 
degenerescence: it resumed the project of a medical technol¬ 
ogy appropriate for dealing with the sexual instinct; but it 
sought to free it from its ties with heredity, and hence from 
eugenics and the various racisms. It is very well to look back 
from our vantage point and remark upon the normalizing 
impulse in Freud; one can go on to denounce the role played 
for many years by the psychoanalytic institution; but the fact 
remains that in the great family of technologies of sex, which 
goes so far back into the history of the Christian West, of all 
those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to 
medicalize sex, it was the one that, up to the decade of the 
forties, rigorously opposed the political and institutional 
effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system. 

It is clear that the genealogy of all these techniques, with 
their mutations, their shifts, their continuities and ruptures, 
does not coincide with the hypothesis of a great repressive 
phase that was inaugurated in the course of the classical age 
and began to slowly decline in the twentieth. There was 
rather a perpetual inventiveness, a steady growth of methods 
and procedures, with two especially productive moments in 
this proliferating history: around the middle of the sixteenth
