century, the development of procedures of direction and 
examination of conscience; and at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century, the advent of medical technologies of sex.

themselves. The history of their spread and their point of 
application is something else again. If one writes the history 
of sexuality in terms of repression, relating this repression to 
the utilization of labor capacity, one must suppose that sex¬ 
ual controls were the more intense and meticulous as they 
were directed at the poorer classes; one has to assume that 
they followed the path of greatest domination and the most 
systematic exploitation: the young adult man, possessing 
nothing more than his life force, had to be the primary target 
of a subjugation destined to shift the energy available for 
useless pleasure toward compulsory labor. But this does not 
appear to be the way things actually happened. On the con¬ 
trary, the most rigorous techniques were formed and, more 
particularly, applied first, with the greatest intensity, in the 
economically privileged and politically dominant classes. 
The direction of consciences, self-examination, the entire 
long elaboration of the transgressions of the flesh, and the 
scrupulous detection of concupiscence were all subtle proce¬ 
dures that could only have been accessible to small groups 
of people. It is true that the penitential method of Alfonso 
de’ Liguori and the rules recommended to the Methodists by 
Wesley ensured that these procedures would be more widely 
disseminated, after a fashion; but this was at the cost of a 
considerable simplification. 

The same can be said of the family as an agency of control 
and a point of sexual saturation; it was in the “bourgeois” or 
“aristocratic” family that the sexuality of children and 
adolescents was first problematized, and feminine sexuality 
medicalized; it was the first to be alerted to the potential 
pathology of sex, the urgent need to keep it under close 
watch and to devise a rational technology of correction. It 
was this family that first became a locus for the psychiatriza- 
tion of sex. Surrendering to fears, creating remedies, appeal¬ 
ing for rescue by learned techniques, generating countless 
discourses, it was the first to commit itself to sexual erethism. 
The bourgeoisie began by considering that its own sex was 



The Deployment of Sexuality

something important, a fragile treasure, a secret that had to 
be discovered at all costs. It is worth remembering that the 
first figure to be invested by the deployment of sexuality, one 
of the first to be “sexualized,” was the “idle” woman. She 
inhabited the outer edge of the “world,” in which she always 
had to appear as a value, and of the family, where she was 
assigned a new destiny charged with conjugal and parental 
obligations. Thus there emerged the “nervous” woman, the 
woman afflicted with “vapors”; in this figure, the hysteriza- 
tion of woman found its anchorage point. As for the adoles¬ 
cent wasting his future substance in secret pleasures, the 
onanistic child who was of such concern to doctors and 
educators from the end of the eighteenth century to the end 
of the nineteenth, this was not the child of the people, the 
future worker who had to be taught the disciplines of the 
body, but rather the schoolboy, the child surrounded by 
domestic servants, tutors, and governesses, who was in dan¬ 
ger of compromising not so much his physical strength as his 
intellectual capacity, his moral fiber, and the obligation to 
preserve a healthy line of descent for his family and his social 
class. 

For their part, the working classes managed for a long 
time to escape the deployment of “sexuality. ” Of course, 
they were subjected in specific ways to the deployment of 
“alliances”: the exploitation of legitimate marriage and fertil¬ 
ity, the exclusion of consanguine sexual union, prescriptions 
of social and local endogamy. On the other hand, it is un¬ 
likely that the Christian technology of the flesh ever had any 
importance for them. As for the mechanisms of sexualiza- 
tion, these penetrated them slowly and apparently in three 
successive stages. The first involved the problems of birth 
control, when it was discovered, at the end of the eighteenth 
century, that the art of fooling nature was not the exclusive 
privilege of city dwellers and libertines, but was known and 
practiced by those who, being close to nature itself, should 
have held it to be more repugnant than anyone else did. Next
