century, the development of procedures of direction and 
examination of conscience; and at the beginning of the nine¬ 
teenth century, the advent of medical technologies of sex.

themselves. The history of their spread and their point of 
application is something else again. If one writes the history 
of sexuality in terms of repression, relating this repression to 
the utilization of labor capacity, one must suppose that sex¬ 
ual controls were the more intense and meticulous as they 
were directed at the poorer classes; one has to assume that 
they followed the path of greatest domination and the most 
systematic exploitation: the young adult man, possessing 
nothing more than his life force, had to be the primary target 
of a subjugation destined to shift the energy available for 
useless pleasure toward compulsory labor. But this does not 
appear to be the way things actually happened. On the con¬ 
trary, the most rigorous techniques were formed and, more 
particularly, applied first, with the greatest intensity, in the 
economically privileged and politically dominant classes. 
The direction of consciences, self-examination, the entire 
long elaboration of the transgressions of the flesh, and the 
scrupulous detection of concupiscence were all subtle proce¬ 
dures that could only have been accessible to small groups 
of people. It is true that the penitential method of Alfonso 
de’ Liguori and the rules recommended to the Methodists by 
Wesley ensured that these procedures would be more widely 
disseminated, after a fashion; but this was at the cost of a 
considerable simplification. 

The same can be said of the family as an agency of control 
and a point of sexual saturation; it was in the “bourgeois” or 
“aristocratic” family that the sexuality of children and 
adolescents was first problematized, and feminine sexuality 
medicalized; it was the first to be alerted to the potential 
pathology of sex, the urgent need to keep it under close 
watch and to devise a rational technology of correction. It 
was this family that first became a locus for the psychiatriza- 
tion of sex. Surrendering to fears, creating remedies, appeal¬ 
ing for rescue by learned techniques, generating countless 
discourses, it was the first to commit itself to sexual erethism.
