The Deployment of Sexuality

something important, a fragile treasure, a secret that had to 
be discovered at all costs. It is worth remembering that the 
first figure to be invested by the deployment of sexuality, one 
of the first to be “sexualized,” was the “idle” woman. She 
inhabited the outer edge of the “world,” in which she always 
had to appear as a value, and of the family, where she was 
assigned a new destiny charged with conjugal and parental 
obligations. Thus there emerged the “nervous” woman, the 
woman afflicted with “vapors”; in this figure, the hysteriza- 
tion of woman found its anchorage point. As for the adoles¬ 
cent wasting his future substance in secret pleasures, the 
onanistic child who was of such concern to doctors and 
educators from the end of the eighteenth century to the end 
of the nineteenth, this was not the child of the people, the 
future worker who had to be taught the disciplines of the 
body, but rather the schoolboy, the child surrounded by 
domestic servants, tutors, and governesses, who was in dan¬ 
ger of compromising not so much his physical strength as his 
intellectual capacity, his moral fiber, and the obligation to 
preserve a healthy line of descent for his family and his social 
class. 

For their part, the working classes managed for a long 
time to escape the deployment of “sexuality. ” Of course, 
they were subjected in specific ways to the deployment of 
“alliances”: the exploitation of legitimate marriage and fertil¬ 
ity, the exclusion of consanguine sexual union, prescriptions 
of social and local endogamy. On the other hand, it is un¬ 
likely that the Christian technology of the flesh ever had any 
importance for them. As for the mechanisms of sexualiza- 
tion, these penetrated them slowly and apparently in three 
successive stages. The first involved the problems of birth 
control, when it was discovered, at the end of the eighteenth 
century, that the art of fooling nature was not the exclusive 
privilege of city dwellers and libertines, but was known and 
practiced by those who, being close to nature itself, should 
have held it to be more repugnant than anyone else did. Next
