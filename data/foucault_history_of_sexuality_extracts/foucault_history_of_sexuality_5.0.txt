Underlying the difference between the physiol¬ 
ogy of reproduction and the medical theories of sexuality, we 
would have to see something other and something more than 
an uneven scientific development or a disparity in the forms 
of rationality; the one would partake of that immense will to 
knowledge which has sustained the establishment of scien¬ 
tific discourse in the West, whereas the other would derive 
from a stubborn will to nonknowledge.This much is undeniable: the learned discourse on sex that 
was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with 
age-old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a 
refusal to see and to understand; but further—and this is the 
crucial point—a refusal concerning the very thing that was 
brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solic¬ 
ited.For there can be no misunderstanding that is not based 
on a fundamental relation to truth.Evading this truth, bar¬ 
ring access to it, masking it: these were so many local tactics 
which, as if by superimposition and through a last-minute 
detour, gave a paradoxical form to a fundamental petition to 
know.Choosing not to recognize was yet another vagary of 
the will to truth.
