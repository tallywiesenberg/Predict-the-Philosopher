sive fact,” the way in which sex is “put into discourse.” 
Hence, too, my main concern will be to locate the forms of 
power, the channels it takes, and the discourses it permeates 
in order to reach the most tenuous and individual modes of 
behavior, the paths that give it access to the rare or scarcely 
perceivable forms of desire, how it penetrates and controls 
everyday pleasure—all this entailing effects that may be 
those of refusal, blockage, and invalidation, but also incite¬ 
ment and intensification: in short, the “polymorphous tech¬ 
niques of power.” And finally, the essential aim will not be 
to determine whether these discursive productions and these 
effects of power lead one to formulate the truth about sex, or

on the contrary falsehoods designed to conceal that truth, 
but rather to bring out the “will to knowledge” that serves 
as both their support and their instrument. 

Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not claim that sex 
has not been prohibited or barred or masked or misap¬ 
prehended since the classical age; nor do I even assert that 
it has suffered these things any less from that period on than 
before. I do not maintain that the prohibition of sex is a ruse; 
but it is a ruse to make prohibition into the basic and con¬ 
stitutive element from which one would be able to write the 
history of what has been said concerning sex starting from 
the modern epoch. All these negative elements—defenses, 
censorships, denials—which the repressive hypothesis 
groups together in one great central mechanism destined to 
say no, are doubtless only component parts that have a local 
and tactical role to play in a transformation into discourse, 
a technology of power, and a will to knowledge that are far 
from being reducible to the former. 

In short, I would like to disengage my analysis from the 
privileges generally accorded the economy of scarcity and 
the principles of rarefaction, to search instead for instances 
of discursive production (which also administer silences, to 
be sure), of the production of power (which sometimes have 
the function of prohibiting), of the propagation of knowledge 
(which often cause mistaken beliefs or systematic misconcep¬ 
tions to circulate); I would like to write the history of these 
instances and their transformations. A first survey made 
from this viewpoint seems to indicate that since the end of 
the sixteenth century, the “putting into discourse of sex,” far 
from undergoing a process of restriction, on the contrary has 
been subjected to a mechanism of increasing incitement; that 
the techniques of power exercised over sex have not obeyed 
a principle of rigorous selection, but rather one of dissemina¬ 
tion and implantation of polymorphous sexualities; and that 
the will to knowledge has not come to a halt in the face of 
a taboo that must not be lifted, but has persisted in constitut-

ing—despite many mistakes, of course—a science of sexual¬ 
ity. It is these movements that I will now attempt to bring 
into focus in a schematic way, bypassing as it were the repres¬ 
sive hypothesis and the facts of interdiction or exclusion it 
invokes, and starting from certain historical facts that serve 
as guidelines for research.

The Incitement 
to Discourse 


The seventeenth century, then, was the beginning of an age 
of repression emblematic of what we call the bourgeois soci¬ 
eties, an age which perhaps we still have not completely left 
behind. Calling sex by its name thereafter became more diffi¬ 
cult and more costly. As if in order to gain mastery over it 
in reality, it had first been necessary to subjugate it at the 
level of language, control its free circulation in speech, ex¬ 
punge it from the things that were said, and extinguish the
