sive fact,” the way in which sex is “put into discourse.” 
Hence, too, my main concern will be to locate the forms of 
power, the channels it takes, and the discourses it permeates 
in order to reach the most tenuous and individual modes of 
behavior, the paths that give it access to the rare or scarcely 
perceivable forms of desire, how it penetrates and controls 
everyday pleasure—all this entailing effects that may be 
those of refusal, blockage, and invalidation, but also incite¬ 
ment and intensification: in short, the “polymorphous tech¬ 
niques of power.” And finally, the essential aim will not be 
to determine whether these discursive productions and these 
effects of power lead one to formulate the truth about sex, or

on the contrary falsehoods designed to conceal that truth, 
but rather to bring out the “will to knowledge” that serves 
as both their support and their instrument. 

Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not claim that sex 
has not been prohibited or barred or masked or misap¬ 
prehended since the classical age; nor do I even assert that 
it has suffered these things any less from that period on than 
before. I do not maintain that the prohibition of sex is a ruse; 
but it is a ruse to make prohibition into the basic and con¬ 
stitutive element from which one would be able to write the 
history of what has been said concerning sex starting from 
the modern epoch. All these negative elements—defenses, 
censorships, denials—which the repressive hypothesis 
groups together in one great central mechanism destined to 
say no, are doubtless only component parts that have a local 
and tactical role to play in a transformation into discourse, 
a technology of power, and a will to knowledge that are far 
from being reducible to the former. 

In short, I would like to disengage my analysis from the 
privileges generally accorded the economy of scarcity and 
the principles of rarefaction, to search instead for instances 
of discursive production (which also administer silences, to 
be sure), of the production of power (which sometimes have 
the function of prohibiting), of the propagation of knowledge 
(which often cause mistaken beliefs or systematic misconcep¬ 
tions to circulate); I would like to write the history of these 
instances and their transformations. A first survey made
