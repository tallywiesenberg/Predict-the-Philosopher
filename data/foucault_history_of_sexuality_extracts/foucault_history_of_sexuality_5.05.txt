Let Charcot’s Salpetriere serve as an exam¬ 
ple in this regard: it was an enormous apparatus for observa¬ 
tion, with its examinations, interrogations, and experiments, 
but it was also a machinery for incitement, with its public 
presentations, its theater of ritual crises, carefully staged 
with the help of ether or amyl nitrate, its interplay of dia-

logues, palpations, laying on of hands, postures which the 
doctors elicited or obliterated with a gesture or a word, its 
hierarchy of personnel who kept watch, organized, pro¬ 
voked, monitored, and reported, and who accumulated an 
immense pyramid of observations and dossiers.It is in the 
context of this continuous incitement to discourse and to 
truth that the real mechanisms of misunderstanding (mecon- 
naissance) operated: thus Charcot’s gesture interrupting a 
public consultation where it began to be too manifestly a 
question of “that”; and the more frequent practice of delet¬ 
ing from the succession of dossiers what had been said and 
demonstrated by the patients regarding sex, but also what 
had been seen, provoked, solicited by the doctors themselves, 
things that were almost entirely omitted from the published 
observations.1 The important thing, in this affair, is not that 
these men shut their eyes or stopped their ears, or that they 
were mistaken; it is rather that they constructed around and 
apropos of sex an immense apparatus for producing truth, 
even if this truth was to be masked at the last moment.The 
essential point is that sex was not only a matter of sensation 
and pleasure, of law and taboo, but also of truth and false¬ 
hood, that the truth of sex became something fundamental, 
useful, or dangerous, precious or formidable: in short, that 
sex was constituted as a problem of truth.What needs to be 
situated, therefore, is not the threshold of a new rationality 
whose discovery was marked by Freud—or someone else— 
but the progressive formation (and also the transformations)
