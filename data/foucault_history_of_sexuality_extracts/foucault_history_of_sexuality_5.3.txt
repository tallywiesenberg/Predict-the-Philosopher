Since the Middle Ages at least, Western societies have 
established the confession as one of the main rituals we rely 
on for the production of truth: the codification of the sacra¬ 
ment of penance by the Lateran Council in 1215, with the 
resulting development of confessional techniques, the declin¬ 
ing importance of accusatory procedures in criminal justice, 
the abandonment of tests of guilt (sworn statements, duels, 
judgments of God) and the development of methods of inter¬ 
rogation and inquest, the increased participation of the royal 
administration in the prosecution of infractions, at the ex¬ 
pense of proceedings leading to private settlements, the set¬ 
ting up of tribunals of Inquisition: all this helped to give the 
confession a central role in the order of civil and religious 
powers.The evolution of the word avowal and of the legal 
function it designated is itself emblematic of this develop¬ 
ment: from being a guarantee of the status, identity, and 
value granted to one person by another, it came to signify 
someone’s acknowledgment of his own actions and thoughts.For a long time, the individual was vouched for by the refer¬ 
ence of others and the demonstration of his ties to the com¬ 
monweal (family, allegiance, protection); then he was 
authenticated by the discourse of truth he was able or obliged 
to pronounce concerning himself.The truthful confession

was inscribed at the heart of the procedures of individualiza¬ 
tion by power.In any case, next to the testing rituals, next to the testi¬ 
mony of witnesses, and the learned methods of observation 
and demonstration, the confession became one of the West’s 
most highly valued techniques for producing truth.
