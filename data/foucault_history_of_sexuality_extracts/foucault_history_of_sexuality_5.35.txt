We have 
since become a singularly confessing society.The confession 
has spread its effects far and wide.It plays a part in justice, 
medicine, education, family relationships, and love relations, 
in the most ordinary affairs of everyday life, and in the most 
solemn rites; one confesses one’s crimes, one’s sins, one’s 
thoughts and desires, one’s illnesses and troubles; one goes 
about telling, with the greatest precision, whatever is most 
difficult to tell.One confesses in public and in private, to 
one’s parents, one’s educators, one’s doctor, to those one 
loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things 
it would be impossible to tell to anyone else, the things people 
write books about.One confesses—or is forced to confess.
