When it is not spontaneous or dictated by some internal 
imperative, the confession is wrung from a person by vio¬ 
lence or threat; it is driven from its hiding place in the soul, 
or extracted from the body.Since the Middle Ages, torture 
has accompanied it like a shadow, and supported it when it 
could go no further: the dark twins.2 The most defenseless 
tenderness and the bloodiest of powers have a similar need 
of confession.Western man has become a confessing animal.Whence a metamorphosis in literature: we have passed 
from a pleasure to be recounted and heard, centering on the 
heroic or marvelous narration of “trials” of bravery or saint¬ 
hood, to a literature ordered according to the infinite task of 
extracting from the depths of oneself, in between the words, 
a truth which the very form of the confession holds out like 
a shimmering mirage.
