simply in oneself—in some forgotten knowledge, or in a 
certain primal trace—but in the self-examination that yields, 
through a multitude of fleeting impressions, the basic cer¬ 
tainties of consciousness.The obligation to confess is now 
relayed through so many different points, is so deeply in¬ 
grained in us, that we no longer perceive it as the effect of 
a power that constrains us; on the contrary, it seems to us 
that truth, lodged in our most secret nature, “demands” only 
to surface; that if it fails to do so, this is because a constraint 
holds it in place, the violence of a power weighs it down, and 
it can finally be articulated only at the price of a kind of 
liberation.Confession frees, but power reduces one to si¬ 
lence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares 
an original affinity with freedom: traditional themes in phi¬ 
losophy, which a “political history of truth” would have to 
overturn by showing that truth is not by nature free—nor 
error servile—but that its production is thoroughly imbued 
with relations of power.The confession is an example of this.
