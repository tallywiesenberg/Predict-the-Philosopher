A thing that was hidden, we 
are told.But what if, on the contrary, it was what, in a quite 
particular way, one confessed?Suppose the obligation to 
conceal it was but another aspect of the duty to admit to it 
(concealing it all the more and with greater care as the 
confession of it was more important, requiring a stricter 
ritual and promising more decisive effects)?What if sex in 
our society, on a scale of several centuries, was something 
that was placed within an unrelenting system of confession?The transformation of sex into discourse, which I spoke of 
earlier, the dissemination and reinforcement of heterogene¬ 
ous sexualities, are perhaps two elements of the same deploy¬ 
ment: they are linked together with the help of the central 
element of a confession that compels individuals to articulate 
their sexual peculiarity—no matter how extreme.
