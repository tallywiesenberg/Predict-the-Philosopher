Moreover, this form was 
not the same as that of education (sexual education confined 
itself to general principles and rules of prudence); nor was it 
that of initiation (which remained essentially a silent prac¬ 
tice, which the act of sexual enlightenment or deflowering 
merely rendered laughable or violent).As we have seen, it is 
a form that is far removed from the one governing the “erotic 
art.” By virtue of the power structure immanent in it, the 
confessional discourse cannot come from above, as in the ars 
erotica, through the sovereign will of a master, but rather 
from below, as an obligatory act of speech which, under some 
imperious compulsion, breaks the bonds of discretion or for¬ 
getfulness.What secrecy it presupposes is not owing to the 
high price of what it has to say and the small number of those 
who are worthy of its benefits, but to its obscure familiarity 
and its general baseness.Its veracity is not guaranteed by the 
lofty authority of the magistery, nor by the tradition it trans¬ 
mits, but by the bond, the basic intimacy in discourse, be¬ 
tween the dne who speaks and what he is speaking about.On 
the other hand, the agency of domination does not reside in 
the one who speaks (for it is he who is constrained), but in 
the one who listens and says nothing; not in the one who 
knows and answers, but in the one who questions and is not 
supposed to know.
