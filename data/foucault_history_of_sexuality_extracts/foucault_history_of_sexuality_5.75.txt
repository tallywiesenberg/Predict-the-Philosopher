For a 
long time, it remained firmly entrenched in the practice of 
penance.But with the rise of Protestantism, the Counter 
Reformation, eighteenth-century pedagogy, and nineteenth- 
century medicine, it gradually lost its ritualistic and exclu¬ 
sive localization; it spread; it has been employed in a whole 
series of relationships: children and parents, students and 
educators, patients and psychiatrists, delinquents and ex¬ 
perts.The motivations and effects it is expected to produce 
have varied, as have the forms it has taken: interrogations, 
consultations, autobiographical narratives, letters; they have 
been recorded, transcribed, assembled into dossiers, pub¬ 
lished, and commented on.But more important, the confes¬ 
sion lends itself, if not to other domains, at least to new ways 
of exploring the existing ones.It is no longer a question 
simply of saying what was done—the sexual act—and how 
it was done; but of reconstructing, in and around the act, the 
thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accom¬ 
panied it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the 
pleasure that animated it.
