It 
was enough to make one’s voice tremble, for an improbable 
thing was then taking shape: a confessional science, a science 
which relied on a many-sided extortion, and took for its 
object what was unmentionable but admitted to nonetheless.The scientific discourse was scandalized, or in any case re¬ 
pelled, when it had to take charge of this whole discourse 
from below.It was also faced with a theoretical and method¬ 
ological paradox: the long discussions concerning the possi¬ 
bility of constituting a science of the subject, the validity of 
introspection, lived experience as evidence, or the presence 
of consciousness to itself were responses to this problem that 
is inherent in the functioning of truth in our society: can one 
articulate the production of truth according to the old juridi- 
co-religious model of confession, and the extortion of confi¬ 
dential evidence according to the rules of scientific discourse?Those who believe that sex was more rigorously elided in the 
nineteenth century than ever before, through a formidable 
mechanism of blockage and a deficiency of discourse, can say 
what they please.There was no deficiency, but rather an 
excess, a redoubling, too much rather than not enough dis¬ 
course, in any case an interference between two modes of
