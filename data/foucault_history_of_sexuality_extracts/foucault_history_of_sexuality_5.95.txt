And instead of adding up the errors, naivetes, and moral- 
isms that plagued the nineteenth-century discourse of truth 
concerning sex, we would do better to locate the procedures 
by which that will to knowledge regarding sex, which cha¬ 
racterizes the modern Occident, caused the rituals of confes¬ 
sion to function within the norms of scientific regularity: how 
did this immense and traditional extortion of the sexual con¬ 
fession come to be constituted in scientific terms?1.Through a clinical codification of the inducement to 
speak.Combining confession with examination, the personal 
history with the deployment of a set of decipherable signs 
and symptoms; the interrogation, the exacting questionnaire, 
and hypnosis, with the recollection of memories and free 
association: all were ways of reinscribing the procedure of 
confession in a field of scientifically acceptable observations.2.
