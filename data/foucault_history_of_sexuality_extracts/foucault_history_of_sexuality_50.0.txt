The History of Sexuality 


the organization of the “conventional” family came to be 
regarded, sometime around the eighteen-thirties, as an indis¬ 
pensable instrument of political control and economic regu¬ 
lation for the subjugation of the urban proletariat: there was 
a great campaign for the “moralization of the poorer 
classes.” The last stage came at the end of the nineteenth 
century with the development of the juridical and medical 
control of perversions, for the sake of a general protection of 
society and the race. It can be said that this was the moment 
when the deployment of “sexuality,” elaborated in its more 
complex and intense forms, by and for the privileged classes, 
spread through the entire social body. But the forms it took 
were not everywhere the same, and neither were the instru¬ 
ments it employed (the respective roles of medical and judi¬ 
cial authority were not the same in both instances; nor was 
even the way in which medicine and sexuality functioned). 

These chronological reminders—whether we are con¬ 
cerned with the invention of techniques or the calendar of 
their diffusion—are of some importance. They cast much 
doubt on the idea of a repressive cycle, with a beginning and 
an end and forming a curve with its point of inflexion: it 
appears unlikely that there was an age of sexual restriction. 
They also make it doubtful that the process was homoge¬ 
neous at all levels of society and in all social classes: there was 
no unitary sexual politics. But above all, they make the 
meaning of the process, and its reasons for being, problemati¬ 
cal: it seems that the deployment of sexuality was not estab¬ 
lished as a principle of limitation of the pleasures of others 
by what have traditionally been called the “ruling classes.” 
Rather it appears to me that they first tried it on themselves. 
Was this a new avatar of that bourgeois asceticism described 
so many times in connection with the Reformation, the new 
work ethic, and the rise of capitalism? It seems in fact that 
what was involved was not an asceticism, in any case not a 
renunciation of pleasure or a disqualification of the flesh, but

on the contrary an intensification of the body, a problemati- 
zation of health and its operational terms: it was a question 
of techniques for maximizing life. The primary concern was 
not repression of the sex of the classes to be exploited, but 
rather the body, vigor, longevity, progeniture, and descent of 
the classes that “ruled.” This was the purpose for which the 
deployment of sexuality was first established, as a new distri¬ 
bution of pleasures, discourses, truths, and powers; it has to 
be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the 
enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthen¬ 
ing, and an exaltation that were eventually extended to oth¬ 
ers—at the cost of different transformations—as a means of 
social control and political subjugation. With this investment 
of its own sex by a technology of power and knowledge 
which it had itself invented, the bourgeoisie underscored the 
high political price of its body, sensations, and pleasures, its 
well-being and survival. Let us not isolate the restrictions, 
reticences, evasions, or silences which all these procedures 
may have manifested, in order to refer them to some con¬ 
stitutive taboo, psychical repression, or death instinct. What 
was formed was a political ordering of life, not through an 
enslavement of others, but through an affirmation of self. 
And this was far from being a matter of the class which in 
the eighteenth century became hegemonic believing itself 
obliged to amputate from its body a sex that was useless, 
expensive, and dangerous as soon as it was no longer given 
over exclusively to reproduction; we can assert on the con¬ 
trary that it provided itself with a body to be cared for, 
protected, cultivated, and preserved from the many dangers 
and contacts, to be isolated from others so that it would 
retain its differential value; and this, by equipping itself with 
—among other resources—a technology of sex. 

Sex is not that part of the body which the bourgeoisie was 
forced to disqualify or nullify in order to put those whom it 
dominated to work. It is that aspect of itself which troubled 
and preoccupied it more than any other, begged and obtained

its attention, and which it cultivated with a mixture of fear, 
curiosity, delight, and excitement. The bourgeoisie made this 
element identical with its body, or at least subordinated the
