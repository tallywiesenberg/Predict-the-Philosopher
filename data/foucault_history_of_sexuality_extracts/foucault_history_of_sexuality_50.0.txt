The History of Sexuality 


the organization of the “conventional” family came to be 
regarded, sometime around the eighteen-thirties, as an indis¬ 
pensable instrument of political control and economic regu¬ 
lation for the subjugation of the urban proletariat: there was 
a great campaign for the “moralization of the poorer 
classes.” The last stage came at the end of the nineteenth 
century with the development of the juridical and medical 
control of perversions, for the sake of a general protection of 
society and the race. It can be said that this was the moment 
when the deployment of “sexuality,” elaborated in its more 
complex and intense forms, by and for the privileged classes, 
spread through the entire social body. But the forms it took 
were not everywhere the same, and neither were the instru¬ 
ments it employed (the respective roles of medical and judi¬ 
cial authority were not the same in both instances; nor was 
even the way in which medicine and sexuality functioned). 

These chronological reminders—whether we are con¬ 
cerned with the invention of techniques or the calendar of 
their diffusion—are of some importance. They cast much 
doubt on the idea of a repressive cycle, with a beginning and 
an end and forming a curve with its point of inflexion: it 
appears unlikely that there was an age of sexual restriction. 
They also make it doubtful that the process was homoge¬ 
neous at all levels of society and in all social classes: there was 
no unitary sexual politics. But above all, they make the 
meaning of the process, and its reasons for being, problemati¬ 
cal: it seems that the deployment of sexuality was not estab¬ 
lished as a principle of limitation of the pleasures of others 
by what have traditionally been called the “ruling classes.” 
Rather it appears to me that they first tried it on themselves. 
Was this a new avatar of that bourgeois asceticism described 
so many times in connection with the Reformation, the new 
work ethic, and the rise of capitalism? It seems in fact that 
what was involved was not an asceticism, in any case not a 
renunciation of pleasure or a disqualification of the flesh, but
