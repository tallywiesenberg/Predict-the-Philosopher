on the contrary an intensification of the body, a problemati- 
zation of health and its operational terms: it was a question 
of techniques for maximizing life. The primary concern was 
not repression of the sex of the classes to be exploited, but 
rather the body, vigor, longevity, progeniture, and descent of 
the classes that “ruled.” This was the purpose for which the 
deployment of sexuality was first established, as a new distri¬ 
bution of pleasures, discourses, truths, and powers; it has to 
be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the 
enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthen¬ 
ing, and an exaltation that were eventually extended to oth¬ 
ers—at the cost of different transformations—as a means of 
social control and political subjugation. With this investment 
of its own sex by a technology of power and knowledge 
which it had itself invented, the bourgeoisie underscored the 
high political price of its body, sensations, and pleasures, its 
well-being and survival. Let us not isolate the restrictions, 
reticences, evasions, or silences which all these procedures 
may have manifested, in order to refer them to some con¬ 
stitutive taboo, psychical repression, or death instinct. What 
was formed was a political ordering of life, not through an 
enslavement of others, but through an affirmation of self. 
And this was far from being a matter of the class which in 
the eighteenth century became hegemonic believing itself 
obliged to amputate from its body a sex that was useless, 
expensive, and dangerous as soon as it was no longer given 
over exclusively to reproduction; we can assert on the con¬ 
trary that it provided itself with a body to be cared for, 
protected, cultivated, and preserved from the many dangers 
and contacts, to be isolated from others so that it would 
retain its differential value; and this, by equipping itself with 
—among other resources—a technology of sex. 

Sex is not that part of the body which the bourgeoisie was 
forced to disqualify or nullify in order to put those whom it 
dominated to work. It is that aspect of itself which troubled 
and preoccupied it more than any other, begged and obtained

curiosity, delight, and excitement. The bourgeoisie made this 
element identical with its body, or at least subordinated the
