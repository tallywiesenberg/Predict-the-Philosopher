It is a 
“practical” work dealing with everyday life, not a work of 
moral reflection or prescription.Of all the texts that have 
survived from this period, it is the only one that presents 
anything like a systematic exposition of the different forms of 
sexual acts.By and large it does not make direct and explicit 
moral judgments concerning those acts, but it does reveal 
schemas of valuation that were generally accepted.And one 
notes that the latter are quite close to the general principles 
that, already in the classical epoch, organized the ethical expe¬ 
rience of the aphrodisia.The book by Artemidorus thus con¬ 
stitutes a point of reference.
