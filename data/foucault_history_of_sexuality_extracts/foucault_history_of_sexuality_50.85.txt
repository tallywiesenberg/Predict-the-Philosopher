It testifies to a perenniality and 
exemplifies a common way of thinking.For this very reason, 
it will allow us to measure what may have been uncommon 
and in part new in the work of philosophical and medical 
reflection on pleasure and sexual conduct that was undertaken 
in the same period.3

The Method of 
Artemidorus 


The Interpretation of Dreams by Artemidorus is the only 
text that remains, in full, of a literature that was abundant in 
antiquity: the literature of oneirocriticism.Artemidorus, writ¬ 
ing in the second century a.d., himself cites several works that 
were in use in his day: those of Nicostratus of Ephesus, Panya- 
sis of Halicarnassus, Apollodorus of Telmessus, Phoebus of 
Antioch, Dionysius of Heliopolis, and the naturalist Alexan¬ 
der of Myndus.1 He makes favorable mention of Aristander of 
Telmessus, and he refers to the three books of the treatise by 
Geminus of Tyre, to the five books of Demetrius of Phalerum, 
and to the twenty-two books of Artemon of Miletus.
