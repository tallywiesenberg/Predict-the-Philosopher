Addressing the man to whom his work is dedicated, a cer¬ 
tain Cassius Maximus (possibly Maximus of Tyre, or his fa¬ 
ther, 3 who he says urged him “not to surrender my wisdom 
to silence”), Artemidorus declares that he “has not done any¬ 
thing else” but employ himself “always, day and night,” in the 
interpretation of dreams.4 An emphatic statement of the sort 
that was rather customary in this kind of presentation?Per¬ 
haps.In any case Artemidorus did something quite different 
from compiling the most famous examples of prophetic 
dreams that were confirmed by reality.He undertook to write 
a work of method, and this in two senses: it was meant to be 
a manual for use in daily practice; it was also meant to be a 
theoretical treatise on the validity of interpretive procedures.
