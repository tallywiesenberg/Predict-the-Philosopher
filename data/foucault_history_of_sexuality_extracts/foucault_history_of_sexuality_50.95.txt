Dreaming of One's Pleasures 


5 


One should bear in mind that the analysis of dreams was 
one of the techniques of existence.Since images encountered 
in dreams, or some of them at least, were thought to be signs 
of reality or messages of the future, a high value was set on 
their decipherment; a reasonable life could scarcely dispense 
with the task.This was a very old popular tradition; it was also 
an accepted custom in cultured milieus.If it was necessary to 
consult the countless professionals of nocturnal images, it was 
also good to be able to interpret their signs oneself.There are 
innumerable testimonies showing the importance accorded 
the analysis of dreams as a life practice, one that was indisÂ¬ 
pensable not only in dramatic circumstances but also in the 
everyday course of events.
