latter to the former by attributing to it a mysterious and 
undefined power; it staked its life and its death on sex by 
making it responsible for its future welfare; it placed its hopes 
for the future in sex by imagining it to have ineluctable effects 
on generations to come; it subordinated its soul to sex by 
conceiving of it as what constituted the soul’s most secret and 
determinant part. Let us not picture the bourgeoisie symboli¬ 
cally castrating itself the better to refuse others the right to 
have a sex and make use of it as they please. This class must 
be seen rather as being occupied, from the mid-eighteenth 
century on, with creating its own sexuality and forming a 
specific body based on it, a “class” body with its health, 
hygiene, descent, and race: the autosexualization of its body, 
the incarnation of sex in its body, the endogamy of sex and 
the body. 

There were doubtless many reasons for this. First of all, 
there was a transposition into different forms of the methods 
employed by the nobility for marking and maintaining its 
caste distinction; for the aristocracy had also asserted the 
special character of its body, but this was in the form of 
blood, that is, in the form of the antiquity of its ancestry and 
of the value of its alliances; the bourgeoisie on the contrary 
looked to its progeny and the health of its organism when it 
laid claim to a specific body. The bourgeoisie’s “blood” was 
its sex. And this is more than a play on words; many of the 
themes characteristic of the caste manners of the nobility 
reappeared in the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie, but in the 
guise of biological, medical, or eugenic precepts. The concern 
with genealogy became a preoccupation with heredity; but 
included in bourgeois marriages were not only economic 
imperatives and rules of social homogeneity, not only the 
promises of inheritance, but the menaces of heredity; families 
wore and concealed a sort of reversed and somber escutcheon

whose defamatory quarters were the diseases or defects of the 
group of relatives—the grandfather’s general paralysis, the 
mother’s neurasthenia, the youngest child’s phthisis, the hys¬ 
terical or erotomanic aunts, the cousins with bad morals. But 
there was more to this concern with the sexual body than the 
bourgeois transposition of themes of the nobility for the 
purpose of self-affirmation. A different project was also in¬ 
volved: that of the indefinite extension of strength, vigor, 
health, and life. The emphasis on the body should undoubt¬ 
edly be linked to the process of growth and establishment of 
bourgeois hegemony: not, however, because of the market 
value assumed by labor capacity, but because of what the 
“cultivation” of its own body could represent politically, 
economically, and historically for the present and the future 
of the bourgeoisie. Its dominance was in part dependent on 
that cultivation; but it was not simply a matter of economy 
or ideology, it was a “physical” matter as well. The works, 
published in great numbers at the end of the eighteenth 
century, on body hygiene, the art of longevity, ways of hav¬ 
ing healthy children and of keeping them alive as long as 
possible, and methods for improving the human lineage, bear 
witness to the fact: they thus attest to the correlation of this 
concern with the body and sex to a type of “racism.” But the 
latter was very different from that manifested by the nobility 
and organized for basically conservative ends. It was a dy¬ 
namic racism, a racism of expansion, even if it was still in a 
budding state, awaiting the second half of the nineteenth 
century to bear the fruits that we have tasted. 

May I be forgiven by those for whom the bourgeoisie 
signifies the elision of the body and the repression of sexual¬ 
ity, for whom class struggle implies the fight to eliminate that 
repression; the “spontaneous philosophy” of the bourgeoisie 
is perhaps not as idealistic or castrating as is commonly 
thought. In any event, one of its primary concerns was to 
provide itself with a body and a sexuality—to ensure the 
strength, endurance, and secular proliferation of that body

through the organization of a deployment of sexuality. This 
process, moreover, was linked to the movement by which it 
asserted its distinctiveness and its hegemony. There is little 
question that one of the primordial forms of class conscious¬ 
ness is the affirmation of the body; at least, this was the case 
for the bourgeoisie during the eighteenth century. It con¬ 
verted the blue blood of the nobles into a sound organism and 
a healthy sexuality. One understands why it took such a long 
time and was so unwilling to acknowledge that other classes 
had a body and a sex—precisely those classes it was exploit¬ 
ing. The living conditions that were dealt to the proletariat,
