This was because in dreams the 
gods gave advice, guidance, and sometimes explicit com¬ 
mands.Moreover, even when the dream only announced an 
event without prescribing anything, even when one believed 
that the concatenation of future occurrences was inevitable, it 
was still good to have foreknowledge of things that were 
bound to happen, so that one might prepare for them.“Provi¬ 
dence,” says Achilles Tatius in The Adventures of Leucippe 
and Clitophon, “sometimes foreshows the future to men in 
dreams, not so that they may be able to avoid the sufferings 
fated for them, for they can never get the better of destiny, but 
in order that they may bear them with the more patience when 
those sufferings come; for when disasters come all together 
and unexpectedly, they strike the spirit with so severe and 
sudden a blow that they overwhelm it; while if they are an¬ 
ticipated, the mind, by dwelling on them beforehand, is able 
little by little to turn the edge of sorrow.” 5 Later, Synesius will 
express a completely traditional point of view when he re¬ 
marks that our dreams constitute an oracle who “dwells with 
us,” who accompanies us “if we go abroad; she is with us on 
the field of battle, she is at our side in the life of the city; she 
labors with us in the fields and barters with us in the market¬ 
place”; dreams are to be regarded as “a prophet who is always 
ready, a tireless and silent adviser.” Hence we should all make

The Care of the Self 


an effort to interpret our dreams, whoever we may be, “men 
and women, old and young, rich and poor, private citizens and 
public officials, inhabitants of the city and of the country, 
artisans and orators,” without regard “either to sex or age, to 
fortune or profession.” 6 It was in this spirit that Artemidorus 
wrote The Interpretation of Dreams.Artemidorus is mainly concerned to show the reader pre¬ 
cisely how to go about it: How does one contrive to break 
down a dream into constituent parts and establish its diagnos¬ 
tic meaning?How does one manage also to take this whole 
into account in the decipherment of each of its parts?
