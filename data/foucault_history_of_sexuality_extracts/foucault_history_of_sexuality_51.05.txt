The 
comparison that Artemidorus makes with the divinatory tech¬ 
niques of sacrificers is significant: they, too, “know how each 
individual sign fits into the whole,” and yet they “base their 
judgments as much on the total sum of the signs as on each 
individual sign.” 7 His book is thus a treatise on how to inter¬ 
pret.Almost entirely centered not on the prophetic marvels of 
dreams but on the techne that enables one to make them speak 
correctly, the work is addressed to several types of readers.Artemidorus wishes to supply an instrument for the use of 
professionals and technicians of analysis.This is the vision 
with which he hopes to inspire his son, the addressee of the 
fourth and fifth books: “what has been written here, as long 
as it remains with you alone, will make you a more excellent 
interpreter of dreams than anyone.” 8 He also intends to help 
those who, discouraged by the erroneous methods they have 
tried, may be tempted to give up this valuable practice.His 
book will serve as a salutary treatment— therapeia soteriddes 
—of those errors.
