9 But he thinks, too, of the general reader 
who needs basic instruction.10 In any case, he offers the book 
as a manual for living, a tool that can be used over the course 
of one’s existence and adapted to life’s changing circum¬ 
stances: “just as there is an order and sequence in actual 
events” so he has made an effort to “set down everything in 
an orderly fashion.” 

This “handbook-for-daily-living” aspect is quite noticeable 



Dreaming of One's Pleasures

when one compares Artemidorus’ text with the Tales of Aris¬ 
tides, an anxious valetudinarian who spent years harkening to 
the god that sent him dreams through all the extraordinary 
ups and downs of his illness and the countless treatments he 
undertook.One notes that in Artemidorus there is almost no 
place for religious enchantments; unlike many other texts of 
this kind, his work does not depend on cult therapeutics, even 
if, using a traditional formula, he evokes Apollo of Daldis, 
“my own native god,” who encouraged him and, appearing at 
his bedside, “all but commanded me to compose this work.” 11 
Moreover, he is careful to remark on the difference between 
his work and that of such oneirocritics as Geminus of Tyre, 
Demetrius of Phalerum, and Artemon of Miletus, who con¬ 
veyed prescriptions and cures given by Serapis.12 The typical 
dreamer whom Artemidorus addresses is not a worried devo¬ 
tee who attends to injunctions given from above.He is an 
“ordinary” individual: generally a man (the dreams of women 
are noted as an aside, as possible variants in cases where the 
sex of the subject happens to change the meaning of the 
dream); a man who has a family, possessions, quite often a 
trade (he runs a business; he has a shop).
