Not only has he compared 
innumerable works, he has patiently frequented the market 
stalls kept by dream readers and soothsayers at the crossroads 
of the Mediterranean world.“I, on the other hand, have not 
only taken special pains to procure every book on the interpre¬ 
tation of dreams, but have consorted for many years with the 
much-despised diviners of the marketplace.People who as¬ 
sume a holier-than-thou countenance and who arch their eye¬ 
brows in a superior way dismiss them as beggars, charlatans, 
and buffoons, but I have ignored their disparagement.Rather, 
in the different cities of Greece and at the great religious 
gatherings in that country, in Asia, in Italy and in the largest 
and most populous of the islands, I have patiently listened to 
old dreams and their consequences.For there was no other 
possible way in which to get practice in these matters.” 13 With 
regard to all that he has brought back, Artemidorus does not 
intend to impart it in the form of raw data; rather, he will 
submit it to “experience” (peira), which is for him the “guid¬ 
ing principle” and “witness” of everything he says.
