Philosophical reflection is certainly not 
absent from the text, and one finds in it rather clear refer¬ 
ences to contemporary problems and debates; but these ref¬ 
erences concern the procedures of decipherment and the 
method of analysis, not value judgments and moral contents.The material on which the interpretations bear, the oneiric 
scenes they treat, as auguries, and the situations and events 
they announce, belong to a common and traditional land¬ 
scape.One can thus expect this text by Artemidorus to pro¬ 
vide evidence of a rather widespread moral tradition, which 
was doubtless rather deeply rooted in the past.But once 
again it must be kept in mind that while the text abounds in 
detail, while it presents in connection with dreams a catalog 
of different possible acts and relations, and is more system¬ 
atic in this regard than any other work from the same pe¬ 
riod, it is not in any sense a treatise on morality, which 
would be primarily concerned with formulating judgments 
abotit those acts and relations.It is only indirectly, through 
the decipherment of the dreams, that one can discern the 
valuations brought to bear on the scenes and acts repre¬ 
sented in the text.
