A second cleavage brings another form of distinction to 
each of the two categories of “nocturnal visions.” There is that 
which reveals itself clearly and transparently, requiring no 
decipherment or interpretation, and that which displays itself 
only figuratively, in images telling something different from 
their first appearance.In state dreams, desire can be manifes¬ 
ted by the easily recognizable presence of its object (one sees 
in a dream the woman one desires); but it can also be manifes¬ 
ted by another image exhibiting a more or less distant relation¬ 
ship with the object in question.An analogous difference 
obtains in event dreams.Some of them directly designate, by 
showing its actual appearance, that which already exists in the 
future mode: one sees in a dream the sinking of a ship on 
which one will later suffer shipwreck; one sees oneself struck 
by the weapon by which one will be wounded the next day.These are the so-called theorematic dreams.
