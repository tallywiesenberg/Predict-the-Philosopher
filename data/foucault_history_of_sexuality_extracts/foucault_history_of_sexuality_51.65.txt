But, in other 
cases, the relation between image and event is indirect: the 
image of the ship that breaks apart on the rocks may signify 
not a shipwreck, or even a misfortune, but, for a slave who has 
this dream, his emancipation in the near future.These are the 
“allegorical” dreams.Now, the margin that exists between these two distinctions 
poses a practical problem for the interpreter.Given a particu¬ 
lar vision in sleep, how is one to know whether one is dealing 
with a state dream or an event dream?How does one deter¬ 
mine whether the image announces directly what it shows, or 
whether one must suppose that it stands for something else?
