Referring to this difficulty in the first pages of Book IV, Ar- 
temidorus emphasizes the importance of considering the indi¬ 
vidual who has the dream.It is quite certain, he explains, that 
state dreams will not appear to “virtuous” persons, for they

have been able to subdue their irrational movements, hence 
their passions, their desires or fears; they also know how to 
keep their bodies balanced between deficiency and excess; for 
them, consequently, there are no disturbances, hence none of 
those “dreams” (enypnia) that are always to be understood as 
manifestations of affects.Moreover, it was a very frequent 
theme of moralists that virtue is marked by the disappearance 
of dreams that translate the appetites and involuntary move¬ 
ments of the mind and the body.“The sleeper’s visions,” said 
Seneca, “are as turbulent as his day.” 18 Plutarch cited Zeno in 
affirming that it is a sign of progress when a person no longer 
dreams that he derives pleasure from indecent actions.And he 
alluded to those individuals who have enough strength in their 
waking hours to combat and resist their passions, but who at 
night, “throwing off opinions and laws,” cease to feel any 
shame: then there awakens what is immoral and licentious 
within them.
