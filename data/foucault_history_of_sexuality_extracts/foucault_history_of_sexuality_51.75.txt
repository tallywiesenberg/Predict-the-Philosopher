For Artemidorus, in any case, when state dreams occur 
they can take two forms.In most people, desire and aversion 
are manifested directly and without concealment; but in a man 
who knows how to interpret his own dreams, they are manifes¬ 
ted only through signs.This is because his mind “plays tricks 
on him in a rather ingenious way.” Thus a man with no 
experience in dream interpretation will see in a dream the 
woman he desires or the longed-for death of his master.The 
mistrustful or clever mind of the expert will, so to say, refuse 
to make manifest the state of desire in which he finds himself: 
it will resort to trickery, so that instead of simply seeing the 
woman he desires, the dreamer will see the image of something 
that signifies her: “a horse, a mirror, a ship, the sea, an animal 
that is female, a piece of feminine apparel.” As an example, 
Artemidorus cites a painter from Corinth, an expert inter¬ 
preter no doubt, who saw the roof of his house collapse in a 
dream and saw his own decapitation.One might have imag¬ 
ined that this was the sign of a future event, but in fact it was

a state dream: the man wished for the death of his master— 
who is still living, Artemidorus notes in passing.
