As concerns the oneiroi, how does one recognize those that 
are transparent and “theorematic” in contrast to those that 
predict allegorically an event different from what they show?If one leaves aside the unusual images that obviously call for 
an interpretation, those that foretell an event are immediately 
confirmed by reality: the event follows them without delay.The theorematic dream opens directly onto the thing it an¬ 
nounces, not giving interpretation any possible purchase, nor 
allowing it the necessary time interval.Allegorical dreams are 
easily recognized, therefore, by the fact that they are not 
followed by a direct realization, which means that one should 
sei^e the occasion to interpret them.It should be added that 
virtuous individuals—who do not have enypnia but only onei¬ 
roi —ordinarily experience only the clear visions of theore¬ 
matic dreams.
