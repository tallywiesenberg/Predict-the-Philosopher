Artemidorus does not need to explain this 
privilege: it was traditional to suppose that the gods spoke 
directly to souls that were pure.Recall what Plato said in the 
Republic: “When he has quieted both spirit and appetites, he 
arouses his third part in which wisdom resides and thus takes 
his rest; you know that it is then that he best grasps reality.” 21 
And in the novel by Chariton of Aphrodisias, at the moment 
when Callirhoe is finally near the end of her trials, and when 
her long struggle to preserve her virtue is about to be re¬ 
warded, she has a “theorematic” dream that anticipates the 
conclusion of the story and constitutes both a presage and a 
promise on the part of the goddess protecting her: “When 
night came, she saw herself in a dream, once more a girl in 
Syracuse, entering the sacred precinct of Aphrodite and re¬ 
turning from it; now she was looking at Chaereas and observ¬ 
ing her wedding day; the whole city was decked with garlands 
and she herself was being escorted by her father and mother 
to the home of the groom.” 22

The Care of the Self 


We can construct a table of the relationships established by 
Artemidorus between the types of dreams, their ways of signi¬ 
fying, and the subject’s modes of being, as follows: 




state dreams 

event dreams 



direct 

through 

signs 

theorematic 

allegorical 

in 

virtuous 

individuals 

never 


usually 


in 

ordinary 

individuals 

expert 


usually 


usually 

inexperienced 

usually 




It is the last entry in the table—allegorical event dreams of 
the sort that ordinary people have—that defines the domain 
of oneirocriticism.It is here that interpretation is possible, 
since such visions are not transparent but make use of one 
image to convey another.And it is here that interpretation is 
useful, since it enables one to prepare for an event that is not 
immediate.2.
