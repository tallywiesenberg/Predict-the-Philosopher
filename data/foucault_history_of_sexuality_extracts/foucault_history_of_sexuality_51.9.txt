Decipherment of the oneiric allegory is carried out by 
means of analogy.Artemidorus returns to this point several 
times: the art of oneirocriticism is based on the law of resem¬ 
blance; it operates through the “juxtaposition of similari¬ 
ties.” 23 Artemidorus brings this analogy into play on two 
levels.First, there is the natural analogy between the dream 
image and the elements of the future that it foretells.Ar¬ 
temidorus employs various means to detect this resemblance: 
qualitative identity (to dream of a malaise may signify a future 
“bad state” of health or fortune; to dream of mud signifies that 
the body will be congested with harmful substances); identity 
of words (a ram signifies authority because of the word associ¬ 
ation krios-kreion ); 24 symbolic affinity (to dream of a lion is

a sign of victory for an athlete; to dream of tempests is a sign 
of misfortune); existence of a belief, a popular saying, a mytho¬ 
logical theme (a bear indicates a woman because of Callisto 
the Arcadian); 25 also membership in the same category of 
existence: thus marriage and death may represent each other 
in a dream, since both are regarded as a telos, an end (goal or 
term) for a man’s life; 26 and similarity of practices (“if a sick 
man dreams that he is marrying a maiden, it portends his 
death, for the same things that happen to a bridegroom hap¬ 
pen to a dead man”).27 

There is also an analogy of value.
