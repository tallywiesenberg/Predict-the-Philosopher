And this is an essential 
point in that oneirocriticism has the function of determining 
whether the events that will take place are favorable or not.The 
whole domain of the dream’s signified is marked, in Ar- 
temidorus’ text, by the binary division between the good and 
the bad, the auspicious and the inauspicious, the fortunate and 
the unfortunate.The question then is this: How does the action 
that is represented in a dream make use of its own value to 
announce the event that will take place?The general principle 
is simple.A dream bears a favorable forecast if the action it 
represents is itself good.
