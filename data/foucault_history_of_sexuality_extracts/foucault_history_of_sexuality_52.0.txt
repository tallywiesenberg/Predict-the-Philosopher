particularly in the first half of the nineteenth century, show 
there was anything but concern for its body and sex: 1 it was 
of little importance whether those people lived or died, since 
their reproduction was something that took care of itself in 
any case. Conflicts were necessary (in particular, conflicts 
over urban space: cohabitation, proximity, contamination, 
epidemics, such as the cholera outbreak of 1832, or again, 
prostitution and venereal diseases) in order for the proletar¬ 
iat to be granted a body and a sexuality; economic emergen¬ 
cies had to arise (the development of heavy industry with the 
need for a stable and competent labor force, the obligation 
to regulate the population flow and apply demographic con¬ 
trols); lastly, there had to be established a whole technology 
of control which made it possible to keep that body and 
sexuality, finally conceded to them, under surveillance 
(schooling, the politics of housing, public hygiene, institu¬ 
tions of relief and insurance, the general medicalization of 
the population, in short, an entire administrative and techni¬ 
cal machinery made it possible to safely import the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality into the exploited class; the latter no longer 
risked playing an assertive class role opposite the bourgeoi¬ 
sie; it would remain the instrument of the bourgeoisie’s

The Deployment of Sexuality

hegemony). Whence no doubt the proletariat’s hesitancy to 
accept this deployment and its tendency to say that this 
sexuality was the business of the the bourgeoisie and did not 
concern it. 

Some think they can denounce two symmetrical hypocri¬ 
sies at the same time: the primary hypocrisy of the bourgeoi¬ 
sie which denies its own sexuality, and the secondary hypoc¬ 
risy of the proletariat which in turn rejects its sexuality by 
accepting the dominant ideology. This is to misunderstand 
the process whereby on the contrary the bourgeoisie en¬ 
dowed itself, in an arrogant political affirmation, with a gar¬ 
rulous sexuality which the proletariat long refused to accept, 
since it was foisted on them for the purpose of subjugation. 
If it is true that sexuality is the set of effects produced in 
bodies, behaviors, and social relations by a certain deploy¬ 
ment deriving from a complex political technology, one has 
to admit that this deployment does not operate in symmetri¬ 
cal fashion with respect to the social classes, and conse¬ 
quently, that it does not produce the same effects in them. 
We must return, therefore, to formulations that have long 
been disparaged; we must say that there is a bourgeois sexu¬ 
ality, and that there are class sexualities. Or rather, that 
sexuality is originally, historically bourgeois, and that, in its 
successive shifts and transpositions, it induces specific class 
effects. 

A few more words are in order. As we have noted, the 
nineteenth century witnessed a generalization of the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality, starting from a hegemonic center. Eventu¬ 
ally the entire social body was provided with a “sexual 
body,” although this was accomplished in different ways and 
using different tools. Must we speak of the universality of 
sexuality, then? It is at this point that one notes the introduc¬ 
tion of a new differentiating element. Somewhat similar to 
the way in which, at the end of the eighteenth century, the 
bourgeoisie set its own body and its precious sexuality

The History of Sexuality 


against the valorous blood of the nobles, at the end of the 
nineteenth century it sought to redefine the specific character 
of its sexuality relative to that of others, subjecting it to a 
thorough differential review, and tracing a dividing line that 
would set apart and protect its body. This line was not the 
same as the one which founded sexuality, but rather a bar 
running through that sexuality; this was the taboo that con¬ 
stituted the difference, or at least the manner in which the 
taboo was applied and the rigor with which it was imposed. 
It was here that the theory of repression—which was gradu¬ 
ally expanded to cover the entire deployment of sexuality, so 
that the latter came to be explained in terms of a generalized 
taboo—had its point of origin. This theory is bound up his¬ 
torically with the spread of the deployment of sexuality. On 
the one hand, the theory would justify its authoritarian and 
constraining influence by postulating that all sexuality must 
be subject to the law; more precisely, that sexuality owes its 
very definition to the action of the law: not only will you 
submit your sexuality to the law, but you will have no sexual¬
