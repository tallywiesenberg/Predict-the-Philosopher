particularly in the first half of the nineteenth century, show 
there was anything but concern for its body and sex: 1 it was 
of little importance whether those people lived or died, since 
their reproduction was something that took care of itself in 
any case. Conflicts were necessary (in particular, conflicts 
over urban space: cohabitation, proximity, contamination, 
epidemics, such as the cholera outbreak of 1832, or again, 
prostitution and venereal diseases) in order for the proletar¬ 
iat to be granted a body and a sexuality; economic emergen¬ 
cies had to arise (the development of heavy industry with the 
need for a stable and competent labor force, the obligation 
to regulate the population flow and apply demographic con¬ 
trols); lastly, there had to be established a whole technology 
of control which made it possible to keep that body and 
sexuality, finally conceded to them, under surveillance 
(schooling, the politics of housing, public hygiene, institu¬ 
tions of relief and insurance, the general medicalization of 
the population, in short, an entire administrative and techni¬ 
cal machinery made it possible to safely import the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality into the exploited class; the latter no longer 
risked playing an assertive class role opposite the bourgeoi¬ 
sie; it would remain the instrument of the bourgeoisie’s

The Deployment of Sexuality

accept this deployment and its tendency to say that this 
sexuality was the business of the the bourgeoisie and did not 
concern it. 

Some think they can denounce two symmetrical hypocri¬ 
sies at the same time: the primary hypocrisy of the bourgeoi¬ 
sie which denies its own sexuality, and the secondary hypoc¬ 
risy of the proletariat which in turn rejects its sexuality by 
accepting the dominant ideology. This is to misunderstand 
the process whereby on the contrary the bourgeoisie en¬ 
dowed itself, in an arrogant political affirmation, with a gar¬ 
rulous sexuality which the proletariat long refused to accept, 
since it was foisted on them for the purpose of subjugation. 
If it is true that sexuality is the set of effects produced in
