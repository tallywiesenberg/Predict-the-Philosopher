that is, with the rules and practices that allow an action to 
achieve its ends?Is it in conformity with time (i.e., is it carried

ance with nature, law, custom, craft, names, or time is good, 
but everything that is contrary to them is bad and inauspi¬ 
cious.” 28 Artemidorus goes on to say, however, that this princi¬ 
ple is not universal and that it involves exceptions.There can be 
a kind of reversal of values.
