Certain dreams that are “good in 
regard to their interior” may be “bad in regard to their exte¬ 
rior”: the action imagined in the dream is favorable (thus, to 
dream that one has dinner with a god is in itself positive), but

the event prefigured is negative (for if the god is Cronos, bound 
in chains by his sons, the image signifies that one will go to 
prison).29 Inversely, other dreams are “bad in regard to their 
interior” and “good in regard to their exterior”: a slave dreams 
that he is fighting in a war; this is a presage of his emancipation, 
for a soldier cannot be a slave.There is a considerable margin of 
variation, therefore, around the positive or negative signs and 
signifieds.What is involved is not an uncertainty that cannot be 
overcome, but a complex domain which demands that one take 
account of every aspect of the image in the dream and the 
circumstances of the dreamer.Before proceeding to the analysis of sexual dreams as it was 
practiced by Artemidorus, this rather long detour was neces¬ 
sary in order to understand the mechanics of the interpreta¬ 
tions and to determine how the moral valuations of sexual acts 
emerge in the divination of the dreams that represent them.
