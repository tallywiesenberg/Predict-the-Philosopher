It would be unwise in fact to use this text as a direct commen¬ 
tary on the value and legitimacy of sexual acts.Artemidorus 
does not say whether it is right or wrong, moral or immoral, 
to commit a particular act, but whether it is good or bad, 
favorable or ominous, to dream that one commits it.The 
principles that can be isolated do not therefore relate to the 
acts themselves but to their author, or rather to the sexual 
actor insofar as he represents, in the oneiric scene, the author 
of the dream and so enacts a presage of the good or evil that 
will befall him.The two main principles of oneirocriticism— 
namely, that the dream “tells what is real” and that it does so 
in the form of analogy—function here in the following way: 
the dream tells the event, the good fortune or misfortune, the 
prosperity or sorrow, that will characterize the subject’s mode 
of being in reality, and it tells it through a relationship of 
analogy with the mode of being—good or bad, favorable or 
unfavorable—of the subject as an actor on the sexual stage of 
the dream.One must not look in this text for a code specifying 
what should and should not be done; what it reveals instead 
is an ethics of the subject, one that was still common in the 
time of Artemidorus.
