The Analysis 


Artemidorus devotes four chapters to sexual dreams—not 
counting the many scattered notations.1 He organizes his anal¬ 
ysis around the distinction between three types of acts: those 
in conformity with the law (kata nomon), those contrary to 
the law (para nomon), and those contrary to nature (para 
physin).This division is far from being clear: none of these 
terms is defined.One does not see how the categories intercon¬ 
nect, or whether the category of “contrary to nature” should 
be understood as a subdivision of acts “contrary to the law.” 
Certain acts appear under two headings at once.We should 
not assume a rigorous classification that would assign every 
possible sexual act to the domain of the lawful, the unlawful, 
or the unnatural.
