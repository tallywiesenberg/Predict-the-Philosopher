Nevertheless, considered in detail, these 
groupings do have a certain intelligibility.1.Let us consider first the acts that are “in conformity 
with the law.” In retrospect, this chapter appears to mix to¬ 
gether things that are quite different: adultery and marriage, 
frequenting of prostitutes, resorting to household slaves, a 
servant’s masturbation.But in fact—leaving aside for now 
the meaning that should be given to this notion of conform¬ 
ity with the law—a passage from the chapter makes the pro¬ 
gression of the analysis rather clear.Artemidorus states as a 
general rule that women in dreams are “symbols of things 
that will happen to the dreamer, so that the character and

disposition of the woman determine what will happen to 
him.” 2 It needs to be understood, then, that for Artemidorus 
what determines the predictive meaning of a dream, and 
hence in a certain way the moral value of the act dreamed 
of, is the condition of the partner, and not the form of the 
act itself.
