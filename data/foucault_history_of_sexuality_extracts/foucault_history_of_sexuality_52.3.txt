Condition should be taken here in the broad sense: 
it is the social status of the “other”; it is the fact that he is 
married or not, is free or a slave, that he is young or old, 
rich or poor; it is his profession, it is the place where one 
meets him; it is the position he holds in relation to the 
dreamer (spouse, mistress, slave, young protege, etc.).One is 
thus able to see, beneath its apparent confusion, how the text 
unfolds: it follows the order of possible partners, according 
to their status, their connection to the dreamer, and the 
place where the dreamer encounters them.The first three figures evoked by the text reproduce the 
traditional series of the three categories of women to which 
one can have access: the wife, the mistress, and the prostitute.To dream of sexual intercourse with one’s own wife is a favor¬ 
able sign, because the wife is in a relationship of natural anal¬ 
ogy to the dreamer’s craft or profession.As with the latter, one 
engages with her in a recognized and legitimate activity; one 
benefits from her as from a prosperous occupation; the plea¬ 
sure that one derives from intercourse with her foretells the 
pleasure one will derive from the profits of one’s trade.
