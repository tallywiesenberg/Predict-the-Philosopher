Two reasons why going to 
prostitutes can, in a dream, portend death.To the conventional triad of wife, mistress, prostitute, Ar- 
temidorus adds the unknown women one encounters.In this 
case the dream’s value for the future depends on the social 
“value” of the woman it represents: Is she rich, well dressed, 
well provided with jewelry, and does she give herself willingly?If so, then the dream promises something beneficial.If she is 
old, ugly, poor, if she does not freely consent, the dream is 
inauspicious.
