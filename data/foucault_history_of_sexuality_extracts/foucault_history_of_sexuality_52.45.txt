The household provides another category of sexual part¬ 
ners: servants and slaves.Here one is in the domain of direct 
possession.It is not by analogy that slaves signify wealth; they 
are an integral part of it.It stands to reason, then, that the 
pleasure one enjoys in a dream with this type of personage 
indicates that one will “derive pleasure from one’s possessions, 
which will grow greater and more valuable.” One exercises a 
right; one reaps benefits from one’s property.Consequently, 
these are favorable dreams, which realize a status and a legiti¬ 
macy.
