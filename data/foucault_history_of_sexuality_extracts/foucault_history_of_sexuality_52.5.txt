bodies, behaviors, and social relations by a certain deploy¬ 
ment deriving from a complex political technology, one has 
to admit that this deployment does not operate in symmetri¬ 
cal fashion with respect to the social classes, and conse¬ 
quently, that it does not produce the same effects in them. 
We must return, therefore, to formulations that have long 
been disparaged; we must say that there is a bourgeois sexu¬ 
ality, and that there are class sexualities. Or rather, that 
sexuality is originally, historically bourgeois, and that, in its 
successive shifts and transpositions, it induces specific class 
effects. 

A few more words are in order. As we have noted, the 
nineteenth century witnessed a generalization of the deploy¬ 
ment of sexuality, starting from a hegemonic center. Eventu¬ 
ally the entire social body was provided with a “sexual 
body,” although this was accomplished in different ways and 
using different tools. Must we speak of the universality of 
sexuality, then? It is at this point that one notes the introduc¬ 
tion of a new differentiating element. Somewhat similar to 
the way in which, at the end of the eighteenth century, the 
bourgeoisie set its own body and its precious sexuality

The History of Sexuality 


against the valorous blood of the nobles, at the end of the 
nineteenth century it sought to redefine the specific character 
of its sexuality relative to that of others, subjecting it to a 
thorough differential review, and tracing a dividing line that 
would set apart and protect its body. This line was not the 
same as the one which founded sexuality, but rather a bar 
running through that sexuality; this was the taboo that con¬ 
stituted the difference, or at least the manner in which the 
taboo was applied and the rigor with which it was imposed. 
It was here that the theory of repression—which was gradu¬ 
ally expanded to cover the entire deployment of sexuality, so 
that the latter came to be explained in terms of a generalized 
taboo—had its point of origin. This theory is bound up his¬ 
torically with the spread of the deployment of sexuality. On 
the one hand, the theory would justify its authoritarian and 
constraining influence by postulating that all sexuality must 
be subject to the law; more precisely, that sexuality owes its 
very definition to the action of the law: not only will you 
submit your sexuality to the law, but you will have no sexual¬
