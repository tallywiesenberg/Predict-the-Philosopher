2.The domain that Artemidorus regards as “contrary to 
the law” is, however, largely constituted by incest.3 More¬ 
over, incest is understood in the very strict sense of sexual 
relations between parents and children.As for incest with 
brothers and sisters, it is assimilated into the category of 
father-daughter intercourse if it occurs between a brother 
and his sister.Between brothers, however, Artemidorus 
can’t seem to decide whether to place it in the category of 
kata nomon or in that of para nomon.
