In any case, he speaks 
of it under both rubrics.When a father dreams that he has sex with his daughter 
or his son, the signification is almost always unfavorable.This may be for immediate physical reasons: if the child is 
very young, the physical injury resulting from such an act is 
a sign pointing to his or her death (if the child is less than 
five years old) or sickness (if more than five years old but 
less than ten).If the child is older, the dream is still bad, 
because it brings into play impossible or disastrous relations.To take sexual pleasure in one’s own son, to “spend” one’s 
semen inside him, is a useless act, a wasteful expenditure by 
which nothing can be gained, and which therefore portends 
a considerable loss of money.
