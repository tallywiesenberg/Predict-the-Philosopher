Either this “ex¬ 
penditure” in the body of a girl who one day will marry, and 
thus convey the father’s seed to another man, portends a 
substantial loss of money; or this intercourse, if the girl is 
already married, indicates that she will leave her husband, 
that she will return home, and that it will be necessary to 
provide for her.The dream is auspicious only in the case 
where, the father being poor, the daughter may return 
wealthy and therefore capable of providing for her father.5 

In a way that may seem strange to us, incest with one’s 
mother (always envisaged by Artemidorus as incest of mother 
with son and never of mother with daughter) is often a bearer 
of favorable omens.Should one conclude, based on the Ar- 
temidorean principle of a correlation between predictive value 
and moral value, that mother-son incest is not fundamentally 
reprehensible?Or should one see this as one of the exceptions, 
provided for by Artemidorus, to the general principle that he 
puts forward?
