ity except by subjecting yourself to the law. But on the other 
hand, the theory of repression would compensate for this 
general spread of the deployment of sexuality by its analysis 
of the differential interplay of taboos according to the social 
classes. The discourse which at the end of the eighteenth 
century said: “There is a valuable element within us that 
must be feared and treated with respect; we must exercise 
extreme care in dealing with it, lest it be the cause of count¬ 
less evils,” was replaced by a discourse which said: “Our 
sexuality, unlike that of others, is subjected to a regime of 
repression so intense as to present a constant danger; not 
only is sex a formidable secret, as the directors of conscience, 
moralists, pedagogues, and doctors always said to former 
generations, not only must we search it out for the truth it 
conceals, but if it carries with it so many dangers, this is 
because—whether out of scrupulousness, an overly acute 
sense of sin, or hypocrisy, no matter—we have too long

reduced it to silence.” Henceforth social differentiation 
would be affirmed, not by the “sexual” quality of the body, 
but by the intensity of its repression. 

Psychoanalysis comes in at this juncture: both a theory of 
the essential interrelatedness of the law and desire, and a 
technique for relieving the effects of the taboo where its rigor 
makes it pathogenic. In its historical emergence, psychoanal¬ 
ysis cannot be dissociated from the generalization of the 
deployment of sexuality and the secondary mechanisms of 
differentiation that resulted from it. The problem of incest is 
still significant in this regard. On one hand, as we have seen, 
its prohibition was posited as an absolutely universal princi¬ 
ple which made it possible to explain both the system of 
alliance and the regime of sexuality; this taboo, in one form 
or another, was valid therefore for every society and every 
individual. But in practice psychoanalysis gave itself the task 
of alleviating the effects of repression (for those who were in 
a position to resort to psychoanalysis) that this prohibition 
was capable of causing; it allowed individuals to express their 
incestuous desire in discourse. But during the same period, 
there was a systematic campaign being organized against the 
kinds of incestuous practices that existed in rural areas or in 
certain urban quarters inaccessible to psychiatry: an inten¬ 
sive administrative and judicial grid was laid out then to put 
an end to these practices. An entire politics f or the protection 
of children or the placing of “endangered” minors under 
guardianship had as its partial objective their withdrawal 
from families that were suspected—through lack of space, 
dubious proximity, a history of debauchery, antisocial 
“primitiveness,” or degenerescence—of practicing incest. 
Whereas the deployment of sexuality had been intensifying 
affective relations and physical proximity since the eigh¬ 
teenth century, and although there had occurred a perpetual 
incitement to incest in the bourgeois family, the regime of 
sexuality applied to the lower classes on the contrary in¬ 
volved the exclusion of incestuous practices or at least their

displacement into another form. At a time when incest was 
being hunted out as a conduct, psychoanalysis was busy 
revealing it as a desire and alleviating—for those who suff¬ 
ered from the desire—the severity which repressed it. We 
must not forget that the discovery of the Oedipus complex 
was contemporaneous with the juridical organization of loss 
of parental authority (in France, this was formulated in the 
laws of 1889 and 1898). At the moment when Freud was 
uncovering the nature of Dora’s desire and allowing it to be 
put into words, preparations were being made to undo those 
reprehensible proximities in other social sectors; on the one 
hand, the father was elevated into an object of compulsory 
love, but on the other hand, if he was a loved one, he was 
at the same time a fallen one in the eyes of the law. Psychoa¬ 
nalysis, as a limited therapeutic practice, thus played a differ¬ 
entiating role with respect to other procedures, within a 
deployment of sexuality that had come into general use. 
Those who had lost the exclusive privilege of worrying over 
their sexuality henceforth had the privilege of experiencing 
more than others the thing that prohibited it and of possess¬ 
ing the method which made it possible to remove the repres¬ 
sion. 

The history of the deployment of sexuality, as it has 
evolved since the classical age, can serve as an archaeology 
of psychoanalysis. We have seen in fact that psychoanalysis 
plays several roles at once in this deployment: it is a mecha¬ 
nism for attaching sexuality to the system of alliance; it
