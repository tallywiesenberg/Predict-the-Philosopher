ity except by subjecting yourself to the law. But on the other 
hand, the theory of repression would compensate for this 
general spread of the deployment of sexuality by its analysis 
of the differential interplay of taboos according to the social 
classes. The discourse which at the end of the eighteenth 
century said: “There is a valuable element within us that 
must be feared and treated with respect; we must exercise 
extreme care in dealing with it, lest it be the cause of count¬ 
less evils,” was replaced by a discourse which said: “Our 
sexuality, unlike that of others, is subjected to a regime of 
repression so intense as to present a constant danger; not 
only is sex a formidable secret, as the directors of conscience, 
moralists, pedagogues, and doctors always said to former 
generations, not only must we search it out for the truth it 
conceals, but if it carries with it so many dangers, this is 
because—whether out of scrupulousness, an overly acute 
sense of sin, or hypocrisy, no matter—we have too long

reduced it to silence.” Henceforth social differentiation 
would be affirmed, not by the “sexual” quality of the body, 
but by the intensity of its repression. 

Psychoanalysis comes in at this juncture: both a theory of 
the essential interrelatedness of the law and desire, and a 
technique for relieving the effects of the taboo where its rigor 
makes it pathogenic. In its historical emergence, psychoanal¬ 
ysis cannot be dissociated from the generalization of the 
deployment of sexuality and the secondary mechanisms of 
differentiation that resulted from it. The problem of incest is 
still significant in this regard. On one hand, as we have seen, 
its prohibition was posited as an absolutely universal princi¬ 
ple which made it possible to explain both the system of 
alliance and the regime of sexuality; this taboo, in one form 
or another, was valid therefore for every society and every 
individual. But in practice psychoanalysis gave itself the task 
of alleviating the effects of repression (for those who were in 
a position to resort to psychoanalysis) that this prohibition 
was capable of causing; it allowed individuals to express their 
incestuous desire in discourse. But during the same period, 
there was a systematic campaign being organized against the 
kinds of incestuous practices that existed in rural areas or in 
certain urban quarters inaccessible to psychiatry: an inten¬
