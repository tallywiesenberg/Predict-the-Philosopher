gather up the sperm that has been squeezed out by the males, 
as, for example, fish.” Similarly, humans have received a very 
specific mode of union from nature: the face-to-face position, 
with the man extended full length on top of the woman.In this 
form, sexual intercourse is an act of complete possession.Pro¬

the whole body of his mate.” All the other positions “have 
been discovered by yielding to wantonness and licentious¬ 
ness.” These unnatural relations always contain a portent of 
defective social relations (bad relationships, hostility) or a 
prediction of a worsening of one’s economic situation (one is 
uncomfortable, financially “embarrassed”).
