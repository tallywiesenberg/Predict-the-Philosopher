Artemidorus 
lists five possibilities: relations with gods, with animals, or 
with corpses; relations with oneself; and relations between 
women.The presence of these last two categories among the 
acts defying nature is more enigmatic than that of the others.Sexual intercourse with oneself is not to be understood as 
masturbation; the latter is mentioned among the acts that are 
“in conformity with the law.’’ What is meant here by unnatu¬ 
ral relations with oneself is penetration of the penis into one’s 
own body, or kissing one’s own sex organ, or taking the sex 
organ into one’s mouth.The first type of dream foretells pov¬ 
erty, indigence, and suffering; the second promises the birth 
of children, if one does not yet have any, or their return, if they 
are absent; the last signifies that the children will die, that one 
will be deprived of women and mistresses (for one does not 
need women when one can gratify oneself), or that one will 
be reduced to extreme poverty.As for sexual relations between women, one might wonder 
why they appear in the category of “unnatural” acts, whereas 
relations between men are distributed under other rubrics 
(and essentially under that of acts in conformity with the law).
