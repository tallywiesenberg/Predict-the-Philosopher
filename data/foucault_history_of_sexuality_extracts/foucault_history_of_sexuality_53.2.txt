Intercourse between two women can also sig¬ 
nify the communication or knowledge of feminine “secrets.”

Dream and Act 


Two traits should be noted because they mark the entire 
analysis of the sexual dream in Artemidorus.First, the 
dreamer is always present in his own dream.The sexual im¬ 
ages that Artemidorus deciphers never constitute a pure and 
simple phantasmagoria of which the dreamer would be the 
spectator and which would unfold before his eyes indepen¬ 
dently of him.He always takes part, and he does so as the 
leading actor.What he sees is himself in his sexual activity: 
there is an exact correspondence between the subject dream¬ 
ing of an act and the subject of the act as it is seen in the 
dream.
