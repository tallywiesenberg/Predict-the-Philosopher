Second, we may remark that in terms of his work as 
a whole, Artemidorus seldom treats sexual acts and plea¬ 
sures as signified or presaged elements; it is relatively excep¬ 
tional for an image given in a dream to forecast a sexual act 
or a deprivation of pleasure.1 On the other hand, these acts 
and pleasures are grouped together, in the three chapters 
studied here, as components of the dream and as predictive 
elements.Artemidorus almost always has them figure on the 
side of the “signifiers,” and almost never on the side of the 
“signified.” They are images and not meanings, representa¬ 
tion and not represented event.Artemidorus’ interpretation 
will therefore place itself on a line traced between the actor 
of the sexual act and the dreamer of the dream, going in this 
way from subject to subject; and, starting from the sexual act 
and the role of the subject as he represents himself in his

dream, the work of interpretation will have as its object to 
decipher what is going to happen to the dreamer once he has 
returned to waking life.It is apparent at a glance that Artemidorus’ interpretation 
quite regularly discovers a social signification in sexual 
dreams.
