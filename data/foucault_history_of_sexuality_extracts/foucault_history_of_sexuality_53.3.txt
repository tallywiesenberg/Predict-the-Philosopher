True, it sometimes happens that these dreams fore¬ 
cast an abrupt change in the state of one’s health—an illness 
or a recovery—and it happens, too, that they are signs of 
death.But in a much greater proportion, they refer to such 
events as success or failure in business, enrichment or im¬ 
poverishment, a family’s prosperity or reverse of fortune, an 
advantageous or disadvantageous undertaking, favorable mar¬ 
riages or ill-fated alliances, disputes, rivalries, reconciliations, 
good or bad luck in a public career, exile, condemnation.Sexual dreams foretell the dreamer’s destiny in social life; the 
actor that he is on the sexual stage of the dream anticipates 
the role that he will play in the theater of family life, profes¬ 
sional endeavor, and civic affairs.There are, to begin with, two reasons for this.One is entirely 
general in nature; it concerns a feature of language Ar¬ 
temidorus puts to frequent use.
