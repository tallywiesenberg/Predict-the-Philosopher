There exists in Greek—and in 
many other languages as well, to varying degrees—a very 
pronounced ambiguity between the sexual meaning and the 
economic meaning of certain terms.Thus, the word soma, 
which designates the body, also refers to riches and posses¬ 
sions; whence the possible equivalence between the “posses¬ 
sion” of a body and the possession of wealth.2 Ousia is 
substance and fortune; it is also semen and sperm: the loss of 
the latter may mean expenditure of the former.3 The term 
blabe, “damage,” may refer to economic setbacks, losses of 
money, but also to the fact that one is the victim of an act of 
violence and that one is a passive object in a sexual act.4 * 
Artemidorus also plays on the polysemy of the vocabulary of 

‘See also Book IV, where it is said that to dream that one becomes a bridge signifies 
that one will be a prostitute: “If a woman or a handsome youth dream they turn into 
a bridge, they will become prostitutes and allow many to go over them.” \ rich man 
who had this same dream found himself in a situation in which he was “regarded 
contemptuously and was, in a certain sense, trampled under foot.”*

debt: words signifying that one is bound to pay and one seeks 
to get free of the debt may also mean that one is pressed by 
a sexual need and that by satisfying it one is free of it.
