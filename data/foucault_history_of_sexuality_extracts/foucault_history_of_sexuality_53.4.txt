The 
word anagkaion, which is employed to designate the male 
organ, is at the intersection of these significations.6 

Another reason has to do with the particular form and 
intended purpose of Artemidorus’ work: a man’s book that is 
addressed mainly to men in order to help them lead their lives 
as men.One must remember in fact that the interpretation of 
dreams is not regarded as a matter of pure and simple curios¬ 
ity; it is an activity that is useful for managing one’s existence 
and for preparing oneself for events that are going to occur.Since the nights tell the things of which the days will be made, 
it is good—if one is properly to live out his existence as a man, 
a master of a household, a father of a family—to be able to 
decipher the dreams that arise in one’s life.This is the perspec¬ 
tive of Artemidorus’ books: they are a guide that will aid the 
responsible man, the master of his house, to conduct himself 
in daily life according to the signs that may prefigure that life.
