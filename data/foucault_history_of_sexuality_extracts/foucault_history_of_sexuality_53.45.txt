Hence it is the fabric of this familial, economic, and social life 
that he strives to rediscover in the images of dreams.But that is not all: the interpretive practice at work in 
Artemidorus’ discourse shows that the sexual dream itself is 
perceived, formalized, analyzed as a social scene.If it foretells 
“good things and bad” in the domain of occupation, patri¬ 
mony, family, political career, status, friendships, and patron¬ 
age, this is because the sexual acts that the dream depicts are 
made up of the same elements as that domain.By following 
the analytic procedures Artemidorus uses, one sees clearly 
that the interpretation of aphrodisia dreams in terms of suc¬ 
cess or failure, social good fortune or misfortune, presupposes 
a sort of consubstantiality between the two domains.This is 
apparent on two levels: that of the elements of the dream that 
are taken up as materials for the analysis and that of the 
principles that make it possible to attribute a meaning (a 
predictive “value”) to those elements.
