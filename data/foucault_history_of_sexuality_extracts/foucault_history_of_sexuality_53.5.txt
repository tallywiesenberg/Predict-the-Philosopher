sive administrative and judicial grid was laid out then to put 
an end to these practices. An entire politics f or the protection 
of children or the placing of “endangered” minors under 
guardianship had as its partial objective their withdrawal 
from families that were suspected—through lack of space, 
dubious proximity, a history of debauchery, antisocial 
“primitiveness,” or degenerescence—of practicing incest. 
Whereas the deployment of sexuality had been intensifying 
affective relations and physical proximity since the eigh¬ 
teenth century, and although there had occurred a perpetual 
incitement to incest in the bourgeois family, the regime of 
sexuality applied to the lower classes on the contrary in¬

displacement into another form. At a time when incest was 
being hunted out as a conduct, psychoanalysis was busy 
revealing it as a desire and alleviating—for those who suff¬ 
ered from the desire—the severity which repressed it. We 
must not forget that the discovery of the Oedipus complex 
was contemporaneous with the juridical organization of loss 
of parental authority (in France, this was formulated in the 
laws of 1889 and 1898). At the moment when Freud was 
uncovering the nature of Dora’s desire and allowing it to be 
put into words, preparations were being made to undo those 
reprehensible proximities in other social sectors; on the one 
hand, the father was elevated into an object of compulsory 
love, but on the other hand, if he was a loved one, he was 
at the same time a fallen one in the eyes of the law. Psychoa¬ 
nalysis, as a limited therapeutic practice, thus played a differ¬ 
entiating role with respect to other procedures, within a 
deployment of sexuality that had come into general use. 
Those who had lost the exclusive privilege of worrying over 
their sexuality henceforth had the privilege of experiencing 
more than others the thing that prohibited it and of possess¬ 
ing the method which made it possible to remove the repres¬ 
sion. 

The history of the deployment of sexuality, as it has 
evolved since the classical age, can serve as an archaeology 
of psychoanalysis. We have seen in fact that psychoanalysis 
plays several roles at once in this deployment: it is a mecha¬ 
nism for attaching sexuality to the system of alliance; it
