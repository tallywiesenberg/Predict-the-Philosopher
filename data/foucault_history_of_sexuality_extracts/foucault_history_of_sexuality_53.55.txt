It is also as “personages” that the partners 
represented are considered.The oneiric world of Ar- 
temidorus’ dreamer is peopled by individuals who have few 
physical traits and who do not appear to have many affective 
or erotic ties to the dreamer himself.They figure as little more 
than social profiles: young people, old people (at any rate they 
are younger or older than the dreamer), rich people, or poor 
people; they are individuals who bring riches or ask for pres¬ 
ents; they are relatives who flatter or humiliate; they are su¬ 
periors to whom one had best yield or inferiors by whom one 
can rightfully profit; they are people from the household or 
from the outside; they are free men, women under a husband’s 
control, slaves, or professional prostitutes.As for what transpires between these personages and the 
dreamer, Artemidorus’ restraint is nothing short of remark¬ 
able.No caresses, no complicated combinations, no phantas¬ 
magoria; just a few simple variations around one basic form 
—penetration.
