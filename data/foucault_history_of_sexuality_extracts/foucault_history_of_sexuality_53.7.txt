Artemidorus sees the sexual act first and foremost as a 
game of superiority and inferiority: penetration places the two 
partners in a relationship of domination and submission.It is 
victory on one side, defeat on the other; it is a right that is 
exercised for one of the partners, a necessity that is imposed 
on the other.It is a status that one asserts, or a condition to 
which one is subjected.It is an advantage from which one 
benefits, or an acceptance of a situation from which others are 
allowed to benefit.Which brings us to the other aspect of the 
sexual act.
