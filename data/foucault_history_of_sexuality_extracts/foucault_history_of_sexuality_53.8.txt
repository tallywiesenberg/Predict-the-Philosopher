How—on the basis of these elements, taken up in this 
fashion and made pertinent for the analysis—will Arte- 
midorus establish the “value” of the sexual dream?And what 
is meant by this is not only the type of event that is forecast 
allegorically, but above all—the crucial aspect for practical 
analysis—its “quality,” that is, its auspicious or inauspicious 
character for the dreamer.Recall that one of the fundamental 
principles of the method is that the predictive quality of a 
dream (the favorable or unfavorable character of the event 
foretold) depends on the value of the foretelling image (the 
good or bad character of the act represented in a dream).Now, 
by following the analysis through a series of examples, we 
have been able to see that a sexual act with a “positive value” 
from Artemidorus’ point of view is not always and not exactly 
a sexual act that is permitted by law, honored by opinion, and 
accepted by custom.There are major coincidences, of course: 
to dream that one has intercourse with one’s own spouse or 
mistress is good.
