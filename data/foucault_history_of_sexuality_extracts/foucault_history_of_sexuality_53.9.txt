It is this adjust¬ 
ment to the “waking” social relation that qualifies the oneiric 
sexual relation.In order to be “good,” the sexual act that one dreams needs 
to obey a general rule of “isomorphism.” And, speaking 
schematically still, one may add that this rule takes two forms: 
“analogy of position” and “economic adequation.” According 
to the first of these principles, a sexual act will be good to the 
extent that the subject who dreams occupies in his sexual 
activity with his partner a position that matches the one he 
occupies in real life with this same partner (or a partner of the 
same type).Thus, to be “active” with one’s slave (whatever 
the sex of the latter), or to be active with a prostitute (male 
or female), or to be active with a boy who is young and poor, 
is good; but it will be “good” to be passive with an individual 
older than oneself, richer than oneself, and so on.It is by 
virtue of this rule of isomorphism that the dream of incest with 
one’s mother is laden with so many positive values.In such 
dreams the subject is indeed seen in a position of activity with 
respect to a mother who gave birth to and nurtured him, and 
whom he ought to cultivate, honor, serve, maintain, and en¬ 
rich in return, like a piece of land, a native country, a city.
