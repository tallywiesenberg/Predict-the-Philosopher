In 
the dream scene, the sexual actor (who is always the dreamer 
and is almost always an adult male) must, if his dream is to 
be good, maintain his role as a social actor (even if the act 
happens to be reprehensible in reality).Let us not forget that 
all the sexual dreams that Artemidorus analyzes are consid¬ 
ered by him to belong to the category of oneiros: hence they 
tell “what will be”; and it so happens in this case that what 
“will be,” and what is “told” in the dream, is the position of 
the dreamer as a subject of activity—active or passive, domi¬ 
nant or dominated, winner or loser, “on top” or “on the 
bottom,” profit-taker or spender, deriving benefits or ex¬ 
periencing losses, finding himself in an advantageous position 
or suffering damages.The sexual dream uses the little drama 
of penetration and passivity, pleasure and expenditure, to tell 
the subject’s mode of being, as destiny has arranged it.By way of confirmation, one might refer to a passage from 
The Interpretation of Dreams which shows unmistakably the 
connection between that which constitutes the individual as 
an active subject in the sexual relation and that which situates 
him in the field of social activities.I am thinking of the text, 
in another section of the book, that is devoted to the meaning 
of the different parts of the body in dreams.
