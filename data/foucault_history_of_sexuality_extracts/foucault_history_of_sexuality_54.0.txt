assumes an adversary position with respect to the theory of 
degenerescence; it functions as a differentiating factor in the 
general technology of sex. Around it the great requirement 
of confession that had taken form so long ago assumed the 
new meaning of an injunction to lift psychical repression. 
The task of truth was now linked to the challenging of 
taboos. 

This same development, moreover, opened up the possibil¬ 
ity of a substantial shift in tactics, consisting in: reinterpret-

ing the deployment of sexuality in terms of a generalized 
repression; tying this repression to general mechanisms of 
domination and exploitation; and linking together the proc¬ 
esses that make it possible to free oneself both of repression 
and of domination and exploitation. Thus between the two 
world wars there was formed, around Reich, the historico- 
political critique of sexual repression. The importance of this 
critique and its impact on reality were substantial. But the 
very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it 
always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not 
outside or against it. The fact that so many things were able 
to change in the sexual behavior of Western societies without 
any of the promises or political conditions predicted by 
Reich being realized is sufficient proof that this whole sexual 
“revolution,” this whole “antirepressive” struggle, repre¬ 
sented nothing more, but nothing less—and its importance 
is undeniable—than a tactical shift and reversal in the great 
deployment of sexuality. But it is also apparent why one 
could not expect this critique to be the grid for a history of 
that very deployment. Nor the basis for a movement to dis¬ 
mantle it.
