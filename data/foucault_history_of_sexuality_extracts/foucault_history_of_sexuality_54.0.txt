assumes an adversary position with respect to the theory of 
degenerescence; it functions as a differentiating factor in the 
general technology of sex. Around it the great requirement 
of confession that had taken form so long ago assumed the 
new meaning of an injunction to lift psychical repression. 
The task of truth was now linked to the challenging of 
taboos. 

This same development, moreover, opened up the possibil¬ 
ity of a substantial shift in tactics, consisting in: reinterpret-

ing the deployment of sexuality in terms of a generalized 
repression; tying this repression to general mechanisms of 
domination and exploitation; and linking together the proc¬ 
esses that make it possible to free oneself both of repression 
and of domination and exploitation. Thus between the two 
world wars there was formed, around Reich, the historico- 
political critique of sexual repression. The importance of this 
critique and its impact on reality were substantial. But the 
very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it 
always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not 
outside or against it. The fact that so many things were able 
to change in the sexual behavior of Western societies without 
any of the promises or political conditions predicted by 
Reich being realized is sufficient proof that this whole sexual 
“revolution,” this whole “antirepressive” struggle, repre¬ 
sented nothing more, but nothing less—and its importance 
is undeniable—than a tactical shift and reversal in the great 
deployment of sexuality. But it is also apparent why one 
could not expect this critique to be the grid for a history of 
that very deployment. Nor the basis for a movement to dis¬ 
mantle it. 




PART FIVE 

Right of Death 
and Power over Life 




For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of 
sovereign power was the right to decide life and death. In a 
formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria 
potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the 
right to “dispose” of the life of his children and his slaves; 
just as he had given them life, so he could take it away. By 
the time the right of life and death was framed by the classi¬ 
cal theoreticians, it was in a considerably diminished form. 
It was no longer considered that this power of the sovereign 
over his subjects could be exercised in an absolute and un¬ 
conditional way, but only in cases where the sovereign’s very 
existence was in jeopardy: a sort of right of rejoinder. If he 
were threatened by external enemies who sought to over¬ 
throw him or contest his rights, he could then legitimately 
wage war, and require his subjects to take part in the defense 
of the state; without “directly proposing their death,” he was 
empowered to “expose their life”: in this sense, he wielded 
an “indirect” power over them of life and death. 1 But if 
someone dared to rise up against him and transgress his laws, 
then he could exercise a direct power over the offender’s life: 
as punishment, the latter would be put to death. Viewed in 
this way, the power of life and death was not an absolute 
privilege: it was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, 
and his own survival. Must we follow Hobbes in seeing it as 
the transfer to the prince of the natural right possessed by 
every individual to defend his life even if this meant the death 
of others? Or should it be regarded as a specific right that was 
manifested with the formation of that new juridical being,

the sovereign? 2 In any case, in its modern form—relative and 
limited-as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life 
and death is a dissymmetrical one. The sovereign exercised 
his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by 
refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only 
through the death he was capable of requiring. The right
