For it is impossible to use two penises at the same time.I know of a slave who dreamt that he had three penises.He 
was set free and, in place of one name, he had three, since he 
received in addition the two names of the master who had 
freed him.But this happened only once.One must not base 
one’s interpretation on rare instances but rather on the more 
normal cases.” 7 

The penis thus appears at the intersection of all these games 
of mastery: self-mastery, since its demands are likely to en¬ 
slave us if we allow ourselves to be coerced by it; superiority 
over sexual partners, since it is by means of the penis that the 
penetration is carried out; status and privileges, since it sig¬ 
nifies the whole field of kinship and social activity.
