In this world, finally, sexual relations between men appear to 
be taken for granted—that is, provided that certain differences 
of age and status are respected.We may also note the presence of several elements of a code.But it must be admitted that they are both few in number and 
rather nebulous—a few major prohibitions that are manifested 
in the form of intense repulsions: fellatio, sexual relations 
between women, and, above all, the usurping of the male role 
by a woman; a very restrictive definition of incest, conceived 
of essentially as intercourse between parents and children; and 
a reference to a standard, natural form of sexual act.But there 
is nothing in Artemidorus’ text that refers to a permanent and 
complete grid of classifications among permitted and prohib¬ 
ited acts; nothing that draws a clear and definitive line of 
division between what is natural and what is “contrary to 
nature.” Moreover, it seems that these code elements are not 
—at least not in dreams having a predictive function—what 
plays the most important and decisive role in determining the 
“quality” of a sexual act.On the other hand, one does perceive, in the very way the 
interpretation proceeds, a different way of thinking about sex¬ 
ual acts and different principles for evaluating them: not with 
a view to the act and its regular or irregular form, but with 
a view to the actor, his way of being, his particular situation, 
his relation to others, and the position he occupies with re¬ 
spect to them.
