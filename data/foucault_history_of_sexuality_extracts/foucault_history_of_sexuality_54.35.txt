The main question appears to bear much less 
on the acts’ conformity with a natural structure or with a 
positive regulation, than on what might be called the subject’s 
“style of activity” and on the relation he establishes between 
sexual activity and the other aspects of his familial, social, and 
economic existence.The movement of analysis and the proce¬ 
dures of valuation do not go from the act to a domain such

as sexuality or the flesh, a domain whose divine, civil, or 
natural laws would delineate the permitted forms; they go 
from the subject as a sexual actor to the other areas of life in 
which he pursues his activity.And it is in the relationship 
between these different forms of activity that the principles of 
evaluation of a sexual behavior are essentially, but not exclu¬ 
sively, situated.Here one easily recognizes the principal characteristics of 
the ethical experience of the aphrodisia in the form in which 
it had appeared in the texts of the classical age.And, precisely 
insofar as it does not formulate an ethic, but uses for dream 
interpretation a way of perceiving and judging sexual pleasure 
that is contemporaneous with it, Artemidorus’ book testifies 
to the endurance and solidity of that form of experience.
