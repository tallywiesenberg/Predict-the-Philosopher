If we turn, however, to texts whose object is to reflect on 
the sexual practices themselves and to give advice on behavior 
and precepts for living, with reference to them, we can note 
a certain number of modifications in comparison with the 
doctrines of austerity formulated in the philosophy of the 
fourth century.Breaks, radical changes, emergence of a new 
form of experience of pleasure?No, this was clearly not the 
case.And yet there are noticeable inflections: a closer atten¬ 
tion, an increased anxiety concerning sexual conduct, a 
greater importance accorded to marriage and its demands, 
and less value given to the love of boys: in short, a more 
rigorous style.But in these themes that develop, become ac¬ 
centuated, and gather strength, one can discern a different 
type of modification: it concerns the way in which ethical 
thought defines the relation of the subject to his sexual ac¬ 
tivity.
