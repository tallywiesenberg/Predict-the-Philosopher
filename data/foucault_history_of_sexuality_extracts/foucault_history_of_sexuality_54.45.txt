PART TWO 

The Cultivation 
of the Self 




A mistrust of the pleasures, an emphasis on the conse¬ 
quences of their abuse for the body and the soul, a valorization 
of marriage and marital obligations, a disaffection with regard 
to the spiritual meanings imputed to the love of boys: a whole 
attitude of severity was manifested in the thinking of philoso¬ 
phers and physicians in the course of the first two centuries.It is visible in the texts of Soranus and Rufus of Ephesus, in 
Musonius or Seneca, in Plutarch as well as in Epictetus or 
Marcus Aurelius.Moreover, it is a fact that the Christian 
authors borrowed extensively—with and without acknowl¬ 
edgment—from this body of ethical thought.And most his¬ 
torians today recognize the existence, strength, and 
intensification of these themes of sexual austerity in a society 
known by its contemporaries, and, more often than not, re¬ 
proached, for its immorality and dissolute ways.Let us leave 
aside the question of knowing whether this blame was jus¬ 
tified.
