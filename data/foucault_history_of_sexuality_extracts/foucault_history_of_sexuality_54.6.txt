They urge individuals 
to be more austere if they wish to lead a life different from that 
of “the throngs”; they do not try to determine which measures 
or punishments might constrain everyone in a uniform man¬ 
ner.Moreover, if we are authorized to speak of an increased 
austerity, this is not because more rigorous prohibitions were 
recommended: after all, the medical regimens of the first and 
second centuries are, generally speaking, not much more re¬ 
strictive than that of Diodes; the conjugal fidelity exalted by 
the Stoics is not more rigorous than that of Nicocles, who 
boasted of not having sexual relations with any woman other

texts of the first centuries—more than new interdictions con¬ 
cerning sexual acts—is the insistence on the attention that 
should be brought to bear on oneself; it is the modality, scope, 
constancy, and exactitude of the required vigilance; it is the 
anxiety concerning all the disturbances of the body and the 
mind, which must be prevented by means of an austere regi¬ 
men; it is the importance attributed to self-respect, not just 
insofar as one’s status is concerned, but as concerns one’s 
rational nature—a self-respect that is exercised by depriving 
oneself of pleasure or by confining one’s indulgence to mar¬ 
riage or procreation.In short, and as a first approximation, 
this added emphasis on sexual austerity in moral reflection 
takes the form, not of a tightening of the code that defined 
prohibited acts, but of an intensification of the relation to 
oneself by which one constituted oneself as the subject of one’s 
acts.
