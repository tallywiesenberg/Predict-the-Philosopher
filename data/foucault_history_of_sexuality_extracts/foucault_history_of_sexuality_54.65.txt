2 And the motivations of this more severe ethics cannot 
be examined without taking such a form into account.One may think at this point of a phenomenon that is often 
alluded to: the growth, in the Hellenistic and Roman world, 
of an “individualism” that is said to have accorded more and 
more importance to the “private” aspects of existence, to the 
values of personal conduct, and to the interest that people 
focused on themselves.Thus, it was not a strengthening of 
public authority that accounted for the development of that 
rigorous ethics, but rather a weakening of the political and 
social framework within which the lives of individuals used to 
unfold.Being less firmly attached to the cities, more isolated 
from one another, and more reliant on themselves, they 
sought in philosophy rules of conduct that were more per¬ 
sonal.Not everything is false in a schema of this sort.
