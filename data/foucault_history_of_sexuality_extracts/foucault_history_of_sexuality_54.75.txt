Quite often with 
such categories, entirely different realities are lumped to¬ 
gether.Three things in fact need to be distinguished here: (1) 
the individualistic attitude, characterized by the absolute 
value attributed to the individual in his singularity and by the 
degree of independence conceded to him vis-a-vis the group to 
which he belongs and the institutions to which he is answer- 
able; (2) the positive valuation of private life, that is, the 
importance granted to family relationships, to the forms of 
domestic activity, and to the domain of patrimonial interests; 
(3) the intensity of the relations to self, that is, of the forms 
in which one is called upon to take oneself as an object of 
knowledge and a field of action, so as to transform, correct, 
and purify oneself, and find salvation.These attitudes can be 
interconnected, no doubt.Thus it can happen that individual¬ 
ism entails an intensification of the values of private life, or 
that the importance accorded to the relations to self is as¬ 
sociated with an exaltation of individual singularity.But these 
connections are neither constant nor necessary.
