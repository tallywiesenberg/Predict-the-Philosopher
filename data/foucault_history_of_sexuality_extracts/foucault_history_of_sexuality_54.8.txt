and enable him to win out over the others, without his having 
to attribute any great importance to his private life or to the 
relations of himself to himself.There are also societies in 
which private life is highly valued, in which it is carefully 
protected and organized, in which it forms the center of refer¬ 
ence for behaviors and one of the principles of their valuation 
—this appears to be true of the bourgeois classes in the West¬ 
ern countries of the nineteenth century.But, for this very 
reason, individualism in such societies is weak and the rela¬ 
tions of oneself to oneself are largely undeveloped.Finally, 
there are societies or groups in which the relation to self is 
intensified and developed without this resulting, as if by neces¬ 
sity, in a strengthening of the values of individualism or of 
private life.The Christian ascetic movement of the first centu¬ 
ries presented itself as an extremely strong accentuation of the 
relations of oneself to oneself, but in the form of a disqualifica¬ 
tion of the values of private life; and when it took the form of 
cenobitism, it manifested an explicit rejection of any individu¬ 
alism that might be inherent in the practice of reclusion.
