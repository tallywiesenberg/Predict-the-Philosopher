The demands of sexual austerity expressed in imperial times 
do not seem to have been the manifestation of a growing 
individualism.Their context is characterized instead by a phe¬ 
nomenon that has a rather long historical range, but reached 
its peak at that particular moment.I am referring to the 
development of what might be called a “cultivation of the 
self,” wherein the relations of oneself to oneself were inten¬ 
sified and valorized.This “cultivation of the self” 3 can be briefly characterized 
by the fact that in this case the art of existence—the techne tou 
biou in its different forms—is dominated by the principle that 
says one must “take care of oneself.” It is this principle of the 
care of the self that establishes its necessity, presides over its 
development, and organizes its practice.But one has to be 
precise here; the idea that one ought to attend to oneself, care 
for oneself (heautou epimeleisthai), was actually a very ancient 
theme in Greek culture.
