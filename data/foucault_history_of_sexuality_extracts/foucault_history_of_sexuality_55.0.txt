which was formulated as the “power of life and death” was 
in reality the right to take life or let live. Its symbol, after 
all, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re¬ 
ferred to a historical type of society in which power was 
exercised mainly as a means of deduction (prelevement), a 
subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of 
the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and 
blood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was 
essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and 
ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize 
hold of life in order to suppress it. 

Since the classical age the West has undergone a very 
profound transformation of these mechanisms of power. 
“Deduction” has tended to be no longer the major form of 
power but merely one element among others, working to 
incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize 
the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak¬ 
ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated 
to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. 
There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least 
a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis¬ 
tering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that 
was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as 
simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, 
maintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody 
as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things 

2 “Just as a composite body can have properties not found in any of the simple bodies 
of which the mixture consists, so a moral body, by virtue of the very union of 
persons of which it is composed, can have certain rights which none of the individu¬ 
als could expressly claim and whose exercise is the proper function of leaders 
alone.” Pufendorf, Le Droit de la nature, p. 452. 



Right of Death and Power over Life

being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts 
on their own populations. But this formidable power of death 
—and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and 
the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits 
—now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that 
exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to adminis¬ 
ter, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls 
and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in 
the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are 
waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire popula¬ 
tions are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in 
the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is 
as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that 
so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, 
causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that 
closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them 
to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision 
that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in 
fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. 
The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: 
the power to expose a whole population to death is the 
underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s con¬ 
tinued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of bat¬ 
tle—that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on 
living—has become the principle that defines the strategy of 
states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical 
existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence 
of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern 
powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient 
right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at 
the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale 
phenomena of population. 

On another level, I might have taken up the example of the 
death penalty. Together with war, it was for a long time the 
other form of the right of the sword; it constituted the reply 
of the sovereign to those who attacked his will, his law, or

his person. Those who died on the scaffold became fewer and 
fewer, in contrast to those who died in wars. But it was for 
the same reasons that the latter became more numerous and 
the former more and more rare. As soon as power gave itself 
the function of administering life, its reason for being and the 
logic of its exercise—and not the awakening of humanitarian 
feelings—made it more and more difficult to apply the death 
penalty. How could power exercise its highest prerogatives 
by putting people to death, when its main role was to ensure, 
sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order? For such 
a power, execution was at the same time a limit, a scandal, 
and a contradiction. Hence capital punishment could not be
