which was formulated as the “power of life and death” was 
in reality the right to take life or let live. Its symbol, after 
all, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re¬ 
ferred to a historical type of society in which power was 
exercised mainly as a means of deduction (prelevement), a 
subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of 
the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and 
blood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was 
essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and 
ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize 
hold of life in order to suppress it. 

Since the classical age the West has undergone a very 
profound transformation of these mechanisms of power. 
“Deduction” has tended to be no longer the major form of 
power but merely one element among others, working to 
incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize 
the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak¬ 
ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated 
to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. 
There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least 
a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis¬ 
tering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that 
was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as 
simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, 
maintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody 
as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things

of which the mixture consists, so a moral body, by virtue of the very union of 
persons of which it is composed, can have certain rights which none of the individu¬ 
als could expressly claim and whose exercise is the proper function of leaders 
alone.” Pufendorf, Le Droit de la nature, p. 452.

being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts 
on their own populations. But this formidable power of death 
—and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and 
the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits 
—now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that 
exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to adminis¬ 
ter, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls 
and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in
