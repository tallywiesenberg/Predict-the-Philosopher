It also took the form of an attitude, a mode of behavior; 
it became instilled in ways of living; it evolved into procedures, 
practices, and formulas that people reflected on, developed, 
perfected, and taught.It thus came to constitute a social 
practice, giving rise to relationships between individuals, to 
exchanges and communications, and at times even to institu¬ 
tions.And it gave rise, finally, to a certain mode of knowledge 
and to the elaboration of a science.In the slow development of the art of living under the theme 
of the care of oneself, the first two centuries of the imperial 
epoch can be seen as the summit of a curve: a kind of golden 
age in the cultivation of the self—it being understood, of 
course, that this phenomenon concerned only the social 
groups, very limited in number, that were bearers of culture 
and for whose members a techne tou biou could have a mean¬ 
ing and a reality.1.
