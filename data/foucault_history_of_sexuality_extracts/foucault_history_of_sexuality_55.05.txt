The epimeleia heautou, the cur a sui, is an injunction 
that one rediscovers in many philosophical doctrines.One 
encounters it in the Platonists: Albinus advises that one com¬ 
mence the study of philosophy by reading the Alcibiades 
“with a view to turning and returning to oneself,” and for the 
purpose of learning “that which one should make into the 
object of his care.” 8 Apuleius, at the end of the God of Socrates, 
expresses his wonder at seeing the carelessness of his contem¬ 
poraries with regard to themselves: “All men should desire to 
live most happily, and should know that they cannot so live 
in any other way than by cultivating the soul, and yet leave 
the soul uncultivated [animum suum non colunt ].If, however, 
anyone wishes to see acutely, it is requisite that he should pay 
attention to his eyes, through which he sees; if you desire to 
run with celerity, attention must be paid to the feet, by which 
you run....In a similar manner, in all the other members, 
attention to each must be paid according to one’s preferences.
