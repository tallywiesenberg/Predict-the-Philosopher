The Care of the Self 


wonder, why they do not also cultivate their soul by reason 
[cur non etiam animum suum ratione excolant ].” 9 

As for the Epicureans, the Letter to Menoeceus began by 
stating the principle that philosophy should be considered as 
a permanent exercise of the care of oneself: “Let no young 
man delay the study of philosophy, and let no young man 
become weary of it; for it is never too early or too late to care 
for the well-being of the soul .” 10 It is this Epicurean theme of 
the need to take care of oneself that Seneca takes up in one of 
his letters: “Just as fair weather, purified into the purest bril¬ 
liancy, does not admit of a still greater degree of clearness; so, 
when a man takes care of his body and of his soul [ hominis 
corpus animumque curantis ], weaving the texture of his good 
from both, his condition is perfect, and he has found the 
consummation of his prayers, if there is no commotion in his 
soul or pain in his body .” 11 

Taking care of one’s soul was a precept that Zeno had given 
his disciples from the beginning, and one Musonius was to 
repeat, in the first century, in a sentence quoted by Plutarch: 
“He who wishes to come through life safe and sound must 
continue throughout his life to take care of himself .” 12 The 
fullness assumed, in Seneca, by the theme of application of 
oneself to oneself is well known: it is to this activity, according 
to him, that a man must devote himself, to the exclusion of 
other occupations.He will thus be able to make himself vacant 
for himself (sibi vacare).
