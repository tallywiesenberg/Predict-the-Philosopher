This is where the basic difference between him and other 
creatures resides.The animals find “ready prepared” that 
which they need in order to live, for nature has so arranged 
things that animals are at our disposal without their having to 
look after themselves, and without our having to look after 
them .17 Man, on the other hand, must attend to himself: not, 
however, as a consequence of some defect that would put him 
in a situation of need and make him in this respect inferior to 
the animals, but because the god [Zeus] deemed it right that 
he be able to make free use of himself; and it was for this 
purpose that he endowed him with reason.The latter is not 
to be understood as a substitute for natural faculties that 
might be lacking; on the contrary it is the faculty that enables 
one to use, at the right time and in the right way, the other 
faculties.In fact, it is this absolutely singular faculty that is 
capable of making use of itself, for it is capable of “contem¬ 
plating both itself and everything else .” 18 By crowning with 
this reasoning faculty all that is already given to us by nature, 
Zeus gave us the possibility and the duty to take care of 
ourselves.
