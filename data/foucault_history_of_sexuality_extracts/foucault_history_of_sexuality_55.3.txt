Apuleius points out that one can, without 
shame or dishonor, ignore the rules that make it possible to 
paint and to play the zither, but to know how “to perfect one’s 
own soul with the help of reason” is a rule “equally necessary 
for all men.” The case of Pliny can serve as a concrete example 
in this regard: aloof from all strict doctrinal adherences, lead¬ 
ing a regular career replete with honors, absorbed by his ac¬ 
tivities as a lawyer, he is not on the point of breaking his ties 
to society—far from it.And yet, throughout his life he does 
not cease to speak of the care he intends to devote to himself 
as perhaps the most important matter with which he could be 
concerned.When, as a very young man still, he is sent to Syria 
to do military service, his first thought is to visit with Euphra¬ 
tes, not just to hear his lectures, but little by little to get to 
know him, “win his affection,” and benefit from the admoni¬ 
tions of a master who knows how to go after faults without 
attacking individuals .21 And later, in Rome, when he has occa¬ 
sion to take a period of rest in his villa at Laurentum, it is in 
order to be able to attend to himself, “reading and writing and 
finding time to take the exercise which keeps my mind fit,” 
and “sharing my thoughts with no one but my own writ¬ 
ings .” 22 

Hence there is no right age for attending to oneself.“It is 
never too early nor too late to care for the well-being of the 
soul,” to quote Epicurus again.
