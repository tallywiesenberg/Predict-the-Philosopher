Sere- 
nus, to whom the moral essay De tranquilitate is addressed (in 
addition to the De constantia and perhaps the De otio ) is a 
young relative under Seneca’s protection, but nothing like a 
boy pursuing his studies.At the time of the writing of De 
tranquilitate, he is a provincial who has just arrived in Rome, 
and who is still trying to decide on a career and a way of life; 
but he already has behind him a certain philosophical itiner¬ 
ary.His perplexity relates essentially to the way in which he 
might bring it to a conclusion.As for Lucilius, apparently he 
was only a few years younger than Seneca.He is procurator 
in Sicily when, starting in 62, they exchange the intimate 
correspondence in which Seneca reveals to him the principles 
and practices of his wisdom, tells him of his own weaknesses 
and his still unfinished battles, and occasionally even asks for 
his help.
