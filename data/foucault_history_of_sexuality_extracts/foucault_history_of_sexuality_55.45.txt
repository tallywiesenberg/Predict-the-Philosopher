Nor is he embarrassed to tell him that when more 
than sixty years old, he himself went to hear the lectures of 
Metronax.25 The correspondents to whom Plutarch addresses 
his treatises—which are not just general considerations on 
virtues and faults, on the happiness of the soul and the misfor¬ 
tunes of life, but advice on conduct, often in reference to very 
specific circumstances—are men as well.This extreme eagerness of adults to look after their souls, 
the zeal with which, like schoolboys grown old, they sought 
out philosophers so that they might be shown the way to 
happiness, irritated Lucian, and many others with him.He 
makes fun of Hermotimus, who is seen muttering lessons in 
the street, lessons he must not forget.Hermotimus is no longer 
a young man, however: it has been twenty years already since 
he decided no longer to mingle his life with that of unfortunate 
humans, and he estimates that it will take him another twenty 
years to reach the state of bliss.
