the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are 
waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire popula¬ 
tions are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in 
the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is 
as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that 
so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, 
causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that 
closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them 
to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision 
that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in 
fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. 
The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: 
the power to expose a whole population to death is the 
underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s con¬ 
tinued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of bat¬ 
tle—that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on 
living—has become the principle that defines the strategy of 
states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical 
existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence 
of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern 
powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient 
right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at 
the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale 
phenomena of population. 

On another level, I might have taken up the example of the 
death penalty. Together with war, it was for a long time the 
other form of the right of the sword; it constituted the reply 
of the sovereign to those who attacked his will, his law, or

fewer, in contrast to those who died in wars. But it was for 
the same reasons that the latter became more numerous and 
the former more and more rare. As soon as power gave itself 
the function of administering life, its reason for being and the 
logic of its exercise—and not the awakening of humanitarian 
feelings—made it more and more difficult to apply the death 
penalty. How could power exercise its highest prerogatives 
by putting people to death, when its main role was to ensure, 
sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order? For such 
a power, execution was at the same time a limit, a scandal, 
and a contradiction. Hence capital punishment could not be
