It is possible too, in the middle or at the 
end of one’s career, to unburden oneself of these activities and, 
taking advantage of these declining years when desires are 
calmed, give oneself up entirely—like Seneca in his philosoph¬ 
ical work or Spurrina in the tranquillity of a pleasant exis¬ 
tence 31 —to the possession of oneself.This time is not empty; it is filled with exercises, practical 
tasks, various activities.Taking care of oneself is not a rest 
cure.There is the care of the body to consider, health regi¬ 
mens, physical exercises without overexertion, the carefully 
measured satisfaction of needs.There are the meditations, the 
readings, the notes that one takes on books or on the conversa¬ 
tions one has heard, notes that one reads again later, the 
recollection of truths that one knows already but that need to 
be more fully adapted to one’s own life.
