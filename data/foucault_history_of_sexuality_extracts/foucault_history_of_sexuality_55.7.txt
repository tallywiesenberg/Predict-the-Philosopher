Marcus Aurelius thus 
gives an example of “a retreat within oneself”: it is a sustained 
effort in which general principles are reactivated and argu¬ 
ments are adduced that persuade one not to let oneself become 
angry at others, at providence, or at things.32 There are also 
the talks that one has with a confidant, with friends, with a 
guide or director.Add to this the correspondence in which one 
reveals the state of one’s soul, solicits advice, gives advice to 
anyone who needs it—which for that matter constitutes a 
beneficial exercise for the giver, who is called the preceptor, 
because he thereby reactualizes it for himself.33 Around the 
care of the self, there developed an entire activity of speaking 
and writing in which the work of oneself on oneself and com¬ 
munication with others were linked together.Here we touch on one of the most important aspects of this 
activity devoted to oneself: it constituted, not an exercise in 
solitude, but a true social practice.
