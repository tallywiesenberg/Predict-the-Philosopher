He had several categories of students: some were there 
for only a short stay; others would remain longer in order to 
prepare for the life of an ordinary citizen or even for important 
activities; and finally a few others, who intended to become 
professional philosophers themselves, were there to be trained 
in the rules and practices of spiritual direction.35 One also 
found—particularly in Rome, in aristocratic circles—the 
practice of the private consultant who served in a family or a 
group as a life counselor, a political adviser, a potential inter¬ 
mediary in a negotiation: “Some wealthy Romans found it 
useful to keep a philosopher, and men of distinction did not 
find the position humiliating.They expected to be able to give 
moral advice and comfort to their patrons and their families, 
while their patrons could draw strength from their ap¬ 
proval.” 36 Thus Demetrius was the spiritual guide of Thrasea 
Paetus, who had him participate in the staging of his suicide, 
so that he might in this final moment help him give his life its 
finest and most accomplished form.Furthermore, these differ¬ 
ent functions of professor, guide, adviser, and personal confi¬ 
dant were not always distinct—far from it: in the practice of 
the cultivation of the self, the roles were often interchangeable, 
and they could be played in turn by the same person.Musonius Rufus had been the political adviser of Rubellius 
Plautus; in the exile that followed the latter’s death, he drew 
visitors and loyal supporters around him and held a kind of 
school.
