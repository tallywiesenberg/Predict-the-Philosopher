37 But it is some¬ 
times the case, too, that the interplay of the care of the self and 
the help of the other blends into preexisting relations, giving 
them a new coloration and a greater warmth.The care of the 
self—or the attention one devotes to the care that others 
should take of themselves—appears then as an intensification 
of social relations.Seneca addresses a letter of consolation to 
his mother, during the period when he is in exile, in order to 
help her support his present misfortune, and perhaps greater 
misfortunes in the future.The Serenus to whom he addresses 
the long moral essay on tranquillity of mind is a young provin¬ 
cial relative whom he has under his protection.His correspon¬ 
dence with Lucilius deepens a preexisting relationship 
between the two men, who are not separated by a very great 
difference in age, and tends little by little to transform this 
spiritual guidance into a shared experience, from which each 
derives a benefit for himself.
