39 They do in fact draw on a shared set of notions, 
whose central element is the concept of “pathos.” It applies 
to passion as well as to physical illness, to the distress of the 
body and to the involuntary movement of the soul; and in both 
cases alike, it refers to a state of passivity, which for the body 
takes the form of a disorder that upsets the balance of its 
humors or its qualities and which for the soul takes the form 
of a movement capable of carrying it away in spite of itself.On the basis of this shared concept, it was possible to con¬ 
struct a grid of analysis that was valid for the ailments of the 
body and the soul.For example, there was the schema pro¬ 
posed by the Stoics, which determines the degrees of develop¬ 
ment and the chronicity of diseases.The first distinction made 
in this schema is the predisposition to disease, the proclivitas 
that exposes one to the possible illnesses.Next there is the 
affection, the disorder, which in Greek is called pathos and in 
Latin affectus; then the illness (nosema, morbus) that is estab¬ 
lished and declared when the disorder has taken hold of the 
body and the soul.
