maintained except by invoking less the enormity of the crime 
itself than the monstrosity of the criminal, his incorrigibility, 
and the safeguard of society. One had the right to kill those 
who represented a kind of biological danger to others. 

One might say that the ancient right to take life or let live 
was replaced by a power to foster life or disallow it to the 
point of death. This is perhaps what explains that disqualifi¬ 
cation of death which marks the recent wane of the rituals 
that accompanied it. That death is so carefully evaded is 
linked less to a new anxiety which makes death unbearable 
for our societies than to the fact that the procedures of power 
have not ceased to turn away from death. In the passage from 
this world to the other, death was the manner in which a 
terrestrial sovereignty was relieved by another, singularly 
more powerful sovereignty; the pageantry that surrounded it 
was in the category of political ceremony. Now it is over life, 
throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its domin¬ 
ion; death is power’s limit, the moment that escapes it; death 
becomes the most secret aspect of existence, the most “pri¬ 
vate.” It is not surprising that suicide—once a crime, since 
it was a way to usurp the power of death which the sovereign 
alone, whether the one here below or the Lord above, had the 
right to exercise—became, in the course of the nineteenth 
century, one of the first conducts to enter into the sphere of 



Right of Death and Power over Life

sociological analysis; it testified to the individual and private 
right to die, at the borders and in the interstices of power that 
was exercised over life. This determination to die, strange 
and yet so persistent and constant in its manifestations, and 
consequently so difficult to explain as being due to particular 
circumstances or individual accidents, was one of the first 
astonishments of a society in which political power had as¬ 
signed itself the task of administering life. 

In concrete terms, starting in the seventeenth century, this 
power over life evolved in two basic forms; these forms were 
not antithetical, however; they constituted rather two poles 
of development linked together by a whole intermediary 
cluster of relations. One of these poles—the first to be 
formed, it seems—centered on the body as a machine: its 
disciplining, the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion 
of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its 
docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic 
controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power that 
characterized the disciplines: an anatomo-politics of the 
human body. The second, formed somewhat later, focused 
on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of 
life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propa¬ 
gation, births and mortality, the level of health, life expect¬ 
ancy and longevity, with all the conditions that can cause 
these to vary. Their supervision was effected through an 
entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a bio¬ 
politics of the population. The disciplines of the body and the 
regulations of the population constituted the two poles 
around which the organization of power over life was de¬ 
ployed. The setting up, in the course of the classical age, of 
this great bipolar technology—anatomic and biological, in¬ 
dividualizing and specifying, directed toward the perfor¬ 
mances of the body, with attention to the processes of life— 
characterized a power whose highest function was perhaps 
no longer to kill, but to invest life through and through. 

The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power

was now carefully supplanted by the administration of bodies 
and the calculated management of life. During the classical 
period, there was a rapid development of various disciplines 
—universities, secondary schools, barracks, workshops; 
there was also the emergence, in the field of political prac¬ 
tices and economic observation, of the problems of birthrate, 
longevity, public health, housing, and migration. Hence 
there was an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques 
for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of 
populations, marking the beginning of an era of “bio¬ 
power.” The two directions taken by its development still 
appeared to be clearly separate in the eighteenth century. 
With regard to discipline, this development was embodied in 
institutions such as the army and the schools, and in reflec¬ 
tions on tactics, apprenticeship, education, and the nature of 
societies, ranging from the strictly military analyses of Mar¬ 
shal de Saxe to the political reveries of Guibert or Servan. As 
for population controls, one notes the emergence of demog¬ 
raphy, the evaluation of the relationship between resources
