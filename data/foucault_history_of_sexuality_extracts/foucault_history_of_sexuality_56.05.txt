More serious, more lasting, is the aegrotatio 
or arrhostema that constitutes a state of sickness and debility.Finally, there is the inveterate disease (kakia, aegrotatio in-

affections; and there are those who have recovered their health 
but are still frail because their predispositions have not been

therapeutics of the soul.
