Moreover, “both are commonly called 
errors in a generic sense.” 44 Thus he undertakes to cure a 
traveling companion who was too easily disposed to lose his 
temper.Or again, he grants the request of a young man he 
knew who had come one day to ask him for medical advice: 
the young man had in fact imagined himself to be immune to 
the agitation of the passions, however minor they might be; 
but he had been obliged to recognize that he was more trou¬ 
bled by matters of no importance than was his teacher Galen 
by momentous ones, so he came to him for help.45 

The increased medical involvement in the cultivation of the 
self appears to have been expressed through a particular and 
intense form of attention to the body.This attention is very 
different from that manifested by the positive valuation of 
physical vigor during an epoch when gymnastics and athletic 
and military training were an integral part of the education of 
a free man.Moreover, it has something paradoxical about it 
since it is inscribed, at least in part, within an ethics that posits 
that death, disease, or even physical suffering do not constitute 
true ills and that it is better to take pains over one’s soul than 
to devote one’s care to the maintenance of the body.
