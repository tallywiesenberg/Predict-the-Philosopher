They bring one 
back, momentarily, to the basic needs, revealing in this man¬ 
ner the actual basis of all that is superfluous and the possibility 
of doing without it.In Socrates' Daemon, Plutarch reports on 
a test of this kind, the value of which is affirmed by the 
character in the dialogue who represents the themes of neo- 
Pythagoreanism.One began by whetting the appetite through 
the practice of some sport; next one placed oneself in front of 
tables laden with the most succulent dishes; then, having 
gazed on these, one left them to the servants and made do with 
the kind of food that slaves ate.51 

Exercises in abstinence were common to the Epicureans 
and the Stoics, but this training did not have the same mean¬ 
ing for both groups.In the tradition of Epicurus, it was a 
matter of showing how, in this satisfaction of the most ele¬ 
mentary needs, one could find a fuller, purer, more stable 
pleasure than in the delight one might take in all that is 
superfluous; and the test served to mark the threshold where 
privation could start to make one suffer.
