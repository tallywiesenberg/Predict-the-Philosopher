of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its 
docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic 
controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power that 
characterized the disciplines: an anatomo-politics of the 
human body. The second, formed somewhat later, focused 
on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of 
life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propa¬ 
gation, births and mortality, the level of health, life expect¬ 
ancy and longevity, with all the conditions that can cause 
these to vary. Their supervision was effected through an 
entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a bio¬ 
politics of the population. The disciplines of the body and the 
regulations of the population constituted the two poles 
around which the organization of power over life was de¬ 
ployed. The setting up, in the course of the classical age, of 
this great bipolar technology—anatomic and biological, in¬ 
dividualizing and specifying, directed toward the perfor¬ 
mances of the body, with attention to the processes of life— 
characterized a power whose highest function was perhaps 
no longer to kill, but to invest life through and through. 

The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power

was now carefully supplanted by the administration of bodies 
and the calculated management of life. During the classical 
period, there was a rapid development of various disciplines 
—universities, secondary schools, barracks, workshops; 
there was also the emergence, in the field of political prac¬ 
tices and economic observation, of the problems of birthrate, 
longevity, public health, housing, and migration. Hence 
there was an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques 
for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of 
populations, marking the beginning of an era of “bio¬ 
power.” The two directions taken by its development still 
appeared to be clearly separate in the eighteenth century. 
With regard to discipline, this development was embodied in 
institutions such as the army and the schools, and in reflec¬ 
tions on tactics, apprenticeship, education, and the nature of 
societies, ranging from the strictly military analyses of Mar¬ 
shal de Saxe to the political reveries of Guibert or Servan. As 
for population controls, one notes the emergence of demog¬ 
raphy, the evaluation of the relationship between resources
