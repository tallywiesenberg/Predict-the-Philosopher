On certain days, 
Epicurus, whose diet was extremely abstemious already, 
would take only a reduced ration in order to see how much 
his pleasure would be diminished.52 For the Stoics, it was 
primarily a matter of preparing oneself for possible priva¬ 
tions by discovering how easy it was, finally, to dispense 
with everything to which habit, opinion, education, attention 
to reputation, and the taste for ostentation have attached us.With these reductive tests, they wished to show that we can 
always have at our disposal those things that are strictly nec¬ 
essary, and that one should guard against the least apprehen¬ 
sion at the thought of possible privations: “In days of peace 
the soldier performs maneuvers, throws up earthworks with 
no enemy in sight, and wearies himself with gratuitous toil, 
in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil.If you 
would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train 
him before it comes.” 53 And Seneca alludes to a practice

which he also speaks of in another letter: brief training peri¬ 
ods of “fancied poverty” to be done every month and in the 
course of which, by voluntarily placing oneself “within the 
confines of destitution” for three or four days, one experi¬ 
ences a bed of straw, coarse clothing, and bread of the lowest 
quality: “not a game, but a test” (non lusus, sed experimen- 
tum ).54 One does not deprive oneself for a moment in order 
to sharpen one’s taste for future refinements but to convince 
oneself that the worst misfortune will not deprive one of the 
things one absolutely needs, and that one will always be able 
to tolerate what one is capable of enduring at times.
