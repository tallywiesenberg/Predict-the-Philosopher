makes oneself familiar with the minimum.This is what 
Seneca wishes to do according to a letter written a short 
time before the Saturnalia of the year 62.Rome is “in a 
sweat” and “licentiousness is officially sanctioned.” Seneca 
asks himself if one ought to take part in the festivities or not; 
it would be proof of one’s self-control if one broke with the 
general attitude and refrained.But one would be acting with 
a still greater moral force if one did not withdraw oneself; 
the best thing would be “to do what the crowd does, but in 
a different way.” And this “different way” is the way that 
one learns ahead of time by means of voluntary exercises, 
periods of abstinence, and poverty treatments.These exer¬ 
cises make it possible to celebrate the festival like everyone 
else but without ever falling into luxuria.
