In what respect are you better?” Seneca, too, 
undertakes an examination of this kind every evening.Dark¬ 
ness—“when the light has been removed from sight”—and 
quiet—“when my wife has become silent”—are its external 
conditions.And he is mindful of the need to prepare for a 
blissful sleep: “Can anything be more excellent than this prac¬ 
tice of thoroughly sifting the whole day?And how delightful 
the sleep that follows this self-examination—how tranquil [ 
tranquillus ], how deep [ altus] and untroubled [liber], when 
the soul has either praised or admonished itself.” At first 
glance, the examination to which Seneca subjects himself ap¬ 
pears to constitute a sort of small-scale judicial drama, which 
is clearly evoked by such phrases as “appear before the judge,” 
“give report of my own character,” “plead my cause.” These 
elements seem to indicate the division of the subject into a 
judging authority and an accused individual.But the process 
as a whole also calls to mind a kind of administrative review, 
where it is a matter of evaluating a performed activity in order 
to reactivate its principles and ensure their correct application 
in the future.
