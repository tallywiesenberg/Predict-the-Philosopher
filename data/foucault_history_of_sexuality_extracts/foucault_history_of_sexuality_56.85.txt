Further, the examination practiced in 
this manner does not focus, as if in imitation of the judicial 
procedure, on “infractions”; and it does not lead to a verdict 
of guilty or to decisions of self-castigation.Seneca, in the 
example he gives here, singles out such actions as arguing too 
intensely with ignorant people, whom one cannot convince in 
any case, or vexing, through reproaches, a friend whom one 
would have liked to help improve.Seneca is dissatisfied with 
these ways of behaving insofar as, in order to achieve the goals 
that one must in fact set for oneself, the means employed were 
not the right ones: it is good to want to correct one’s friends, 
if need be, but reproof is too extreme and gives offense instead 
of helping; it is good to convince those who don’t know, but 
it is necessary first to choose such people as are capable of 
being taught.The purpose of the examination is not therefore 
to discover one’s own guilt, down to its most trifling forms and 
its most tenuous roots.If one “conceals nothing from oneself,” 
if one “omits nothing,” it is in order to commit to memory, 
so as to have them present in one’s mind, legitimate ends, but 
also rules of conduct that enable one to achieve these ends 
through the choice of appropriate means.
