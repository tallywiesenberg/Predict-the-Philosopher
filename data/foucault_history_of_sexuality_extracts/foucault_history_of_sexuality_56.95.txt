He asks that one adopt, 
vis-a-vis oneself, the role and posture of a “night watchman” 
who checks the entries at the gate of cities or houses; 60 or 
further, he suggests that one exercise on oneself the functions 
of a “tester of coinage,” an “assayer,” one of those money¬ 
changers who won’t accept any coin without having made 
sure of its worth: “You all see in the matter of coinage ... how 
we have even invented an art, and how many means the tester 
employs to test the coinage—sight, touch, smell, finally hear¬ 
ing: he throws the denarius down and then listens to the sound 
and is not satisfied with the sound it makes on a single test, 
but, as a result of his constant attention to the matter, he 
catches the tune, like a musician.” Unfortunately, Epictetus 
continues, these precautions that we willingly take when it 
is a matter of money, we neglect to take when it is a question 
of our soul.Now the task of philosophy—its principal and 
primary ergon —will be precisely to exercise this control 
(dokimazein ).61 

In order to formulate what is both a general principle and 
an attitudinal schema, Epictetus refers to Socrates and to the 
aphorism stated in the Apology: “An unexamined life [ anex- 
etastos bios] is not worth living.” 62 In reality, the examination 
Socrates was talking about was the one to which he intended 
to subject both himself and others apropos of ignorance, 
knowledge, and the non-knowledge of this ignorance.The 
examination Epictetus talks about is completely different: it is 
an examination that deals with representations, that aims to 
“test” them, to “distinguish” (diakrinein) one from another 
and thus to prevent one from accepting the “first arrival.” 
“We ought not to accept a mental representation unsubjected 
to examination, but should say, ‘Wait, allow me to see who

you are and whence you came’ (just as the night-watch say, 
‘Show me your tokens’).‘Do you have your token from na¬ 
ture, the one which every representation which is to be ac¬ 
cepted must have?’ ” 63 However, it should be made clear that 
the control point will not be located in the origin or in the very 
object of the representation, but in the approval that one 
should or should not give to it.
