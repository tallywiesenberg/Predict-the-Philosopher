and its circulation: the work of Quesnay, Moheau, and Siiss- 
milch. The philosophy of the “Ideologists,” as a theory of 
ideas, signs, and the individual genesis of sensations, but also 
a theory of the social composition of interests—Ideology 
being a doctrine of apprenticeship, but also a doctrine of 
contracts and the regulated formation of the social body— 
no doubt constituted the abstract discourse in which one 
sought to coordinate these two techniques of power in order 
to construct a general theory of it. In point of fact, however, 
they were not to be joined at the level of a speculative 
discourse, but in the form of concrete arrangements (agence- 
ments concrets) that would go to make up the great technol¬ 
ogy of power in the nineteenth century: the deployment of 
sexuality would be one of them, and one of the most impor¬

have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies 
into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the 
phenomena of population to economic processes. But this 
was not all it required; it also needed the growth of both these 
factors, their reinforcement as well as their availability and 
docility; it had to have methods of power capable of optimiz¬ 
ing forces, aptitudes, and life in general without at the same 
time making them more difficult to govern. If the develop¬ 
ment of the great instruments of the state, as institutions of 
power, ensured the maintenance of production relations, the 
rudiments of anatomo- and bio-politics, created in the eigh¬ 
teenth century as techniques of power present at every level 
of the social body and utilized by very diverse institutions 
(the family and the army, schools and the police, individual 
medicine and the administration of collective bodies), ope¬ 
rated in the sphere of economic processes, their development, 
and the forces working to sustain them. They also acted as 
factors of segregation and social hierarchization, exerting 
their influence on the respective forces of both these move¬ 
ments, guaranteeing relations of domination and effects of 
hegemony. The adjustment of the accumulation of men to 
that of capital, the joining of the growth of human groups to
