and inhabitants, the constructing of tables analyzing wealth 
and its circulation: the work of Quesnay, Moheau, and Siiss- 
milch. The philosophy of the “Ideologists,” as a theory of 
ideas, signs, and the individual genesis of sensations, but also 
a theory of the social composition of interests—Ideology 
being a doctrine of apprenticeship, but also a doctrine of 
contracts and the regulated formation of the social body— 
no doubt constituted the abstract discourse in which one 
sought to coordinate these two techniques of power in order 
to construct a general theory of it. In point of fact, however, 
they were not to be joined at the level of a speculative 
discourse, but in the form of concrete arrangements (agence- 
ments concrets) that would go to make up the great technol¬ 
ogy of power in the nineteenth century: the deployment of 
sexuality would be one of them, and one of the most impor¬ 
tant. 

This bio-power was without question an indispensable ele-

ment in the development of capitalism; the latter would not 
have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies 
into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the 
phenomena of population to economic processes. But this 
was not all it required; it also needed the growth of both these 
factors, their reinforcement as well as their availability and 
docility; it had to have methods of power capable of optimiz¬ 
ing forces, aptitudes, and life in general without at the same 
time making them more difficult to govern. If the develop¬ 
ment of the great instruments of the state, as institutions of 
power, ensured the maintenance of production relations, the 
rudiments of anatomo- and bio-politics, created in the eigh¬ 
teenth century as techniques of power present at every level 
of the social body and utilized by very diverse institutions 
(the family and the army, schools and the police, individual 
medicine and the administration of collective bodies), ope¬ 
rated in the sphere of economic processes, their development, 
and the forces working to sustain them. They also acted as 
factors of segregation and social hierarchization, exerting 
their influence on the respective forces of both these move¬ 
ments, guaranteeing relations of domination and effects of 
hegemony. The adjustment of the accumulation of men to 
that of capital, the joining of the growth of human groups to 
the expansion of productive forces and the differential alloca¬ 
tion of profit, were made possible in part by the exercise of 
bio-power in its many forms and modes of application. The 
investment of the body, its valorization, and the distributive 
management of its forces were at the time indispensable. 

One knows how many times the question has been raised 
concerning the role of an ascetic morality in the first forma¬ 
tion of capitalism; but what occurred in the eighteenth cen¬ 
tury in some Western countries, an event bound up with the 
development of capitalism, was a different phenomenon hav¬ 
ing perhaps a wider impact than the new morality; this was 
nothing less than the entry of life into history, that is, the 
entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species

into the order of knowledge and power, into the sphere of 
political techniques. It is not a question of claiming that this 
was the moment when the first contact between life and 
history was brought about. On the contrary, the pressure 
exerted by the biological on the historical had remained very 
strong for thousands of years; epidemics and famine were the 
two great dramatic forms of this relationship that was always 
dominated by the menace of death. But through a circular 
process, the economic—and primarily agricultural—devel¬ 
opment of the eighteenth century, and an increase in produc¬ 
tivity and resources even more rapid than the demographic 
growth it encouraged, allowed a measure of relief from these 
profound threats: despite some renewed outbreaks, the pe¬ 
riod of great ravages from starvation and plague had come 
to a close before the French Revolution; death was ceasing 
to torment life so directly. But at the same time, the develop¬ 
ment of the different fields of knowledge concerned with life 
in general, the improvement of agricultural techniques, and 
the observations and measures relative to man’s life and 
survival contributed to this relaxation: a relative control over 
life averted some of the imminent risks of death. In the space 
for movement thus conquered, and broadening and organiz¬ 
ing that space, methods of power and knowledge assumed 
responsibility for the life processes and undertook to control 
and modify them. Western man was gradually learning what 
it meant to be a living species in a living world, to have a 
body, conditions of existence, probabilities of life, an individ¬
