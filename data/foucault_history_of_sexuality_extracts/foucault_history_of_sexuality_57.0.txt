When a representation enters 
the mind, the work of discrimination, of diakrisis, will consist 
in applying to it the famous Stoic canon that marks the divi¬ 
sion between that which does not depend on us and that which 
does.In the former case, the representations will not be ac¬ 
cepted since they are beyond our understanding; they will be 
rejected as not being appropriate objects of “desire” or “aver¬ 
sion,” of “attraction” or “repulsion.” This inspection is a test 
of power and a guarantee of freedom: a way of always making 
sure that one will not become attached to that which does not 
come under our control.To keep constant watch over one’s 
representations, or to verify their marks the way one authenti¬ 
cates a currency, is not to inquire (as will be done later in 
Christianity) concerning the deep origin of the idea that pre¬ 
sents itself; it is not to try and decipher a meaning hidden 
beneath the visible representation; it is to assess the relation¬ 
ship between oneself and that which is represented, so as to 
accept in the relation to the self only that which can depend 
on the subject’s free and rational choice.5.The common goal of these practices of the self, allowing 
for the differences they present, can be characterized by the 
entirely general principle of conversion to self—of epistrophe 
eis heauton.
