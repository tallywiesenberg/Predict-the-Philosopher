61 But apart from this 
rather political and judicial form, the relation to self is also 
defined as a concrete relationship enabling one to delight in 
oneself, as in a thing one both possesses and has before one’s 
eyes.If to convert to oneself is to turn away from the preoccu¬ 
pations of the external world, from the concerns of ambition,

from fear of the future, then one can turn back to one’s own 
past, recall it to mind, have it unfold as one pleases before 
one’s own eyes, and have a relationship with it that nothing 
can disturb: “This is the part of our time that is sacred and 
set apart, put beyond the reach of all human mishaps, and 
removed from the dominion of fortune, the part which is 
disquieted by no want, by no fear, by no attack of disease; this 
can neither be troubled nor snatched away—it is an everlast¬ 
ing and unanxious possession.” 48 And the experience of self 
that forms itself in this possession is not simply that of a force 
overcome, or a rule exercised over a power that is on the point 
of rebelling; it is the experience of a pleasure that one takes 
in oneself.The individual who has finally succeeded in gaining 
access to himself is, for himself, an object of pleasure.Not only 
is one satisfied with what one is and accepting of one’s limits, 
but one “pleases oneself.” 69 This pleasure, for which Seneca 
usually employs the word gaudium or laetitia, is a state that 
is neither accompanied nor followed by any form of distur¬ 
bance in the body or the mind.It is defined by the fact of not 
being caused by anything that is independent of ourselves and 
therefore escapes our control.
