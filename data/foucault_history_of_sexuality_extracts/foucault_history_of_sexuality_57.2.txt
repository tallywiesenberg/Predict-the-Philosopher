It arises out of ourselves and 
within ourselves.70 It is characterized as well by the fact that 
it knows neither degree nor change, but is given as a “woven 
fabric,” and once given no external event can rend it.71 This 
sort of pleasure can thus be contrasted point by point with 
what is meant by the term voluptas.The latter denotes a 
pleasure whose origin is to be placed outside us and in objects 
whose presence we cannot be sure of: a pleasure, therefore, 
which is precarious in itself, undermined by the fear of loss, 
and to which we are drawn by the force of a desire that may 
or may not find satisfaction.In place of this kind of violent, 
uncertain, and conditional pleasure, access to self is capable 
of providing a form of pleasure that comes, in serenity and 
without fail, of the experience of oneself.
