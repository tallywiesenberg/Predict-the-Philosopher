But what do I mean by 
‘your own store’?I mean your very self and the best part of 
you.” 72 

It was against the background of this cultivation of the self, 
of its themes and practices, that reflection on the ethics of 
pleasure developed in the first centuries of our era.It is in that 
direction that one must look in order to understand the trans¬ 
formations that may have affected that ethics.What may be 
regarded, at first sight, as a more pronounced severity, an 
increased austerity, stricter requirements, should not in fact be 
interpreted as a tightening of interdictions.The domain of 
behaviors that might be forbidden did not expand to any 
appreciable extent, and there was no attempt to organize sys¬ 
tems of prohibition that would be more authoritarian and 
efficacious.
