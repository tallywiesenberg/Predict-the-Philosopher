The change had much more to do with the manner 
in which the individual needed to form himself as an ethical 
subject.The development of the cultivation of the self pro¬ 
duced its effect not in the strengthening of that which can 
thwart desire, but in certain modifications relating to the 
formative elements of ethical subjectivity.A break with the 
traditional ethics of self-mastery?Clearly not, but rather a 
shift, a change of orientation, a difference in emphasis.Sexual pleasure as an ethical substance continues to be gov¬ 
erned by relations of force—the force against which one must 
struggle and over which the subject is expected to establish his 
domination.
