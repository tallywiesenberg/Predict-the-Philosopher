Lastly, the end result of this elaboration is still and always 
defined by the rule of the individual over himself.But this rule 
broadens into an experience in which the relation to self takes 
the form not only of a domination but also of an enjoyment 
without desire and without disturbance.One is still far from an experience of sexual pleasure where 
the latter will be associated with evil, where behavior will have 
to submit to the universal form of law, and where the deci¬ 
phering of desire will be a necessary condition for acceding to 
a purified existence.Yet one can already see how the question 
of evil begins to work upon the ancient theme of force, how 
the question of law begins to modify the theme of art and 
techne, and how the question of truth and the principle of 
self-knowledge evolve within the ascetic practices.But we 
need first to try to discover in what context and for what 
reasons the cultivation of the self developed in this way, pre¬ 
cisely in the form that we have just considered.
