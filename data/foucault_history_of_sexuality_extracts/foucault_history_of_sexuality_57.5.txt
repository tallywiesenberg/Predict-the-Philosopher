PART THREE 

Self and Others 




The work of historians suggests several reasons for this 
development of the cultivation of the self and for the concur¬ 
rent modulation in the ethics of pleasure.Two factors seem 
especially important: changes in marital practice and modifi¬ 
cations in the rules of the political game.In this brief section, 
I shall simply review some aspects of these two themes, bor¬ 
rowing from previous historical research, and outline a tenta¬ 
tive general hypothesis.Is it not the case that the new 
importance of marriage and the couple, together with a certain 
redistribution in political roles, gave rise, in what was essen¬ 
tially a male ethics, to a new problematization of the relation 
to the self?These developments may very well have occa¬ 
sioned, not a withdrawal into the self, but a new way of 
conceiving oneself in one’s relation to one’s wife, to others, to 
events, and to civic and political activities—and a different 
way of considering oneself as the subject of one’s pleasures.
