Hence the cultivation of the self would not be the necessary 
“consequence” of these social modifications; it would not be 
their expression in the sphere of ideology; rather, it would

The Marital Role 


It is difficult to determine, for the different regions and the 
different social strata, the actual extent of marital practice in 
Hellenistic or Roman civilization.Historians have been able, 
however, to identify—where the documentation makes this 
possible—certain transformations affecting either the insti¬ 
tutional forms, the organization of conjugal relationships, 
or the meaning and moral value that could be given to the 
latter.The institutional perspective first of all.As a private act, a 
matter for the family to decide, coming under its authority, 
under the rules it followed and recognized as its own, marriage 
did not call for intervention by public powers, either in Greece 
or in Rome.
