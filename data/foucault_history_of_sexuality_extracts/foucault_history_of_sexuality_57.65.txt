It thus overstepped the 
bounds of the family, with the paradoxical result that the 
authority of the latter found itself “publicly” sanctioned but 
also relatively limited.In Claude Vatin’s view, this evolution 
was aided by recourse to religious ceremonies, which served 
as a kind of intermediary between the private and the public 
institution.Summing up this transformation, whose results 
can be observed in the second and first centuries b.c., he 
writes: “It is clear that marriage has now gone beyond the 
limits of the familial institutions, and Alexandrian religious 
marriage, which is perhaps a vestige of the ancient religious 
marriage, is also a civic institution.It is always the entire city 
that sanctions marriage, whether this is through an official or 
a priest.” And comparing the data for the city of Alexandria 
with the data for rural society, he adds: “One sees in the 
chord and in the capital a rapid evolution, with variants, from 
a private into a public institution.” 4 

In Rome, one notes an evolution that is of the same general 
type, although it takes different paths and although marriage 
continues, until quite late, to be essentially “a private cere¬ 
mony, a celebration.” 5 A set of legislative measures marks 
little by little the hold of public authority on the marriage 
institution.The famous law de adulteriis is one of the manife¬ 
stations of this phenomenon.
