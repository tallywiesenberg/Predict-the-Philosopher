Marriage, when one did marry, corresponded to 
a private objective: to transmit the estate to one’s descendants, 
rather than to other members of the family or to the sons of 
friends; and it corresponded to a politics of castes: to perpetu¬ 
ate the caste of citizens.” 6 As John Boswell puts it, this was 
a kind of marriage which “for the upper classes was largely 
dynastic, political, and economic.” 7 As for the lower classes, 
as little informed as we are concerning their marital practice, 
we may suppose with S. B. Pomeroy that two contradictory 
factors were able to play a part, both of which were connected 
with the economic functions of marriage: the wife and chil¬ 
dren could form a useful source of labor for a free man who 
was poor.On the other hand, “there is an economic level below 
which a man may not hope to support a wife and family.” 8 

The economico-political imperatives that governed mar¬ 
riage (making it necessary in some cases, and in others, use¬ 
less) must have lost some of their importance when, in the 
privileged classes, status and fortune came to depend on prox¬ 
imity to the prince, on a civil or military “career,” on success 
in “business,” more than simply on the alliance between fam¬ 
ily groups.Less encumbered with various strategies, marriage 
became “freer”: free in the choice of a wife; free, too, in the 
decision to marry and in the personal reasons for doing so.It 
could be, too, that in the underprivileged classes, marriage 
became—beyond the economic motives that could make it 
attractive—a form of tie that owed its value to the fact that

it established and maintained strong personal relationships, 
implying the sharing of life, mutual aid, and moral support.In any case, the study of tomb inscriptions has been able to 
show the relative frequency and stability of marriages in mi¬ 
lieus that were not those of the aristocracy, 9 and we have 
statements attesting to the marriage of slaves.
