10 Whatever re¬ 
sponse is given to the question of the extent of marital practice, 
it seems that the latter became more accessible; the thresholds 
that made it “interesting” were lowered.Hence marriage appeared more and more as a voluntary 
union between two partners whose inequality diminished to a 
certain extent but did not cease to exist.It does seem that in 
the Hellenistic world, and taking many local differences into 
account, the wife’s status gained in independence compared 
with what it was in the classical period—and above all com¬ 
pared with the Athenian situation.This relative modification 
was due first of all to the fact that the position of the citizen- 
husband lost some of its political importance.It was also due 
to a strengthening of the role of the wife—of her economic role 
and her juridical independence.
