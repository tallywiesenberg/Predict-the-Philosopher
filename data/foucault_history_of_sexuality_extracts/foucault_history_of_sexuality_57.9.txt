According to some historians, 
the documents show that the intervention of the wife’s father 
became less and less decisive in marriage.“It was common for 
a father to give a daughter in marriage in his role of formal 
guardian, but some contracts were made simply between a 
woman and a man agreeing to share a common life.The right 
of the married daughter to self-determination against paternal 
authority began to be asserted.According to Athenian, Roman 
and Egyptian law, the authority of the father over a married 
daughter was curtailed by judicial rulings stating that the 
wishes of the woman were the determining factor.If she 
wished to remain married, she could do so.” 11 Marriage was 
concluded more and more clearly as a voluntary agreement 
entered into by the partners, who pledged themselves person¬ 
ally.
