ended up existing only in the case of written marriages, where 
it was supplemented by clauses relating to the persons.Not 
only did women receive their dowry, which they disposed of 
more and more freely within marriage, with certain contracts 
providing for restitution to them in case of divorce, but they 
also collected their share of inheritance.As for the obligations marriage contracts imposed on hus¬ 
bands, Claude Vatin’s study shows a significant evolution for 
Hellenistic Egypt.In documents dating from the end of the 
fourth century b.c.or from the third, the wife’s pledges im¬ 
plied obedience to the husband; prohibition from leaving the 
house, day or night, without the husband’s permission; exclu¬ 
sion of any sexual relations with another man; and the obliga¬ 
tion not to ruin the household and not to dishonor her 
husband.
