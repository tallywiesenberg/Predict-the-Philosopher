The latter in turn must support his wife, must not 
establish a concubine in the house, must not mistreat his wife, 
and must not have children from relationships he might main¬ 
tain on the outside.Later, the contracts studied specify much 
stricter obligations on the part of the husband.The obligation 
to provide for the needs of his wife is stipulated; but it is also 
expressly forbidden for him to have a mistress or sweetheart, 
and to own another house (in which he might maintain a 
concubine).As Vatin notes, in this type of contract “it is the 
sexual liberty of the husband that is in question; the woman 
will now be just as exclusive as the man.” Developed in this 
way, marriage contracts bring the husband and the wife into 
a system of duties or obligations that are not equal, certainly, 
but are shared.And this sharing occurs not in the name of the 
respect due to the family, which each of the two marriage 
partners represents, as it were, in the state of marriage, but on 
behalf of the couple, its stability and its internal regulation.
