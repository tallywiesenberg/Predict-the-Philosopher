ual and collective welfare, forces that could be modified, and 
a space in which they could be distributed in an optimal 
manner. For the first time in history, no doubt, biological 
existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living 
was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged 
from time to time, amid the randomness of death and its 
fatality; part of it passed into knowledge’s field of control and 
power’s sphere of intervention. Power would no longer be 
dealing simply with legal subjects over whom the ultimate

dominion was death, but with living beings, and the mastery 
it would be able to exercise over them would have to be 
applied at the level of life itself; it was the taking charge of 
life, more than the threat of death, that gave power its access 
even to the body. If one can apply the term bio-history to the 
pressures through which the movements of life and the proc¬ 
esses of history interfere with one another, one would have 
to speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its 
mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made 
knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life. 
It is not that life has been totally integrated into techniques 
that govern and administer it; it constantly escapes them. 
Outside the Western world, famine exists, on a greater scale 
than ever; and the biological risks confronting the species are 
perhaps greater, and certainly more serious, than before the 
birth of microbiology. But what might be called a society’s 
“threshold of modernity” has been reached when the life of 
the species is wagered on its own political strategies. For 
millennia, man remained what he was for Aristotle: a living 
animal with the additional capacity for a political existence; 
modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence 
as a living being in question. 

This transformation had considerable consequences. It 
would serve no purpose here to dwell on the rupture that 
occurred then in the pattern of scientific discourse and on the 
manner in which the twofold problematic of life and man 
disrupted and redistributed the order of the classical epis- 
teme. If the question of man was raised—insofar as he was 
a specific living being, and specifically related to other living 
beings—the reason for this is to be sought in the new mode 
of relation between history and life: in this dual position of 
life that placed it at the same time outside history, in its 
biological environment, and inside human historicity, pene¬ 
trated by the latter’s techniques of knowledge and power. 
There is no need either to lay further stress on the prolifera¬ 
tion of political technologies that ensued, investing the body,

health, modes of subsistence and habitation, living condi¬ 
tions, the whole space of existence. 

Another consequence of this development of bio-power 
was the growing importance assumed by the action of the 
norm, at the expense of the juridical system of the law. Law 
cannot help but but be armed, and its arm, par excellence, 
is death; to those who transgress it, it replies, at least as a last 
resort, with that absolute menace. The law always refers to 
the sword. But a power whose task is to take charge of life 
needs continuous regulatory and corrective mechanisms. It 
is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field 
of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of 
value and utility. Such a power has to qualify, measure, 
appraise, and hierarchize, rather than display itself in its 
murderous splendor; it does not have to draw the line that 
separates the enemies of the sovereign from his obedient 
subjects; it effects distributions around the norm. I do not 
mean to say that the law fades into the background or that 
the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather that 
the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the 
judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a con¬ 
tinuum of apparatuses (medical, administrative, and so on) 
whose functions are for the most part regulatory. A normal¬ 
izing society is the historical outcome of a technology of 
power centered on life. We have entered a phase of juridical 
regression in comparison with the pre-seventeenth-century 
societies we are acquainted with; we should not be deceived 
by all the Constitutions framed throughout the world since 
the French Revolution, the Codes written and revised, a 
whole continual and clamorous legislative activity: these 
were the forms that made an essentially normalizing power 
acceptable. 

Moreover, against this power that was still new in the 
nineteenth century, the forces that resisted relied for support
