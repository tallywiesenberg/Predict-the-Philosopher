In this way a new idea came into 
being: the couple composed of the master and mistress of the 
house .” 14 

So there were many paradoxes in the evolution of this mari¬ 
tal practice.It looked to public authority for its guarantees; 
and it became an increasingly important concern in private 
life.It threw off the economic and social purposes that had 
invested it with value; and at the same time it became a general 
practice.It became more and more restrictive for spouses, and 
gave rise at the same time to attitudes that were more and 
more favorable—as if the more it demanded, the more attrac¬ 
tive it became.It appears that marriage became more general 
as a practice, more public as an institution, more private as a 
mode of existence—a stronger force for binding conjugal part¬ 
ners and hence a more effective one for isolating the couple in 
a field of other social relations.
