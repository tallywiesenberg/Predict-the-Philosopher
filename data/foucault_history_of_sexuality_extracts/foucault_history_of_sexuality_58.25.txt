It is not, as we have seen, that matrimonial life according 
to the old schema excluded closeness and feeling between 
spouses.But it does seem that in the ideal set forth by Xeno¬ 
phon these feelings were tied directly (which did not rule out 
serious commitment or intensity) to the exercise of the hus¬ 
band’s status and to the authority granted to him.Rather 
paternal toward his young wife, Ischomachus patiently taught 
her what she had to do; and to the degree that she performed 
well in the role that went with her duties as mistress of the 
household, he had a respect and an affection for her that 
would not diminish to the end of their days.In the literature 
of the imperial epoch, one finds testimonies to a far more 
complex experience of marriage; and the search for an ethics 
of “conjugal honor” is clearly manifested in the reflection on 
the role of the husband, on the nature and form of the bond 
that attached him to his wife, on the interplay between a 
superiority at once natural and statutory and an affection that 
could extend to the point of need and dependence.It might be useful, then, to look at the image that Pliny, in 
certain of his letters, gives of himself as a “conjugal individ¬ 
ual,” and compare it with the portrait of that other good 
husband, Ischomachus.
