dresses to his wife bemoaning her absence, what is shown is

and docile spouse to witness his literary labors and his suc¬

to his wife and a physical desire so strong that he cannot keep 
from looking for her night and day even though she is no

awake most of the night thinking of you, and by day I find my

out with my friends’ lawsuits.You can judge then what a life 
I am leading, when I find my rest in work and distraction in 
troubles and anxiety .” 15 The formulas of this letter merit our 
attention.
