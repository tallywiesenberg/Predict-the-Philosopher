The specific character of a personal, intense, and 
affective conjugal relationship, which does not depend on sta¬ 
tus, marital authority, or household responsibility, is clearly 
evident.Love is carefully differentiated from the habitual 
sharing of existence, even if both rightfully contribute to mak¬ 
ing the presence of the wife precious and her absence painful.Moreover, Pliny avails himself of several of the traditionally 
acknowledged signs of amorous passion: the images that 
haunt the night, the involuntary comings and goings, the 
search for the lost object.Now, these behaviors that belong to 
the classic and negative image of passion are presented in a 
positive light; or rather, the husband’s suffering, the passion¬ 
ate movement in which he is taken up, the fact that he is ruled 
by his desire and his sorrow are offered as positive tokens of 
conjugal affection.Finally, between matrimonial life and pub¬ 
lic activity, Pliny suggests, not a common principle unifying 
the government of the household and authority over others, 
but a complex process of substitution and compensation: fail¬ 
ing to find at home the happiness that his wife provided him, 
he immerses himself in public affairs.
