life that placed it at the same time outside history, in its 
biological environment, and inside human historicity, pene¬ 
trated by the latter’s techniques of knowledge and power. 
There is no need either to lay further stress on the prolifera¬ 
tion of political technologies that ensued, investing the body,

health, modes of subsistence and habitation, living condi¬ 
tions, the whole space of existence. 

Another consequence of this development of bio-power 
was the growing importance assumed by the action of the 
norm, at the expense of the juridical system of the law. Law 
cannot help but but be armed, and its arm, par excellence, 
is death; to those who transgress it, it replies, at least as a last 
resort, with that absolute menace. The law always refers to 
the sword. But a power whose task is to take charge of life 
needs continuous regulatory and corrective mechanisms. It 
is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field 
of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of 
value and utility. Such a power has to qualify, measure, 
appraise, and hierarchize, rather than display itself in its 
murderous splendor; it does not have to draw the line that 
separates the enemies of the sovereign from his obedient 
subjects; it effects distributions around the norm. I do not 
mean to say that the law fades into the background or that 
the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather that 
the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the 
judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a con¬ 
tinuum of apparatuses (medical, administrative, and so on) 
whose functions are for the most part regulatory. A normal¬ 
izing society is the historical outcome of a technology of 
power centered on life. We have entered a phase of juridical 
regression in comparison with the pre-seventeenth-century 
societies we are acquainted with; we should not be deceived 
by all the Constitutions framed throughout the world since 
the French Revolution, the Codes written and revised, a 
whole continual and clamorous legislative activity: these 
were the forms that made an essentially normalizing power 
acceptable. 

Moreover, against this power that was still new in the 
nineteenth century, the forces that resisted relied for support
