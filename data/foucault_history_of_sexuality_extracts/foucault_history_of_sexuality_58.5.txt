The sincerity they 
display does not have the value of evidence.They are texts that 
go out of their way to proclaim an ideal of conjugality.They 
should be taken not as the reflection of a situation, but as the 
formulation of an exigency, and it is precisely on this account 
that they form part of reality.They show that marriage was 
interrogated as a mode of life whose value was not exclusively, 
nor perhaps even essentially, linked to the functioning of the 
oikos, but rather to a mode of relation between two partners.They also show that, in this linkage, the man had to regulate 
his conduct, not simply by virtue of status, privileges, and 
domestic functions, but also by virtue of a “relational role” 
with regard to his wife.
