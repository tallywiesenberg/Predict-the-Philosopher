City life, 
with its institutional rules, its interests at stake, its struggles, 
did not disappear as a result of the widening of the context in 
which it was inscribed, nor as a consequence of the develop¬ 
ment of a monarchical type of power.Apprehension before a 
universe become too vast and having lost its constituent com¬ 
munities could well be a feeling that has been imputed retro¬ 
spectively to the people of the Greco-Roman world.The 
Greeks of the Hellenistic period did not have to flee from “the 
cityless world of the great empires” for the very good reason 
that “Hellenism was a world of cities.” Furthermore, criticiz¬ 
ing the idea that philosophy constituted, after the collapse of 
the system of cities, “a shelter from the storm,” F. H. Sand- 
bach observes that, in the first place, “the city-state had never 
given security,” and second, “it remained the standard pri¬ 
mary form of social organization even after military power 
had passed into the hands of the great monarchies .” 2 

Rather than imagining a reduction or cessation of political 
activities through the effects of a centralized imperialism, one 
should think in terms of the organization of a complex space.Much vaster, much more discontinuous, much less closed 
than must have been the case for the small city-states, it was 
also more flexible, more differentiated, less rigidly hierarch¬ 
ized than would be the authoritarian and bureaucratic Empire 
that people would attempt to organize after the great crisis of 
the third century.It was a space in which the centers of power 
were multiple; in which the activities, the tensions, the con¬ 
flicts were numerous; in which they developed in several di¬ 
mensions; and in which the equilibria were obtained through
