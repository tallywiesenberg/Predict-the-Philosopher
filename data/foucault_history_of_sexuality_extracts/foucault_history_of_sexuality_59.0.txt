on the very thing it invested, that is, on life and man as a 
living being. Since the last century, the great struggles that

have challenged the general system of power were not guided 
hy the belief in a return to former rights, or by the age-old 
dream of a cycle of time or a Golden Age. One no longer 
aspired toward the coming of the emperor of the poor, or the 
kingdom of the latter days, or even the restoration of our 
imagined ancestral rights; what was demanded and what 
served as an objective was life, understood as the basic needs, 
man’s concrete essence, the realization of his potential, a 
plenitude of the possible. Whether or not it was Utopia that 
was wanted is of little importance; what we have seen has 
been a very real process of struggle; life as a political object 
was in a sense taken at face value and turned back against 
the system that was bent on controlling it. It was life more 
than the law that became the issue of political struggles, even 
if the latter were formulated through affirmations concerning 
rights. The “right” to life, to one’s body, to health, to happi¬ 
ness, to the satisfaction of needs, and beyond all the oppres¬ 
sions or “alienations,” the “right” to rediscover what one is 
and all that one can be, this “right”—which the classical 
juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending— 
was the political response to all these new procedures of 
power which did not derive, either, from the traditional right 
of sovereignty. 

This is the background that enables us to understand the 
importance assumed by sex as a political issue. It was at the 
pivot of the two axes along which developed the entire politi¬ 
cal technology of life. On the one hand it was tied to the 
disciplines of the body: the harnessing, intensification, and 
distribution of forces, the adjustment and economy of ener¬ 
gies. On the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of 
populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activ¬ 
ity. It fitted in both categories at once, giving rise to infinitesi¬ 
mal surveillances, permanent controls, extremely meticulous 
orderings of space, indeterminate medical or psychological 
examinations, to an entire micro-power concerned with the

body. But it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, 
statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire 
social body or at groups taken as a whole. Sex was a means 
of access both to the life of the body and the life of the 
species. It was employed as a standard for the disciplines and 
as a basis for regulations. This is why in the nineteenth 
century sexuality was sought out in the smallest details of 
individual existences; it was tracked down in behavior, pur¬ 
sued in dreams; it was suspected of underlying the least 
follies, it was traced back into the earliest years of childhood; 
it became the stamp of individuality—at the same time what 
enabled one to analyze the latter and what made it possible 
to master it. But one also sees it becoming the theme of 
political operations, economic interventions (through incite¬ 
ments to or curbs on procreation), and ideological campaigns 
for raising standards of morality and responsibility: it was 
put forward as the index of a society’s strength, revealing of 
both its political energy and its biological vigor. Spread out 
from one pole to the other of this technology of sex was a 
whole series of different tactics that combined in varying 
proportions the objective of disciplining the body and that of 
regulating populations. 

Whence the importance of the four great lines of attack 
along which the politics of sex advanced for two centuries. 
Each one was a way of combining disciplinary techniques 
with regulative methods. The first two rested on the require¬ 
ments of regulation, on a whole thematic of the species, 
descent, and collective welfare, in order to obtain results at 
the level of discipline; the sexualization of children was ac¬ 
complished in the form of a campaign for the health of the 
race (precocious sexuality was presented from the eighteenth 
century to the end of the nineteenth as an epidemic menace 
that risked compromising not only the future health of adults 
but the future of the entire society and species); the hysteriza- 
tion of women, which involved a thorough medicalization of 
their bodies and their sex, was carried out in the name of the
