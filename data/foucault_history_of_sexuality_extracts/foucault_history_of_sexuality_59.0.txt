on the very thing it invested, that is, on life and man as a 
living being. Since the last century, the great struggles that

have challenged the general system of power were not guided 
hy the belief in a return to former rights, or by the age-old 
dream of a cycle of time or a Golden Age. One no longer 
aspired toward the coming of the emperor of the poor, or the 
kingdom of the latter days, or even the restoration of our 
imagined ancestral rights; what was demanded and what 
served as an objective was life, understood as the basic needs, 
man’s concrete essence, the realization of his potential, a 
plenitude of the possible. Whether or not it was Utopia that 
was wanted is of little importance; what we have seen has 
been a very real process of struggle; life as a political object 
was in a sense taken at face value and turned back against 
the system that was bent on controlling it. It was life more 
than the law that became the issue of political struggles, even 
if the latter were formulated through affirmations concerning 
rights. The “right” to life, to one’s body, to health, to happi¬ 
ness, to the satisfaction of needs, and beyond all the oppres¬ 
sions or “alienations,” the “right” to rediscover what one is 
and all that one can be, this “right”—which the classical 
juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending— 
was the political response to all these new procedures of 
power which did not derive, either, from the traditional right 
of sovereignty. 

This is the background that enables us to understand the 
importance assumed by sex as a political issue. It was at the 
pivot of the two axes along which developed the entire politi¬ 
cal technology of life. On the one hand it was tied to the 
disciplines of the body: the harnessing, intensification, and 
distribution of forces, the adjustment and economy of ener¬ 
gies. On the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of 
populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activ¬ 
ity. It fitted in both categories at once, giving rise to infinitesi¬ 
mal surveillances, permanent controls, extremely meticulous 
orderings of space, indeterminate medical or psychological 
examinations, to an entire micro-power concerned with the
