One seeks to make oneself as adequate as possible to 
one’s own status by means of a set of signs and marks pertain¬ 
ing to physical bearing, clothing and accommodations, ges¬ 
tures of generosity and munificence, spending behavior, and so 
on.With regard to these behaviors by which one affirms one¬ 
self in the superiority one manifests over others, MacMullen 
has shown how common they were in the Roman aristocracy 
and the degree of exaggeration to which they could be carried.But at the opposite extreme one finds the attitude that con¬ 
sists, on the contrary, in defining what one is purely in relation 
to oneself.It is then a matter of forming and recognizing 
oneself as the subject of one’s own actions, not through a 
system of signs denoting power over others, but through a 
relation that depends as little as possible on status and its 
external forms, for this relation is fulfilled in the sovereignty 
that one exercises over oneself.To the new forms of the politi¬ 
cal game, and to the difficulties of conceiving oneself as an 
acting subject placed between birth and functions, tasks and 
rights, prerogatives and subordinations, one was able to re¬ 
spond by intensifying all the recognizable marks of status or 
by seeking an adequate relationship with oneself.
