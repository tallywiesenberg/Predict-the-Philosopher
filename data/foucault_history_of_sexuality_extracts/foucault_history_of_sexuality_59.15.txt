Do I lay claim to any of 
these?But you, for your part, have you concerned yourself 
with judgments?Have you concerned yourself with your own 
rational self ?” 13 

The importance assumed by the theme of the return to 
oneself or of the attention that must be given to oneself, in 
Hellenistic and Roman thought, is often interpreted as the 
alternative that was offered to civic activity and political re¬ 
sponsibilities.It is true that in certain philosophical currents 
one finds the recommendation to turn aside from public 
affairs, from the troubles and passions to which they give rise.But it is not in this choice between participation and absten¬ 
tion that the principal line of division lies; and it is not in 
opposition to the active life that the cultivation of the self 
places its own values and practices.
