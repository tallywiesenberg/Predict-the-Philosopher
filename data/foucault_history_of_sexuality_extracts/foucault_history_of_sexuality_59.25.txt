A relatmzation.In the new political game, the exercise 
of power is relativized in two ways.First, even if by one’s birth 
one is marked out for public offices, one no longer identifies 
sufficiently with one’s status to consider it a foregone conclu¬ 
sion that one will accept such responsibilities; or in any case, 
if many reasons, and the best of reasons, incline one toward 
public and political life, it is good to enter it precisely for those 
reasons and as a consequence of a personal act of choice.The 
treatise Plutarch addresses to the young Menemachus is char¬ 
acteristic in this regard.He condemns the attitude that would 
make politics into an occasional activity, but he refuses to 
treat it as the necessary and natural consequence of a status.
