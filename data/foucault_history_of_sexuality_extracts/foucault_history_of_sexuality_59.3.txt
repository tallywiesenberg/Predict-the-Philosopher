One must not, he says, regard political activity as a sort of 
pastime (schole) in which one would engage because one has 
nothing else to do and because circumstances are favorable, 
only to abandon it when difficulties arise.14 Politics is “a life” 
and a “practice” (bios kai praxis).15 But one cannot devote 
oneself to it except by a free and deliberate choice.(Here 
Plutarch employs the technical expression of the Stoics: 
proairesis. )And this choice must be based on judgment and 
reason (krisis kai logos): 16 only in this way can one deal firmly 
with the problems that may be posed.
