The exercise of political 
activity is indeed a “life,” implying a personal and lasting 
commitment.But the foundation, the link between oneself and 
political activity, that which establishes the individual as a 
political actor, is not—or not merely—his status; it is, in the 
general context defined by his birth and his standing, a per¬ 
sonal act.But one can also speak of relativization in another sense.Short of being the prince himself, one exercises power within 
a network in which one occupies a key position.In a certain 
way, one is always the ruler and the ruled.
