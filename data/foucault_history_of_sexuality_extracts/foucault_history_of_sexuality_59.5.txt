The History of Sexuality 


body. But it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures, 
statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire 
social body or at groups taken as a whole. Sex was a means 
of access both to the life of the body and the life of the 
species. It was employed as a standard for the disciplines and 
as a basis for regulations. This is why in the nineteenth 
century sexuality was sought out in the smallest details of 
individual existences; it was tracked down in behavior, pur¬ 
sued in dreams; it was suspected of underlying the least 
follies, it was traced back into the earliest years of childhood; 
it became the stamp of individuality—at the same time what 
enabled one to analyze the latter and what made it possible 
to master it. But one also sees it becoming the theme of 
political operations, economic interventions (through incite¬ 
ments to or curbs on procreation), and ideological campaigns 
for raising standards of morality and responsibility: it was 
put forward as the index of a society’s strength, revealing of 
both its political energy and its biological vigor. Spread out 
from one pole to the other of this technology of sex was a 
whole series of different tactics that combined in varying 
proportions the objective of disciplining the body and that of 
regulating populations. 

Whence the importance of the four great lines of attack 
along which the politics of sex advanced for two centuries. 
Each one was a way of combining disciplinary techniques 
with regulative methods. The first two rested on the require¬ 
ments of regulation, on a whole thematic of the species, 
descent, and collective welfare, in order to obtain results at 
the level of discipline; the sexualization of children was ac¬ 
complished in the form of a campaign for the health of the 
race (precocious sexuality was presented from the eighteenth 
century to the end of the nineteenth as an epidemic menace 
that risked compromising not only the future health of adults 
but the future of the entire society and species); the hysteriza- 
tion of women, which involved a thorough medicalization of 
their bodies and their sex, was carried out in the name of the
