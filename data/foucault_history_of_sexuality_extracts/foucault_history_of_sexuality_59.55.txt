Self and Others

the ruler will still have to be guided by his personal reason.It is in knowing how properly to conduct himself that he will 
be able to lead others properly.A man, says Dio of Prusa, who 
observes the law and equity, who is more courageous than 
common soldiers, who works more diligently than those who 
are under coercion, who refrains from any sort of sensual 
excess (obviously, it is a question of virtues that anyone might 
possess, but that need to be carried to a higher degree when 
one aims to govern)â€”such a man, who is not just good for 
himself but for others as well, has a daimon .22 The rationality 
of the government of others is the same as the rationality of 
the government of oneself.This is what Plutarch explains in 
To an Uneducated Ruler: one will not be able to rule if one 
is not oneself ruled.
