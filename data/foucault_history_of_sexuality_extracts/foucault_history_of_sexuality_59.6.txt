Now, who then is to govern the ruler?The 
law, of course; it must not, however, be understood as the 
written law, but rather as reason, the logos, which lives in the 
soul of the ruler and must never abandon him.23 

In a political space where the political structure of the city 
and the laws with which it is endowed have unquestionably 
lost some of their importance, although they have not ceased 
to exist for all that, and where the decisive elements reside 
more and more in men, in their decisions, in the manner in 
which they bring their authority to bear, in the wisdom they 
manifest in the interplay of equilibria and transactions, it 
appears that the art of governing oneself becomes a crucial 
political factor.We are aware of the importance assumed by 
the problem of the emperorsâ€™ virtue, of their private life, and 
of their ability to control their passions, which is seen as the 
guarantee that they will themselves be able to set a limit on 
the exercise of their political power.But this principle applies 
to anyone who governs: he must attend to himself, guide his 
own soul, establish his own ethos.
