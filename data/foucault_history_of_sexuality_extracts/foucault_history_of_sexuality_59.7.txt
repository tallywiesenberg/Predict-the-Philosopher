And it was in these conditions that the exercise 
of imperial responsibilities could appear as the practice of a 
serious occupation, and one that demanded a good deal of 
effort: examining matters closely, never leaving a dossier in¬ 
complete, not incurring useless expenses, carefully planning 
one’s projects and seeing them through.A whole elaboration 
of the self by oneself was necessary for these tasks, which 
would be accomplished all the better because one did not 
identify in an ostentatious way with the trappings of power.Epictetus, for his part, had set forth the principles that 
ought to guide an official—of relatively high rank—in the 
performance of his tasks.On the one hand, he must fulfill his

obligations without regard to his personal life or interests: 
“You have been given a post in an imperial city, and not in 
some mean place; not for a short time, either, but you are a 
senator for life.Do you not know that a man in such a post 
has to give only a little attention to the affairs of his own 
household, but for most of his time has to be away, in com¬ 
mand, or under command, or serving some official, or in the 
field, or on the judge’s bench?” 25 But even though the magis¬ 
trate must leave aside his personal life and that which attaches 
him to it, it is his personal virtues as a reasonable man that 
will need to serve him as a guide and regulative principle in 
governing others.
