this; do not do this; otherwise I will throw you in prison.’ Say 
that and you cease to be a government as over rational beings.No, rather say, ‘As Zeus has ordained, do this; if you do not 
do so, you will be punished, you will suffer injury.What kind 
of injury?No injury but that of not doing what you ought.’ ” 26

of a status that establishes and ought to determine, in their 
concrete form, relations between the governors and the gov¬ 
erned.
