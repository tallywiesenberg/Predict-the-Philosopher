The precarious¬ 
ness of good fortune—too much success provokes the jealousy 
of the gods, or the people are fond of withdrawing favors they 
once granted—was clearly a traditional theme of meditation.In reflection on political activity, during the first centuries of 
the Empire, this precariousness inherent in the exercise of 
power is associated with two other themes.First, it is per¬ 
ceived as being linked to the dependence that one experiences 
in relation to others.It is not so much the particular cycle of 
good and bad fortune that explains this fragility, but the fact 
that one is placed under what Seneca calls the potentia aliena 
or the vis potentioris.28 In the complex network of power, one 
is never alone facing one’s enemies.
