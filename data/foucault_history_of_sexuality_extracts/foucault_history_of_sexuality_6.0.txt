words that rendered it too visibly present. And even these 
prohibitions, it seems, were afraid to name it. Without even 
having to pronounce the word, modern prudishness was able 
to ensure that one did not speak of sex, merely through the 
interplay of prohibitions that referred back to one another: 
instances of muteness which, by dint of saying nothing, im¬ 
posed silence. Censorship. 

Yet when one looks back over these last three centuries 
with their continual transformations, things appear in a very 
different light: around and apropos of sex, one sees a veritable 
discursive explosion. We must be clear on this point, how¬ 
ever. It is quite possible that there was an expurgation—and 
a very rigorous one—of the authorized vocabulary. It may 
indeed be true that a whole rhetoric of allusion and metaphor 
was codified. Without question, new rules of propriety

screened out some words: there was a policing of statements. 
A control over enunciations as well: where and when it was 
not possible to talk about such things became much more 
strictly defined; in which circumstances, among which 
speakers, and within which social relationships. Areas were 
thus established, if not of utter silence, at least of tact and 
discretion: between parents and children, for instance, or 
teachers and pupils, or masters and domestic servants. This 
almost certainly constituted a whole restrictive economy, 
one that was incorporated into that politics of language and 
speech—spontaneous on the one hand, concerted on the 
other—which accompanied the social redistributions of the 
classical period. 

At the level of discourses and their domains, however, 
practically the opposite phenomenon occurred. There was a 
steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex—spe¬ 
cific discourses, different from one another both by their 
form and by their object: a discursive ferment that gathered 
momentum from the eighteenth century onward. Here I am 
thinking not so much of the probable increase in “illicit” 
discourses, that is, discourses of infraction that crudely 
named sex by way of insult or mockery of the new code of
