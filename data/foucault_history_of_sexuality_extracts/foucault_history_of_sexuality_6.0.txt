words that rendered it too visibly present. And even these 
prohibitions, it seems, were afraid to name it. Without even 
having to pronounce the word, modern prudishness was able 
to ensure that one did not speak of sex, merely through the 
interplay of prohibitions that referred back to one another: 
instances of muteness which, by dint of saying nothing, im¬ 
posed silence. Censorship. 

Yet when one looks back over these last three centuries 
with their continual transformations, things appear in a very 
different light: around and apropos of sex, one sees a veritable 
discursive explosion. We must be clear on this point, how¬ 
ever. It is quite possible that there was an expurgation—and 
a very rigorous one—of the authorized vocabulary. It may 
indeed be true that a whole rhetoric of allusion and metaphor 
was codified. Without question, new rules of propriety

screened out some words: there was a policing of statements. 
A control over enunciations as well: where and when it was 
not possible to talk about such things became much more 
strictly defined; in which circumstances, among which 
speakers, and within which social relationships. Areas were 
thus established, if not of utter silence, at least of tact and 
discretion: between parents and children, for instance, or 
teachers and pupils, or masters and domestic servants. This 
almost certainly constituted a whole restrictive economy, 
one that was incorporated into that politics of language and 
speech—spontaneous on the one hand, concerted on the 
other—which accompanied the social redistributions of the 
classical period. 

At the level of discourses and their domains, however, 
practically the opposite phenomenon occurred. There was a 
steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex—spe¬ 
cific discourses, different from one another both by their 
form and by their object: a discursive ferment that gathered 
momentum from the eighteenth century onward. Here I am 
thinking not so much of the probable increase in “illicit” 
discourses, that is, discourses of infraction that crudely 
named sex by way of insult or mockery of the new code of 
decency; the tightening up of the rules of decorum likely did 
produce, as a countereffect, a valorization and intensification 
of indecent speech. But more important was the multiplica¬ 
tion of discourses concerning sex in the field of exercise of 
power itself: an institutional incitement to speak about it, and 
to do so more and more; a determination on the part of the 
agencies of power to hear it spoken about, and to cause it to 
speak through explicit articulation and endlessly ac¬ 
cumulated detail. 

Consider the evolution of the Catholic pastoral and the 
sacrament of penance after the Council of Trent. Little by 
little, the nakedness of the questions formulated by the con¬ 
fession manuals of the Middle Ages, and a good number of 
those still in use in the seventeenth century, was veiled. One

avoided entering into that degree of detail which some au¬ 
thors, such as Sanchez or Tamburini, had for a long time 
believed indispensable for the confession to be complete: 
description of the respective positions of the partners, the 
postures assumed, gestures, places touched, caresses, the pre¬ 
cise moment of pleasure—an entire painstaking review of the 
sexual act in its very unfolding. Discretion was advised, with 
increasing emphasis. The greatest reserve was counseled 
when dealing with sins against purity: “This matter is similar 
to pitch, for, however one might handle it, even to cast it far 
from oneself, it sticks nonetheless, and always soils.”' And 
later, Alfonso de’ Liguori prescribed starting—and possibly 
going no further, especially when dealing with children— 
with questions that were “roundabout and vague.” 2 

But while the language may have been refined, the scope 
of the confession—the confession of the flesh—continually 
increased. This was partly because the Counter Reformation 
busied itself with stepping up the rhythm of the yearly con¬ 
fession in the Catholic countries, and because it tried to 
impose meticulous rules of self-examination; but above all, 
because it attributed more and more importance in penance 
—and perhaps at the expense of some other sins—to all the 
insinuations of the flesh: thoughts, desires, voluptuous ima¬ 
ginings, delectations, combined movements of the body and 
the soul; henceforth all this had to enter, in detail, into the
