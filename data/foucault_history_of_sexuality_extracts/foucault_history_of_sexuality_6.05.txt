The limitless dangers that sex carried with it jus¬ 
tified the exhaustive character of the inquisition to which it 
was subjected.3.Through the principle of a latency intrinsic to sexuality.If it was necessary to extract the truth of sex through the 
technique of confession, this was not simply because it was 
difficult to tell, or stricken by the taboos of decency, but 
because the ways of sex were obscure; it was elusive by 
nature; its energy and its mechanisms escaped observation, 
and its causal power was partly clandestine.By integrating 
it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth 
century altered the scope of the confession; it tended no 
longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished 
to hide, but with what was hidden from himself, being inca¬ 
pable of coming to light except gradually and through the 
labor of a confession in which the questioner and the ques¬ 
tioned each had a part to play.
