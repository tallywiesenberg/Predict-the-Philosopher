Paradoxically, the scientia sexualis that emerged in 
the nineteenth century kept as its nucleus the singular ritual 
of obligatory and exhaustive confession, which in the Chris¬ 
tian West was the first technique for producing the truth of 
sex.Beginning in the sixteenth century, this rite gradually 
detached itself from the sacrament of penance, and via the 
guidance of souls and the direction of conscience—the ars 
artium —emigrated toward pedagogy, relationships between 
adults and children, family relations, medicine, and psychia¬ 
try.In any case, nearly one hundred and fifty years have gone 
into the making of a complex machinery for producing true 
discourses on sex: a deployment that spans a wide segment 
of history in that it connects the ancient injunction of confes¬ 
sion to clinical listening methods.It is this deployment that 
enables something called “sexuality” to embody the truth of 
sex and its pleasures.“Sexuality”: the correlative of that slowly developed dis¬ 
cursive practice which constitutes the scientia sexualis.
