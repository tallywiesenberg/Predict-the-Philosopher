The 
society that emerged in the nineteenth century—bourgeois, 
capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will—did not 
confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition.On 
the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for 
producing true discourses concerning it.Not only did it 
speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to 
formulate the uniform truth of sex.As if it suspected sex of 
harboring a fundamental secret.As if it needed this produc¬ 
tion of truth.
