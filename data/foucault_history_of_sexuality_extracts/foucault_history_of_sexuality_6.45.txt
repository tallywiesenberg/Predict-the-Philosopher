As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not 
only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of 
knowledge.Thus sex gradually became an object of great 
suspicion; the general and disquieting meaning that pervades 
our conduct and our existence, in spite of ourselves; the point 
of weakness where evil portents reach through to us; the 
fragment of darkness that we each carry within us: a general 
signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause, a fear 
that never ends.And so, in this “question” of sex (in both 
senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the 
need for confession and integration into a field of rationality), 
two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other: 
we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret 
and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves 
the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and 
deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth, 
or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about our¬ 
selves which we think we possess in our immediate con¬

determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be 
ignorant of himself.
