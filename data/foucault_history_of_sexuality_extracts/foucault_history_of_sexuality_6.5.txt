As unlikely as this may seem, it should 
not surprise us when we think of the long history of the 
Christian and juridical confession, of the shifts and transfor¬ 
mations this form of knowledge-power, so important in the 
West, has undergone: the project of a science of the subject 
has gravitated, in ever narrowing circles, around the question 
of sex.Causality in the subject, the unconscious of the sub¬ 
ject, the truth of the subject in the other who knows, the 
knowledge he holds unbeknown to him, all this found an 
opportunity to deploy itself in the discourse of sex.Not, 
however, by reason of some natural property inherent in sex 
itself, but by virtue of the tactics of power immanent in this 
discourse.Scientia sexualis versus ars erotica, no doubt.But it should 
be noted that the ars erotica did not disappear altogether 
from Western civilization; nor has it always been absent from 
the movement by which one sought to produce a science of 
sexuality.
