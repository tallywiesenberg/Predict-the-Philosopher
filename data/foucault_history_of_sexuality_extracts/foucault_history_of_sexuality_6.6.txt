We have at least invented a 
different kind of pleasure: pleasure in the truth of pleasure, 
the pleasure of knowing that truth, of discovering and expos¬ 
ing it, the fascination of seeing it and telling it, of captivating 
and capturing others by it, of confiding it in secret, of luring 
it out in the open—the specific pleasure of the true discourse 
on pleasure.The most important elements of an erotic art linked to our 
knowledge about sexuality are not to be sought in the ideal, 
promised to us by medicine, of a healthy sexuality, nor in the 
humanist dream of a complete and flourishing sexuality, and 
certainly not in the lyricism of orgasm and the good feelings 
of bio-energy (these are but aspects of its normalizing utiliza¬ 
tion), but in this multiplication and intensification of pleas¬ 
ures connected to the production of the truth about sex.The 
learned volumes, written and read; the consultations and 
examinations; the anguish of answering questions and the 
delights of having one’s words interpreted; all the stories told 
to oneself and to others, so much curiosity, so many confi¬ 
dences offered in the face of scandal, sustained—but not 
without trembling a little—by the obligation of truth; the 
profusion of secret fantasies and the dearly paid right to 
whisper them to whoever is able to hear them; in short, the 
formidable “pleasure of analysis” (in the widest sense of the 
latter term) which the West has cleverly been fostering for 
several centuries: all this constitutes something like the er¬ 
rant fragments of an erotic art that is secretly transmitted by 
confession and the science of sex.Must we conclude that our 
scientia sexualis is but an extraordinarily subtle form of ars 
erotica, and that it is the Western, sublimated version of that 
seemingly lost tradition?Or must we suppose that all these 
pleasures are only the by-products of a sexual science, a
