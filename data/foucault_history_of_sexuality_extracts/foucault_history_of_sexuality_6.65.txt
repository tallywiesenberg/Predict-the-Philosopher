In any case, the hypothesis of a power of repression ex¬ 
erted by our society on sex for economic reasons appears to 
me quite inadequate if we are to explain this whole series of 
reinforcements and intensifications that our preliminary in¬ 
quiry has discovered: a proliferation of discourses, carefully 
tailored to the requirements of power; the solidification of the 
sexual mosaic and the construction of devices capable not 
only of isolating it but of stimulating and provoking it, of 
forming it into focuses of attention, discourse, and pleasure; 
the mandatory production of confessions and the subsequent 
establishment of a system of legitimate knowledge and of an 
economy of manifold pleasures.We are dealing not nearly so 
much with a negative mechanism of exclusion as with the 
operation of a subtle network of discourses, special knowl¬ 
edges, pleasures, and powers.At issue is not a movement 
bent on pushing rude sex back into some obscure and inac¬ 
cessible region,'but on the contrary, a process that spreads 
it over the surface of things and bodies, arouses it, draws it 
out and bids it speak, implants it in reality and enjoins it to 
tell the truth: an entire glittering sexual array, reflected in a 
myriad of discourses, the obstination of powers, and the 
interplay of knowledge and pleasure.All this is an illusion, it will be said, a hasty impression 
behind which a more discerning gaze will surely discover the 
same great machinery of repression.Beyond these few phos¬ 
phorescences, are we not sure to find once more the somber 
law that always says no?
