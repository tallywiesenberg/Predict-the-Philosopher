The answer will have to come out 
of a historical inquiry.An inquiry concerning the manner in 
which a knowledge of sex has been forming over the last 
three centuries; the manner in which the discourses that take 
it as their object have multiplied, and the reasons for which 
we have come to attach a nearly fabulous price to the truth 
they claimed to produce.Perhaps these historical analyses 
will end by dissipating what this cursory survey seems to 
suggest.But the postulate I started out with, and would like

to hold to as long as possible, is that these deployments of 
power and knowledge, of truth and pleasures, so unlike those 
of repression, are not necessarily secondary and derivative; 
and further, that repression is not in any case fundamental 
and overriding.We need to take these mechanisms seriously, 
therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather 
than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an 
ignorance measured against what we are supposed to know, 
we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as 
they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleas¬ 
ure, and generate power; we must investigate the conditions 
of their emergence and operation, and try to discover how 
the related facts of interdiction or concealment are dis¬ 
tributed with respect to them.
