The sex which one catches unawares and ques¬ 
tions, and which, restrained and loquacious at the same time, 
endlessly replies.One day a certain mechanism, which was 
so elfin-like that it could make itself invisible, captured this 
sex and, in a game that combined pleasure with compulsion, 
and consent with inquisition, made it tell the truth about 
itself and others as well.For many years, we have all been 
living in the realm of Prince Mangogul: under the spell of an 
immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it, with an 
insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about, quick 
to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to 
abandon its discretion.As if it were essential for us to be able 
to draw from that little piece of ourselves not only pleasure 
but knowledge, and a whole subtle interchange f rom one to 
the other: a knowledge of pleasure, a pleasure that comes of 
knowing pleasure, a knowledge-pleasure; and as if that fan¬ 
tastic animal we accommodate had itself such finely tuned 
ears, such searching eyes, so gifted a tongue and mind, as to 
know much and be quite willing to tell it, provided we em¬ 
ployed a little skill in urging it to speak.Between each of us 
and our sex, the West has placed a never-ending demand for 
truth: it is up to us to extract the truth of sex, since this truth 
is beyond its grasp; it is up to sex to tell us our truth, since 
sex is what holds it in darkness.
