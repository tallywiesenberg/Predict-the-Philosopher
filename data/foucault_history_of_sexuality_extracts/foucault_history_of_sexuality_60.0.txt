and sometimes 
individuals equipped with power by the people and against the 
people.It is burdensome to keep the friendship of all such 
persons; it is enough not to make enemies of them.” Between 
the prince, the Senate, and the populace giving and taking 
away their favors according to circumstances, the exercise of 
power depends on an unstable conjuncture: “You have held 
the highest offices; but have you held any as great, as unlooked 
for, as comprehensive as those of Sejanus?Yet on the day on 
which the Senate played the escort, the people tore him to 
pieces!Of the man who had heaped upon him all that gods and 
men were able to bestow, nothing was left for the executioner 
to drag to the river!” 29 

For these reversals and for the anxiety that they cause, one 
must prepare oneself by setting a prior limit on the ambitions 
that one entertains: “Nothing can free us from these mental 
waverings so effectively as always to establish some limit to

advancement and not leave to Fortune the decision of when 
it shall end, but halt of our own accord.” 30 And if the occasion 
presents itself, it is good to withdraw from these activities 
when they become disturbing and prevent one from attending 
to oneself.If misfortune suddenly strikes, if one falls from 
favor and is exiled, one ought to tell oneself—this is the advice 
Plutarch addresses no doubt to the same Menemachus whom 
he had encouraged, several years before, to enter politics “by 
free choice”*—that one is finally free from obedience to gover¬ 
nors, from liturgies that are too costly, from services to render, 
from ambassadorial missions to accomplish, and from taxes to 
pay.
