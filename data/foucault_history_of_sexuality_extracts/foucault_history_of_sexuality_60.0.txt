responsibility they owed to the health of their children, the 
solidity of the family institution, and the safeguarding of 
society. It was the reverse relationship that applied in the 
case of birth controls and the psychiatrization of perversions: 
here the intervention was regulatory in nature, but it had to 
rely on the demand for individual disciplines and constraints 
(dressages). Broadly speaking, at the juncture of the “body” 
and the “population,” sex became a crucial target of a power 
organized around the management of life rather than the 
menace of death. 

The blood relation long remained an important element in 
the mechanisms of power, its manifestations, and its rituals. 
For a society in which the systems of alliance, the political 
form of the sovereign, the differentiation into orders and 
castes, and the value of descent lines were predominant; for 
a society in which famine, epidemics, and violence made 
death imminent, blood constituted one of the fundamental 
values. It owed its high value at the same time to its instru¬ 
mental role (the ability to shed blood), to the way it func¬ 
tioned in the order of signs (to have a certain blood, to be of 
the same blood, to be prepared to risk one’s blood), and also 
to its precariousness (easily spilled, subject to drying up, too 
readily mixed, capable of being quickly corrupted). A society 
of blood—I was tempted to say, of “sanguinity”—where 
power spoke through blood: the honor of war, the fear of 
famine, the triumph of death, the sovereign with his sword, 
executioners, and tortures; blood was a reality with a sym¬ 
bolic function. We, on the other hand, are in a society of 
“sex,” or rather a society “with a sexuality”: the mechanisms 
of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes 
it to proliferate, to what reinforces the species, its stamina, 
its ability to dominate, or its capacity for being used. 
Through the themes of health, progeny, race, the future of 
the species, the vitality of the social body, power spoke of 
sexuality and to sexuality, the latter was not a mark or a 
symbol, it was an object and a target. Moreover, its impor-

tance was due less to its rarity or its precariousness than to 
its insistence, its insidious presence, the fact that it was every¬ 
where an object of excitement and fear at the same time. 
Power delineated it, aroused it, and employed it as the prolif¬ 
erating meaning that had always to be taken control of again 
lest it escape; it was an effect with a meaning-value. I do not 
mean to say that a substitution of sex for blood was by itself 
responsible for all the transformations that marked the 
threshold of our modernity. It is not the soul of two civiliza¬ 
tions or the organizing principle of two cultural forms that 
I am attempting to express; I am looking for the reasons for 
which sexuality, far from being repressed in the society of 
that period, on the contrary was constantly aroused. The 
new procedures of power that were devised during the classi¬ 
cal age and employed in the nineteenth century were what 
caused our societies to go from a symbolics of blood to an 
analytics of sexuality. Clearly, nothing was more on the side 
of the law, death, transgression, the symbolic, and sove¬ 
reignty than blood; just as sexuality was on the side of the 
norm, knowledge, life, meaning, the disciplines, and regula¬ 
tions. 

Sade and the first eugenists were contemporary with this 
transition from “sanguinity” to “sexuality.” But whereas the 
first dreams of the perfecting of the species inclined the whole 
problem toward an extremely exacting administration of sex 
(the art of determining good marriages, of inducing the 
desired fertilities, of ensuring the health and longevity of 
children), and while the new concept of race tended to oblit¬ 
erate the aristocratic particularities of blood, retaining only 
the controllable effects of sex, Sade carried the exhaustive 
analysis of sex over into the mechanisms of the old power of 
sovereignty and endowed it with the ancient but fully main¬ 
tained prestige of blood; the latter flowed through the whole 
dimension of pleasure—the blood of torture and absolute 
power, the blood of the caste which was respected in itself 
and which nonetheless was made to flow in the major rituals

of parricide and incest, the blood of the people, which was 
shed unreservedly since the sort that flowed in its veins was 
not even deserving of a name. In Sade, sex is without any 
norm or intrinsic rule that might be formulated from its own 
nature; but it is subject to the unrestricted law of a power 
which itself knows no other law but its own; if by chance it
