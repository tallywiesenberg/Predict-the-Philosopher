responsibility they owed to the health of their children, the 
solidity of the family institution, and the safeguarding of 
society. It was the reverse relationship that applied in the 
case of birth controls and the psychiatrization of perversions: 
here the intervention was regulatory in nature, but it had to 
rely on the demand for individual disciplines and constraints 
(dressages). Broadly speaking, at the juncture of the “body” 
and the “population,” sex became a crucial target of a power 
organized around the management of life rather than the 
menace of death. 

The blood relation long remained an important element in 
the mechanisms of power, its manifestations, and its rituals. 
For a society in which the systems of alliance, the political 
form of the sovereign, the differentiation into orders and 
castes, and the value of descent lines were predominant; for 
a society in which famine, epidemics, and violence made 
death imminent, blood constituted one of the fundamental 
values. It owed its high value at the same time to its instru¬ 
mental role (the ability to shed blood), to the way it func¬ 
tioned in the order of signs (to have a certain blood, to be of 
the same blood, to be prepared to risk one’s blood), and also 
to its precariousness (easily spilled, subject to drying up, too 
readily mixed, capable of being quickly corrupted). A society 
of blood—I was tempted to say, of “sanguinity”—where 
power spoke through blood: the honor of war, the fear of 
famine, the triumph of death, the sovereign with his sword, 
executioners, and tortures; blood was a reality with a sym¬ 
bolic function. We, on the other hand, are in a society of 
“sex,” or rather a society “with a sexuality”: the mechanisms 
of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes 
it to proliferate, to what reinforces the species, its stamina, 
its ability to dominate, or its capacity for being used. 
Through the themes of health, progeny, race, the future of 
the species, the vitality of the social body, power spoke of 
sexuality and to sexuality, the latter was not a mark or a 
symbol, it was an object and a target. Moreover, its impor-
