31 And to Lucilius, who is not under any threat, however, 
Seneca gives the advice to disengage himself from his duties, 
gradually and at the right time, just as Epicurus counseled, so 
as to be able to place himself at his own disposal.32 

The basic attitude that one must have toward political activ¬ 
ity was related to the general principle that whatever one is, 
it is not owing to the rank one holds, to the responsibility one 
exercises, to the position in which one finds oneself—above or 
beneath other people.What one is, and what one needs to 
devote one’s attention to as to an ultimate purpose, is the 
expression of a principle that is singular in its manifestation 
within each person, but universal by the form it assumes in 
everyone, and collective by the community bond it establishes 
between individuals.Such is, at least for the Stoics, human 
reason as a divine principle present in all of us.Now, this god, 
“a guest in a mortal body,” can be found in the form or a 
Roman knight as well as in the body of a freedman or a slave.
