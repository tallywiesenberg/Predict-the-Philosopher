Clearly, then, it would not be adequate to say that political 
activities, in moral reflection, were conceived primarily in the 
form of a simple alternative: to participate or to abstain.It is 
true that the question was framed in such terms rather often.But this alternative itself derived from a more general prob- 
lematization.The latter concerned the manner in which one 
ought to form oneself as an ethical subject in the entire sphere 
of social, political, and civic activities.It concerned how one 
determined which of these activities were obligatory or op¬ 
tional, natural or conventional, permanent or provisional, un¬ 
conditional or recommended only under certain conditions.
