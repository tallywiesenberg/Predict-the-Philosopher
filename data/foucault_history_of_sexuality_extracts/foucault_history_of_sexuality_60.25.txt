Self-mastery had implied a close connection between 
the superiority one exercised over oneself, the authority one 
exercised in the context of the household, and the power one 
exercised in the field of an agonistic society.It was the practice 
of superiority over oneself that guaranteed the moderate and

reasonable use that one could and ought to make of the two 
other superiorities.Henceforth one was in a world where these relations could 
no longer operate in the same way: the relation of superiority 
exercised in the household and over the wife had to be as¬ 
sociated with certain forms of reciprocity and equality.As for 
the agonistic game by which one sought to manifest and en¬ 
sure one’s superiority over others, it had to be integrated into 
a far more extensive and complex field of power relations.Consequently, the principle of superiority over the self as the 
ethical core, the general form of “heautocratism,” needed to 
be restructured.
