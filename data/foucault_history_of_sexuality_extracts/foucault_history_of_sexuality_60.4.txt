G. W. Bowersock observes that the medical 
model accompanied the development of the Second Sophistic 
and that a number of important rhetors had received medical 
training or manifested interests in that field.2 * It had long been 
established that philosophy was closely related to medicine, 
even though the demarcation of boundaries posed doctrinal 
problems and gave rise to territorial rivalries.In the first lines 
of Advice about Keeping Well, Plutarch echoes these debates: 
the physician is wrong, he says, when he claims to be able to 
do without philosophy, and one would be quite mistaken to 
reproach philosophers with crossing their own boundaries 
when they concern themselves with health and its regimen.One must consider, Plutarch concludes, that medicine is in no 
way inferior to the liberal arts (eleutherai technai) in elegance, 
distinction, and the satisfaction it yields.To those who study 
it, it gives access to a knowledge of great importance since it 
concerns health and the preservation of life .
