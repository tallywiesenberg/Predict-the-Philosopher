The way in which the latter some¬ 
times took control of their clients’ existence in order to man¬ 
age it in the least detail was an object of criticism, for the same 
reasons as was the spiritual direction practiced by philoso¬ 
phers.And Celsus, as convinced as he was of the high value 
of regimen medicine, was against subjecting oneself to a physi¬ 
cian if one was in good health.* The literature of regimen was 
meant to ensure this self-reliance.It was in order to avoid 
too-frequent consultations—because they were not always 
possible and they were often not desirable—that it was neces¬ 
sary to equip oneself with a medical knowledge that one could 
always use.Such is the advice that Athenaeus gives: acquire 
when young sufficient knowledge to be able, throughout one’s 
life and in ordinary circumstances, to be one’s own health 
counselor.
