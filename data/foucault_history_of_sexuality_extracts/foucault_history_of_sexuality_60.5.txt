where an object of excitement and fear at the same time. 
Power delineated it, aroused it, and employed it as the prolif¬ 
erating meaning that had always to be taken control of again 
lest it escape; it was an effect with a meaning-value. I do not 
mean to say that a substitution of sex for blood was by itself 
responsible for all the transformations that marked the 
threshold of our modernity. It is not the soul of two civiliza¬ 
tions or the organizing principle of two cultural forms that 
I am attempting to express; I am looking for the reasons for 
which sexuality, far from being repressed in the society of 
that period, on the contrary was constantly aroused. The 
new procedures of power that were devised during the classi¬ 
cal age and employed in the nineteenth century were what 
caused our societies to go from a symbolics of blood to an 
analytics of sexuality. Clearly, nothing was more on the side 
of the law, death, transgression, the symbolic, and sove¬

norm, knowledge, life, meaning, the disciplines, and regula¬ 
tions. 

Sade and the first eugenists were contemporary with this 
transition from “sanguinity” to “sexuality.” But whereas the 
first dreams of the perfecting of the species inclined the whole 
problem toward an extremely exacting administration of sex

desired fertilities, of ensuring the health and longevity of 
children), and while the new concept of race tended to oblit¬ 
erate the aristocratic particularities of blood, retaining only 
the controllable effects of sex, Sade carried the exhaustive 
analysis of sex over into the mechanisms of the old power of 
sovereignty and endowed it with the ancient but fully main¬ 
tained prestige of blood; the latter flowed through the whole 
dimension of pleasure—the blood of torture and absolute 
power, the blood of the caste which was respected in itself 
and which nonetheless was made to flow in the major rituals

of parricide and incest, the blood of the people, which was 
shed unreservedly since the sort that flowed in its veins was 
not even deserving of a name. In Sade, sex is without any 
norm or intrinsic rule that might be formulated from its own 
nature; but it is subject to the unrestricted law of a power 
which itself knows no other law but its own; if by chance it
