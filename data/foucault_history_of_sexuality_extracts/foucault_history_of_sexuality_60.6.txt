Now, it is tiresome and impossible al¬ 
ways to consult a physician concerning all these details .” 6 One 
easily recognizes in this passage one of the basic principles of 
the practice of the self: be equipped with, have ready to hand, 
a “helpful discourse,” which one has learned very early, re¬ 
hearses often, and reflects on regularly.The medical logos was 
one such discourse, dictating at every moment the correct 
regimen of life.A reasonable discourse could not unfold without a “health 
practice ”—hygieinepragmateia or techne —which constituted 
the permanent framework of everyday life, as it were, making 
it possible to know at every moment what was to be done and 
how to do it.It implied a medical perception of the world, so 
to speak, or at least a medical perception of the space and 
circumstances in which one lived.The elements of the milieu 
were perceived as having positive or negative effects on health.
