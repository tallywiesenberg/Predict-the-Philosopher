Between the individual and his environs, one imagined a 
whole web of interferences such that a certain disposition, a 
certain event, a certain change in things would induce morbid 
effects in the body.Conversely, a certain weak constitution of 
the body would be favorably or unfavorably affected by such 
and such a circumstance.Hence there was a constant and 
detailed problematization of the environment, a differential 
valuation of this environment with regard to the body, and a 
positing of the body as a fragile entity in relation to its sur¬ 
roundings.One can cite as an example the analysis submitted 
by Antyllus of the different medical “variables” of a house, its 
architecture, its orientation, and its interior design.Each ele¬ 
ment is assigned a dietetic or therapeutic value; a house is a 
series of compartments that will be harmful or beneficial as 
regards possible illnesses.
