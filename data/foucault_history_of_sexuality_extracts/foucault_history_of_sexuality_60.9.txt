The evocations of their every¬ 
day life that one can find in the letters of Seneca or in the 
correspondence between Marcus Aurelius and Fronto testify 
to this mode of attention to the self and to one’s body.An 
intensification, much more than a radical change; an increase 
of apprehension and not a disparagement of the body; a 
change of scale in the elements to which one needed to direct 
one’s attention and not a different way of perceiving oneself 
as a physical individual.104 


The Care of the Self 


It was in this overall context, so strongly marked by con¬ 
cern for the body, health, environment, and circumstances, 
that medicine framed the question of sexual pleasures: the 
question of their nature and their mechanism, that of their 
positive and negative value for the organism, that of the regi¬ 
men to which they ought to be subjected .10
