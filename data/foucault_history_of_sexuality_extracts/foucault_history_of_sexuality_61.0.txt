is at times forced to accept the order of progressions carefully 
disciplined into successive days, this exercise carries it to a 
point where it is no longer anything but a unique and naked 
sovereignty: an unlimited right of all-powerful monstrosity. 

While it is true that the analytics of sexuality and the 
symbolics of blood were grounded at first in two very distinct 
regimes of power, in actual fact the passage from one to the 
other did not come about (any more than did these powers 
themselves) without overlappings, interactions, and echoes. 
In different ways, the preoccupation with blood and the law 
has for nearly two centuries haunted the administration of 
sexuality. Two of these interferences are noteworthy, the one 
for its historical importance, the other for the problems it 
poses. Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, 
the thematics of blood was sometimes called on to lend its 
entire historical weight toward revitalizing the type of politi¬ 
cal power that was exercised through the devices of sexuality. 
Racism took shape at this point (racism in its modern, “bi¬ 
ologizing,” statist form): it was then that a whole politics of 
settlement (peuplement), family, marriage, education, social 
hierarchization, and property, accompanied by a long series 
of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct, 
health, and everyday life, received their color and their jus¬ 
tification from the mythical concern with protecting the 
purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race. 
Nazism was doubtless the most cunning and the most naive 
(and the former because of the latter) combination of the 
fantasies of blood and the paroxysms of a disciplinary power. 
A eugenic ordering of society, with all that implied in the 
way of extension and intensification of micro-powers, in the

guise of an unrestricted state control (etatisation), was ac¬ 
companied by the oneiric exaltation of a superior blood; the 
latter implied both the systematic genocide of others and the 
risk of exposing oneself to a total sacrifice. It is an irony of 
history that the Hitlerite politics of sex remained an insignifi¬ 
cant practice while the blood myth was transformed into the 
greatest blood bath in recent memory. 

At the opposite extreme, starting from this same end of the 
nineteenth century, we can trace the theoretical effort to
