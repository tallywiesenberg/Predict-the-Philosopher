is at times forced to accept the order of progressions carefully 
disciplined into successive days, this exercise carries it to a 
point where it is no longer anything but a unique and naked 
sovereignty: an unlimited right of all-powerful monstrosity. 

While it is true that the analytics of sexuality and the 
symbolics of blood were grounded at first in two very distinct 
regimes of power, in actual fact the passage from one to the 
other did not come about (any more than did these powers 
themselves) without overlappings, interactions, and echoes. 
In different ways, the preoccupation with blood and the law 
has for nearly two centuries haunted the administration of 
sexuality. Two of these interferences are noteworthy, the one 
for its historical importance, the other for the problems it 
poses. Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, 
the thematics of blood was sometimes called on to lend its 
entire historical weight toward revitalizing the type of politi¬ 
cal power that was exercised through the devices of sexuality. 
Racism took shape at this point (racism in its modern, “bi¬ 
ologizing,” statist form): it was then that a whole politics of 
settlement (peuplement), family, marriage, education, social 
hierarchization, and property, accompanied by a long series 
of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct, 
health, and everyday life, received their color and their jus¬ 
tification from the mythical concern with protecting the 
purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race. 
Nazism was doubtless the most cunning and the most naive 
(and the former because of the latter) combination of the 
fantasies of blood and the paroxysms of a disciplinary power. 
A eugenic ordering of society, with all that implied in the 
way of extension and intensification of micro-powers, in the

guise of an unrestricted state control (etatisation), was ac¬ 
companied by the oneiric exaltation of a superior blood; the 
latter implied both the systematic genocide of others and the 
risk of exposing oneself to a total sacrifice. It is an irony of 
history that the Hitlerite politics of sex remained an insignifi¬ 
cant practice while the blood myth was transformed into the 
greatest blood bath in recent memory. 

At the opposite extreme, starting from this same end of the 
nineteenth century, we can trace the theoretical effort to 
reinscribe the thematic of sexuality in the system of law, the 
symbolic order, and sovereignty. It is to the political credit 
of psychoanalysis—or at least, of what was most coherent in 
it—that it regarded with suspicion (and this from its incep¬ 
tion, that is, from the moment it broke away from the neu¬ 
ropsychiatry of degenerescence) the irrevocably proliferating 
aspects which might be contained in these power mech¬ 
anisms aimed at controlling and administering the everyday 
life of sexuality: whence the Freudian endeavor (out of reac¬ 
tion no doubt to the great surge of racism that was contem¬ 
porary with it) to ground sexuality in the law—the law of 
alliance, tabooed consanguinity, and the Sovereign-Father, 
in short, to surround desire with all the trappings of the old 
order of power. It was owing to this that psychoanalysis was 
—in the main, with a few exceptions—in theoretical and 
practical opposition to fascism. But this position of psychoa¬ 
nalysis was tied to a specific historical conjuncture. And yet, 
to conceive the category of the sexual in terms of the law, 
death, blood, and sovereignty—whatever the references 
to Sade and Bataille, and however one might gauge their 
“subversive” influence—is in the last analysis a historical 
“retro-version.” We must conceptualize the deployment of 
sexuality on the basis of the techniques of power that are 
contemporary with it.

biologically established existence of sexual functions for the 
benefit of phenomena that are variable, perhaps, but fragile, 
secondary, and ultimately superficial; and that I speak of 
sexuality as if sex did not exist. And one would be entitled 
to object as follows: “You claim to analyze in detail the 
processes by which women’s bodies, the lives of children, 
family relationships, and an entire network of social relations 
were sexualized. You wish to describe that great awakening 
of sexual concern since the eighteenth century and our grow¬ 
ing eagerness to suspect the presence of sex in everything. Let 
us admit as much and suppose that the mechanisms of power 
were in fact used more to arouse and ‘excite’ sexuality than 
to repress it. But here you remain quite near to the thing you 
no doubt believe you have gotten away from; at bottom,
