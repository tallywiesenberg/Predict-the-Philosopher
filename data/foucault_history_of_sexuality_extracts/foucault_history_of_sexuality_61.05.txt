In short, something inge¬ 
nious (sophisma) is needed.2 To bring her work to its logical 
conclusion, the demiurge, in creating living beings and giving 
them a means to reproduce, had to perfect a ruse: a ruse of 
the logos that presides over the world, in order to overcome 
the unavoidable corruptibility of the material of which this 
very world is made.This ruse brings three elements into play.First, the organs 
that are given to all animals and are used for fertilization.Next, a capacity for pleasure that is extraordinary and “very 
keen.” Lastly, in the soul, the longing (epithumia) to make use 
of these organs—a marvelous, inexpressible (arrheton) desire.
