The “sophism” of sex does not therefore reside simply in a 
subtle anatomical arrangement and in carefully planned 
mechanisms; it also consists in their association with a plea¬ 
sure and a desire, the singular force of which is “even beyond 
words.” To overcome the incompatibility between her plan 
and the limitations of her materials, Nature had to place the 
principle of a force, an extraordinary dynamis, in the body 
and soul of the living creature.Hence the wisdom of the demiurgic principle, which, know¬ 
ing very well the substance of her work and consequently its 
limits, invented this mechanism of excitement—this “sting” of 
desire.(Here Galen repeats the traditional image, by which 
one spoke metaphorically of the uncontrolled vehemence of 
desire.3 ) So that, experiencing this sting, even those animals 
that are incapable of understanding the purpose of Nature in 
her wisdom—because they are young, foolish (aphrona), or 
without reason (aloga) —do in fact accomplish it.4 By their 
intensity the aphrodisia serve a rationality which those who 
engage in them do not even need to know.
