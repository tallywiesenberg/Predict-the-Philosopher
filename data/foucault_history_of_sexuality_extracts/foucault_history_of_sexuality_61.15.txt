2.The physiology of sexual acts in Galen is still marked 
by some fundamental traits found in the earlier traditions.In the first place, there is the isomorphism of these acts in 
the man and the woman.For Galen, it rests on the principle 



The Body

of an identity of the anatomical apparatus in the two sexes: 
“Consider first whichever parts you please, turn outward the 
woman’s, turn inward, so to speak, and fold double the man’s, 
and you will find them the same in both in every respect.” 5 He 
assumes the emission of sperm by the woman as well as by the 
man, the difference being that the production of this humor 
is less perfect in the woman and less complete—which ex¬ 
plains its minor role in the formation of the embryo.One also finds in Galen the traditional model of the 
paroxysmal process of excretion that traverses the body, 
shakes it, and exhausts it.
