But the analysis he gives of this 
phenomenon deserves nonetheless to be examined.It has the 
double effect of linking, very closely, the mechanisms of the 
sexual act with the organism as a whole, while making it a 
process in which the individual’s health, and possibly his very 
life, is at risk.At the same time that it inserts the act into a 
dense and unbroken physiological web, it invests it with a high 
potential for danger.This is brought out very clearly in what we might call a 
“physiologization” of desire and pleasure.Chapter Nine of 
Book XIV of On the Usefulness of the Parts poses the question: 
“Why is a very great pleasure coupled with the exercise of the 
generative parts?” From the outset Galen rejects the idea that 
the vehemence of desire and the intensity of pleasure could 
simply have been associated with the sexual act by the will of 
the creating gods as a means of inciting men to its perform¬ 
ance.
