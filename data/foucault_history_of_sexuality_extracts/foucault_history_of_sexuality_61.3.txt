Galen sees 
several pleasure factors in this mechanism.First, there is the 
accumulation of a humor of such a nature that it provokes 
intense sensations in those parts where it collects.“It is the 
sort of thing that happens when serous humors are heated, as 
they frequently are, especially when acrid humors collect 
under the skin of the animal and then itch and make it scratch 
and enjoy the scratching.” 7 One must also take into account 
the heat that is particularly strong in the lower part, and 
singularly so on the right side because of the nearness of the 
liver and the large number of vessels that come from it.This 
dissymmetry with regard to heat explains the fact that boys 
are formed most frequently in the right uterus and girls in the 
left.8 It also explains why the parts on the right side are more 
apt to be the locus of intense pleasure.
