In any case, Nature 
gave the organs of this area a special sensitivity, much greater 
than that of the skin, despite their having the same functions.Lastly, the much thinner humor coming from the glandular 
bodies Galen calls parastata constitutes an additional material 
factor of pleasure.This humor, by permeating the parts in¬ 
volved in the sexual act, makes them more elastic and height¬ 
ens the pleasure they experience.There is, then, a whole 
anatomical disposition and a whole physiological design that 
inscribe in the body and its specific mechanisms pleasure with 
its excessive vigor (hyperoche tes hedones), which cannot be 
resisted: it is amechanos .9 

But even though the formation of pleasure is firmly an¬ 
chored and precisely localized in this way, it is no less true 
that, by virtue of the elements it brings into play and the 
consequences it entails, the sexual act involves the entire body.
