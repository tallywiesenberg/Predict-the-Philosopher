Galen does not hold, as does the Hippocratic author of De 
generation, that the sperm is formed by agitation occurring 
in the bloodstream; nor does he believe, as does Aristotle, that 



The Body

it constitutes the final state of digestion.In his view, it com¬ 
bines two elements: first, the product of a certain “coction” of 
the blood that is effected in the coils of the spermatic channels 
(it is this slow elaboration that gradually gives it its color and 
consistency); and second, the presence of the pneuma: it is the 
pneuma that swells the sexual organs, it is the pneuma that 
seeks to exit violently from the body and escapes in the sperm 
at the moment of ejaculation.Now, this pneuma is formed in 
the complex labyrinth of the brain.The sexual act, when it 
takes place and thus withdraws sperm and pneuma, acts on 
the general mechanism of the body, where all the elements are 
linked “as in a chorus.” And, “when, as a result of venereal 
excesses, all the sperm has been evacuated, the testicles draw 
from the veins above them all the seminal fluid which they 
contain.Now, this liquid is found there only in small quanti¬ 
ties, mixed with the blood in the form of dew.” These veins, 
“violently deprived of this fluid by the testicles, which have a 
more energetic action than they, in turn draw the liquid away 
from the veins situated above them, these draw it from the 
next ones, and the latter from those that are adjacent to them.
