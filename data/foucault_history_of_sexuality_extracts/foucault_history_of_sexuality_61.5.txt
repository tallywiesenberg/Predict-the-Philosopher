In this large family of convulsions, Galen identifies a partic¬ 
ular analogy between epilepsy and the sexual act.For him, 
epilepsy is caused by a congestion of the brain, which finds 
itself completely filled by a thick humor: whence the obstruc¬ 
tion of the channels that leave the ventricles where the 
pneuma resides.The latter is therefore imprisoned by this 
accumulation and it tries to escape, just as it strains to get out 
when it has collected with the sperm in the testicles.It is this 
attempt that is the source of the agitation of the nerves and 
muscles that one can witness, with varying proportions, in 
epileptic seizures or in the performance of the aphrodisia.Finally, there is, between the aphrodisia and convulsive 
attacks, a relation of causality that can be established in either 
direction.
