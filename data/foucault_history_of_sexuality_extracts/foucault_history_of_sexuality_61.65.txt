This ambiguity in medical thought concerning the sexual 
pleasures is not peculiar to Galen, although it is more discern¬ 
ible in him than elsewhere.It characterizes the essential part 
of what remains of the medical texts of the first and second 
centuries.In reality it is an ambivalence rather than an ambi¬ 
guity, for what is involved is the interweaving of two antitheti¬ 
cal valuations.First, on the positive side, there is the valorization of semen, 
of sperm—that precious substance which Nature, when she 
designed the human body, took so many precautions in form¬ 
ing.It gathers up all that is powerful in life and transmits it, 
thereby enabling us to cheat death.
