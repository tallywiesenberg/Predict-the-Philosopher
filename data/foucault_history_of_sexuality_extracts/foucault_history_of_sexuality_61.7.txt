It is in the male that it 
reaches its greatest strength and its highest perfection.And it 
is this substance that gives him his superiority.It contributes 
“to health, strength, courage, and generation.” 1 The male is 
preeminent because he is the spermatic animal par excellence.There is also a valorization of the act for which, in both 
sexes, the organs were so carefully arranged.Sexual union is 
a fact of nature; it cannot be considered bad.
