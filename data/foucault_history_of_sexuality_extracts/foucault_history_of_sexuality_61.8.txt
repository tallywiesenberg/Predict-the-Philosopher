Aretaeus had a meaningful 
phrase for this: the sexual act, he said, “bears the symbola ” of 
epilepsy.3 Caelius Aurelianus compared, term by term, the 
unfolding of the sexual act and the development of an epileptic 
seizure, finding exactly the same phases in both: “various parts 
are subjected to spasms, and at the same time there occur 
panting, sweating, rolling of the eyes and flushing of the face, 
and finally a feeling of malaise along with pallor, weakness, or 
dejection.” 4 Such is the paradox of the sexual pleasures: the 
high function Nature assigned them, the value of the sub¬ 
stance they have to transmit and therefore lose—this is the 
very thing that relates them to sickness.The physicians of the 
first and second centuries were not the first nor the only ones 
to formulate this ambivalence.But around it, they described 
an entire pathology, more developed, more complex, and 
more systematic than that attested in the past.1.
