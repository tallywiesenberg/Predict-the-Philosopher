...It is an unrestrainable im¬ 
pulse to connection; but neither are they at all relieved by 
those embraces, nor is the tentigo soothed by many and re¬ 
peated acts of sexual intercourse.Spasms of all the nerves, and 
tension of all the tendons, groins, and perineum, inflammation 
and pain of the genital parts.” This constant state is punc¬ 
tuated by attacks.The patients then lose “all restraint of 
tongue as regards obscenity, and likewise all restraint in re¬ 
gard to the open performance of the act...; they vomit much 
phlegm.Afterwards, froth settles on their lips, as is the case 
with goats in the season of rutting, and the smell likewise is 
similar.” Their minds lapse into madness, and they do not 
come to their ordinary senses again until the paroxysm has 
ended.
