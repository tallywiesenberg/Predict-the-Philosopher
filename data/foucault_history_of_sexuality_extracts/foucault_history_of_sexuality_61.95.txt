5 Galen, in his treatise On the Affected Parts, gives a 
much more sober description of satyriasis: “Priapism is an 
increase in the length and circumference of the male genitalia 
without sexual desire and without the acquired increase in 
heat which some people experience in the recumbent position.Other physicians describe it in the following manner, which 
is a shorter definition: a persisting increase of the external 
genitals or a persisting swelling.” 6 The cause of this disease is 
to be understood, according to Galen, from the mechanisms 
of erection, which means that it will be found in “the dilated 
orifices of the arteries” or in “the formation of the pneuma in 
the nerve.” Actually, Galen allows for both causes and their 
convergence in the genesis of symptoms.But he is most often 
inclined to blame the dilation of arteries, which is, according 
to him, a phenomenon that occurs much more frequently than 
that involving the pneuma “in the cavernous nerve.” This 
kind of disease is found in those who “have too much sperm” 
and who, contrary to their usual habits, “abstain from inter¬ 
course” (unless they find a means of “dissipating in numerous 
occupations the surplus quantity of their blood”), or in those 
who, while practicing self-control, imagine sexual pleasures

after seeing certain spectacles or as a result of recurring 
memories.Satyriasis in women is sometimes mentioned.Soranus en¬ 
counters the same type of symptoms in such cases; they take 
the form of an “intense itching of the genitals.” Women 
afflicted with this ailment are moved by “an irresistible desire 
for sexual intercourse,” which “throws aside all sense of 
shame.” 7 But it is doubtless hysteria that best represents the 
excessive tension of the sexual organs.
