when you point out phenomena of diffusion, anchorage, and 
fixation of sexuality, you are trying to reveal what might be 
called the organization of ‘erotic zones’ in the social body; it 
may well be the case that you have done nothing more than 
transpose to the level of diffuse processes mechanisms which 
psychoanalysis has identified with precision at the level of the 
individual. But you pass over the thing on the basis of which 
this sexualization was able to develop and which psychoanal¬ 
ysis does not fail to recognize—namely, sex. Before Freud, 
one sought to localize sexuality as closely as possible: in sex, 
in its reproductive functions, in its immediate anatomical 
localizations; one fell back upon a biological minimum: 
organ, instinct, and finality. You, on the other hand, are in 
a symmetrical and inverse position: for you, there remain 
only groundless effects, ramifications without roots, a sexual¬ 
ity without a sex. What is this if not castration once again?” 

Here we need to distinguish between two questions. First, 
does the analysis of sexuality necessarily imply the elision of 
the body, anatomy, the biological, the functional? To this 
question, I think we can reply in the negative. In any case, 
the purpose of the present study is in fact to show how 
deployments of power are directly connected to the body—

The History of Sexuality 


to bodies, functions, physiological processes, sensations, and 
pleasures; far from the body having to be effaced, what is 
needed is to make it visible through an analysis in which the 
biological and the historical are not consecutive to one an¬ 
other, as in the evolutionism of the first sociologists, but are 
bound together in an increasingly complex fashion in accord¬ 
ance with the development of the modern technologies of 
power that take life as their objective. Hence I do not envis¬ 
age a “history of mentalities” that would take account of 
bodies only through the manner in which they have been 
perceived and given meaning and value; but a “history of 
bodies” and the manner in which what is most material and 
most vital in them has been invested. 

Another question, distinct from the first one: this material¬ 
ity that is referred to, is it not, then, that of sex, and is it not 
paradoxical to venture a history of sexuality at the level of 
bodies, without there being the least question of sex? After
