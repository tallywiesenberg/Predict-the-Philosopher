In any case, that is how 
Galen describes an affliction in which he declines to see a 
movement of the uterus.The changes that have made some 
people think that the desiccated organ draws up toward the 
diaphragm in search of the moisture it lacks are due, accord¬ 
ing to him, either to retention of the menstrual flow or to 
retention of sperm.The obstruction of the vessels may cause 
them to become enlarged and hence shortened.A traction is 
thus brought to bear on the uterus.But it is not this process 
in itself which provokes the set of other symptoms; these all 
stem from the retention of humors that occurs, either when 
menstruation is suspended or when the woman interrupts her 
sexual relations: whence the hysteria that one can observe in 
widowed women, “particularly those who previously men¬ 
struated regularly, had been pregnant, and were eager for 
intercourse, but were now deprived of all this.” 8 

The other pole of the pathology is constituted by unlimited 
expenditure.
