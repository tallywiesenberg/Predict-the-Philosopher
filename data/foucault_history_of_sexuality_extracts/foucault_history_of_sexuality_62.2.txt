The acts are so fragile that the 
least deviation, the least malaise, risks perturbing them.As 
Galen says, to experience the sexual pleasures, one ought to 
be in an exactly medial state, at the zero point, as it were, of 
all the possible organic variations: “beware of repletion and 
deficiency,” avoid “fatigue, indigestion, and anything, more¬ 
over, which might be suspect in consideration of a person’s 
health.” 13

But if the aphrodisia constitute such a fragile and precari¬ 
ous activity, they in return exert a substantial and quite exten¬ 
sive influence on the entire organism.The list of ailments, 
malaises, and diseases that can be engendered by the sexual 
pleasures if one commits a deviation, with respect either to 
time or measure, is virtually open.“It is not difficult,” says 
Galen, “to recognize that sexual relations are fatiguing for the 
chest, the lungs, the head and the nerves.” 14 Rufus submits a 
table in which are juxtaposed, as effects of an abuse of sexual 
relations, digestive disorders, a weakening of sight and hear¬ 
ing, a general weakness of the sense organs, and memory loss; 
convulsive trembling, pains of the joints, a stabbing pain in the 
side; aphtha in the mouth, toothaches, inflammation of the 
throat, spitting of blood, and kidney and bladder diseases.15 It 
is concerning hysteria that Galen meets the objection of those 
who cannot believe that symptoms so numerous, so extensive, 
and so violent can be due to the retention or alteration of such 
a small amount of humor, which remains in the body as a 
result of the suspension of sexual relations.
