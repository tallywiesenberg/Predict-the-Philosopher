To which Galen 
replies by comparing the noxious powers of corrupted sperm 
to those of the virulent poisons that one observes in nature: 
“We can see that the entire body is affected by the bite of the 
venemous spider, although only an insignificant amount of 
venom enters through a very small opening.” The effect pro¬ 
duced by the scorpion is more surprising still, for the most 
violent symptoms declare themselves immediately; and yet, “a 
truly minimal amount or absolutely nothing is injected by the 
attacking stinger, the point of which seems to be without 
perforation.” The torpedo-fish is another example of this fact 
that “a minute quantity of some substance elicits a most pain¬ 
ful effect simply by contact.” And Galen concludes: “When, 
however, an affection involving our body originates inside and 
resembles the effect of the administration of a dangerous poi¬ 
son, then it is not astonishing that an abnormally composed

as pathological consequences.Its ambivalence makes it capa¬ 
ble of healing in certain cases.In others, on the contrary, it 
is likely to lead to illnesses.
