But it is not always easy to de¬ 
termine which of the two effects it will have: a question 
of individual temperament; a question, too, of particular cir¬ 
cumstances and of the transitory state of the body.In general, 
theorists subscribe to the Hippocratic teaching that “sexual 
intercourse is excellent against diseases due to the phlegm.” 
And Rufus comments: “Many individuals who are emaciated 
as a result of an illness are restored by means of this practice.Some of them thereby regain an easy respiration, which had 
been obstructed, others recover the appetite for food which 
they had lost, still others achieve the cessation of contrary 
nocturnal emissions.” 17 He also credits the evacuation of 
sperm with positive effects on the soul when the latter is 
troubled and needs, like the body, to be purged of that which 
encumbers it: intercourse dissipates fixed ideas and pacifies 
violent fits of anger.This is why there does not exist a more 
eminently useful remedy against melancholy and misan¬ 
thropy.Galen also attributes to sexual relations a number of 
curative effects, on the soul as well as the body: “this act 
predisposes the soul to tranquillity.
