Indeed it restores the 
melancholy and furious man to a more sensible state, and in 
an amorous individual it dampens the too immoderate ardor, 
even when this man has intercourse with a different woman.Further, animals that are ferocious when they have given birth 
become calm after copulation.” As to their effectiveness for 
the body, Galen sees a proof of their action in the fact that, 
once sexual practice has begun, boys become “hairy, large, 
manly,” whereas before they were “smooth-skinned, small, 
and feminine.” 18

But Galen also remarks on the opposite effects that sexual 
relations may have according to the condition in which the 
subject finds himself: “intercourse reduces to extreme weak¬ 
ness those whose strength is inconsiderable while those whose 
strength is intact and who are sick through the effect of the 
phlegm will not be struck down by intercourse.” For a mo¬ 
ment “it makes weak people warm again, but afterwards it 
chills them considerably”; or further, whereas some, “already 
in their early youth, become instantly enfeebled by inter¬ 
course.Others, if they do not have regular sexual relations, 
feel heavy in the head, become nauseated and feverish, have 
a poor appetite and bad digestion.” 19 And Galen even men¬ 
tions the case of certain temperaments for which the evacua¬ 
tion of sperm provokes illnesses or malaises despite the fact 
that its retention is harmful: “Certain people have an abun¬ 
dant, warm sperm which incessantly arouses the need for 
excretion; however, after its expulsion, people who are in this 
state experience a languor at the stomach orifice, exhaustion, 
weakness, and dryness in the whole body.They become thin, 
their eyes grow hollow and if, because they have suffered these 
effects after intercourse, they abstain from sexual relations, 
they feel discomfort in the head and at the stomach orifice 
along with nausea, and they do not derive any significant 
advantage from their self-control.” 20 

Around these positive or negative effects, several debates 
developed concerning certain precise questions.For example, 
the question of nocturnal emissions.
