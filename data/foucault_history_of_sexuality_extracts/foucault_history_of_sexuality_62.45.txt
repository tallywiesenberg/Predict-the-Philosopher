Aretaeus criticizes this method, because it 
violates the designs of Nature, who appointed the proper 
times, and because it produces or prolongs the disease it aims 
to cure: physicians who give such advice “are ignorant of the 
spontaneous law of Nature by which all cures are accom¬ 
plished.For along with every age she produces that which is 
proper for it in due season.At a given time there is the matu¬ 
rity of semen, of the beard, of hoary hairs.For on the one hand 
what physician could alter Nature’s original change in regard 
to the semen, and, on the other, the appointed time for each?But they also offend against the nature of the disease; for being 
previously injured by the unseasonableness of the act, they are 
not possessed of seasonable powers at the proper commence¬ 
ment of the age for coition.” 24 If in fact the convulsions disap¬ 
pear at puberty, this is due not to the enjoyment of sexual 
pleasures, but to a general modification in the balance and role 
of the humors.
