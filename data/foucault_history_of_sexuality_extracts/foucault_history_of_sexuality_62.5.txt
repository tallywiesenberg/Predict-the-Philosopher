all, is the power that is exercised through sexuality not di¬ 
rected specifically at that element of reality which is “sex,” 
sex in general? That sexuality is not, in relation to power, an 
exterior domain to which power is applied, that on the con¬ 
trary it is a result and an instrument of power’s designs, is 
all very well. But as for sex, is it not the “other” with respect 
to power, while being the center around which sexuality 
distributes its effects? Now, it is precisely this idea of sex in 
itself that we cannot accept without examination. Is “sex” 
really the anchorage point that supports the manifestations 
of sexuality, or is it not rather a complex idea that was 
formed inside the deployment of sexuality? In any case, one 
could show how this idea of sex took form in the different 
strategies of power and the definite role it played therein. 

All along the great lines which the development of the 
deployment of sexuality has followed since the nineteenth 
century, one sees the elaboration of this idea that there exists 
something other than bodies, organs, somatic localizations, 
functions, anatomo-physiological systems, sensations, and

pleasures; something else and something more, with intrinsic 
properties and laws of its own: “sex.” Thus, in the process 
of hysterization of women, “sex” was defined in three ways: 
as that which belongs in common to men and women; as that 
which belongs, par excellence, to men, and hence is lacking 
in women; but at the same time, as that which by itself 
constitutes woman’s body, ordering it wholly in terms of the 
functions of reproduction and keeping it in constant agita¬ 
tion through the effects of that very function. Hysteria was 
interpreted in this strategy as the movement of sex insofar as 
it was the “one” and the “other,” whole and part, principle 
and lack. In the sexualization of childhood, there was formed 
the idea of a sex that was both present (from the evidence of 
anatomy) and absent (from the standpoint of physiology), 
present too if one considered its activity, and deficient if one 
referred to its reproductive finality; or again, actual in its 
manifestations, but hidden in its eventual effects, whose path¬ 
ological seriousness would only become apparent later. If the 
sex of the child was still present in the adult, it was in the 
form of a secret causality that tended to nullify the sex of the 
latter (it was one of the tenets of eighteenth- and nineteenth-
