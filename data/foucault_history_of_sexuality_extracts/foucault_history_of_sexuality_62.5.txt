tendency to attribute positive effects to sexual abstention.It is 
true, as we have seen, that the physicians call attention to the 
disorders that can result from the practice of self-restraint.But they generally observe them in subjects who were accus¬ 
tomed to frequent sexual relations and in whom the cessation 
amounts to a sudden change of regimen.This is the case 
reported by Galen in the treatise On the Affected Parts, involv¬ 
ing a man who, breaking with all this previous habits, had 
given up sexual activity.
