25 They are also observed in subjects 
whose sperm is affected by qualities that make its evacuation 
necessary.Galen has seen men who, through the effect of this 
deprivation, became “dull and inactive,” and others who, “for

no evident reason, had a sad and hopeless expression on their 
faces like melancholics.” These observations allow him to 
state that “the retention of sperm does considerable harm to 
young and strong individuals, in whom the sperm is naturally 
abundant and formed of humors that are not entirely faultless, 
who lead a somewhat lazy life, who had quite frequently 
indulged in sexual intercourse before, and who suddenly prac¬ 
tice continence.” 26 That abstention from all sexual relations is 
harmful to the organism is therefore not regarded as a general 
fact that might be observed in anyone, no matter who they 
might be, but rather as the consequence of certain particular 
facts pertaining either to the state of the organism or to a 
habitual mode of living.In itself, and without any other factor 
entering in, abstinence that retains the spermatic substance 
cannot reasonably be considered harmful.As concerns men, the high vital value granted to the sper¬ 
matic humor had long enabled people to attribute positive 
effects to the kind of rigorous self-restraint practiced by ath¬ 
letes.The example is still regularly cited.
