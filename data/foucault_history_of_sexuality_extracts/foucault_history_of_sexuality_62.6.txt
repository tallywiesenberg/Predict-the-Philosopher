It was precisely in 
order to follow this model that a patient of Galen’s had de¬ 
cided to refrain from all sexual activity, without considering 
that up to then he had led a very different life and that the 
effects of this abstention could not therefore be comparable.Aretaeus, describing the beneficial effects of semen, that “vivi¬ 
fying humor”—it makes one manly, courageous, full of fire, 
robust; it gives a deep tone to the voice and makes one capable 
of vigorous action—asserts that a self-con trolled man “who 
retains his semen” thereby becomes “bold, daring, and strong 
as wild beasts.” He recalls the example of athletes or animals 
that are all the more vigorous because they keep their semen; 
thus, “such as are naturally superior in strength, by inconti¬ 
nence [akrasia ] become inferior to their inferiors; while those 
by nature much their inferiors by continence [enkrateia] be¬ 
come superior to their superiors [ kreittones ].” 27 

On the other hand, the values of abstinence were much less 
likely to be granted for women, given the fact that they were

considered to be socially and physiologically destined for mar¬ 
riage and procreation.Yet Soranus, in his Gynecology, cites 
the arguments of a debate, which seems to have been impor¬ 
tant in his day, on the advantages and disadvantages of virgin¬ 
ity.Those who criticize it call attention to the diseases that are 
due to humors that do not flow out and desires that are not 
extinguished by abstinence.The advocates of virginity point 
out, to the contrary, that women thereby avert the dangers of 
childbearing, are unacquainted with desire since they do not 
know pleasure, and keep within themselves the force that 
semen possesses.
