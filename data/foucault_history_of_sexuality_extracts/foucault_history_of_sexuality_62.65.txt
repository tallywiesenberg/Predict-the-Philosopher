Soranus, for his part, concedes that virginity 
can have disadvantages.But he observes them for the most 
part in women who live “shut inside the temples” and are 
deprived of “the necessary exercises.” He contends that as a 
rule permanent virginity is healthy for both sexes.28 Hence 
sexual union would not in his view have any natural justifica¬ 
tion in the health of individuals; only the obligation to main¬ 
tain the human race makes its practice necessary.It is “the 
general principle of nature” that requires it, more than per¬ 
sonal regimen.Sexual abstinence was not regarded as a duty, certainly, nor 
was the sexual act represented as an evil.
