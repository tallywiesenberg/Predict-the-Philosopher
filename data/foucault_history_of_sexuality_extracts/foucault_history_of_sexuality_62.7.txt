But we see how, in 
the development of these themes that were already explicitly 
formulated by the medical and philosophical thought of the 
fourth century, a certain inflection occurred: an insistence on 
the ambiguity of the effects of sexual activity, an extension of 
the correlations attributed to it throughout the organism, an 
accentuation of its peculiar fragility and its pathogenic power, 
and a valorization of abstinent behaviors, for both sexes.In 
times past the dangers of sexual activity were perceived in 
connection with involuntary violence and careless expendi¬ 
ture.They are now described more as the effect of a general 
fragility of the human body and its functioning.We can understand, given these conditions, the importance 
that the regimen of the aphrodisia was apt to assume in the 
management of one’s personal life.On this point, Rufus makes 
a noteworthy statement, which links together, quite explicitly,

the danger of sexual practice and the fundamental principle of 
the care of the self: “Those who indulge in sexual relations and 
especially those who indulge without much caution need to 
take care of themselves in a much more rigorous fashion than 
others, so that, by putting their body in the best possible 
condition, they might experience less the harmful effects of 
these relations” (he ek ton aphrodision blabe ).
