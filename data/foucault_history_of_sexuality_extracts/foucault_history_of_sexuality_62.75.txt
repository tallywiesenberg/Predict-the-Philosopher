The Regimen of 
Pleasures 


Sexual acts must therefore be placed under an extremely 
careful regimen.But this regimen is very different from a 
prescriptive system that would try to define a “natural,” legiti¬ 
mate, and acceptable form of practice.It is remarkable that 
almost nothing is said in these regimens about the type of 
sexual acts that one may engage in or about those which 
Nature disfavors.Rufus, for example, mentions relations with 
boys in passing.He also alludes to the positions the partners 
can take, but he translates the dangers of these positions di¬ 
rectly into quantitative terms: they would demand a greater 
expenditure of strength than the others.
