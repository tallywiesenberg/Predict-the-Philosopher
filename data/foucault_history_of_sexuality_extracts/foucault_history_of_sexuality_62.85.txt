The regimen of the aphrodisia and procreation.An en¬ 
tirely traditional theme said that noble offspring— euteknia — 
could not be engendered unless one took a certain number of 
precautions.The disorders of conception would be reflected in 
one’s progeny.Not only because the descendants would re¬ 
semble their parents, but because they would bear the charac¬ 
teristics of the act that brought them into existence.We recall 
the recommendations of Aristotle and Plato on this point.
