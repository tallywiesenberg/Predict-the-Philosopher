That the sexual act, in its procreative finality, requires a good 
deal of care and a meticulous preparation is a principle that 
one finds again in the medical regimens of the imperial epoch.These regimens prescribe a long-term preparation first of all.This involves a general conditioning of the body and the soul 
designed to produce or maintain in the individual the qualities 
with which the semen will need to be imbued and by which 
the embryo will need to be marked.One must form oneself as 
the prior image of the child one wishes to have.A passage 
from Athenaeus, cited by Oribasius, is very explicit on this 
point: those who intend to beget children must have body and 
soul in the best possible condition.
