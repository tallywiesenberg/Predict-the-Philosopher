In other words, the soul 
must be tranquil and completely free of pain, of worries ac¬ 
companied by fatigue, and of any other affliction; and the body 
must be healthy and not spoiled in any way.6 An immediate 
preparation is necessary as well: a period of restraint during 
which the sperm accumulates and gathers strength, while 
the urge acquires the necessary intensity (too-frequent sexual 
relations prevent the sperm from reaching the degree of elab¬

alimentary diet is recommended: no food that is too hot or too

thing is to choose “a time in which the body is neither in want 
nor overburdened, but in a satisfactory state in every respect” 
—both for physiological reasons (the harmful humors that 
rise up in the body may prevent the seed from adhering to the 
fundus of the uterus) and for ethical reasons (the embryo will 
be imbued with the condition of the procreators).There is, of course, a time more favorable than others in the 
woman’s cycle.
