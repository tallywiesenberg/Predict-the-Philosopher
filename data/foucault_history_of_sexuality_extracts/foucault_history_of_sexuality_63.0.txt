According to a metaphor that is already quite 
ancient and that will still do long service in Christianity, 
“every season is not propitious for sewing seed upon the land 
for the purpose of bringing forth fruit, so in humans too not 
every time is suitable for conception of the seed discharged in 
intercourse.” 8 Soranus places this favorable time immediately 
after menstruation.His argumentation rests on the metaphor 
—which is not personal to him, moreover—of the appetite.9 
The uterus is avid; it consumes, it loads itself with nutriment, 
sometimes with blood (the normal case), sometimes with seed 
(and fertilization occurs).To be procreative, the sexual act 
must take place at a favorable time in this alimentary rhythm.Not before menstruation, for “just as the stomach when over¬ 
burdened with some kind of material and turned to nausea is 
disposed to vomit what oppresses it and is averse to receiving 
food, so according to the same principle, the uterus, being 
congested at the time of menstruation, is well adapted for the 
evacuation of the blood which has flowed into it, but is unfitted 
for the reception and retention of the seed.” Not during men¬ 
strual evacuation, which constitutes a kind of natural vomit¬ 
ing, when the semen runs the risk of being swept out as well.
