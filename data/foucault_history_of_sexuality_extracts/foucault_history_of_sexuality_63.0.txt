century medicine that precocious sex would eventually result 
in sterility, impotence, frigidity, the inability to experience 
pleasure, or the deadening of the senses); by sexualizing 
childhood, the idea was established of a sex characterized 
essentially by the interplay of presence and absence, the visi¬ 
ble and the hidden; masturbation and the effects imputed to 
it were thought to reveal in a privileged way this interplay 
of presence and absence, of the visible and the hidden. 

In the psychiatrization of perversions, sex was related to 
biological functions and to an anatomo-physiological ma¬ 
chinery that gave it its “meaning,” that is, its finality; but it 
was also referred to an instinct which, through its peculiar 
development and according to the objects to which it could 
become attached, made it possible for perverse behavior pat¬ 
terns to arise and made their genesis intelligible. Thus “sex”

was defined by the interlacing of function and instinct, final¬ 
ity and signification; moreover, this was the form in which 
it was manifested, more clearly than anywhere else, in the 
model perversion, in that “fetishism” which, from at least as 
early as 1877, served as the guiding thread for analyzing all 
the other deviations. In it one could clearly perceive the way 
in which the instinct became fastened to an object in accord¬ 
ance with an individual’s historical adherence and biological 
inadequacy. Lastly, in the socialization of procreative behav¬ 
ior, “sex” was described as being caught between a law of 
reality (economic necessity being its most abrupt and imme¬ 
diate form) and an economy of pleasure which was always 
attempting to circumvent that law—when, that is, it did not 
ignore it altogether. The most notorious of “frauds,” coitus 
interruptus, represented the point where the insistence of the 
real forced an end to pleasure and where the pleasure found 
a way to surface despite the economy dictated by the real. It 
is apparent that the deployment of sexuality, with its differ¬ 
ent strategies, was what established this notion of “sex”; and 
in the four major forms of hysteria, onanism, fetishism, and 
interrupted coition, it showed this sex to be governed by the 
interplay of whole and part, principle and lack, absence and 
presence, excess and deficiency, by the function of instinct, 
finality, and meaning, of reality and pleasure. 

The theory thus generated performed a certain number of 
functions that made it indispensable. First, the notion of 
“sex” made it possible to group together, in an artificial 
unity, anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts, 
sensations, and pleasures, and it enabled one to make use of 
this fictitious unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent 
meaning, a secret to be discovered everywhere: sex was thus 
able to function as a unique signifier and as a universal 
signified. Further, by presenting itself in a unitary fashion, as 
anatomy and lack, as function and latency, as instinct and 
meaning, it was able to mark the line of contact between a 
knowledge of human sexuality and the biological sciences of

reproduction; thus, without really borrowing anything from 
the these sciences, excepting a few doubtful analogies, the 
knowledge of sexuality gained through proximity a guaran¬ 
tee of quasi-scientificity; but by virtue of this same proximity, 
some of the contents of biology and physiology were able to 
serve as a principle of normality for human sexuality. Fi¬ 
nally, the notion of sex brought about a fundamental rever¬ 
sal; it made it possible to invert the representation of the 
relationships of power to sexuality, causing the latter to ap¬ 
pear, not in its essential and positive relation to power, but 
as being rooted in a specific and irreducible urgency which 
power tries as best it can to dominate; thus the idea of “sex” 
makes it possible to evade what gives “power” its power; it 
enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo. Sex 
—that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret 
which seems to underlie all that we are, that point which 
enthralls us through the the power it manifests and the 
meaning it conceals, and which we ask to reveal what we are 
and to free us from what defines us—is doubtless but an ideal 
point made necessary by the deployment of sexuality and its 
operation. We must not make the mistake of thinking that 
sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces 
manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its 
surface of contact with power. On the contrary, sex is the 
most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a 
deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on 
bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensa¬ 
tions, and pleasures.
