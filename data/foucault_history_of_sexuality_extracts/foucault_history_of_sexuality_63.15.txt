It is also an obligation vis-a-vis 
themselves since it is advantageous for them to have offspring 
endowed with the best qualities.These obligations that sur¬ 
round procreation define a whole set of possible errors, which 
are at the same time faults.And they are so numerous, they 
bring in so many different factors, that few procreations would 
be successful were it not for Nature’s ability to compensate for 
these failings and to prevent disasters.At least this is how 
Galen justifies both the necessity of taking a large number of 
precautions and the fact that in spite of everything many 
births come off well: “How frequently in the fathers that beget 
and the mothers that bear us it must be not error that is rare 
but right-doing.For drunkards consort with drunkards, and 
men do not know their own whereabouts from repletion with 
women in the same state.
