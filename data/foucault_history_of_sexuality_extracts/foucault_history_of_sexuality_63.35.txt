The physicians prescribe, in keeping with tradition, a 
life of intense physical exercise.Thus Athenaeus: “Since the 
production of sperm begins at that age [fourteen] and since 
young people have very strong cravings which incite them to 
sexual intercourse, physical exercises should be very numer¬ 
ous, so that tiring the body and the soul very quickly, they 
may repress their desires from the beginning.” 19 

The problem for girls is a little different.The practice of 
early marriage doubtless caused people to concede that the 
first sexual relations and childbearing could occur as soon as 
menstruation was regularly established.20 This is the opinion 
of Soranus, who advises reliance on organic criteria in setting 
the age for marriage and not on the desires of the girls them¬ 
selves.Depending on education, these desires can awaken 
before the body is ready; “since the female conceives seed into 
the substance of a living being,” there is a danger when the 
body of the woman has not reached the maturity necessary to 
this function; so it is good that she remain a virgin until 
menstruation has been established spontaneously.
