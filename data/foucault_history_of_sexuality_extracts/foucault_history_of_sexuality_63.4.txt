The Care of the Self 


physicians envisage a much later date.Thus Rufus of Ephesus 
considers that a pregnancy before the age of eighteen risks 
being unfavorable to mother and child alike.He recalls that 
this is the age recommended long ago by Hesiod; and he points 
out that this age—quite late in the eyes of some—did not have, 
in a former time, the drawbacks that it may have subsequently 
assumed.In those days, women led a life just as active as men; 
it is overeating and idleness that cause problems in unmarried 
girls, making it desirable for them to have sexual relations, 
which may facilitate the menstrual flow.The solution Rufus 
suggests, then, is a relatively late marriage (at about eighteen), 
but a marriage prepared for by a whole regimen that ought to 
accompany the life of the young girl even before puberty.
