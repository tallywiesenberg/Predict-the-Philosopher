The theory thus generated performed a certain number of 
functions that made it indispensable. First, the notion of 
“sex” made it possible to group together, in an artificial 
unity, anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts, 
sensations, and pleasures, and it enabled one to make use of 
this fictitious unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent 
meaning, a secret to be discovered everywhere: sex was thus 
able to function as a unique signifier and as a universal 
signified. Further, by presenting itself in a unitary fashion, as 
anatomy and lack, as function and latency, as instinct and 
meaning, it was able to mark the line of contact between a 
knowledge of human sexuality and the biological sciences of

reproduction; thus, without really borrowing anything from 
the these sciences, excepting a few doubtful analogies, the 
knowledge of sexuality gained through proximity a guaran¬ 
tee of quasi-scientificity; but by virtue of this same proximity, 
some of the contents of biology and physiology were able to 
serve as a principle of normality for human sexuality. Fi¬ 
nally, the notion of sex brought about a fundamental rever¬ 
sal; it made it possible to invert the representation of the 
relationships of power to sexuality, causing the latter to ap¬ 
pear, not in its essential and positive relation to power, but 
as being rooted in a specific and irreducible urgency which 
power tries as best it can to dominate; thus the idea of “sex” 
makes it possible to evade what gives “power” its power; it 
enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo. Sex 
—that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret 
which seems to underlie all that we are, that point which 
enthralls us through the the power it manifests and the 
meaning it conceals, and which we ask to reveal what we are 
and to free us from what defines us—is doubtless but an ideal 
point made necessary by the deployment of sexuality and its 
operation. We must not make the mistake of thinking that 
sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces 
manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its 
surface of contact with power. On the contrary, sex is the 
most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a 
deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on 
bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensa¬ 
tions, and pleasures.
