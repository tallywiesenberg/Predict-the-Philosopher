25 But, on the other hand, one must avoid copious meals 
and excessive quantities of drink.The time of digestion is 
always harmful: “That is why coitus in the middle of the night 
is deceptive, because then the food is not yet elaborated; the 
same is true of coitus that one has early in the morning, 
because there still may be ill-digested food in the stomach and 
because all the superfluities have not yet been evacuated 
through the urine and the feces.” 26 So that, all things consid¬ 
ered, it is after a moderate meal and before sleep—or possibly 
before the afternoon nap—that the time will be most favorable 
for sexual intercourse.According to Rufus, Nature herself 
indicated her preference for this time by giving the body its 
strongest excitation then.Furthermore, if one wishes to have 
children, it is appropriate that the man “engage in sexual 
intercourse after having eaten and drunk to satisfaction, 
whereas the woman ought to follow a less invigorating diet”; 
indeed, it is necessary that “the one give and the other re¬ 
ceive.” 27 Galen is of the same opinion: he recommends that 
time when one is going to sleep, after having enjoyed “a solid 
meal but one that does not cause discomfort.” In this way the 
food is sufficient to nourish and strengthen the body, and sleep 
allows one to repair the fatigue; further, this is the best mo¬ 
ment for conceiving children “because the woman retains the 
sperm better while sleeping”; finally, this is in fact the hour 
for which Nature herself indicates her preference by giving 
rise then to desire.28 * 

*It may be added that for Celsus, night is preferable "but care should be taken that 
by day it not be immediately followed by a meal, and at night not immediately 
followed by work and wakefulness.
