principle that the natures most suited for coition are those 
which are “more or less hot and moist”; in return, sexual 
activity is rather unfavorable for constitutions that are cold

proper nourishment.Around sexual activity, and in order to 
preserve the balance it risks upsetting, one must keep to a 
whole mode of living.
