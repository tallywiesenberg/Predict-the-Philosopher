It is helpful to drink pale red wine, to 
eat oven bread made from bran (its moisture is useful for 
preparation and regulation); to consume, in the meat category, 
young goat, lamb, hen, grouse, partridge, goose, duck; in the 
seafood category, octopus and mollusks—together with tur¬ 
nips, broad beans, green beans, chick peas (for their heat), and 
grapes (for their moisture).As for the activities to which one 
should resort, they include excursions, on foot or horseback, 
and running, but neither too fast nor too slow; but no violent 
exercises, no gesticulation as in javelin throwing (which di¬ 
verts the nutritive material to other parts of the body), no 
excessively hot baths, no heating and cooling off; no strenuous 
work.One should also avoid anything that would contribute 
to tiring the body—anger, joy that is too great, and pain.30
