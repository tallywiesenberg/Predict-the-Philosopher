It is as if the body dictated to the body.And yet the soul has its part to play as well, and the physicians 
bring it into the scheme of things.For it is the soul that 
constantly risks carrying the body beyond its own mechanics 
and its elementary needs; it is the soul that prompts one to 
choose the times that are not suitable, to act in questionable 
circumstances, to contravene natural dispositions.If humans 
need a regimen that takes into account, with such meticulous¬ 
ness, all the elements of physiology, this is because they always 
tend to be led astray by their imaginings, their passions, and 
their loves.Even the proper age for beginning sexual inter¬ 
course gets confused in girls and boys alike; education and 
habits can cause desire to appear at the wrong time.
