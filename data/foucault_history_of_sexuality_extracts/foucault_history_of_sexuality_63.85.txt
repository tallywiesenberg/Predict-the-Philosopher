In the medical regimen it is not a question of eliminat¬ 
ing desire.Nature herself placed it in all the animal species as 
a spur for exciting both sexes and for attracting them to one 
another.Nothing would be more unnatural, therefore, noth¬ 
ing more harmful than to seek to have the aphrodisia escape 
the natural force of desire; one must never—out of a spirit of 
debauchery or in order to circumvent the lost vigor of age— 
try to force nature.One must not have sexual relations aneu 
epithumein, without feeling desire: such is the advice of Rufus 
in the treatise On Satyriasis.But this desire is twofold: it 
appears in the body and it appears in the soul.
