The problem 
of regimen consists in bringing about an exact correlation of

nouncement in this regard: “It is best that the man indulge in 
sexual intercourse when he is pressed at the same time by the 
soul’s desire and the body’s need.” 3 

It sometimes happens that this natural correlation is jeop¬ 
ardized through the action of the body itself.The body loses 
control of itself, as it were.Nothing in the soul corresponds
