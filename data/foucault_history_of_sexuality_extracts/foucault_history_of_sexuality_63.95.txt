It gives way to a kind of pure convulsion.The 
sexual act then becomes altogether “paroxysmal,” as Rufus 
says.4 It is to this purely physical excitation that Rufus seems 
to allude when he speaks of the hormai that accompany the 
warning signs of mania or epilepsy.5 The same phenomenon 
occurs, but in a different form, in satyriasis or gonorrhea: the 
sexual organs become inflamed by themselves, in the first of 
these diseases; and in the other, “without an act, without a 
nocturnal image, a profusion of semen is discharged in abun¬ 
dance”; the patient, transported by the crazed mechanics of 
his body, becomes exhausted and “dies of consumption after 
a certain time.” 6 

But the soul, conversely, can escape the forms and limits of 
the desire manifested in the body.The term Rufus and Galen 
use to designate this excess is significant: it is the word doxa.
