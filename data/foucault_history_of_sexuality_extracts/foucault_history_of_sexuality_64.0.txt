The soul, instead of attending only to the wants and needs of 
the body, allows itself to be enticed by representations that are 
peculiar to it and have no counterpart in the organism: repre¬ 
sentations that are vain and empty (kenai).Just as the body 
must not let itself be carried away without the correlative of 
a desire in the soul, the latter must not go beyond what the 
body demands and what its needs dictate.But in the first case, 
what is involved is an illness, which remedies may be able to 
cure; in the second, what is involved above all is an ethical 
regimen, which ought to be applied to oneself.Rufus proposes 
a formula for this: “subdue the soul and make it obey the 
body.” 7 

A paradoxical proposition, if one thinks of the eminently 
traditional theme of the soul that must not be seduced by the 
entreaties of the body.But it has to be grasped in its precise 
theoretical and medical context, which was inspired perhaps 
by Stoicism.
