It might be added that “sex” performs yet another func¬ 
tion that runs through and sustains the ones we have just 
examined. Its role in this instance is more practical than 
theoretical. It is through sex—in fact, an imaginary point 
determined by the deployment of sexuality—that each 
individual has to pass in order to have access to his own 
intelligibility (seeing that it is both the hidden aspect and the 
generative principle of meaning), to the whole of his body

The History of Sexuality 


(since it is a real and threatened part of it, while symbolically 
constituting the whole), to his identity (since it joins the force 
of a drive to the singularity of a history). Through a reversal 
that doubtless had its surreptitious beginnings long ago—it 
was already making itself felt at the time of the Christian 
pastoral of the flesh—we have arrived at the point where we 
expect our intelligibility to come from what was for many 
centuries thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body 
from what was long considered its stigma and likened to a 
wound; our identity from what was perceived as an obscure 
and nameless urge. Hence the importance we ascribe to it, 
the reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we 
take to know it. Hence the fact that over the centuries it has 
become more important than our soul, more important al¬ 
most than our life; and so it is that all the world’s enigmas 
appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in 
each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than 
any other. The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been 
instilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as 
follows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the 
truth and the sovereignty of sex. Sex is worth dying for. It 
is in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued 
with the death instinct. When a long while ago the West 
discovered love, it bestowed on it a value high enough to 
make death acceptable; nowadays it is sex that claims this 
equivalence, the highest of all. And while the deployment of 
sexuality permits the techniques of power to invest life, the 
fictitious point of sex, itself marked by that deployment, 
exerts enough charm on everyone for them to accept hearing 
the grumble of death within it. 

By creating the imaginary element that is “sex,” the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality established one of its most essential
