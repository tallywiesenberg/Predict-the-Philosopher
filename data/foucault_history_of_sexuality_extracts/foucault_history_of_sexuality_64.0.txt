It might be added that “sex” performs yet another func¬ 
tion that runs through and sustains the ones we have just 
examined. Its role in this instance is more practical than 
theoretical. It is through sex—in fact, an imaginary point 
determined by the deployment of sexuality—that each 
individual has to pass in order to have access to his own 
intelligibility (seeing that it is both the hidden aspect and the 
generative principle of meaning), to the whole of his body

The History of Sexuality 


(since it is a real and threatened part of it, while symbolically 
constituting the whole), to his identity (since it joins the force 
of a drive to the singularity of a history). Through a reversal 
that doubtless had its surreptitious beginnings long ago—it 
was already making itself felt at the time of the Christian 
pastoral of the flesh—we have arrived at the point where we 
expect our intelligibility to come from what was for many 
centuries thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body 
from what was long considered its stigma and likened to a 
wound; our identity from what was perceived as an obscure 
and nameless urge. Hence the importance we ascribe to it, 
the reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we 
take to know it. Hence the fact that over the centuries it has 
become more important than our soul, more important al¬ 
most than our life; and so it is that all the world’s enigmas 
appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in 
each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than 
any other. The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been 
instilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as 
follows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the 
truth and the sovereignty of sex. Sex is worth dying for. It 
is in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued 
with the death instinct. When a long while ago the West 
discovered love, it bestowed on it a value high enough to 
make death acceptable; nowadays it is sex that claims this 
equivalence, the highest of all. And while the deployment of 
sexuality permits the techniques of power to invest life, the 
fictitious point of sex, itself marked by that deployment, 
exerts enough charm on everyone for them to accept hearing 
the grumble of death within it. 

By creating the imaginary element that is “sex,” the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality established one of its most essential 
internal operating principles: the desire for sex—the desire to 
have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to 
articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth. It con¬ 
stituted “sex” itself as something desirable. And it is this 



Right of Death and Power over Life

desirability of sex that attaches each one of us to the injunc¬ 
tion to know it, to reveal its law and its power; it is this 
desirability that makes us think we are affirming the rights 
of our sex against all power, when in fact we are fastened to 
the deployment of sexuality that has lifted up from deep 
within us a sort of mirage in which we think we see ourselves 
reflected—the dark shimmer of sex. 

“It is sex,” said Kate in The Plumed Serpent. “How won¬ 
derful sex can be, when men keep it powerful and sacred, and 
it fills the world! like sunshine through and through one!” 

So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency 
of sex; but rather show how “sex” is historically subordinate 
to sexuality. We must not place sex on the side of reality, and 
sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is 
a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the 
notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its opera¬ 
tion. We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says 
no to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid 
out by the general deployment of sexuality. It is the agency 
of sex that we must break away from, if we aim—through a 
tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality—to 
counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleas¬ 
ures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibil¬ 
ity of resistance. The rallying point for the counterattack 
against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex- 
desire, but bodies and pleasures. 

“There has been so much action in the past,” said D. H. 
Lawrence, “especially sexual action, a wearying repetition 
over and over, without a corresponding thought, a corre¬ 
sponding realization. Now our business is to realize sex. 
Today the full conscious realization of sex is even more 
important than the act itself.” 

Perhaps one day people will wonder at this. They will not
