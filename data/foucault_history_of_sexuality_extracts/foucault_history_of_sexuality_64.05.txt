The voluntary submission of the soul to the body 
should be understood as obedience to a rationality that has 
presided over the natural order and has designed, for its own 
purposes, the mechanics of the body.It is from this natural 
reason that the doxai risk leading the soul astray by creating 
extraneous desires; it is to this reason that the reasonable

medical regimen, based on the true knowledge of living crea¬ 
tures, must be attuned.In this context the animal example, 
which so often served to disqualify the appetites of man, can 
on the contrary constitute a model for conduct.This is be¬ 
cause in their sexual regimen animals follow the dictates of the 
body, but never anything more or anything else.What directs 
them, explains Rufus, and hence what ought also to guide 
humans, are not the doxai, but the “preludes of a nature that 
needs evacuation.” For Galen, similarly, animals are not led 
to seek sexual union by the “belief”— doxa —that “pleasure is 
a good thing”; they are prompted to desire sexual relations 
“for the sake of the discharge, since the retention of semen is 
a burden to them.” For them, there is no difference between 
that which brings them to sexual intercourse and that which 
“makes them regard the elimination of stool and urine as a 
natural act.” 8 

The medical regimen proposes, then, a sort of animalization 
of the epithumia; that is, a subordination, as strict as possible, 
of the soul’s desire to the body’s needs; an ethics of desire that 
is modeled on a natural philosophy of excretions; and the 
tendency toward an ideal point where the soul, purified of all 
its vain representations, no longer gives its attention to any¬ 
thing but the austere economy of organic functions.
