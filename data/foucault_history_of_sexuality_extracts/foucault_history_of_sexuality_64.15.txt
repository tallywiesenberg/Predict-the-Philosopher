constant excitation.Galen advises him first to relieve himself 
physically by excreting the accumulated semen; then—once 
the body is purified—to let nothing enter the mind that might 
deposit images there: “to refrain completely from spectacles, 
not to tell stories or recall memories which could stimulate his 
sexual desire.” 10 

These dangerous images, which also give rise in the soul to 
“empty” desires, having no correlation with the needs of the 
body, are of several types.There are of course the dream 
images, which the physicians seem especially concerned about 
when these images are accompanied by emissions—whence 
the often repeated advice not to sleep on one’s back, not to 
drink too much or eat before sleeping, and to keep the mind 
at rest when one is going to go to bed.In any case Rufus of 
Ephesus makes this an important item in the regimen of those 
suffering from satyriasis: “Sleep on your side rather than on 
your back.” 11 * Among the images to be avoided are those 
which can be seen at the theater; those which are suggested 
by reading, singing, music, and dancing, and which insinuate 
themselves into the mind without there being anything that 
corresponds to them in the needs of the body.
