Galen thus 
claims to have observed symptoms of satyriasis in subjects 
“who fail to get rid of an excess of blood, particularly when 
they do not refrain from erotic ideas.Likewise do persons 
suffer who are chaste by nature and accustomed to self-control 
over a long time but who indulge in imaginings in order to 
stimulate themselves by such spectacles and memories.The 
condition of the genital organs of these patients is quite con¬ 
trary to that of others who never indulge in erotic ideas.” 13 

But visual perceptions must also be included under this 
term phantasia, in keeping with a philosophical usage.There 
is a danger not just in imagining or remembering the aphro- 
disia, but also in perceiving them.It is a very old theme of 
traditional modesty that the aphrodisia ought to take place at 
night and in darkness rather than in broad daylight.
