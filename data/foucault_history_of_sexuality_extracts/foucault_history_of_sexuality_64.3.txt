Propertius finds that the play of Venus loses its charm 
in darkness: “why make love in the dark ...naked Endymion 
won the love of Phoebus’ sister and held in his arms the 
goddess naked.” 15 By the same token, the gaze, light, and 
image were considered dangerous.Dangerous as far as strict 
morals were concerned: the same Propertius believes that im¬ 
modesty spread when images were introduced into people’s 
houses.
