The approach he 
recommends is clearly Stoic: it is a matter of considering 
pleasure as nothing more than the accompaniment of the act; 
it must never be taken as a reason to accomplish the act.“That 
pleasure is a good thing” is, as we have seen, for Galen, a doxa 
that animals do not have (which ensures that their behavior 
will have a natural limit).On the other hand, those humans 
who have such an opinion run the risk of pursuing the aphro¬ 
disia for the pleasure they provide; consequently, they are 
liable to become attached to them and always to want to 
repeat them.For a reasonable regimen, the task therefore is to elide 
pleasure as a sought-after object: to indulge in the aphrodisia 
independently of the attraction of pleasure and as if it did not 
exist.The only goal that reason should set itself is the one 
indicated by the state of the body, according to its own purga¬ 
tive requirements.
