internal operating principles: the desire for sex—the desire to 
have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to 
articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth. It con¬ 
stituted “sex” itself as something desirable. And it is this

desirability of sex that attaches each one of us to the injunc¬ 
tion to know it, to reveal its law and its power; it is this 
desirability that makes us think we are affirming the rights 
of our sex against all power, when in fact we are fastened to 
the deployment of sexuality that has lifted up from deep 
within us a sort of mirage in which we think we see ourselves 
reflected—the dark shimmer of sex. 

“It is sex,” said Kate in The Plumed Serpent. “How won¬ 
derful sex can be, when men keep it powerful and sacred, and 
it fills the world! like sunshine through and through one!” 

So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency 
of sex; but rather show how “sex” is historically subordinate 
to sexuality. We must not place sex on the side of reality, and 
sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is 
a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the 
notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its opera¬ 
tion. We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says 
no to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid 
out by the general deployment of sexuality. It is the agency 
of sex that we must break away from, if we aim—through a 
tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality—to 
counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleas¬ 
ures, and knowledges, in their multiplicity and their possibil¬ 
ity of resistance. The rallying point for the counterattack 
against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex- 
desire, but bodies and pleasures. 

“There has been so much action in the past,” said D. H. 
Lawrence, “especially sexual action, a wearying repetition 
over and over, without a corresponding thought, a corre¬ 
sponding realization. Now our business is to realize sex. 
Today the full conscious realization of sex is even more 
important than the act itself.” 

Perhaps one day people will wonder at this. They will not
