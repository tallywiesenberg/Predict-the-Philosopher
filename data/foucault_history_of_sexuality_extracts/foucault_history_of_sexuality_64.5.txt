“It is evident that chaste persons [tous so- 
phronas] do not indulge in sexual intercourse for pleasure, but 
with the intention to relieve this urge, as if this were not 
associated with pleasure.” This is precisely the lesson that 
Galen derives from the famous gesture of Diogenes: without 
even waiting for the prostitute whom he had asked to come, 
the philosopher rid himself of the humor that inconvenienced 
him.In doing this, he wished, according to Galen, to dis¬ 
charge his sperm “without seeking the pleasure that accompa¬ 
nies that emission.”’ 5

The Care of the Self 


We may note in passing the very modest place that mastur¬ 
bation and the solitary pleasures occupied in these medical 
regimens—as was generally the case in all the moral reflec¬ 
tions of the Greeks and the Romans concerning sexual activ¬ 
ity.When masturbation appears, which is rather rare, it is in 
a positive form: an act of natural elimination, which has the 
value both of a philosophical lesson and a necessary remedy.One thinks of Dio of Prusa reporting how Diogenes jokingly 
praised the act he performed in public: an act that, done in 
time, would have made the Trojan War unnecessary; an act 
Nature herself recommends to us through the example of the 
fish; a reasonable act, for it depends on us alone, just as we 
have no need of anyone to scratch our leg for us; an act, finally, 
for which we are indebted to the gods, for it was they who 
showed us how—Hermes in particular, who taught the trick 
to Pan, hopelessly in love with the inaccessible Echo.And the 
shepherds seem to have learned it subsequently from Pan.
