is an act of Nature herself, one that, without recourse to 
passions and artifices and in complete independence, corre¬ 
sponds strictly to need.In Western literature—beginning with 
Christian monasticism—masturbation remains associated 
with the chimera of the imagination and its dangers.It is the 
very form of unnatural pleasure that humans invented in order 
to exceed the limits assigned to them.In a medical ethics 
anxious, like that of the first centuries of our era, to gear sexual 
activity to the basic needs of the body, the act of solitary 
purgation constitutes the barest form of the uselessness of 
desire, images, and pleasure.1.
