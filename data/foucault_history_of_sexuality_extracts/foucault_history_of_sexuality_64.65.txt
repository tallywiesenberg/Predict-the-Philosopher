But it is a trait manifested by all Greek and 
Roman medicine to accord much more space to the dietetics 
of alimentation than to that of sex.For this medicine, the 
thing that matters is eating and drinking.A whole develop¬ 
ment—evident in Christian monasticism—will be necessary 
before the preoccupation with sex will begin to match the 
preoccupation with food.But alimentary abstentions and fasts 
will long remain fundamental.And it will be an important 
moment for the history of ethics in European societies when 
apprehension about sex and its regimen will significantly out¬ 
weigh the rigor of alimentary prescriptions.
