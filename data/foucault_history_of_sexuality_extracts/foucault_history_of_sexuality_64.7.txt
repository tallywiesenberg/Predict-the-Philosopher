In the Roman 
epoch, at all events, the regimen of sexual pleasures holds a 
relatively limited place next to the great alimentary regimen, 
just as, moreover, these pleasures themselves are associated in 
moral thought and social ritual with the delights of eating and 
drinking.The banquet, an occasion shared by gluttony, 
drunkenness, and love, is a direct testimony of this associa¬ 
tion; the latter is attested indirectly by the inverse ritual of the 
philosophical symposium, where the food is always measured, 
the drunkenness is still capable of truth, and the love is an 
object of reasonable discourses.2.In these medical regimens, one sees a certain “patholog- 
ization” of the sexual act take shape.But there must be no 
misunderstanding on this point: the development in question 
is in no way similar to the one that occurred much later in 
Western societies, when sexual behavior was perceived as a 
bearer of unhealthy deviations.
