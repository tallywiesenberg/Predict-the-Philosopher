They describe it rather as a process 
in which the individual is passively overcome by the mech¬ 
anisms of the body and the movements of the soul, so that he 
must reestablish his mastery by means of a precise adjustment 
to the needs of nature alone.It is important to understand that 
this medicine of the chresis aphrodision did not aim to delimit 
the “pathological” forms of sexual behavior: rather, it uncov¬ 
ered, at the root of sexual acts, an element of passivity that was 
also a source of illness, according to the double meaning of the 
word pathos.The sexual act is not an evil; it manifests a 
permanent focus of possible ills.3.A medical science of this sort requires an extreme vigi¬ 
lance toward sexual activity.
