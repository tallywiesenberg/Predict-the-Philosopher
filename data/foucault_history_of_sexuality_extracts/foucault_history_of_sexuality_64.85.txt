to a decipherment of that activity in its origin and unfolding; 
it is not a matter of the subject’s knowing precisely how things 
are with his own desire, with the movements that lead him to 
the sexual act, with the choices he makes, with the forms of 
acts he commits or the modes of pleasure he experiences.The 
attention he must give is that which keeps him mindful of the

expected to rediscover the obscure processes of desire working 
within him; he needs to recognize the numerous complex 
conditions that must be jointly present if one is to perform the 
acts of pleasure in an appropriate manner, without danger or 
harm.He must address a discourse of “truth” to himself.But 
this discourse does not have the function of telling the subject

the truth about himself; it should teach him, given what sexual 
acts are by nature, how to resort to them in a way that con¬
