Georges 
Canguilhem said that “the cause of the cure” for Aristotle 
“was the form of health in one’s medical activity”; that it was 
not the physician but rather “health that cured the patient”; 
and that, broadly speaking, “the responsibility for a technical 
production did not belong to the artisan but to the art ... ; 
the Art, which is to say, the nondeliberative finality of a 
natural logos.” 21 Similarly, one might say that the regimen of 
the aphrodisia, the regimen of their distribution, as proposed 
by medicine, needed to be nothing more nor less than the form 
of their nature present to thought, their truth dwelling in 
conduct as its constant prescription.4.Between these dietetic recommendations and the pre¬ 
cepts that are to be found later, in Christian ethics and medical 
thought, the analogies are numerous: the principle of a strict 
economy aiming at scarcity; a dread of individual misfortunes 
or collective ills that can be caused by disorderly sexual behav¬ 
ior; the need for a rigorous mastery of desires, for a struggle 
against images and a disallowance of pleasure as the goal of 
sexual intercourse.These analogies are not distant resem¬ 
blances.Several continuities can be identified.
