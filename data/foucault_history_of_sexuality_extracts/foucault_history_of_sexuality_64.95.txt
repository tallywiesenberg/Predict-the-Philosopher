Certain of them 
are indirect, relayed through philosophical doctrines: the rule 
according to which pleasure must not be a goal was doubtless 
conveyed into Christianity more by philosophers than by 
physicians.But there are also direct continuities.The treatise 
by Basil of Ancyra on virginity—its author is thought to have 
been a physician—refers to considerations that are clearly 
medical.Saint Augustine makes use of Soranus in his polemic 
against Julian of Eclana.One must not forget, either, the 
explicit references to Roman and Greek medicine that were 
made in the eighteenth century and the first half of the nine¬ 
teenth, during the time of a major new development in the 
pathology of sex.
