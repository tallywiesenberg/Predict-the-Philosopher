The History of Sexuality 


found the time and the infinite patience to inquire so anxi¬ 
ously concerning the actual state of sex; people will smile 
perhaps when they recall that here were men—meaning our¬ 
selves—who believed that therein resided a truth every bit as 
precious as the one they had already demanded from the 
earth, the stars, and the pure forms of their thought; people 
will be surprised at the eagerness with which we went about 
pretending to rouse from its slumber a sexuality which every¬ 
thing—our discourses, our customs, our institutions, our 
regulations, our knowledges—was busy producing in the 
light of day and broadcasting to noisy accompaniment. And 
people will ask themselves why we were so bent on ending 
the rule of silence regarding what was the noisiest of our 
preoccupations. In retrospect, this noise may appear to have 
been out of place, but how much stranger will seem our 
persistence in interpreting it as but the refusal to speak and 
the order to remain silent. People will wonder what could 
have made us so presumptuous; they will look for the reasons 
that might explain why we prided ourselves on being the first 
to grant sex the importance we say is its due and how we 
came to congratulate ourselves for finally—in the twentieth 
century—having broken free of a long period of harsh repres¬ 
sion, a protracted Christian asceticism, greedily and fastidi¬ 
ously adapted to the imperatives of bourgeois economy. And 
what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and 
the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the 
centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling 
sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon 
sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when 
in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality. 

People will be amused at the reproach of pansexualism 
that was once aimed at Freud and psychoanalysis. But the 
ones who will appear to have been blind will perhaps be not 
so much those who formulated the objection as those who 
discounted it out of hand, as if it merely expressed the fears 
of an outmoded prudishness. For the first, after all, were only

taken unawares by a process which had begun long before 
and by which, unbeknown to them, they were already sur¬ 
rounded on all sides; what they had attributed solely to the 
genius of Freud had already gone through a long stage of 
preparation; they had gotten their dates wrong as to the 
establishment, in our society, of a general deployment of 
sexuality. But the others were mistaken concerning the na¬ 
ture of the process; they believed that Freud had at last, 
through a sudden reversal, restored to sex the rightful share 
which it had been denied for so long; they had not seen how 
the good genius of Freud had placed it at one of the critical 
points marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the 
strategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effec¬ 
tive he was—worthy of the greatest spiritual fathers and 
directors of the classical period—in giving a new impetus to 
the secular injunction to study sex and transform it into 
discourse. We are often reminded of the countless procedures 
which Christianity once employed to make us detest the 
body; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for 
centuries to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it 
desirable and everything said about it precious. Let us con¬ 
sider the stratagems by which we were induced to apply all 
our skills to discovering its secrets, by which we were at¬ 
tached to the obligation to draw out its truth, and made 
guilty for having failed to recognize it for so long. These 
devices are what ought to make us wonder today. Moreover, 
we need to consider the possibility that one day, perhaps, in 
a different economy of bodies and pleasures, people will no 
longer quite understand how the ruses of sexuality, and the 
power that sustains its organization, were able to subject us 
to that austere monarchy of sex, so that we became dedicated 
to the endless task of forcing its secret, of exacting the truest 
of confessions from a shadow. 

The irony of this deployment is in having us believe that 
our “liberation” is in the balance.
