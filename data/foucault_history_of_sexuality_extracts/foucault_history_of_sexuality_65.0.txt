The History of Sexuality 


found the time and the infinite patience to inquire so anxi¬ 
ously concerning the actual state of sex; people will smile 
perhaps when they recall that here were men—meaning our¬ 
selves—who believed that therein resided a truth every bit as 
precious as the one they had already demanded from the 
earth, the stars, and the pure forms of their thought; people 
will be surprised at the eagerness with which we went about 
pretending to rouse from its slumber a sexuality which every¬ 
thing—our discourses, our customs, our institutions, our 
regulations, our knowledges—was busy producing in the 
light of day and broadcasting to noisy accompaniment. And 
people will ask themselves why we were so bent on ending 
the rule of silence regarding what was the noisiest of our 
preoccupations. In retrospect, this noise may appear to have 
been out of place, but how much stranger will seem our 
persistence in interpreting it as but the refusal to speak and 
the order to remain silent. People will wonder what could 
have made us so presumptuous; they will look for the reasons 
that might explain why we prided ourselves on being the first 
to grant sex the importance we say is its due and how we 
came to congratulate ourselves for finally—in the twentieth 
century—having broken free of a long period of harsh repres¬ 
sion, a protracted Christian asceticism, greedily and fastidi¬ 
ously adapted to the imperatives of bourgeois economy. And 
what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and 
the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the 
centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling 
sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon 
sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when 
in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality. 

People will be amused at the reproach of pansexualism 
that was once aimed at Freud and psychoanalysis. But the 
ones who will appear to have been blind will perhaps be not 
so much those who formulated the objection as those who 
discounted it out of hand, as if it merely expressed the fears 
of an outmoded prudishness. For the first, after all, were only
