Should one 
suppose that the choice of the matrimonial life and the way 
one was expected to conduct oneself in it occasioned in this 
period more apprehension and that they were more carefully 
problematized?It is doubtless not possible to give an answer 
in quantitative terms.It does seem, however, that the art of 
leading the married life was considered and defined in several 
important texts in a relatively new way.The first change 
appears to consist in the fact that the art of matrimonial 
existence, while continuing to be concerned with the house¬ 
hold, its management, the birth and procreation of children, 
places an increasing value on a particular element in the midst 
of this ensemble: the personal relationship between husband 
and wife, the tie that joins them, their behavior toward each 
other.And this relationship, rather than borrowing its impor¬ 
tance from the other exigencies of the life of a master of a 
household, seems to be regarded as a primary and fundamen¬ 
tal element around which all the others are organized, from 
which they derive, and to which they owe their strength.
