These problems are still treated in a rather discreet 
and allusive manner, but the fact remains that one finds, in 
authors like Plutarch, a concern with defining a certain way 
for marriage partners to act, to conduct themselves in pleasure 
relations.Here the interest in procreation is combined with 
other significations and values, which have to do with love, 
affection, understanding, and mutual sympathy.Once again, I am not claiming that such behaviors or senti¬ 
ments were unknown in the classical period and that they 
appeared subsequently: to establish changes of that order 
would demand an entirely different documentation and very 
different analyses as well.But it does appear—if we are to 
believe the texts we possess—that these attitudes, these ways 
of behaving, of acting and feeling, became themes of prob- 
lematization, objects of philosophical discussion, and elements 
of a deliberative art of self-conduct.2 A stylistics of living as 
a couple emerges from the traditional precepts of matrimonial 
management: it can be observed rather clearly in an art of 
conjugal relationship, in a doctrine of sexual monopoly, and 
in an aesthetics of shared pleasures.
