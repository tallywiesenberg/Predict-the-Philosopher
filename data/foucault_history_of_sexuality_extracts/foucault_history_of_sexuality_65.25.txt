The Marriage Tie 


In several of these reflections on marriage, and particularly 
in the Stoic texts of the first two centuries, one discerns the 
elaboration of a certain model of relationship between spouses.Not that there is any notion of imposing new institutional 
forms on marriage, or any suggestion of fitting it into a differ¬ 
ent legal framework.But, without calling the traditional struc¬ 
tures into question, there is an attempt to define a mode of 
coexistence between husband and wife, a modality of relations 
between them, and a way of living together that are rather 
different from what was proposed in the classical texts.Schematizing a good deal, perhaps, and employing a some¬ 
what anachronistic vocabulary, we may say that marriage is 
no longer conceived simply as a “matrimonial form” fixing the 
complementarity of roles in the management of the house¬ 
hold, but also and above all as a “marriage tie” and a personal 
relationship between the man and the woman.This art of 
married living defines a relation that is dual in its form, uni¬ 
versal in its value, and specific in its intensity and its strength.
