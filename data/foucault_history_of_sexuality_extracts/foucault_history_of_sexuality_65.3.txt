1.A dual relation.If there is one thing that is in conform¬ 
ity with nature (kata physin) it is marrying, says Musonius 
Rufus.’ And in order to explain that nothing could be more 
essential than the discourse he is undertaking on the subject 
of marriage, Hierocles declares that it is Nature who causes 
our species to prefer that form of community.2

These principles merely restated a lesson that was entirely 
traditional.The naturalness of marriage, though it was dis¬ 
puted by certain philosophical schools, and by the Cynics in 
particular, had been broadly founded on a series of reasons: 
the indispensable joining of male and female for procreation; 
the necessity of prolonging this conjunction, of transforming 
it into a stable union in order to ensure the education of 
offspring; the combination of assistance, comforts, and plea¬ 
sures that married life can provide, with its services and its 
obligations; and lastly, the forming of the family as the basic 
unit of the city.
