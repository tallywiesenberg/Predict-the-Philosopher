A passage from the treatise On the Purpose of 
Marriage is revealing in this connection.3 It begins with the 
duality of the goals of marriage: descendants to beget, a life 
to share.But Musonius immediately adds that while procreaÂ¬ 
tion may very well be an important thing, it could not in itself 
justify marriage.Recalling an objection made often by the 
Cynics, he points out that if it were only a matter of begetting 
offspring, humans could very well behave like the animals: 
join together and immediately separate.If they do not do so, 
it is because the essential thing for them is community: a 
companionship in which they exchange mutual care, in which 
they compete in attentiveness and kindness for one another, 
and in which the two partners can be compared to two beasts 
in a yoke, which make no progress if each one looks off to its 
side.
