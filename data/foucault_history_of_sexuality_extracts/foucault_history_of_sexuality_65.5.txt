4 Musonius reflects on the fact 
that after having separated the two sexes, the Creator wished 
to bring them back together.Now, Musonius notes, he 
brought them together again by implanting in each of them a 
“strong desire,” a desire that was both for “association” and 
for “union”— homilia and koindnia.Of the two terms, the 
first seems in fact to refer to sexual intercourse, the second to 
community life.What should be understood, then, is that 
there is a certain fundamental and original desire in human 
beings, and that this desire is directed toward physical inti¬ 
macy as well as toward the sharing of existence.A thesis that 
has this double consequence: that the extreme intensity of 
desire is not characterized simply by the movement that leads 
to the conjoining of the sexes, but also by the movement that 
conduces to the sharing of lives; conversely, that the relation¬ 
ship between the sexes belongs to the same rational scheme as 
the relations that bind two individuals to one another through 
interest, affection, and community of souls.
