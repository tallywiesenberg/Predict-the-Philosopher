Right of Death and Power over Life

taken unawares by a process which had begun long before 
and by which, unbeknown to them, they were already sur¬ 
rounded on all sides; what they had attributed solely to the 
genius of Freud had already gone through a long stage of 
preparation; they had gotten their dates wrong as to the 
establishment, in our society, of a general deployment of 
sexuality. But the others were mistaken concerning the na¬ 
ture of the process; they believed that Freud had at last, 
through a sudden reversal, restored to sex the rightful share 
which it had been denied for so long; they had not seen how 
the good genius of Freud had placed it at one of the critical 
points marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the 
strategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effec¬ 
tive he was—worthy of the greatest spiritual fathers and 
directors of the classical period—in giving a new impetus to 
the secular injunction to study sex and transform it into 
discourse. We are often reminded of the countless procedures 
which Christianity once employed to make us detest the 
body; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for 
centuries to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it 
desirable and everything said about it precious. Let us con¬ 
sider the stratagems by which we were induced to apply all 
our skills to discovering its secrets, by which we were at¬ 
tached to the obligation to draw out its truth, and made 
guilty for having failed to recognize it for so long. These 
devices are what ought to make us wonder today. Moreover, 
we need to consider the possibility that one day, perhaps, in 
a different economy of bodies and pleasures, people will no 
longer quite understand how the ruses of sexuality, and the 
power that sustains its organization, were able to subject us 
to that austere monarchy of sex, so that we became dedicated 
to the endless task of forcing its secret, of exacting the truest 
of confessions from a shadow. 

The irony of this deployment is in having us believe that 
our “liberation” is in the balance.
