Hierocles, in a rather similar way, founds marriage on the 
“binary” nature of man.For him, humans are “conjugal” 
animals (syndyastikoi ).5 The notion was already present in the 
Naturalists: they distinguished between animals that herd to¬ 
gether (synagelastikoi) and those that live in pairs (syndyas¬ 
tikoi).Moreover, Plato had referred to this distinction in a 
passage of the Laws.He recommended to humans the example 
of those animals that are chaste so long as they are living in 
a band but pair off and become “conjugal” when the mating 
season arrives.
