Aristotle had likewise spoken of the “syndas- 
tic” character of human beings, in order to define the relations 
of the master with the slave as well as relations between 
spouses.6 

Hierocles uses the notion for different ends.He applies it 
exclusively to the conjugal relation, of which, in his view, it 
is the founding principle and natural basis.Humans are binary 
by nature; they are made to live in pairs, in a relation that at 
the same time gives them descendants and enables them to live 
their lives with a partner.For Hierocles and Musonius alike, 
Nature is not content to make allowance for marriage; she 
incites individuals to marry through a primordial inclination; 
she urges each of them to do so, including the philosopher 
himself.
