One thus 
finds this conjugal duality over the entire course of human 
existence and in all of its aspects: in the original constitution 
that Nature has given it; in the obligations that man is under 
insofar as he is a creature endowed with reason; in the form 
of social life that ties him to the human community of which 
he is a part.As an animal, as a reasonable creature, and as an 
individual whose reason connects him to the human race, man 
is, in every respect, a conjugal being.2.A universal relation.For a long time, the question of 
knowing whether or not one should marry had been, in philoÂ¬ 
sophical reflection on ways of living, a subject of discussion.
