The advantages and disadvantages of marriage; the usefulness 
of having a lawful wife and, through her, of providing oneself 
with honorable descendants; the cares and troubles, on the 
other hand, when one had to support one’s wife, look after 
one’s children, supply their needs, and at times face their 
illness or their death—these were the inexhaustible themes of 
a debate that was sometimes serious, sometimes ironic, and 
always repetitious.The echoes of it will be heard very late in 
antiquity.Epictetus and Clement of Alexandria, Pseudo- 
Lucian, the author of Affairs of the Heart, or Libanius in the 
treatise Ei gameteon (Whether One Should Marry), will draw 
from this stock of arguments, which scarcely changed over the 
centuries.The Epicureans and the Cynics were theoretically 
opposed to marriage.It seems that the Stoics were, on the 
contrary, favorable toward it from the start.
