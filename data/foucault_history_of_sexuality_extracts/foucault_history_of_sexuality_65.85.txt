thesis that one ought to marry seems to have become very 
common in Stoicism and entirely characteristic of its individ¬

formulated as a simple preference for marriage by reason of 
the latter’s advantages and in spite of its disadvantages; mar¬

does, not because it is “better,” but because it is a duty.The 
marital tie derives from a universal rule.This general principle 
is supported by two types of reflection.For the Stoics, the 
obligation to marry is first of all the direct consequence of the 
principle that marriage was ordained by Nature and that 
human beings are led to it by an impulse which, being at once 
natural and rational, is the same in everyone.
