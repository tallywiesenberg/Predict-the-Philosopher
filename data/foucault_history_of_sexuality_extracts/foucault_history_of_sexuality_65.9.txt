But it is also 
implied as an element in a set of tasks and duties that must 
not be evaded by any human being who acknowledges himself 
to be a member of a community and a part of the human race.Marriage is one of those duties by which private existence 
acquires a value for all.Epictetus’ discussion with an Epicurean shows clearly this 
recognition of marriage as a universal duty for every human 
being who wishes to live in harmony with nature, and as a 
function for the individual who aims to lead a life that is useful 
to those around him and to humanity in general.The Epicu¬ 
rean whom Epictetus refutes in Discourse Seven of Book III 
is a leading citizen; he exercises responsibilities; he is an “in¬ 
spector of cities.” But, out of faithfulness to his philosophical 
principles, he rejects marriage.To which Epictetus retorts 
with three arguments.
