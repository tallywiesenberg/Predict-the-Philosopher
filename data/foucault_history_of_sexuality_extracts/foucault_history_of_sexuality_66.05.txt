No harm but that of failing to do 
your duty; you will destroy the trustworthy, self-respecting, 
well-behaved man in you.Look not for any greater harm than

And yet, it was the same with marriage as with all the other 
practices that the Stoics classed among the proegoumena, the 
things that are preferable.There may be circumstances in 
which it is not obligatory.This is what Hierocles says: “Mar¬ 
rying is preferable [proegoumenon ]; hence it is an imperative 
for us provided that no circumstance opposes it.” 10 It is pre¬ 
cisely in this relationship between the obligation to marry and 
the conjuncture of circumstances that the difference between 
the Stoics and the Epicureans was most pronounced.For the 
Epicureans, no one was obliged to marry, unless there existed 
a circumstance that could make this form of union desirable.
