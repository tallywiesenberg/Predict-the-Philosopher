In his text he takes up 
the question of the practical incompatibility between the mar¬ 
ried life and the philosophical life, turning it into the affirma¬ 
tion of an essential connection between the two.11 Anyone who 
would be a philosopher, he says, should marry.He should do 
so because the primary function of philosophy is to enable one 
to live in accord with nature and to fulfill all the obligations 
that follow from nature.He will take as his “teacher and 
guide” that which is fitting for a human being who conforms 
to nature.But, further, he is under a greater obligation to 
marry than anyone else, for the philosopher’s role is not sim¬ 
ply to live according to reason; he must be for everyone else 
an example of that reasonable life as well as a master who 
shows the way to it.
