The philosopher cannot be inferior to 
those he must advise and lead.If he were to refuse marriage, 
he would be showing himself inferior to all those who, obeying 
reason and following nature, practice, out of concern for 
themselves and for others, matrimonial life.The latter, far 
from being incompatible with philosophy, constitutes for it a 
double obligation.In relation to oneself, it is the duty of giving 
one’s existence a universally valuable form, and in relation to 
others, it is the necessity of offering them a model of living.One might be tempted to oppose to this analysis the one that 
Epictetus submits when he draws the ideal portrait of the 
Cynic, of the man who makes a profession of philosophizing, 
who must be the common pedagogue, the herald of truth, 
Zeus’ messenger to humans, who goes on stage to challenge 
men and to reproach them for the way they live.
