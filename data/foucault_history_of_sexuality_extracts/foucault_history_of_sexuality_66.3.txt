On 
the contrary, it is because he has the mission of caring for 
humans, of looking after them, of being their “benefactor.” It 
is because, like a doctor, he must “make his rounds” and “feel 
men’s pulses.” 14 Kept occupied by the responsibilities of a 
household (and perhaps especially by the household Epictetus 
describes), he would not have the leisure to go about a task 
that takes in the whole of humanity.His renunciation of all 
these private ties is but the consequence of the ties he estab¬ 
lishes, qua philosopher, with the human race.He has no 
family because his family is mankind; he has no children 
because, in a sense, he has fathered all men and all women.It 
is important to understand, therefore, that the responsibility 
for the universal family is what prevents the Cynic from devot¬ 
ing himself to a particular household.But Epictetus does not stop there.
