Of all the communities 
that can be established among humans, Musonius designates 
marriage as the highest, the most important, and the most 
venerable (presbytate).It is greater in strength than that which 
can join a friend to a friend, a brother to a brother, a son to 
his parents.It even surpasses—this is the decisive point—the 
bond that attaches parents to their offspring.No father, no 
mother, writes Musonius, will feel greater friendship for their 
child than for their marriage partner, and he cites the example 
of Admetus: Who was willing to die for him?Not his old 
parents, but his wife, Alcestis, in spite of her youth.
