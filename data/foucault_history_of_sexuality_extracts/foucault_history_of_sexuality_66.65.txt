Hierocles refers, 
in his Economics, to rules that are identical to those found in 
Xenophon.18 But behind this distribution of behaviors relating 
to the house, the possessions, and the estate, one sees a shared 
life and a common existence being affirmed as an exigency.The art of marriage is not simply a rational way for the 
spouses to act, each on his or her own account, in view of a 
purpose both partners recognize and in which they are united.It is a way of living together and of being as one person.Marriage calls for a certain style of conduct in which each of 
the two partners leads his or her life with the other, and in 
which, together, they form a common existence.
