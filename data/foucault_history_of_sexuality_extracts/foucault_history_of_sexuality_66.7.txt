This style of existence is characterized first of all by a cer¬ 
tain art of being together.For his business affairs, the husband 
must be away from home, while the wife must remain at home.But good spouses will want to rejoin one another and remain 
separated as little as possible.Closeness, the other’s presence, 
living side by side, are presented not simply as duties, but as 
an aspiration characteristic of the relationship that should join 
husband and wife.They may each have their roles; there is no 
question of their doing without each other.
