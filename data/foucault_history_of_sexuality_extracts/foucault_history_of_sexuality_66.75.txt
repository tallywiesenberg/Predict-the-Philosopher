Musonius under¬ 
scores the need felt by spouses in a good marriage to be 
together.He even makes the difficulty of being apart the crite¬ 
rion of their singular friendship.No absence, he says, is as 
difficult to endure as, for the wife, that of the husband and, for 
the husband, that of the wife.No presence has such a power 
to lighten grief, to increase joy, to remedy misfortune.19 The 
presence of the spouse is at the heart of married life.
