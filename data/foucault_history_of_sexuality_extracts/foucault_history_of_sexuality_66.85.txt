The later texts suggest an¬ 
other kind of dialogue, with different ends.Each of the two 
spouses, according to Hierocles, should report to the other 
concerning what they have done.The wife will tell the hus¬ 
band what is going on at home, but she will also need to ask 
him about what is happening on the outside.21 Pliny likes 
Calpurnia to keep informed of his public activity, to encourage 
him, and to rejoice in his successes—a custom that had long 
been traditional in aristocratic Roman families.But he associ¬ 
ates it directly with his work; and in return, the taste his wife 
has for belles-lettres is inspired by the tenderness she feels for 
her husband.
