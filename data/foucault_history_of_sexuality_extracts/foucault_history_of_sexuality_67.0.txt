23 But in order to characterize the substan¬ 
tial unity the couple must form, writers occasionally resort to 
another metaphor, stronger than that of pieces fitted together: 
di'holdn krasis, complete fusion, according to a notion bor¬ 
rowed from Stoic physics.The treatise by Antipater had already appealed to this 
model in order to contrast conjugal affection with the other 
forms of friendship.24 He described the latter as combinations 
in which the elements remain independent of each other, like 
the seeds that one mixes and that can be separated again.The 
term mixis denotes this type of blending by juxtaposition.By 
contrast, marriage should be in the nature of a total fusion, 
like that observed between water and wine, which form by 
their mixture a new liquid.
