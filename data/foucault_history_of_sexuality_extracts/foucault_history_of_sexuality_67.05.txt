This same notion of matrimonial 
“crasis” is reencountered in Plutarch, in the thirty-fourth of 
the Marriage Precepts.It is used to distinguish between three 
types of marriage and to rank them in relation to one another.There are marriages that are contracted solely for the plea¬ 
sures of the bed.They belong in the category of those mixtures 
that juxtapose separate elements, each of which retains its 
individuality.There are marriages that are concluded for rea¬ 
sons of self-interest.
