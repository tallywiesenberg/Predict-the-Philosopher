In this model, the relationship to the other that appears as the 
most fundamental of all is neither the blood relationship nor 
that of friendship; it is the relationship between a man and a 
woman when it is organized in the institutional form of mar¬ 
riage and in the common life that is superimposed on the 
latter.The familial system and the friendship network have 
doubtless retained a large part of their social importance.However, in the art of existence they lose some of their value 
in comparison with the tie that attaches two persons of differ¬ 
ent sexes.A natural privilege, at once ontological and ethical, 
is granted to this dual, heterosexual relationship at the ex¬ 
pense of all others.In light of the above, one understands what was no doubt 
one of the most characteristic features of this art of being 
married—that attention to oneself and devotion to conjugal 
life could be closely associated.
