If relationship with a woman 
who is “the wife,” “the spouse,” is essential to existence, if 
human beings are conjugal individuals whose nature is 
fulfilled in the practice of shared life, then there could not be 
an essential and primary incompatibility between the relation¬ 
ship one establishes with oneself and the rapport one forms 
with the other.The art of conjugality is an integral part of the 
cultivation of the self.But the individual who is concerned about himself does not 
simply have to marry; he must give his married life a deliber¬ 
ate form and a particular style.This style, with the moderation 
it requires, is not defined by self-mastery alone and by the 
principle that one must govern oneself in order to be able to 
rule others.It is also defined by the elaboration of a certain 
form of reciprocity.
