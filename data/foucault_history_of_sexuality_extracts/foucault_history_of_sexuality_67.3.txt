The Question of 
Monopoly 


One might expect that the treatises on matrimonial life 
would assign an important role to the regimen of sexual rela¬ 
tions that must be established between husband and wife.In 
actual fact, the place reserved for them is relatively limited.It 
is as if the objectivation of the conjugal relation had preceded, 
and by far, the objectivation of the sexual relations that devel¬ 
oped within it.As if all the effort and attention that needed 
to be devoted to living together continued to leave the question 
of conjugal sex in the shadows.A discretion that was traditional, no doubt.
