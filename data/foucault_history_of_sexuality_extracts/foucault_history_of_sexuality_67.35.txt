Plato, at the 
point where he is nevertheless about to legislate on these mat¬ 
ters—determining the precautions to take in order to produce 
healthy children, prescribing the physical and moral state of 
future parents, even instituting female inspectors who will 
need to look into the lives of young married couples—under¬ 
scores the difficulty people probably would have in accept¬ 
ing legislation concerned with such things.1 Opposing this 
Greek discretion, there will be the meticulous attentiveness of 
the Christian pastoral ministry, starting in the Middle Ages.One will then attempt to regulate everything—positions, fre¬ 
quency, gestures, each partner’s state of mind, knowledge by 
the one of the intentions of the other, signs of desire on one 
side, tokens of acceptance on the other, and so on.For its part, 
Hellenistic and Roman moral philosophy says little on this 
subject.165
