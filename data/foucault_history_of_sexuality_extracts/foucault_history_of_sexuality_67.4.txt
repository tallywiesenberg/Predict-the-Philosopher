We have seen that traditionally the connection between the 
sexual act and marriage was established on the basis and in 
terms of the need to have descendants.This procreative aim 
figured among the reasons for marrying.It was what made 
sexual relations within marriage necessary.Its absence, more¬ 
over, was what could dissolve the conjugal union.It was in 
order to take account of the best possible conditions for pro¬ 
creation that certain recommendations were made to married 
people regarding the proper way to perform the conjugal act 
(the time one should choose, the regimen that ought to pre¬ 
cede the act).
