It was also in order to avoid the disadvantages 
of illegitimate offspring that extramarital liaisons were dis¬ 
couraged (for women, certainly, but also for men).Let us say 
schematically that in the classical texts the synthesis of the 
marriage tie and sexual relations was granted mainly for 
reasons pertaining to procreation.For men at least, it was 
neither the very nature of sexual acts nor the essence of mar¬ 
riage itself that implied that there should be pleasure only in 
conjugality.Apart from the question of illegitimate births, and 
allowing for the ethical requirement of self-mastery, there was 
no reason to expect a man, even a married man, to reserve all 
his sexual pleasures for his wife, and for her alone.Now in the ethics of strict marriage that we see being for¬ 
mulated in the first centuries of our era, it is easy to ascertain 
something that might be called a “conjugalization” of sexual 
relations—a conjugalization at once direct and reciprocal.
