Second, the marriage bond is such that 
the wife risks being hurt not just by the loss of her status but 
by the fact that her husband might take his pleasure with 
someone other than her.1.It is doubtless rare to see formulated the principle that 
all sexual relations are culpable if they do not take place in a 
relationship of marriage that makes them legitimate.Provided 
that he exhibits personal moderation and respect for customs, 
laws, and the rights of others, an unmarried man may very 
well enjoy his pleasure as he sees fit.It would be very difficult, 
even within this austere ethics, to oblige him to abstain comÂ¬ 
pletely so long as he has not contracted a marriage.
