It was 
owing to a great personal virtue that the son of Marcia, by 
Seneca’s account, rejected the advances of the women who 
desired him, even going so far as to blush at the thought of 
pleasing them, as if this were a fault (quasi peccasset ).2 We 
may also remark that Dio of Prusa shows himself to be very 
severe with regard to prostitution and the way it is organized: 
first, because he sees it as a form of “loveless love,” and a kind 
of union that is foreign to Aphrodite; second, because its 
victims are nonconsenting human beings.Though he hopes 
that a truly well-governed city will abolish these institutions, 
he does not expect such an inveterate evil to be eliminated at 
once.3 Marcus Aurelius expresses pride in his own sobriety in 
matters of sexual pleasure: he has “preserved [his] adoles¬ 
cence,” he “did not become a man before the proper time,” 
he “even took a little longer.” Now these statements show 
very clearly that the point of virtue is not in the fact that he 
has reserved his pleasures only for marriage, but that he has
