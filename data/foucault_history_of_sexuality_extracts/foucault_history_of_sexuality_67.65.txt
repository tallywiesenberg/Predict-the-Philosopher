This advice is to be followed 
if one can, but there is no reason to make an arrogant precept 
of this sort of chastity: “Before marriage guard yourself with 
all your ability from illicit intercourse with women; yet be not 
uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this, nor boast 
frequently that you yourself do otherwise.” 5 Epictetus does 
not justify the extreme reserve that he demands in the sexual 
relationship by the form of marriage, by the rights and duties 
it establishes and which must be rendered to the wife; he 
explains it by saying that one owes it to oneself since one is 
a fragment of God, that one must honor this principle which 
dwells for a time in the body, and that one must respect it over 
the entire course of one’s everyday existence.Mindfulness of 
one’s own nature, rather than consciousness of one’s ties with 
others, should serve as the permanent basis of austerity: “Will 
you not remember, when you eat, who you are that eat, and 
whom you are feeding, and the same in your relations with 
women?When you take part in society, or training, or conver¬ 
sation, do you not know that it is God you are nourishing and 
training?...Yet when God himself is present within you and 
sees and hears all things, you are not ashamed of thinking and 
acting thus: so slow to understand your nature, and estranged 
from God!” 6 

On the other hand, it seems that Musonius Rufus under¬ 
takes a thorough conjugalization of sexual activity since he 
condemns all sexual intercourse that does not take place 
within marriage and with a view to the latter’s particular 
objectives.
