The passage of the treatise on the aphrodisia that 
is preserved in Stobaeus opens with a customary criticism of 
the life of debauchery: a life that, being incapable of exercising 
the necessary mastery over itself, gets caught up in the pursuit 
of rare and affected pleasures and “shameful intimacies.” 
Now, to this banal condemnation, Musonius adds as a positive 
prescription a definition of what must be considered as aphro¬ 
disia dikaia, legitimate pleasures: these, he says, are pleasures

that the partners enjoy together in marriage and for the pur¬ 
pose of begetting children (ta en gamdi kai epi genesei paidon 
synteloumena).And Musonius then states precisely the two 
hypotheses that can emerge: either extramarital relations are 
sought in adultery (moicheia), and nothing could be more 
unlawful (paranomotatai); or one obtains them without any 
adultery.Yet from the moment they are “without that which 
makes them lawful,” they are themselves shameful and have 
their origin in self-indulgence.7 Conjugality is for sexual activ¬ 
ity the condition of its legitimate exercise.Between the ancient theme that the overly intense pursuit 
of pleasure goes against the necessary self-mastery and the 
principle that there can be legitimate pleasure only in the 
context of the matrimonial institution, there is an important 
threshold that Musonius crosses.
