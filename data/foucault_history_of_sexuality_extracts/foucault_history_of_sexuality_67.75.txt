He draws the consequence 
this necessarily implies, even if it may have seemed paradoxi¬ 
cal to many of his contemporaries.Moreover, he himself pre¬ 
sents the inference in connection with a possible objection: 
Should one regard as culpable, sexual relations that would 
occur between two free persons not bound by the ties of mar¬ 
riage?“The man who has relations with a courtesan or a 
woman who has no husband wrongs no one for he does not 
destroy anyone’s hope of children.” Even in these circum¬ 
stances, one commits an offense—just as a man can commit 
an offense and an injustice without doing wrong to anyone 
around him: he defiles himself, and “like swine, rejoices in his 
own vileness.” 8 One must also count among the implications 
of this conception of the essential relationship between mar¬ 
riage and sexual activity the objection raised by Musonius to 
contraceptive practices.These practices, he says, in a text 
devoted to the question of whether all children must be raised, 
transgress the laws of cities that take care to maintain their 
population.They are harmful to individuals as well since it is 
useful to have descendants.
