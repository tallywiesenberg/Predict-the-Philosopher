They also violate the universal 
order that was willed by the gods: “How could we not be 
sinning against our ancestral gods and against Zeus, protector

of the family, when we do such things?For just as he who 
mistreats a guest sins against Zeus, the protector of the rights 
of hospitality, and he who acts unrighteously to a friend, 
against Zeus, the god of friendship, even so whoever acts 
unrighteously toward his family line sins against his ancestral 
gods and against Zeus, protector of the family.” 9 

Here one might be tempted to see the anticipation of the 
Christian idea that sexual pleasure is in itself a defilement, 
which only the lawful form of marriage, with the possibility 
of procreation, could render acceptable.It is a fact that this 
passage from Musonius was utilized by Clement of Alexandria 
in the second book of the Pedagogue .10 However, although 
Musonius—like most of the ancient moral philosophers, with 
the exception of the Cynics—does consider the public practice 
of this type of relation to be reprehensible, it would undoubt¬ 
edly be a falsification of his doctrine to attribute to him the 
idea that sexual pleasure is an evil, and that marriage was 
instituted in order to redeem and regulate the necessary expe¬ 
rience of it within a strict framework.If Musonius regards as 
shameful any sexual intercourse outside marriage, it is not 
that the latter has been superimposed on the former so as to 
rid it of its intrinsically wrongful character.
