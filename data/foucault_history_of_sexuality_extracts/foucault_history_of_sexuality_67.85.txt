It is that, for the 
reasonable and social human being, the very nature of the 
sexual act demands that it be inscribed within the matrimonial 
relation, where it may produce a legitimate progeny.The 
sexual act, the conjugal tie, offspring, the family, the city, and 
beyond it, the human community—all this constitutes a series 
whose elements are connected and in which man’s existence 
achieves its rational form.To withdraw pleasure from this 
form, to detach pleasure from the conjugal relation in order 
to propose other ends for it, is in fact to debase the essential 
composition of the human being.The defilement is not in the 
sexual act itself, but in the “debauchery” that would dissociate 
it from marriage, where it has its natural form and its rational 
purpose.From this perspective, marriage constitutes for 
human beings the only legitimate context for sexual union and 
the experience of the aphrodisia.
