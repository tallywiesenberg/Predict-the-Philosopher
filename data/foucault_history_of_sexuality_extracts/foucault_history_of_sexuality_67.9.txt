The Wife 


171 


2.Given this essential association of sexual relations and 
sexual pleasure with lawful conjugality, one can understand 
the new problematization of adultery and the incipient re¬ 
quirement of double sexual fidelity.We know that adultery was juridically condemned and 
morally reproved on account of the injustice done by a man 
to the one whose wife he led astray.What constituted adul¬ 
tery, therefore, in an extramarital sexual relation was the fact 
that the woman was married and that fact alone: the marital 
status of the man was not relevant.The deceit and injury were 
a matter between the two men—the one who had possessed 
himself of the woman and the one who had the legitimate 
rights to her.
