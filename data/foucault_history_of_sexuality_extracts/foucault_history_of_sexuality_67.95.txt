11 This definition of adultery, solely in terms of 
the derogation of the husband’s rights, was common enough 
to be found even in an ethics as exacting as that of Epictetus.12 
In the middle of a lecture on the theme “man is born for 
mutual trust” (pistis), there enters a man of letters (philologos) 
who had been discovered committing adultery and who de¬ 
fends himself by appealing to the doctrine of Archedemus on 
women as common property.The remonstrances that Epic¬ 
tetus addresses to him relate to two points.By the practice of 
adultery the man has transgressed “the principle of trust for 
which we were born.” But Epictetus does not localize this 
“trust” in the matrimonial institution.What is more, he does 
not even cite the marriage bond as one of its essential forms.
