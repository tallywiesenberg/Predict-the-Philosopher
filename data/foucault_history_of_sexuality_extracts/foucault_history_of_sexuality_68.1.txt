You know that a man does wrong in requiring chastity of his 
wife while he himself is intriguing with the wives of other men; 
you know that, as your wife should have no dealings with a 
lover, neither should you yourself with a mistress.” 14 

It is in Musonius that one finds the most detailed statement 
of the principle of a symmetrical conjugality.15 The argument 
is set forth in the long passage of the treatise On the Aphrodisia 
where it is demonstrated that only marriage can constitute the 
naturally legitimate tie for sexual relations.Musonius focuses 
on what might be called “the problem of the servant.” The 
slave was so taken for granted as a household sexual object 
that it might seem impossible to forbid a married man to use 
her; yet this is precisely what Musonius would prohibit, even, 
he notes, if the slave is not married (which implies that a 
married slave couple in a house was entitled to a certain 
respect).And to justify this prohibition, Musonius posits a 
principle of symmetry, or rather a relatively complex interplay 
between a symmetry with respect to rights and a superiority 
concerning obligations.In the first place, how could one ac¬ 
cept that the husband might have relations with a maid¬ 
servant, whereas one does not recognize the right of a wife to 
have relations with her manservant?
