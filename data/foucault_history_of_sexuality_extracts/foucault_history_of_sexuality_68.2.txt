For the husband to 
be the one who actually prevails, he must forgo doing that 
which is forbidden a wife.In this Stoic art of marriage, for 
which Musonius proposes such a strict model, a form of 
fidelity is required.It obligates the man and the woman alike.It does not merely prohibit anything that might compromise 
the rights of other men.Nor is it content just to protect the 
wife against the threats that could compromise her privileged 
status as mistress of the house and as a mother.
