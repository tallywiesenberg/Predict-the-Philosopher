It interprets 
the marriage relationship as a system that establishes an exact 
balance of obligations in the practice of pleasure.This integral conjugalization of sexual practice that one 
finds in Musonius and the principle of a strict monopoly of the 
aphrodisia reserved for marriage are no doubt exceptional.A 
point has been reached where the art of married life seems to 
be organized around the formal principle of double prohibi¬ 
tion.But in the authors who are careful not to formulate such 
rigid rules, one also notes the emergence of a requirement of 
fidelity calling for slightly different modes of conduct and 
ways of acting.These authors do not assert an explicit prohibi¬ 
tion, but rather a concern with preserving the conjugal bond 
with all that it may entail in the way of individual relationship, 
attachment, affection, and personal respect between the mar¬ 
riage partners.
