He also enjoins him not to deprive the woman he has 
married of the honor she is due.16 But he also demands that 
the two spouses prevent one another from doing anything base 
and dishonest.He counsels the husband to “approach his wife 
in an honorable way, full of self-restraint and awe” (cum 
honestate, et cum multa modestia et timore).He hopes that the 
husband will be “neither indifferent nor harsh” (nec negligens 
nec sever us): “Between a courtesan and her lover, such tem¬ 
pers are allowed their course.” With his wife, on the contrary, 
the good husband should be attentive but also restrained, and 
the wife will respond with modesty and tact, and by showing 
affection and fear “in equal parts.” 17 And while he stresses the 
value of this fidelity, the author makes it clear to the wife that 
she will need to have a relatively accommodating attitude 
toward her husband’s faults: “and let her forget any wrong her 
husband may have done her through distress of mind” (si quid 
vir animae passione ad ipsam peccaverit); “let her refrain from 
all complaint nor charge him with the wrong, but rather attri¬ 
bute everything of this kind to sickness or ignorance or acci¬ 
dental errors.” In this way the husband in return will be ready 
to show her his gratitude after his cure.In a similar fashion, the Marriage Precepts affirm the princi¬ 
ple of a reciprocal fidelity.
