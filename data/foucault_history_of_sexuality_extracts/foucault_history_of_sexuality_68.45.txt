In the same way, women are 
infuriated when the husband has intercourse with other 
women.It is therefore unjust (adikon) to make them suffer 
such a violent vexation for a pleasure that is “trivial.” And he 
advises the husband to follow, with his wife, the example of 
the beekeeper, who does not go near his bees if he has had 
intercourse with a woman .18 Conversely, Plutarch counsels 
wives to show a certain tolerance; not only would it be better 
for them to shut their eyes—a little like the wives of Persian 
kings who take part in banquets with their husbands but re¬ 
turn to their apartments when, with the onset of drunkenness, 
the musicians and courtesans are summoned.But they ought 
to tell themselves that if their husbands are going to seek 
pleasure with a hetaera or a maidservant, this is out of respect 
for them, and because he would not want them to share his 
debauchery, his licentiousness, and his excess .19 Thus mar¬ 
riage, as a bond of affection and a relation of respect, much 
more than as a statutory structure, draws all sexual activities 
to it and condemns all those that might take place outside it.
