And while it tends to demand a symmetrical fidelity of the two 
partners, it also constitutes a locus of conciliation, where the 
husband’s attachment to the wife and the wife’s prudence 
vis-a-vis the husband will manage to correspond.The external 
pleasures of the husband will no longer be the recognized 
consequence of his statutory superiority, but the consequence 
of a certain weakness, which he is all the more obliged to limit 
seeing that the wife tolerates it through a concession that, 
while possibly saving her honor, also proves her affection.3 


The Pleasures of 
Marriage 


This definition of marriage as a relationship that is as exclu¬ 
sive as possible regarding the practice of the aphrodisia raises 
(or could raise) a number of questions pertaining to the inte¬ 
gration, the role, the form, and the finality of acts of pleasure 
in the interplay of affective or statutory relations between 
husband and wife.In actual fact, one has to admit that even in the forms of 
reflection in which marriage occupies an important place, the 
economy of pleasures in the conjugal relationship is treated 
with a great deal of reserve.Marriage, in this rigorous ethics 
advocated by some, demands a monopoly of pleasure.
