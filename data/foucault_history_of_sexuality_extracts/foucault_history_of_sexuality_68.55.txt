But as 
to which pleasures will be allowed within marriage and which 
others excluded, little is said.However, two general principles are often evoked.First, it 
is made clear that the conjugal relation must not be foreign to 
Eros, to that love which some philosophers wished to reserve 
for boys; but neither must it ignore or exclude Aphrodite.Musonius, in the text where he shows that marriage, far from 
being a hindrance, is an obligation for the philosopher, affirms 
the greatness and value of the marital state.He invokes the 
three great deities who watch over it: Hera, whom “we address 
as the patroness of wedlock”; Aphrodite, since people have 
called “Aphrodision ergon the joining of wife and husband”; 
and Eros (to what indeed could the name be better applied 
“than to the lawful union of man and wife”?).
