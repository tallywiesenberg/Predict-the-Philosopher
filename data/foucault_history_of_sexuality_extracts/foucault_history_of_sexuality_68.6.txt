three powers have the function of “bringing together man and 
woman for the procreation of children.” 1 It is in the same 
manner that Plutarch will affirm the role of Aphrodite and 
Eros in that which properly constitutes the conjugal relation¬ 
ship.2 

In correlation with this presence of amorous passion and 
physical pleasures in marriage, another principle, opposite to 
the first one but also quite general, is brought into play; 
namely, that one must not treat one’s wife as a mistress and 
one should behave as a husband rather than as a lover.3 It is 
only logical that the old principle of conjugal decency will 
become all the more important as marriage tends to constitute 
the only licit context for the pleasures of sex.Aphrodite and 
Eros must be present in marriage and nowhere else.Moreover, 
the conjugal relationship needs to be different from the rela¬ 
tionship of lovers.
