One encounters the principle in several 
forms.In the form of a (doubtless quite traditional) counsel 
of prudence: by introducing one’s wife to overly intense pleas¬ 
ures one risks giving her lessons she will put to bad use and 
which one will regret having taught her.4 Or in the form of 
advice given to both spouses: let them find a middle way 
between an excessive austerity and a conduct too close to that 
of profligates, and let the husband always remind himself that 
“I cannot have the society of the same woman as wife and 
paramour” (hos gamete kai hos hetaira ).5 Or, further, in the 
form of a general thesis: behaving too ardently with one’s wife 
amounts to treating her as an adulteress.6 The theme is impor¬ 
tant, for it will be reencountered in the Christian tradition, 
where it will appear very early (Clement of Alexandria refers 
to it in the Stromateis ), and where it will persist for a very long 
time (Saint Francis of Sales works out its implications in the 
Introduction to the Devout Life ).
