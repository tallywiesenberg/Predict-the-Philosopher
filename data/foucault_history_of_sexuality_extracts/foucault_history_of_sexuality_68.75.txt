The formulations are, more often than 
not, rather vague, a little like those one finds in the Latin text 
that is supposed to be Book III of the Economics attributed 
to Aristotle.The author asks the husband to approach his wife 
“in an honorable way” (cum honestate), “full of self-restraint 
and awe” (cum multa modestia et timore).He recommends 
that “in his conversation with her, he should use the words of 
a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are them¬ 
selves lawful and honorable.” He advises him to treat his 
spouse with “respect and modesty” (verecundia et pudore).%

tified by the two great natural and rational finalities that will 
be ascribed to marriage.The first, of course, is procreation.
