The 
exclusion of pleasure as an end does seem, in the most rigorous 
of the moral philosophers, to have been an exigency.But this 
exigency was more a statement of principle than a schema 
enabling a regulation of behaviors and a precise codification 
of their permitted or forbidden forms.The second great finality of marriage—making a life to¬ 
gether, a life entirely shared—constitutes the other principle 
that calls for austerity in conjugal relations.Like the procrea¬ 
tive finality, this principle does not trace a clear dividing line 
between what is permitted and what is forbidden.But certain 
authors—and foremost among them Plutarch—have it play, 
in the linking of pleasure relations to the conjugal relationship, 
a more subtle and complex role.
