This spiraling process of necessary austerity and desirable 
intensity is clearly apparent in the Marriage Precepts; in fact 
it constitutes one of that work’s guiding threads.The text 
reiterates some of the old familiar principles concerning the 
modesty and secrecy that should surround not only the pro- 
creative act but also the simple acts of pleasure such as kissing 
and caressing."It also recalls to mind, transforming a well- 
known saying of Herodotus, that a woman’s modesty should 
not fall along with the gown that she lays aside, 12 nor should 
darkness cover any licentiousness whatever.Recalling the ex¬ 
ample of a woman who tried to get away from Philip by 
pointing out to him that all women are the same once the 
lights are out, Plutarch notes that the wife, on the contrary, 
does not have to be like the others.Hidden by the night, 
without one’s being able to see her body, she must cause what 
is virtuous in her (to sophron autes) to shine forth.
