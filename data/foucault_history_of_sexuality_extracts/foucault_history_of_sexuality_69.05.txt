He draws attention to the 
risk of bad experiences that the bride may have.He advises her 
not to dwell on them, for the benefits of marriage may appear 
later: not to behave like those who “submit to the bees’ stings, 
but abandon the honeycomb.” 16 But he also fears that too 
intense a physical pleasure experienced at the outset of mar¬ 
riage may cause the affection to be lost when this pleasure 
disappears.It is better for the love to owe its vitality to the 
spouses’ character and disposition.17 It is also necessary, 
throughout married life, to bring into play anything that 
might benefit conjugal friendship in sexual relations between 
husband and wife.Specific examples of this function of affec¬ 
tive reactivation—to which one of the interlocutors of the 
Dialogue on Love explicitly refers 18 —are given in the Marriage 
Precepts : avoid quarrels, especially those that might take place 
in the bedroom, because “the disagreements, recriminations, 
and angry passions which the bed generates are not easily 
settled in another place and at another time”; 19 or, further, 
when you are in the habit of occupying the same bed, don’t 
go to a separate bedroom because of an angry disagreement.
