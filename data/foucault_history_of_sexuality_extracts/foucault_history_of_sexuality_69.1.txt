On the contrary, this is the right time to invoke Aphrodite, 
“who is the best physician for such disorders.” 20 

The theme holds a relatively important place in Plutarch 
himself.We will encounter it again in the Dialogue on Love, 
where it will serve as a basic discriminant between the love of 
women, in which pleasure is integrable with a positive role in 
the spiritual relation, and the love of boys, in which physical 
pleasure (assumed to be nonreciprocal) can figure only as a

the temple he constructs; the Muses, when they employ them¬ 
selves with the lyre or the flute, have no other task than “the 
development of characters and the soothing of the emo¬

not in the fact of drinking intoxicating wine, the task of 
Aphrodite (ergon Aphrodites) is not in the mere relating and 
conjoining of bodies (synousia, meixis); it is in the feeling of 
friendship (philosophrosyne), the longing (pothos), the associa¬ 
tion (homilia), and the intimacy (synetheia) between two peo¬ 
ple.Sexual intercourse, in married life, ought to serve as an 
instrument for the formation and development of symmetrical 
and reciprocal affective relations.
