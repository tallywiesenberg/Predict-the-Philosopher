“Aphrodite,” says Plutarch, 
“is the artisan who creates concord and friendship [homophro- 
synes kai philias demiourgos] between men and women, for 
through their bodies, under the influence of pleasure, she at 
the same time unites and welds together their souls.” 22 * 

This advice may appear rather crude.Nevertheless, it 
figures among the preliminaries of a long history: that of the 
codification of moral relations between spouses, in the dual 
form of a general recommendation of reserve and a complex 
lesson of affective communication through sexual pleasure.A “monopolistic” principle: no sexual relations outside 
marriage.A requirement of “dehedonization”: sexual inter¬ 
course between spouses should not be governed by an econ¬ 
omy of pleasure.A procreative finalization : its goal should be 
the birth of offspring.
