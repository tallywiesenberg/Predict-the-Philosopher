But the constancy of these three phenomena should not be 
taken as evidence of a pure and simple identity.A certain 
more or less Stoicizing ethics of the imperial epoch did not 
merely carry forward, from the Platonic utopia to Christian¬ 
ity, the code of a “monopolistic” marriage dedicated to pro¬ 
creation and distrustful of pleasure.It contributed a number 
of particular inflections that derived from the forms taken at 
the time by the development of the cultivation of the self.It should be noted first that in Plato the obligation to inte¬ 
grate all sexual pleasure into the matrimonial structure had 
for one of its chief justifications the need to supply the city 
with the children it required to survive and maintain its 
strength.In Christianity, on the other hand, the link between 
sexual intercourse and marriage will be justified by the fact 
that the former bears the marks of sin, the Fall, and evil, and 
that only the latter can give it a legitimacy that still may not 
exculpate it entirely.
