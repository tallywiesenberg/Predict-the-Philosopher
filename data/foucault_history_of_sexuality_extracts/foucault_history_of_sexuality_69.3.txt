Now, in Musonius, Seneca, Plutarch, or 
Hierocles, although utility has its part to play, although dis¬ 
trust of the transports of pleasure is very strong, the link 
between marriage and the aphrodisia is not really established 
by positing the primacy of the social and political objectives 
of marriage, or by postulating an original evil intrinsic to

the sexual monopoly that tends to be claimed for marriage in 
this form of ethics centers less on the “external” utilities of 
marriage or the “internal” negativity of pleasure than on an 
attempt to bring a certain number of relations into coinci¬ 
dence: the union of two sexual partners, the dual tie of hus¬ 
band and wife, and the social role of the family—while 
achieving as perfect a congruence as possible with the relation 
to the self.Here we touch on an important difference.The obligation 
to keep the use of pleasure within the bounds of marriage was 
also, for Plato’s guardian, Isocrates’ leader, or Aristotle’s citi¬ 
zen, a way of exercising self-mastery, a mastery made neces¬ 
sary by one’s status or by the authority one had to exercise in 
the city.The principle of a perfect conjugal fidelity will be, in 
the pastoral ministry, an unconditional duty for anyone con¬ 
cerned about his salvation.
