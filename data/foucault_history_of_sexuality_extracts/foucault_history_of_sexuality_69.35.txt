By contrast, in this ethics inspired 
by Stoicism, it is in order to satisfy the specific requirements 
of the relation to oneself, not to violate one’s natural and 
essential being, and to honor oneself as a reasonable being that 
one must keep one’s practice of sexual pleasure within mar¬ 
riage and in conformity with its objectives.Doubtless this 
principle, which tends to exclude, even for men, sexual inter¬ 
course outside marriage, and to authorize it only for certain 
definite purposes, will be one of the anchor points for a subse¬ 
quent “juridification” of marital relations and sexual prac¬ 
tices.Like that of women, the sexual activity of married men 
will, in theory at least, risk coming within the provisions of the 
law.Even within marriage, a precise code will say what one 
is permitted or forbidden to do, to want, or even to think.But 
this juridification—which will be so pronounced in later times 
—is tied to Christian pastoral practice, to its own peculiar 
structure.
