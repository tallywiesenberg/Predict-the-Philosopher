Moreover, 
the insistence on a dissociation between the practice of plea¬ 
sure and the hedonic finality will tend toward an internal 
disqualification of this activity itself.But it needs to be un¬ 
derstood as well that these restrictions and this disqualifica¬ 
tion are accompanied by another process: an intensification of 
the value and meaning of sexual relations within marriage.On 
the one hand, in fact, intramarital sexual relations are no 
longer simply the consequence and manifestation of a right.They must be placed within a cluster of relations character¬ 
ized by affection, attachment, and reciprocity.And on the 
other hand, while pleasure must be eliminated as a goal, it is, 
at least in certain of the most subtle formulations of this ethics, 
to be used as an element (at once an instrument and a guaran¬ 
tee) in the interplay of affective expressions between spouses.
