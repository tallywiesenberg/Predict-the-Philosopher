And it is precisely on behalf of this intensification of the 
value of the aphrodisia in marital relations, by reason of the 
role it is assigned in the communication between husband and 
wife, that one begins to question, in an increasingly doubtful 
mode, the privileges that used to be granted to the love of boys.PART SIX 

Boys 




In the first centuries of our era, compared with the lofty 
formulations of the classical period, reflection on the love of 
boys lost some of its intensity, its seriousness, its vitality, if not 
its topicality.Where it appears, it has a facile, repetitive sound.Playing on ancient themes, often those of Platonism, it partici¬ 
pates in the reactivation of classical culture, but in a dull way.Even when philosophy tries to restore to the figure of Socrates 
some of its former prestige, the love of boys, with the problems 
it poses, does not constitute an active and vital focus of reflec¬ 
tion (the four speeches of Maximus of Tyre cannot furnish 
an argument to the contrary).
