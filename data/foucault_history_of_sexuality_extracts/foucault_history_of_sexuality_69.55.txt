This does not mean that the practice disappeared or that it 
became the object of a disqualification.All the texts plainly 
show that it was still common and still regarded as a natural 
thing.What seems to have changed is not the taste for boys, 
or the value judgment that was brought to bear on those who 
had this partiality, but the way in which one questioned one¬ 
self about it.An obsolescence not of the thing itself, but of the 
problem; a decline in the interest one took in it; a fading of the 
importance it was granted in philosophical and moral debate.There are no doubt many reasons for this “deproblematiza- 
tion.” Certain of them can be traced to the influence of Roman 
culture.
