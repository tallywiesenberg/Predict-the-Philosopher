2 Hellenized though it was, and satu¬ 
rated with philosophy, Rome, whose poets were so fond of 
singing of adolescents, offered few echoes of the great specula¬ 
tion of the Greeks on the love of boys.Further, the forms taken by pedagogical practice and its 
modes of institutionalization made it much more difficult to 
valorize the relationship with adolescents in terms of educa¬ 
tional efficacy.When Quintilian speaks of the moment when 
a boy should be entrusted to the rhetoric teacher, he empha¬ 
sizes the need to make sure of the latter’s “morals”: “Pupils 
are transferred to the school of rhetoric when they are practi¬ 
cally grown up, and they continue there when they are young 
men; accordingly, we must at this stage exercise even greater 
care that the stainless character of the teacher may preserve 
their more tender years from harm and that the weight of his 
authority may deter their bolder age from excess.” The 
teacher must therefore “adopt the attitude of a parent toward 
his pupils and consider that he is taking the place of those who 
entrust their children to him .” 3 In a more general way, a 
certain lessening of the importance of personal relations of 
philia, together with the valorization of marriage, no doubt 
had much to do with the fact that the love relation between 
men ceased to be the focus of an intense theoretical and moral 
discussion.Three important texts remain nevertheless: Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue on love, the later dialogue attributed to Lucian, and the 
four lectures by Maximus of Tyre on Socratic love.We can

leave aside this last text: not because of its rhetorical and 
artificial character—Pseudo-Lucian’s Affairs of the Heart are 
scarcely less so, and the reactivation of ancient themes in 
academic exercises was a feature characteristic of the epoch.
