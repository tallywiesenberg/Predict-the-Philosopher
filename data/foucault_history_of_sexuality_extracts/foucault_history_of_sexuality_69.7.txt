But the text by Maximus of Tyre is essentially devoted—this 
is what constitutes its traditionalism—to the distinction and 
comparison, in male relations, between two sorts of love: the 
love that is fine and just and the love that is not .4 Conforming 
to the Socratic tradition, Maximus of Tyre has this distinction 
coincide with the opposition between true love and the love 
that is only a simulation.Starting from this point, he develops 
a systematic and traditional comparison of the two loves.In 
terms of the qualities that belong to each: the first comprises 
virtue, friendship, modesty, candor, stability; the second com¬ 
prises excess, hatred, immodesty, infidelity.In terms of the 
ways of being that characterize them: the one is Hellenic and 
virile; the other is effeminate and barbaric.
