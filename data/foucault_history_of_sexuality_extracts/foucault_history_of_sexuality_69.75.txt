And lastly, in terms 
of the behaviors in which they are manifested: with the first, 
the lover takes care of the beloved, accompanies him to the 
gymnasium, goes hunting with him, into battle with him; he 
will be with him in death; and it is not in darkness or solitude 
that he seeks his company; with the second, on the other hand, 
the lover flees the sun, seeks darkness and solitude, and avoids 
being seen with the one he loves .5 

Plutarch’s and Pseudo-Lucian’s dialogues on love are con¬ 
structed quite differently.Their erotics is also binary and com¬ 
parative: it is still a matter of distinguishing two forms of love 
and of contrasting their value.But this time, instead of operat¬ 
ing within an Eros that is dominated, if not entirely repre¬ 
sented, by masculine love, in order to isolate two morally 
unequal forms of the latter, the comparison starts from two 
forms of relations that are naturally distinct: the relation with 
boys and the relation with women (and more specifically the 
relation that one may have with one’s lawful wife in the con¬ 
text of marriage).It is to these two distinct forms that the 
question of value, beauty, and moral superiority will be di¬ 
rected.
