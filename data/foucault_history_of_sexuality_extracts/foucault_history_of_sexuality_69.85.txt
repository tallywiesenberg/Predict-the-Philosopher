The 
love of boys will not become a doomed figure for all that.It 
will find many other ways of expressing itself in poetry and art.But it will undergo a kind of philosophical “disinvestment.” 
When it is examined, instead of asking it to reveal one of the 
highest possible forms of love, one will criticize it for a radical 
inadequacy, for its inability to accommodate relations of 
pleasure.The difficulty of accounting for the relations between 
this form of love and the use of the aphrodisia had long been 
the cause of its philosophical valorization.Now the difficulty 
becomes the reason for seeing it as a taste, a practice, a prefer¬ 
ence, which may have their tradition, but which are incapable 
of defining a style of living, an aesthetics of behavior, and a 
whole modality of relation to oneself, to others, and to truth.
