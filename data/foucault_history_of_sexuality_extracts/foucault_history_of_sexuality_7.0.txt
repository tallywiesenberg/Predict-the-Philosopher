process of confession and guidance. According to the new 
pastoral, sex must not be named imprudently, but its aspects, 
its correlations, and its effects must be pursued down to their 
slenderest ramifications: a shadow in a daydream, an image 
too slowly dispelled, a badly exorcised complicity between 
the body’s mechanics and the mind’s complacency: every¬ 
thing had to be told. A twofold evolution tended to make the 
flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important 
moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings

was an evil that afflicted the whole man, and in the most 
secret of forms: “Examine diligently, therefore, all the facul¬ 
ties of your soul: memory, understanding, and will. Examine 
with precision all your senses as well. . . . Examine, more¬ 
over, all your thoughts, every word you speak, and all your

do not think that in so sensitive and perilous a matter as this, 
there is anything trivial or insignificant.” 3 Discourse, there¬ 
fore, had to trace the meeting line of the body and the soul, 
following all its meanderings: beneath the surface of the sins, 
it would lay bare the unbroken nervure of the flesh. Under 
the authority of a language that had been carefully expur¬ 
gated so that it was no longer directly named, sex was taken 
charge of, tracked down as it were, by a discourse that aimed 
to allow it no obscurity, no respite. 

It was here, perhaps, that the injunction, so peculiar to the 
West, was laid down for the first time, in the form of a 
general constraint. I am not talking about the obligation to 
admit to violations of the laws of sex, as required by tradi¬ 
tional penance; but of the nearly infinite task of telling— 
telling oneself and another, as often as possible, everything 
that might concern the interplay of innumerable pleasures, 
sensations, and thoughts which, through the body and the 
soul, had some affinity with sex. This scheme for transform- 
ing sex into discourse had been devised long before in an
