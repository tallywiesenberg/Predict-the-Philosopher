process of confession and guidance. According to the new 
pastoral, sex must not be named imprudently, but its aspects, 
its correlations, and its effects must be pursued down to their 
slenderest ramifications: a shadow in a daydream, an image 
too slowly dispelled, a badly exorcised complicity between 
the body’s mechanics and the mind’s complacency: every¬ 
thing had to be told. A twofold evolution tended to make the 
flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important 
moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings

The History of Sexuality 


—so difficult to perceive and formulate—of desire. For this 
was an evil that afflicted the whole man, and in the most 
secret of forms: “Examine diligently, therefore, all the facul¬ 
ties of your soul: memory, understanding, and will. Examine 
with precision all your senses as well. . . . Examine, more¬ 
over, all your thoughts, every word you speak, and all your 
actions. Examine even unto your dreams, to know if, once 
awakened, you did not give them your consent. And finally, 
do not think that in so sensitive and perilous a matter as this, 
there is anything trivial or insignificant.” 3 Discourse, there¬ 
fore, had to trace the meeting line of the body and the soul, 
following all its meanderings: beneath the surface of the sins, 
it would lay bare the unbroken nervure of the flesh. Under 
the authority of a language that had been carefully expur¬ 
gated so that it was no longer directly named, sex was taken 
charge of, tracked down as it were, by a discourse that aimed 
to allow it no obscurity, no respite. 

It was here, perhaps, that the injunction, so peculiar to the 
West, was laid down for the first time, in the form of a 
general constraint. I am not talking about the obligation to 
admit to violations of the laws of sex, as required by tradi¬ 
tional penance; but of the nearly infinite task of telling— 
telling oneself and another, as often as possible, everything 
that might concern the interplay of innumerable pleasures, 
sensations, and thoughts which, through the body and the 
soul, had some affinity with sex. This scheme for transform- 
ing sex into discourse had been devised long before in an 
ascetic and monastic setting. The seventeenth century made 
it into a rule for everyone. It would seem in actual fact that 
it could scarcely have applied to any but a tiny elite; the great 
majority of the faithful who only went to confession on rare 
occasions in the course of the year escaped such complex 
prescriptions. But the important point no doubt is that this 
obligation was decreed, as an ideal at least, for every good

The Repressive Hypothesis

Christian. An imperative was established: Not only will you 
confess to acts contravening the law, but you will seek to 
transform your desire, your every desire, into discourse. In¬ 
sofar as possible, nothing was meant to elude this dictum, 
even if the words it employed had to be carefully neutralized. 
The Christian pastoral prescribed as a fundamental duty the 
task of passing everything having to do with sex through the 
endless mill of speech . 4 The forbidding of certain words, the 
decency of expressions, all the censorings of vocabulary, 
might well have been only secondary devices compared to 
that great subjugation: ways of rendering it morally accept¬ 
able and technically useful. 

One could plot a line going straight from the seventeenth- 
century pastoral to what became its projection in literature, 
“scandalous” literature at that. “Tell everything,” the direc¬ 
tors would say time and again: “not only consummated acts, 
but sensual touchings, all impure gazes, all obscene remarks 
. . . all consenting thoughts .” 5 Sade takes up the injunction 
in words that seem to have been retranscribed from the 
treatises of spirtual direction: “Your narrations must be 
decorated with the most numerous and searching details; the 
precise way and extent to which we may judge how the 
passion you describe relates to human manners and man’s 
character is determined by your willingness to disguise no 
circumstance; and what is more, the least circumstance is apt 
to have an immense influence upon the procuring of that 
kind of sensory irritation we expect from your stories .” 6 And 
again at the end of the nineteenth century, the anonymous 
author of My Secret Life submitted to the same prescription; 
outwardly, at least, this man was doubtless a kind of tradi-
