It is reasonable therefore to ask first of all: What is this 
injunction?Why this great chase after the truth of sex, the 
truth in sex?In Diderot’s tale, the good genie Cucufa discovers at the 
bottom of his pocket, in the midst of worthless things— 
consecrated seeds, little pagodas made of lead, and moldy 
sugar-coated pills—the tiny silver ring whose stone, when 
turned, makes the sexes one encounters speak.He gives it to 
the curious sultan.Our problem is to know what marvelous 
ring confers a similar power on us, and on which master’s 
finger it has been placed; what game of power it makes 
possible or presupposes, and how it is that each one of us has 
become a sort of attentive and imprudent sultan with respect 
to his own sex and that of others.
