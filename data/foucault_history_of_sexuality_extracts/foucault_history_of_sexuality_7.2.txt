I 


Objective 


Why these investigations?I am well aware that an uncer¬ 
tainty runs through the sketches I have drawn thus far, one 
that threatens to invalidate the more detailed inquiries that 
I have projected.I have repeatedly stressed that the history 
of the last centuries in Western societies did not manifest the 
movement of a power that was essentially repressive.I based 
my argument on the disqualification of that notion while 
feigning ignorance of the fact that a critique has been 
mounted from another quarter and doubtless in a more radi¬ 
cal fashion: a critique conducted at the level of the theory of 
desire.In point of fact, the assertion that sex is not “re¬ 
pressed” is not altogether new.
