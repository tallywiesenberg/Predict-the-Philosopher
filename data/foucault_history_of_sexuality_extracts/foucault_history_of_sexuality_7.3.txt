And 
I grant that one might justifiably say to me: By constantly 
referring to positive technologies of power, you are playing 
a double game where you hope to win on all counts; you 
confuse your adversaries by appearing to take the weaker 
position, and, discussing repression alone, you would have us 
believe, wrongly, that you have rid yourself of the problem 
of law; and yet you keep the essential practical consequence 
of the principle of power-as-law, namely the fact that there 
is no escaping from power, that it is always-already present, 
constituting that very thing which one attempts to counter 
it with.As to the idea of a power-repression, you have re¬ 
tained its most fragile theoretical element, and this in order 
to criticize it; you have retained the most sterilizing political 
consequence of the idea of power-law, but only in order to 
preserve it for your own use.The aim of the inquiries that will follow is to move less 
toward a “theory” of power than toward an “analytics” of 
power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain 
formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of 
the instruments that will make possible its analysis.How¬ 
ever, it seems to me that this analytics can be constituted 
only if it frees itself completely from a certain representation 
of power that I would term—it will be seen later why— 
“juridico-discursive.” It is this conception that governs both 
the thematics of repression and the theory of the law as 
constitutive of desire.In other words, what distinguishes the 
analysis made in terms of the repression of instincts from 
that made in terms of the law of desire is clearly the way in

which they each conceive of the nature and dynamics of the 
drives, not the way in which they conceive of power.
