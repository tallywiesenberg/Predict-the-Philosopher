Where 
sex and pleasure are concerned, power can “do” nothing but 
say no to them; what it produces, if anything, is absences and 
gaps; it overlooks elements, introduces discontinuities, sepa¬ 
rates what is joined, and marks off boundaries.Its effects take 
the general form of limit and lack.— The insistence of the rule.Power is essentially what 
dictates its law to sex.Which means first of all that sex is 
placed by power in a binary system: licit and illicit, permitted 
and forbidden.
