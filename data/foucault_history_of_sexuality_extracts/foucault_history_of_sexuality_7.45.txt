Secondly, power prescribes an “order” for sex 
that operates at the same time as a form of intelligibility: sex 
is to be deciphered on the basis of its relation to the law.And 
finally, power acts by laying down the rule: power’s hold on 
sex is maintained through language, or rather through the 
act of discourse that creates, from the very fact that it is 
articulated, a rule of law.It speaks, and that is the rule.The 
pure form of power resides in the function of the legislator; 
and its mode of action with regard to sex is of a juridico- 
discursive character.84

shalt not touch, thou shalt not consume, thou shalt not 
experience pleasure, thou shalt not speak, thou shalt not 
show thyself; ultimately thou shalt not exist, except in dark¬ 
ness and secrecy.
