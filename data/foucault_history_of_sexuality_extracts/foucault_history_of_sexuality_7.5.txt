ascetic and monastic setting. The seventeenth century made 
it into a rule for everyone. It would seem in actual fact that 
it could scarcely have applied to any but a tiny elite; the great 
majority of the faithful who only went to confession on rare 
occasions in the course of the year escaped such complex 
prescriptions. But the important point no doubt is that this 
obligation was decreed, as an ideal at least, for every good

The Repressive Hypothesis

confess to acts contravening the law, but you will seek to 
transform your desire, your every desire, into discourse. In¬ 
sofar as possible, nothing was meant to elude this dictum, 
even if the words it employed had to be carefully neutralized. 
The Christian pastoral prescribed as a fundamental duty the 
task of passing everything having to do with sex through the 
endless mill of speech . 4 The forbidding of certain words, the 
decency of expressions, all the censorings of vocabulary, 
might well have been only secondary devices compared to 
that great subjugation: ways of rendering it morally accept¬ 
able and technically useful. 

One could plot a line going straight from the seventeenth- 
century pastoral to what became its projection in literature, 
“scandalous” literature at that. “Tell everything,” the direc¬ 
tors would say time and again: “not only consummated acts, 
but sensual touchings, all impure gazes, all obscene remarks 
. . . all consenting thoughts .” 5 Sade takes up the injunction 
in words that seem to have been retranscribed from the 
treatises of spirtual direction: “Your narrations must be 
decorated with the most numerous and searching details; the 
precise way and extent to which we may judge how the 
passion you describe relates to human manners and man’s 
character is determined by your willingness to disguise no 
circumstance; and what is more, the least circumstance is apt 
to have an immense influence upon the procuring of that 
kind of sensory irritation we expect from your stories .” 6 And 
again at the end of the nineteenth century, the anonymous 
author of My Secret Life submitted to the same prescription; 
outwardly, at least, this man was doubtless a kind of tradi-
