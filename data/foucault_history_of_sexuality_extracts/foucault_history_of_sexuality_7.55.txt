Power con¬ 
strains sex only through a taboo that plays on the alternative 
between two nonexistences.— The logic of censorship.This interdiction is thought to 
take three forms: affirming that such a thing is not permitted, 
preventing it from being said, denying that it exists.Forms 
that are difficult to reconcile.But it is here that one imagines 
a sort of logical sequence that characterizes censorship 
mechanisms: it links the inexistent, the illicit, and the inex¬ 
pressible in such a way that each is at the same time the 
principle and the effect of the others: one must not talk about 
what is forbidden until it is annulled in reality; what is inex¬ 
istent has no right to show itself, even in the order of speech 
where its inexistence is declared; and that which one must 
keep silent about is banished from reality as the thing that 
is tabooed above all else.
