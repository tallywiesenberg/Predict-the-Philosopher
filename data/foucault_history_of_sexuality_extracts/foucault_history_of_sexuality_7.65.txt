Whether one attributes to it the form of the 
prince who formulates rights, of the father who forbids, of 
the censor who enforces silence, or of the master who states 
the law, in any case one schematizes power in a juridical 
form, and one defines its effects as obedience.Confronted by 
a power that is law, the subject who is constituted as subject 
—who is “subjected”—is he who obeys.To the formal 
homogeneity of power in these various instances corresponds 
the general form of submission in the one who is constrained 
by it—whether the individual in question is the subject oppo¬ 
site the monarch, the citizen opposite the state, the child 
opposite the parent, or the disciple opposite the master.A 
legislative power on one side, and an obedient subject on the 
other.Underlying both the general theme that power represses 
sex and the idea that the law constitutes desire, one encoun¬ 
ters the same putative mechanics of power.
