The History of Sexuality 


Why is this juridical notion of power, involving as it does 
the neglect of everything that makes for its productive effec¬ 
tiveness, its strategic resourcefulness, its positivity, so readily 
accepted?In a society such as ours, where the devices of 
power are so numerous, its rituals so visible, and its instru¬ 
ments ultimately so reliable, in this society that has been 
more imaginative, probably, than any other in creating devi¬ 
ous and supple mechanisms of power, what explains this 
tendency not to recognize the latter except in the negative 
and emaciated form of prohibition?Why are the deploy¬ 
ments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law 
of interdiction?Let me offer a general and tactical reason that seems self- 
evident: power is tolerable only on condition that it mask a 
substantial part of itself.Its success is proportional to its 
ability to hide its own mechanisms.
