Would power be ac¬ 
cepted if it were entirely cynical?For it, secrecy is not in the 
nature of an abuse; it is indispensable to its operation.Not 
only because power imposes secrecy on those whom it domi¬ 
nates, but because it is perhaps just as indispensable to the 
latter: would they accept it if they did not see it as a mere 
limit placed on their desire, leaving a measure of freedom— 
however slight—intact?Power as a pure limit set on freedom 
is, at least in our society, the general form of its acceptability.There is, perhaps, a historical reason for this.
