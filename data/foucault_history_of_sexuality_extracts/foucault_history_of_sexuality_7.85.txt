The great 
institutions of power that developed in the Middle Ages— 
monarchy, the state with its apparatus—rose up on the basis 
of a multiplicity of prior powers, and to a certain extent in 
opposition to them: dense, entangled, conflicting powers, 
powers tied to the direct or indirect dominion over the land, 
to the possession of arms, to serfdom, to bonds of suzerainty 
and vassalage.If these institutions were able to implant

alliances, they were able to gain acceptance, this was because 
they presented themselves as agencies of regulation, arbitra¬ 
tion, and demarcation, as a way of introducing order in the

temper them and distribute them according to boundaries 
and a fixed hierarchy.Faced with a myriad of clashing 
forces, these great forms of power functioned as a principle 
of right that transcended all the heterogeneous claims, mani¬ 
festing the triple distinction of forming a unitary regime, of 
identifying its will with the law, and of acting through mech¬ 
anisms of interdiction and sanction.The slogan of this re¬ 
gime, pax et justitia, in keeping with the function it laid claim 
to, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private 
wars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling 
of lawsuits.Doubtless there was more to this development of 
great monarchic institutions than a pure and simple juridical 
edifice.
