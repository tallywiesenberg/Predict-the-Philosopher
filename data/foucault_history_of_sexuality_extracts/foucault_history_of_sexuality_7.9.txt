But such was the language of power, the representa¬ 
tion it gave of itself, and the entire theory of public law that 
was constructed in the Middle Ages, or reconstructed from 
Roman law, bears witness to the fact.Law was not simply 
a weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the mo¬ 
narchic system’s mode of manifestation and the form of its 
acceptability.In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the 
exercise of power has always been formulated in terms of 
law.A tradition dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth 
century has accustomed us to place absolute monarchic 
power on the side of the unlawful: arbitrariness, abuse, ca¬ 
price, willfulness, privileges and exceptions, the traditional 
continuance of accomplished facts.But this is to overlook a 
fundamental historical trait of Western monarchies: they 
were constructed as systems of law, they expressed them¬ 
selves through theories of law, and they made their mech¬ 
anisms of power work in the form of law.
