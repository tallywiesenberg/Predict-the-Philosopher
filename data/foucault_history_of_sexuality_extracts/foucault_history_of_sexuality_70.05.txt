The theo¬ 
retical aim of the debate is in harmony with this devotional 
practice.It will provide the rational justification for the latter: 
to show that the conjugal relationship, more than any other, 
is capable of accommodating the force of love, and that, 
among humans, love has its privileged place in the couple.The pretext for the conversation and the external peripeteia 
that give rise to its successive developments are recounted in 
a solemn and ironic fashion.A “pathetic” situation has arisen, 
which “merely wants a chorus to sympathize and lacks a 
stage, for no other element of drama is wanting .” 3 In reality, 
what has transpired is a little comic episode.Bacchon, the 
desirable adolescent—he is handsome and virtuous—is pur¬ 
sued by an erastes, but also by a widow, who is much older 
than he.
