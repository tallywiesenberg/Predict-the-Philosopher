It starts from the traditional schema—be it in the myth¬ 
ical figures or in the moral casuistry—of the crossroads.There 
are two paths: Which does one choose, that of love for boys 
or that of love for women?Now, in actual fact the debate does 
not exactly raise this problem.Whereas in the Platonic texts 
the noble, masculine Eros is contrasted with the facile, multi¬ 
ple, physical, “pandemian” Eros (which, clearly, is the love 
that can be practiced with boys and with girls outside mar¬ 
riage), in Plutarch the choice is between boys on the one hand 
and marriage on the other, as if it were in the latter that the 
relationship with women is fulfilled.Another distinctive element in Plutarch’s dialogue is the 
personage of the woman who is pursuing the boy.
