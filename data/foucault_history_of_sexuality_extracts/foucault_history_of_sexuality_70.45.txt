Many mythi¬ 
cal and historical narratives revolve around one of these epi¬ 
sodes of violence.The Love Stories attributed to Plutarch and 
those Lectures of Maximus of Tyre that are devoted to So- 
cratic love make reference to them .8 If a person as virtuous as 
Ismenodora gives way to such an assault, this is because she 
has been possessed by “some divine impulse, more powerful 
than human reason.” Now all these traits (the age difference, 
the acknowledged merit, the interest taken in the moral quali¬ 
ties and good reputation of the beloved, the initiative of the 
pursuit, the violence of divine inspiration) are easily recogniz¬ 
able.They are those which characterize the lover of boys in 
the traditional pederastic model.Ismenodora, in Plutarch’s 
description, is exactly in the position of the erastes.
