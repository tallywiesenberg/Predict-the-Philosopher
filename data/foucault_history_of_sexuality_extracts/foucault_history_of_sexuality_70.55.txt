One sees two movements running beneath Plutarch’s dia¬ 
logue.First, there is the shift resulting from the discussion 
itself; the question of the choice the beloved must make be¬ 
tween his two lovers surreptitiously becomes the question of 
love in its two possible forms—for boys and for girls.And 
second, the shift, made possible by the paradoxical situation 
of the intrigue, which confers on the relationship with a 
woman the same ethical potential as the relationship with a 
man.
