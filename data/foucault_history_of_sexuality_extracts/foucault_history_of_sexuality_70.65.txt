It is legitimate to place it alongside the 
Stoic treatises on marriage.It has many themes and formula¬ 
tions in common with them.But we are dealing, in this text, 
with something quite different from an argumentation in favor 
of marriage and against pederasty.We can see in it the first 
shape of an important change in the old erotics.This transfor¬ 
mation can be summed up briefly: whereas scarcely any dis¬ 
continuity, impassable boundary, or important difference of 
values was recognized in the practice of the aphrodisia, in 
return the elaboration of the erotics was clearly dualistic.
