This 
dualism was, moreover, double and, in itself, rather complex.On the one hand, common love (that love in which sensual 
acts are preponderant) was opposed to noble, pure, elevated, 
heavenly love (in which the presence of these same acts are, 
if not disallowed, at least veiled).On the other hand, the 
specificity of the love for boys was stressed, the aspiration, 
form, goals, and effects of which were supposed—at least 
provided one acted in conformity with its true nature—to be 
different from those found in the other loves.Furthermore, 
these two dualisms tended to overlap, since it was held that 
“true” love for boys could only be a pure love, a love free of 
the vulgar pursuit of the aphrodisia (which actuates the desire 
for women or the corrupt appetite for boys).A continuous 
domain of the aphrodisia, and an erotics with a binary struc¬ 
ture: it is this configuration that begins to be reversed here.
