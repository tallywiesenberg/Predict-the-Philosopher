Plutarch’s Dialogue may bear witness to a movement that will 
not actually be completed until much later, when an abso¬ 
lutely unitary conception of love will be constructed, while the 
practice of pleasure will be divided by a strict boundary: the 
one that separates the conjoinings of one sex with the other 
and relations within the same sex.It is roughly this order of 
things which is still ours today, solidified as it is by a unitary 
conception of sexuality, which enables one to delimit strictly 
the dimorphism of relations and the differential structure of 
desire.Boys

In Plutarch’s Dialogue, one sees the effort to constitute a 
unitary erotics, very clearly organized on the model of the 
man-woman, and even husband-wife, relationship.In compar¬ 
ison with this single love (it is supposed to be the same, 
whether it is directed to women or to boys), the pederastic 
attachment will in fact be disqualified, but without a rigid line 
of demarcation being drawn, as it will be later, between 
“homo-” and “heterosexual” acts.The whole burden of the 
text bears on this unification of erotics.
