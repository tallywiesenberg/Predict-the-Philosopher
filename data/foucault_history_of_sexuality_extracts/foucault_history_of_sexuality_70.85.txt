They were there long 
enough to celebrate differential erotics one last time.Accord¬ 
ing to this erotics, the love of boys is both different from the 
attraction to women and superior to it, for two reasons: one 
has to do with their respective positions relative to nature, and 
the other concerns the role played, in each of them, by plea¬ 
sure.The advocates of the love of boys do refer briefly to the 
frequent argument that contrasts everything that is artificial 
about women (adornments and perfumes for some; razors, 
philters, and makeup for the most shameless) with the natural¬ 
ness of the boys one sees at the palestrae.10 But their main 
argument against love for women is that it is nothing more 
than a natural inclination.In reality, it is nature, says Proto¬ 
genes, that has placed an appetite (orexis) in us that draws the 
two sexes to each other.
