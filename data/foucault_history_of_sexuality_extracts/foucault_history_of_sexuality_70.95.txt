But it restricts the value of this practice 
to that of a behavior found everywhere in the animal world, 
a behavior whose reason for being is basic necessity.The 
natural character of relations with women is put forward by 
Protogenes in order to underscore its defectiveness and to 
show how it differs from a love of boys, which scorns such 
necessities and aims much higher.Actually he does not exÂ¬ 
plain what he understands by this love that is beyond nature.It is Plutarch who will take up these Platonic themes, but only 
to integrate them, against the apologists of boys, into a unitary 
conception of love.The other difference is marked by the role of pleasure.
