The 
fondness for women cannot be detached from pleasure.The 
love for boys, on the contrary, does not truly accord with its 
own essence unless it frees itself of pleasure.The argumentaÂ¬ 
tion used by Protogenes and Pisias in support of this principle 
is Stoic, if anything.They observe that intercourse with 
women was indeed designed by nature for the conservation of 
the species.But things were arranged in such a way that 
pleasure is associated with this act.
