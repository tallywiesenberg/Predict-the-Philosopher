For this reason, the appe¬ 
tite and the impulse (orexis, horme) that induce us to perform 
it are always apt to become violent and unrestrained; in this 
case, they are transformed into desire (epithumia).Thus we 
are led in two ways toward that natural object which a woman 
constitutes: by the appetite, a natural movement, which looks 
to the survival of the generations as its reasonable goal and 
uses pleasure as a means; and by desire, a violent movement, 
with no internal regulation, which has “pleasure and enjoy¬

and chaste woman to feel “love” for her husband and to accept 
“being loved” by him (eran, erastai).13 Hence there is only one 
true love, the love of boys, because unworthy pleasures are 
absent from it and because it necessarily implies a friendship 
that is indissociable from virtue.
