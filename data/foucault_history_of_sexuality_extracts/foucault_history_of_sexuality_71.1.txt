If, moreover, the erastes finds 
that his love does not give rise to friendship and virtue in the 
other, then he abjures his attention and his fidelity.14 

To this traditional line of argument, there will be an ex¬ 
pected reply: Daphnaeus’ denunciation of pederastic hypoc¬ 
risy.As if a tearful Achilles had not evoked the thighs of 
Patroclus, as if Solon, apropos of boys in the flower of their 
youth, had not praised “the sweetness of their thighs and their 
lips,” the fancier of boys likes to pose as a philosopher and a 
sage.But undoubtedly he waits only for an opportunity.At 
night when all is quiet, “sweet is the harvest when the guard 
is away.” One sees the dilemma: either the aphrodisia are 
incompatible with friendship and love, and in this case the 
lovers of boys who enjoy in secret the bodies they desire have 
fallen from the heights of love; or one admits that sensual 
pleasures have a place in friendship and love, and so there is 
no reason to exclude from the latter relationships with women.
