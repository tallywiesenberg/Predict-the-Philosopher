Up to this point, remarks Pemptides, the debate 
has focused on personal questions; it needs to be directed 
toward general themes.2.The central part of the dialogue consists of a eulogy of 
Love in the traditional manner of praising a god; his truly 
divine nature is thereby established.Here Plutarch opposes 
the Epicurean-inspired argument outlined by Pemptides, acÂ¬ 
cording to which the gods are nothing more than our passions; 
and he shows that the Love that takes possession of us is the 
effect of a necessarily divine power.This power is compared 
to that of the other gods, an important passage because it 
shows how Eros is a necessary complement of Aphrodite.
