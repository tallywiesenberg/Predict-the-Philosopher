Without him, the work of Aphrodite would be nothing more 
than the pleasure of the senses and could be bought for a 
drachma.Contrary to what people say, he is also stronger and 
more courageous than Ares: it is out of mutual love that 
lovers, in battle, throw themselves on the enemy, fighting 
boldly to their death rather than fleeing in shame.Plutarch 
describes his action on men’s souls, which he renders “gener¬ 
ous, compassionate, and liberal, and which he pervades 
through and through, as in a divine possession.” Finally, the 
eulogy ends with a reference to Egyptian myths and an exposi¬ 
tion of the Platonic theory.The remarkable thing about this eulogy is that all the ele¬ 
ments stem from the traditional erotics of pederasty.Most of 
the cases are borrowed from the love of boys or from the 
example of Sappho (Alcestis and Admetus form almost the 
only exception).
