proposition advanced by Daphnaeus: “if we have regard for 
the truth, the liking for boys and the liking for women origi¬

This seems to be the essential business of the dialogue.The 
little drama of the “pederastic” kidnapping of Bacchon by 
Ismenodora merely serves as its immediate context and illus¬ 
tration.Everything that the erotics of boys was able to claim 
as properly belonging to that form of love (in opposition to the 
false love for women) will be reutilized here, without anything 
from the great pederastic tradition being overlooked—on the 
contrary.But it will be used as a general form capable of 
subsuming both loves.
