In particular, it will be applied not only 
to the fondness for women, but to the conjugal relationship 
itself.After a speech by Zeuxippus—which the manuscripts have 
not passed down to us and which is supposed to have criticized 
conjugal love, not on behalf of pederasty, but in Epicurean 
terms—Plutarch speaks again in order to establish three es¬ 
sential points.First, he observes that if Love is indeed what 
he is said to be, he will make his presence, his power, and his 
actions felt in relations between the two sexes as well as in 
relations with boys.Let us assume for a moment that the 
Epicurean argument is correct: the images which emanate 
from the loved body, which are conveyed to the eyes of the one 
who loves, which enter into his body, fill it with emotion and 
agitate it to the point where sperm is formed—there is no 
reason why this mechanism should be set in motion by boys 
and not by women.18 On the other hand, suppose that we 
accept the Platonic argument toward which Plutarch inclines: 
if “through the freshness and grace of a body” one perceives 
the beauty of a soul, and the latter, recalling the heavenly 
spectacle, gives wings to our soul, why would the difference 
between the sexes matter here, where it is only a question of 
“beauty” and “natural excellence”?
