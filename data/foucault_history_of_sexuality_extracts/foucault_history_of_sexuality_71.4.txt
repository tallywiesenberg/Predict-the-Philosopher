19 Plutarch shows that this 
element of virtue, arete, by which the traditional erotics of 
boys marked one of its important differences from the fond-

The Care of the Self 


ness for women, transcends any difference of sex: “They say 
that beauty is the flower of virtue; yet it would be absurd to 
deny that the female produces that flower or gives it a presen¬ 
tation of a natural bent for virtue ... all these characteristics 
belong to both sexes alike.” 20 

As for the friendship that the pederasts wish to reserve 
exclusively for the love of boys, Plutarch shows that it can also 
characterize the relationship of a man with a woman, or at 
least with his wife (this specification is obviously crucial).It 
is conjugality and it alone that engenders the form of friend¬ 
ship in the relationship between the sexes.Plutarch evokes this 
conjugality briefly here, in a few strokes reminiscent of the 
Marriage Precepts.It involves sharing a common life (Plu¬ 
tarch plays on the words stergein and stegein, “to shelter,” “to 
keep at home”); it calls for mutual kindness (eunoia); it im¬ 
plies perfect community and a oneness of souls in separate 
bodies, a unity so strong that the spouses “no longer wish to 
be separate entities, or believe that that are so” 21 ; lastly, it 
requires reciprocal moderation, a sophrosyne that abjures any 
other liaison.It is concerning this last point that the transposi¬ 
tion of the theory of Eros to the practice of married life is most 
interesting, for it suggests an idea of the high value of marriage 
very different from that found in the Stoics.
