As a matter of 
fact, against the moderation that “comes from without,” 
which is nothing but obedience to laws and is imposed by 
shame and fear, Plutarch opposes the moderation that is the 
effect of Eros: it is Eros in fact, when he inflames the two 
spouses for one another, who teaches “self-control, decorum, 
and mutual trust.” Into the amorous soul of the husband and 
the wife, he introduces “modesty, silence, calm”; he bestows 
“a reserved manner” on them and makes them “attentive to 
a single being.” It is easy to recognize in this sketch the 
characteristics of the pederastic Eros, the bringer of virtue and 
measure to the souls of lovers, the source, in the more perfect 
beings like Socrates, of that self-restraint which made him 
hold his silence and keep control of his desires in the presence 
of those he loved.Plutarch transposes to the married couple

the traits that had long been reserved for the philia of lovers 
of the same sex.However, the elaboration of a general theory of love, 
equally valid for the relationship with women and the relation¬ 
ship with boys, is skewed: Plutarch has not gone, as Anthem- 
ion asked him to do and as he claimed to be doing, from a 
particular love to a more general love.He has borrowed from 
the erotics of boys its fundamental and traditional features in 
order to demonstrate that they can be applied, not to all forms 
of love, but to the conjugal relationship alone.3.
