Such is in fact the ultimate goal of the dialogue: to show 
that this single chain of love, which can find its perfect realiza¬ 
tion in marriage, cannot be accommodated, at least not in its 
complete form, in the relationship with boys.While this rela¬ 
tionship, with its traditional values, has been able to serve as 
a support and model for the general conception of love, it finds 
itself, in the last analysis, invalidated and fallen into disfavor: 
an imperfect love when one compares it with that of husband 
and wife.Where does Plutarch have this imperfection reside?So long 
as one had a dualistic erotics that distinguished true love (true 
because it was pure) from false, delusive love (false because it 
was physical), the absence of the aphrodisia was not merely 
possible, it was necessary if this was to be made the love 
relation par excellence.But the elaboration of a general erot¬ 
ics, linking Eros and Aphrodite closely together, changes the 
terms of the problem.
