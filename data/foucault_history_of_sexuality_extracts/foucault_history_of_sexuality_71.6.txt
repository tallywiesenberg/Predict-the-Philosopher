* Either sexual relations will be im¬ 
posed through violence and the individual who undergoes 
them will feel only anger, hatred, and desire for revenge.Or 
they will be consented to by an individual who, because of his 
“softness,” his “femininity,” “enjoys being passive” (hedome- 
nos toi paschein), which is a “shameful,” “unnatural” thing, 
and which reduces him to the lowest condition.24 Plutarch has 
gone back to the “dilemma of the eromenos"-.compelled, he 
feels hatred, and consenting, he becomes an object of con¬ 
tempt.The traditional adversaries of pederasty let it go at that.
