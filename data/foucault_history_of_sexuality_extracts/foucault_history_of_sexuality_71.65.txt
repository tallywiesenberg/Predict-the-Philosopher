But Plutarch’s analysis goes further, attempting to define what 
is lacking in the love of boys, what prevents it from being, like 
conjugal love, a harmonious mixture of Eros and Aphrodite, 
in which the bond between souls is associated with physical 
pleasure.Plutarch designates this deficiency with one word: 
the love of boys is acharistos.The word charis, which appears several times in the course 
of the dialogue, seems to be one of the keys to Plutarch’s 
reflection.It is introduced with a good deal of solemnity at the 
beginning of the text, before the formulation of the great 
theory of a single love.Daphnaeus is the first to use it, as an 
“overpowering” argument in favor of his thesis: the love of 
women is special, he says, in that through the practice of such 
sexual relations as nature has established, it can lead to friend¬ 
ship (eis philian) by way of charis.
