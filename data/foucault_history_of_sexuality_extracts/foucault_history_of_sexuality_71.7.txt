25 And Daphnaeus attaches 
so much importance to this term that he immediately under¬ 
takes to define it and to give it a few great poetic sponsors: 
charis is the consent that a woman willingly grants to a man, 
a consent that can appear only with nubility, according to 
Sappho, and the absence of which can result, according to 
Pindar, in ungraceful births; thus Hephaestus was born from 
Hera “aneu chariton.” 2A The role that is assigned to this acqui¬ 
escence is clear: to integrate sexual relations, with their two 
naturally defined poles of activity and passivity, into recipro-

cal relations of kindness and to bring physical pleasure into 
friendship.After this preliminary presentation, and once the unitary 
doctrine of love is established, the question of charis becomes 
preponderant at the end of the dialogue.It will serve as a 
discriminant between the love of women and the love of boys, 
only the former being able to engender that complete form in 
which are joined, owing to the gentleness of consent, the plea¬ 
sure of Aphrodite and the virtue of friendship.Now Plutarch 
does not conceive of this junction simply as a tolerance that 
could concede, in the conjugal relationship, a more or less 
utilitarian place (e.g., for procreation) to sexual acts.
