On the 
contrary, he makes the latter the starting point of the whole 
relation of affection that should animate the relationship.Physical pleasure, precisely insofar as the gentleness of con¬ 
sent excludes everything in the way of violence, deceit, or base 
compliance, can be at the very origin of the affectionate reci¬ 
procities that marriage requires: “Physical union with a lawful 
wife is the beginning of friendship, a sharing, as it were, in 
great mysteries.” Sensual pleasure is a small matter (this is 
even a traditional expression among the enemies of physical 
pleasure); but, Plutarch immediately adds, “it is like the seed 
out of which mutual respect [time], kindness [charis], affec¬ 
tion [agapesis], and loyalty [p/vt/s] daily grow between hus¬ 
band and wife.” 27 

To this fundamental role and this germinative function of 
physical pleasure, Plutarch gives a solemn historical sanction.He finds it in the legislation by Solon, which prescribed that 
husbands must have intercourse with their wives “not less 
than three times a month.” In the Life of Solon, he also 
referred to this law, pointing out that it applied only to the 
marriage of heiress girls.The reason for it was the need for 
offspring to whom one could leave the estate.But, Plutarch 
added, this was not the only reason: for this regular inter¬ 
course, even when “it does not result in children,” “is a mark 
of esteem and affection which a man should pay to a chaste

wife; it always removes the many annoyances which develop, 
and prevents their being altogether estranged by their differ¬ 
ences.” 28 To this role of sexual intercourse as an inducement 
to regular intimacy and a guarantee of good understanding, 
Plutarch, in the Dialogue on Love, lends an even more solemn 
formulation.
