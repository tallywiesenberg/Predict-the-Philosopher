He makes it a way to put new life into the conju¬ 
gal relationship, similar to the way in which one renews an 
agreement: “As cities renew their mutual agreements from 
time to time, just so he [Solon] must have wished this to be 
a renewal of marriage and with such an act of tenderness to 
wipe out the complaints that accumulate in everyday living.” 29 
Sexual pleasure is therefore at the heart of the matrimonial 
relation as a source and a token of the relationship of love and 
friendship.It founds the relationship, or in any case, reaffirms 
it as a covenant of existence.And if Plutarch acknowledges 
that the sexual relations at the beginning of marriage may be 
“wounding” to the wife, he also explains how this very “bite” 
is necessary for the formation of a vital, solid, and durable 
conjugal unity.He resorts to three metaphors: that of a plant 
that is grafted and must be well incised if it is to form, with 
the graft, a tree that will bear the desired fruit; that of a child 
or young man in whom one must inculcate, not without pain 
for him, the rudiments of a knowledge he will later turn to 
advantage and profit; that, lastly, of one liquid that is poured 
into another—after a period of effervescence and agitation, a 
mixture is produced, resulting in that di' ho Ion krasis to which 
the Marriage Precepts also made reference, 30 and together they 
form a new liquid whose two components can no longer be 
separated.A certain suffering, agitation, and disorder are inev¬ 
itable at the beginning of conjugal relations; but this is the 
necessary condition for a new, stable unity to be formed.
