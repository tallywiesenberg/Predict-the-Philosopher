The activity therefore is a 
source of faithfulness as well, since each of the two can take 
the love they feel for the other as a guide for their conduct and 
a reason for limiting their desires.“Love rescues us from all 
errors that wreck or impair wedlock.” 32 This union owes its 
value and its stability to the schema of a double love in which 
each partner is, from the standpoint of Eros, always an active 
subject.Owing to this reciprocity in the act of loving, sexual 
relations can have their place in the form of mutual affection 
and consent.In terms of this relational model, pederasty can 
only be inadequate in view of the strongly marked difference 
between the erastes and the eromenos, the dilemma of passiv¬ 
ity, and the necessary fragility that is due to the age factor.It 
lacks the double and symmetrical activity of loving, hence it 
lacks the internal regulation and the stability of the couple.
