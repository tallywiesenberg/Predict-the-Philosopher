Plutarch brings these same Platonic 
notions into play in an erotics that seeks to form a single Eros 
capable of accounting for the love of women and the love of 
boys, and to integrate the aphrodisia into it.But in the inter¬ 
ests of such a unity, this erotics ultimately excludes the love 
of boys, for it lacks charis.Starting from a dualistic erotics 
traversed.by the question of truth and semblance, and in¬ 
tended essentially to provide a rational foundation for the love 
of boys, but at the cost of an elision of the aphrodisia, one sees, 
in Plutarch, a new stylistics of love being formed.It is monistic 
in that it includes the aphrodisia, but it makes this inclusion 
a criterion allowing it to keep only conjugal love and to ex¬ 
clude relations with boys because of the deficiency that char¬ 
acterizes them.There can no longer be a place for them in this 
great unitary and integrative chain in which love is revitalized 
by the reciprocity of pleasure.
