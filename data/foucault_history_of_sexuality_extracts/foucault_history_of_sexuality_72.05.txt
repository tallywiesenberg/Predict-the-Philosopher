Pseudo-Lucian 


The Affairs of the Heart, attributed to Lucian, is manifestly 
a later text.* It is presented in the quite customary form of in¬ 
terlocking dialogues.Theomnestus, whose loves—for women 
or for boys—reappear more numerous than the heads of 
Hydra, almost before they have ended, complains of Aphro¬ 
dite.From the time when as a child he became an ephebe, the 
wrath of the goddess has been pursuing him.And yet, he is 
not a child of the Sun, nor does he have the boorish contempt 
of Hippolytus.
