He feels equally inclined toward both kinds of 
love, without managing to decide which of the two is more 
deserving of his attention.He asks Lycinus—who is not 
affected by either of these two passions—to serve as an impar¬ 
tial judge and to tell him which is the better choice.Fortu¬ 
nately, Lycinus has preserved, as if engraved in his memory, 
the dialogue of two men on this very subject.One of them 
loved only boys, considering the female Aphrodite to be only 
“an abyss.” The other was passionately fond of women.So he 
will relate their discussion.
