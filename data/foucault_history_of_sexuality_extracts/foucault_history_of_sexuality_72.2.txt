Taken together, they constitute the typical discourse of the 
Advocate of Women and the Devotee of Boys.Traditional 
arguments, obligatory quotations, references to great philo¬ 
sophical ideas, rhetorical flourishes—the author smiles in re¬ 
porting the speeches of these imperturbable disputants.And, 
from this point of view, it should be noted that the pederastic 
discourse is much more ponderous, pretentious, and “ba¬ 
roque” than the one spoken in favor of women, which is 
plainer, more Stoicizing.The final irony—Theomnestus will 
observe that what it all comes down to is just a matter of 
kisses, caresses, and hands that wander beneath tunics—will 
be mainly at the expense of the eulogy of the love of boys.But 
this very irony indicates the seriousness of the problem that 
is raised.
