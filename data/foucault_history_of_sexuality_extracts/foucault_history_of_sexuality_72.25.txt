And whatever enjoyment Pseudo-Lucian may have

most prominent features, of that “contest of loves” which had 
such a long career in Hellenic culture.There is something surprising at the beginning of the dia¬

is undecided between the two loves: this dialogue, which will 
be concluded (not without some ambiguity) in favor of the 
love of boys, is not placed under the sign of Eros, who is 
regarded as the guardian of this form of attachment, but under 
that of Aphrodite.The scene that Lycinus is supposed to recall 
in its smallest details unfolds at Cnidus, near the temple of
