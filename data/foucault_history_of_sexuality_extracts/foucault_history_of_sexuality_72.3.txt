The rea¬ 
son is that the problem of physical pleasure traverses the entire 
dialogue.This is what the perplexity expressed by Theomnes- 
tus, equally susceptible to the charm of girls and the beauty 
of boys, is about; it is a question of the aphrodisia.It is 
physical pleasure that will have the last word and dismiss the 
prudish speeches with a peal of laughter.And it is physical 
pleasure that serves as a pretext for the debate between Chari- 
cles and Callicratidas—in the form of a meaningful anecdote: 
a young man, enamored of the marble by Praxiteles, had let 
himself be locked in the temple at night, and he had sullied 
the statue, but as if it had been a boy.2 The telling of this story 
—a very traditional one—occasions the debate.
