Since the sac¬ 
rilegious act was addressed to Aphrodite, was it an homage to 
the goddess who presides over female pleasures?But given the 
form in which it was carried out, was it not a testimonial 
against that particular Aphrodite?An ambiguous act.Should 
this impious homage, this profanatory reverence, be ac¬ 
counted to the love of women, or of boys?And the question that runs through the whole dialogue, 
even if it appears forgotten in the most ethereal statements, 
will be this: What place, what form, should be given to sexual 
pleasure in the two loves?
