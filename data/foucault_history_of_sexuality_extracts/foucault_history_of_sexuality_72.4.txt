The answer to this question will 
serve as a discriminant, offering to the love of boys, in the 
heaven of philosophy, a moment’s victory, which the irony of 
reality will soon compromise.The debate has a rigid composition.Each of the two orators 
speaks in turn, and pleads, in a continuous discourse, the 
cause of the love he prefers.A silent witness (Lycinus) will 
judge the contest and determine the winner.Although the 
“boy-favoring” discourse of Callicratidas is longer and more 
ornate than that of Charicles, the two speeches have the same 
structure.
