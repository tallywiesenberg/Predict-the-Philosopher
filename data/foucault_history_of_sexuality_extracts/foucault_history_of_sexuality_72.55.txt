Knowing very well that living beings were made “from perish¬ 
able matter,” and since the time allotted to each being was 
brief, she contrived (emechanesato) things in such a way that 
the death of one would be the birth of another.Thus, through 
the process of succession, we can live forever.To accomplish 
this, she also contrived the division of the sexes, one being 
designed to ejaculate semen, the other to receive it.And she 
imbued each with an appetite (pothos) for the other.From the 
intercourse of these two sexes can come the succession of the 
generations, but never from the intercourse between two in¬ 
dividuals of the same sex.
