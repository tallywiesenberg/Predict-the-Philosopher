to the gods through virtue, a desire to behave heroically, 
marriage at a suitable age, and a noble progeny: these were the 
four traits that characterized that lofty existence and ensured 
its accord with nature.Then came the fall, which was gradual.It seems that Charicles distinguishes, as stages in this degener¬ 
ation, the time when, pleasure leading humans to the depths, 
people sought “strange and extraordinary paths to enjoy¬ 
ment” (Should this be taken to mean non procreative forms of 
sexual relations or pleasures alien to marriage?), then the time 
when they came to “transgress the laws of Nature herself,” a 
bold development whose basic form—the only one in any case 
which is mentioned in the text—consists in treating a man like 
a woman.Now, in order for an act so alien to Nature to be 
possible, it was necessary that what enables one to do violence 
and to deceive—tyrannical power and the art of persuasion— 
be brought into relations between men.
