Charicles finds the third mark of naturalness in the animal 
world 7 —“the laws of nature” rule over them without restric¬ 
tion or division: neither lions, nor bulls, nor rams, nor boars, 
nor wolves, nor fish seek out their own sex.For them, “the 
decisions of Providence are unchangeable.” To this chaste 
animality, Pseudo-Lucian’s orator opposes the “perverse bes¬ 
tiality” of men, which makes them lower than other creatures 
whereas they were meant to be superior to the highest of them.Several significant terms are employed in Charicles’ speech to 
characterize this “bestiality” on the part of men: passion, but 
also “strange infection,” “blind insensibility” (anaisthesia), 
inability to hit the mark, so that they neglect what should be 
pursued and pursue what should be left alone.In contrast to 
the conduct of the animals, who obey the law and aim for the 
goal that is assigned to them, men who have sex with men 
evince all the signs traditionally ascribed to the passional state: 
uncontrolled violence, a sickly condition, blindness to the real¬ 
ity of things, an incapacity for attaining the goals set for 
human nature.In sum, the love of boys is placed in turn on the three axes 
of nature, as the general order of the world, the original state
