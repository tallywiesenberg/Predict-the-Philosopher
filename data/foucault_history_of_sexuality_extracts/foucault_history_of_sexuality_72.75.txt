It disturbs the orderly progression of things; 
it gives rise to violent and deceitful conduct.Finally, it is 
pernicious from the standpoint of human objectives.Cosmo- 
logically, “politically,” and morally, this type of relation 
transgresses nature.In the part of his discourse that replies to these assertions, 
Callicratidas does not so much advance arguments that refute 
his adversary, as put forward a different conception of the 
world, the human race, its history, and the noblest ties that 
can connect men to each other.To the idea of nature as a 
provident “mechanic” who, by means of sex, arranged for 
procreation and the succession of generations so as to give the 
human race an eternity that individuals are denied, he opposes 
the vision of a world formed out of chaos.
