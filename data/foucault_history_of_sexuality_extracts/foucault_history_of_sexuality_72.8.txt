It was the demiurgic 
Eros who conquered this primeval disorder by creating all 
things that have a soul and all that do not, by instilling the 
principle of harmony in the body of men, and by attaching 
them to one another through “the holy sentiment of friend¬ 
ship.” Charicles saw, in relations between men and woman, an 
artful Nature who established temporal succession in order to 
circumvent death.Callicratidas recognizes, in the love of boys, 
the strength of the bond that, by attaching and combining, 
triumphs over chaos.8 

From this perspective, the history of the world should not 
be read as an early disregard for the laws of nature and a 
plunge into “the depths of pleasure,” but rather as a gradual 
release from the primary necessities.9 In the beginning, man 
was pressed by needs.The arts and skills (technai and epis- 
temai) made it possible for him to escape from these pressures 
and to provide for himself in a better fashion.
