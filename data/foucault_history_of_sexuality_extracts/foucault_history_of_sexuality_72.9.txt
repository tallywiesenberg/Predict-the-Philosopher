Pseudo-Lucian’s orator does 
not really explain this twin birth, but his speech contains 
enough familiar references so that it would have been readily 
understandable to any reader.It rests implicitly on the opposi¬ 
tion between the imparting of life through intercourse with the 
other sex and the imparting of “techniques” and “knowl¬ 
edges” through teaching, learning, and the relationship of 
disciple with master.When, emerging from the particular arts, 
philosophy began to inquire concerning all things, it found, as 
a means of transmitting the wisdom it obtains, the love of boys 
—which is also the love of noble souls, capable of virtue.One 
understands, then, how Callicratidas can reply with laughter 
to the animal lesson presented by his adversary: 10 What ex¬ 
actly is proved by the fact that lions do not love the males of 
their species, and that he-bears are not enamored of he-bears?Not that men have corrupted a nature that remains intact 
among the animals, but that animals do not know what it 
means to “philosophize,” and they are ignorant of the beauty 
that friendship can produce.
