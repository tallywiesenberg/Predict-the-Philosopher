the exacting sign of Nature.Which does not mean, obviously, 
that the Stoics condemned a pederasty that Platonism justified 
while rejecting marriage.We know that, from the viewpoint 
of doctrines, this is not the way things were—or in any case,

notice, in the documents we have, the presence of what might 
be called “a privileged association.” We have seen in the 
preceding part that the art of conjugal life was understood 
largely in terms of a Stoic mode of reflection, and in reference 
to a certain conception of nature, of its basic necessities, of the 
place and function ordained by it for all beings, of a general 
scheme of successive procreations, and of a state of original 
perfection from which the human race was estranged owing 
to a perverse decadence.
