Moreover, it is from a similar concep¬ 
tion that Christianity will amply draw when it decides to 
construct an ethics of the marital relationship.In the same 
way, the love of boys, practiced as a way of life, consolidated 
and reproduced for centuries a rather different theoretical 
landscape: a cosmic and individual force of love, an upward 
movement that enables man to escape from immediate neces¬ 
sities, the acquisition and transmission of knowledge through 
the intense forms and secret ties of friendship.The debate 
between the love of women and the love of boys is more than 
a literary joust.It is not, however, the conflict of two forms 
of sexual desire struggling for supremacy or for their respec¬ 
tive right to expression.It is the confrontation of two forms 
of life, of two ways of stylizing one’s pleasure, and of the two 
philosophical discourses that accompany these choices.
