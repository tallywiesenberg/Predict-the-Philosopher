on this theme with a traditional denunciation of pederastic 
hypocrisy: You pretend to be disciples of Socrates who are not 
enamored of bodies but of souls.How is it then that you do 
not pursue old men full of wisdom, but rather children, who 
are unable to reason?If it’s a matter of virtue, why love, as 
Plato did, a Phaedrus who betrayed Lysias, or, as Socrates did, 
an impious Alcibiades, an enemy of his country, eager to 
become a tyrant?One would do well, therefore, despite the 
claims of this love of souls, “to descend,” along with Chari- 
cles, to the question of pleasure, and to compare “the practice 
of boys” with the “practice of women.” 

Among the arguments that Charicles employs to differenti¬ 
ate between these two “practices” and the place that pleasure 
occupies in each, the first is that of age and transience.12 Until 
the threshold of old age, a woman preserves her charms—even 
if she must lend them the support of her long experience.
