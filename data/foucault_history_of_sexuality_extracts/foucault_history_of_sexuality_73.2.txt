A 
boy, for his part, is agreeable only for a moment.And Chari¬ 
cles contrasts the body of a woman—who, with her ringlets 
of hair, her skin always smooth and “not a hair growing on 
it,” remains an object of desire—with the body of a boy, which 
very soon becomes hairy and muscled.But from this differ¬ 
ence, Charicles does not conclude, as is often done, that one 
can love a boy only for a very short time, and that one is very 
soon led to abandon him.Rather, he evokes the man who goes 
on loving a boy past twenty.What he pursues in this case is 
an “equivocal Aphrodite,” a love in which he plays the passive 
part.
