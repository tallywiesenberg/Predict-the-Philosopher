That the shared life has this role is 
an idea that is regularly found in the Stoic treatises on mar¬ 
riage.Here it is applied to the specific domain of physical 
pleasures.Charicles first evokes the meals and banquets that 
one enjoys with others, because, according to him, shared 
pleasures are made more intense.Then he speaks of the sexual 
pleasures.According to the traditional assertion, the boy who 
is passive, hence more or less violated (hubrismenos), cannot 
experience pleasure; no one “could be so mad” as to state the 
contrary.
