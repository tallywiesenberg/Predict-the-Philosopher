To this fact of nature corresponds a principle of 
conduct: it is good not to seek a selfish enjoyment (philautos 
apolausai), not to try and have all the pleasure oneself, but to 
share it by supplying the other with as much of it as one 
experiences.To be sure, this reciprocity of pleasure is already 
a well-known theme, which amatory or erotic literature has 
used quite often.But it is interesting to see it used here at the 
same time to give a “natural” characterization of intercourse 
with women, to define a rule of behavior in the practice of the 
aphrodisia, and to designate what there might be that is non¬ 
natural, violent, hence unjust and bad, in the intercourse of a 
man with a boy.Reciprocity of pleasure in an exchange where 
one shows concern for the other’s enjoyment, while observing 
as strict an equality as possible of the two partners, inscribes 
within sexual practice an ethics that extends the ethics of 
communal existence.To this serious bit of reasoning, Charicles adds two argu¬ 
ments that are less so, although they both relate to the ex¬ 
change of pleasures.
