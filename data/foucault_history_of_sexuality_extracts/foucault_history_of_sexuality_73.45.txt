One refers to a theme that was common 
in erotic literature: women, for anyone who knows how to use 
them, are capable of offering all the pleasures that boys can

give, but the latter cannot provide the pleasure that is held 
exclusively by the female sex.14 Women are thus capable of 
giving all the forms of sensual delight, including those most 
pleasing to the lovers of boys.According to the other argu¬ 
ment, if one finds love between men acceptable, one should 
also accept intercourse between women.15 This polemical sym¬ 
metry invoked here between intermale relations and inter¬ 
female relations is interesting: first, because it denies, as does 
the second part of Charicles’ discourse, the cultural, moral, 
affective, and sexual specificity of the love of boys, bringing 
it back into the general category of relations between male 
individuals; second, because, in order to compromise the 
latter, it uses the traditionally more scandalous love—one is 
“ashamed” even to talk about it—between women; and third, 
because Charicles, reversing this hierarchy, suggests that it is 
even more shameful for a man to be passive like a woman than 
for a woman to take the male role.* 

The part of Callicratidas’ discourse that replies to this criti¬ 
cism is by far the longest.
