demonstration consists first of all 
in criticizing, as illusory, that reciprocity of pleasure which 
the love of women claims as its specific trait, and in setting 
against it, as the only relationship capable of truth, the virtu¬ 
ous relationship with boys.Thus, in a single stroke, the privi¬ 
lege of reciprocal pleasure attributed to male-female relations 
will be contested, and the theme that the love of boys is 
unnatural will be turned around.In a display of rancor, Callicratidas reels off a series of 
commonplaces against women.17 One only has to look closely 
to see that women are intrinsically “ugly,” “truly” (alethos) 
so: their bodies are “unshapely” and their faces are as ill- 
favored as those of monkeys.They must take great pains to 
mask this reality: makeup, fancy clothes, coiffures, jewels, 
adornments.
