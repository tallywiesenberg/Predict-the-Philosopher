For the benefit of spectators they give themselves 
a spurious beauty, which a careful gaze suffices to dissipate.And then they have a liking for secret cults, which allow them 
to envelop their debauches in mystery.There is no need to 
recall all the satirical themes that are echoed, rather flatly, by 
this passage.One could find many other examples, with simi¬ 
lar arguments, in the eulogies of pederasty.Thus Achilles 
Tatius, in Leucippe and Clitophon, has one of his characters, 
a lover of boys, say: “False are the ways of a woman, words 
and deeds alike; and although she may seem fair to behold, it 
is all the result of the laborious use of pigments, and her 
beauty is all of myrrh, hair dye and makeup; and if she is 
stripped of all these many devices, she is like the jackdaw that 
was plucked of its feathers in the fable.” 18 

A woman’s world is deceptive because it is a secret world.
