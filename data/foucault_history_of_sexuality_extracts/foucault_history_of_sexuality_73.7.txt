The social separation between the group of men and that of 
women, their different ways of life, the careful division be¬ 
tween female activities and male activities—all this probably 
did much to heighten, in the experience of Hellenic men, this 
apprehension of women as mysterious and deceptive objects.One could be deceived about a woman’s body, which was 
hidden by adornments and which might be disappointing 
when it was uncovered.One was apt to suspect it of cleverly 
masked imperfections.One was afraid of discovering some 
repellent defect.The female body, with its secrecy and its 
particular characteristics, was charged with ambiguous pow¬ 
ers.
