Do you wish, says Ovid, to rid yourself of a passion?Look 
a little more closely at the body of your mistress.19 * One could 
be deceived, too, regarding morals, with that secret life which 
women led, a life enclosed in disturbing mysteries.In the 
argumentation that Pseudo-Lucian attributes to Callicratidas, 
these themes have a precise significance: they enable him to 
question the principle of reciprocity of pleasure in intercourse 
with women.How could there be such a reciprocity if women 
are deceptive, if they have their own pleasure, if, unbeknown 
to men, they indulge in secret debauchery?
