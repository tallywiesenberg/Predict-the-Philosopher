In contrast, pleasure with boys is placed under the sign of 
truth.21 The beauty of a young man is real because it is uncon¬ 
trived.As Achilles Tatius has one of his characters say: “The 
beauty of a boy is not fostered by the odor of myrrh perfumes, 
nor yet by cunning and foreign unguents.And the fresh natu¬ 
ral odor of a boy has a sweeter smell than all the anointings 
and perfumery of a woman.” 22 Callicratidas contrasts the de¬ 
ceptive enticements of the female dressing table with a descrip¬ 
tion of the boy who gives no thougnt to any preparations: he 
jumps out of bed at dawn and washes with pure water.He has 
no need of a mirror, he doesn’t use a comb.
