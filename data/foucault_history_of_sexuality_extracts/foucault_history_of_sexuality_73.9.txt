chlamys on his shoulder and hurries off to school.At the 
palestra he exercises vigorously, works up a sweat, and bathes

understood, he quickly falls asleep as a result of the day’s 
beneficial exertions.How could one not wish to share one’s whole life with this 
guileless boy?23 One would like to “pass one’s time sitting 
opposite this dear friend,” enjoying his pleasant conversation, 
and “sharing every activity with him.” A sensible pleasure 
that will last not just for the fleeting time of youth.
