This is how things were, says Callicratidas, between 
Orestes and Pylades, about whom it was traditional to won¬ 
der, as in the case of Achilles and Patroclus, who was the lover 
and who the beloved.Pylades was the lover, it seems.But as 
they grew older, and when the time of trial came—the two 
friends had to decide which one would face death—the be¬ 
loved behaved as the lover.One should see a model in this.It 
is in this way, says Callicratidas, that the zealous and serious 
love one bears for a young boy (the famous spoudaios erds) 
must be transformed.
