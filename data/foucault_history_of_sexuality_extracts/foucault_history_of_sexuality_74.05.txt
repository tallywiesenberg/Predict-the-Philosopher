It must become the manly form (an- 
drousthai) with the coming of that age when a youth is at last 
capable of reason.In this masculine affection, the one who had 
been loved “gives love in return,” and to such an extent that 
it becomes difficult to know “which of the two is the erastes 
the affection of the one who loves is returned to him by the 
beloved the way an image is reflected in a mirror.25 

The return by the beloved of the affection he has received 
had always been a part of pederastic ethics, whether this was 
in the form of help in misfortune, care in old age, companion¬ 
ship in lif e, or unexpected sacrifice.But Pseudo-Lucian’s insis¬ 
tence on the equality of the two lovers and his use of words 
that characterize conjugal reciprocity seem to show a concern 
to adapt male love to the descriptive and prescriptive model 
of marriage.After enumerating everything that is simple, nat¬ 
ural, and free of all artifice in the body of a young man, and 
hence after establishing the “truthfulness” of the pleasure he 
is capable of providing, the author of the text relates the 
spiritual bond, not to pedagogical action, or to the formative 
effect of this attachment, but entirely to the exact reciprocity 
of an equal exchange.
