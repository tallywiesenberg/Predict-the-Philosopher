And Callicratidas gives some unequivocal ad¬ 
vice to the lovers of such boys: Remain as chaste as Socrates 
when he slept beside Alcibiades.Approach them with temper¬ 
ance (sophronos).Don’t squander a lasting affection for the 
sake of a brief pleasure.And it is this very lesson which will 
be drawn, once the debate is concluded, when, with an ironic 
solemnity, Lycinus awards the prize; it goes to the speech that 
praised the love of boys, insofar as the latter is practiced by 
“philosophers” and insofar as it pledges itself to ties of friend¬ 
ship that are “just and undefiled.” 

The debate between Charicles and Callicratidas thus ends 
with a “victory” of the love of boys.A victory conforming to 
a traditional schema that reserves for philosophers a pederasty 
in which physical pleasure is evaded.
