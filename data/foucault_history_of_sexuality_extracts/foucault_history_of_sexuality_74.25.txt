Theomnestus does not 
become indignant, as did Charicles, at the hypocrisy of such 
a discourse.Whereas, in order to link together pleasure and 
virtue, the advocates of boys stressed the absence of any sexual 
act, he reinstates the physical contact that one enjoys, the 
kisses, the caresses, and the gratification, as the real reason for 
the existence of this love.Seriously, he says, they can’t make 
us believe that the whole pleasure of this relationship is in 
looking into each other’s eyes and in being enchanted by 
friendly conversation.Looking is agreeable, certainly, but it is 
only the first stage.After that comes touching, which thrills 
the whole body.
