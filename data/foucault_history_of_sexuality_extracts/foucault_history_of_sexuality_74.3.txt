Then kissing, which is timid at first but soon 
becomes eager.The hand does not remain idle during this 
time; it glides down under the clothing, squeezes the breasts 
for a moment, descends the length of the firm belly, reaches 
the “flower of puberty,” and finally strikes the target .26 For 
Theomnestus, and doubtless for the author as well, this de¬ 
scription does not amount to a rejection of an inadmissible 
practice.It is a reminder that it is not possible—without re¬ 
sorting to violence—to keep the aphrodisia outside the do¬ 
main of love and its justifications.Pseudo-Lucian’s irony is not 
a way of denouncing this pleasure which one can take in boys, 
a pleasure he evokes with a smile.
