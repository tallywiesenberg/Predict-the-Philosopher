It is a fundamental objection 
to the very old line of argument of Greek pederasty, which, 
in order to conceptualize, formulate, and discourse about the

manifest presence of physical pleasure.He does not say that 
the love of women is better.But he demonstrates the essential 
weakness of a discourse on love that makes no allowance for 
the aphrodisia and for the relations they engage.3

is not in philosophical texts, and it does not borrow its major 
themes from the love of boys.
