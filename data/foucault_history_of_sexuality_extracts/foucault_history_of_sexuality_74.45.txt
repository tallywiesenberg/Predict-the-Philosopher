Not only does it occupy an important 
place, certainly, in the tales of Petronius or Apuleius, which 
attests to the frequency and quite general acceptance of the 
practice.But it is also present in certain tales of virginity, 
betrothal, and marriage.Thus in Leucippe and Clitophon, two 
characters represent it, and in a completely positive manner: 
Clinias, who tries to dissuade his own male lover from mar¬ 
riage, nevertheless gives the hero of the tale some excellent 
advice for making progress in the love of girls .2 Menelaus, for 
his part, offers a charming theory of a boy’s kiss—not cunning, 
or soft, or licentious, like that of a woman; a kiss that is the 
product not of art but of nature: a glaze of nectar become lips, 
such is the simple kiss of a boy at the gymnasium .3 But these 
are only episodic and marginal themes.
