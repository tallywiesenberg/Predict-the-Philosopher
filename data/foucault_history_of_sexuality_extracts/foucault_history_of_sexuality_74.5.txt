The love of a boy is 
never the principal object of the narrative.The whole focus of 
attention is centered on the relationship of the boy and the 
girl.This relationship always begins with a revelation that 
strikes them both and makes them love each other with an 
equal intensity.Except in the novel by Chariton of Aphro- 
disias, Chaereas and Callirhoe, this love does not immediately 
result in their union: the novel recounts a long series of adven¬ 
tures, which separate the two young people and prevent both 
marriage and the consummation of pleasure until the last 
moment.* These adventures are, insofar as possible, symmet¬ 
rical.
