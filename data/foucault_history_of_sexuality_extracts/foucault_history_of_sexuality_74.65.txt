.glorifying the virgin state, which, she declares, is next to 
the immortal.” 4 Symmetrically, Theagenes had never had re¬ 
lations with a woman: “He affirmed with many oaths that he 
had never yet had intimacy with a woman.He had spurned 
all women, and marriage itself, and many love affairs that were 
mentioned to him, until the beauty of Chariclea had proved 
to him that he was not by nature obdurate.But up to the 
previous day he had never beheld a woman worthy of being 
loved.” 5 

We see then that virginity is not simply abstention as a 
preliminary to sexual practice.It is a choice, a style of life, a 
lofty form of existence that the hero chooses out of the regard 
that he has for himself.
