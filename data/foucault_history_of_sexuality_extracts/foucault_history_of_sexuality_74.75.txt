The 
lovers save themselves for each other until the time when love 
and virginity find their fulfillment in marriage.So that 
premarital chastity, which brings the two fiances together in 
spirit so long as they are separated and being put to the test 
by others, keeps them self-restrained and makes them abstain 
when they are finally reunited after many twists of fate.Find¬ 
ing themselves alone in a cave, left to themselves, Theagenes 
and Chariclea “took their fill of ardent embraces and kisses.In a moment they were oblivious of everything else.For a long 
time they clung to each other as though grown into one per¬ 
son, satiating themselves with a devout, virginal love, com¬ 
muning with one another through the flow of hot tears, and 
commingling only by the chaste means of their kisses.
