This new erotics organizes itself around the 
symmetrical and reciprocal relationship of a man and a 
woman, around the high value attributed to virginity, and

of pleasure.Philosophers condemn any sexual relation that 
might take place outside marriage and prescribe a strict 
fidelity between spouses, admitting no exceptions.FurtherÂ¬

love for boys.
