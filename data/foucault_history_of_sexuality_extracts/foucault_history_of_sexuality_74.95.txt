On the 
one side, a certain ancient ethics closely related to Christianity 
(this is the thesis of the Manuductio ad stoicam philosophiam 
by Justus Lipsius, which Karl Barth radicalized by making 
Epictetus into a true Christian; it is, later, on behalf of the 
Catholics, the thesis of J.-P. Camus and, most notably, of the 
Epictete chretien by Jean-Marie de Bordeaux).On the other 
side, those for whom Stoicism was just another philosophy, 
one that was virtuous, certainly, but indelibly pagan (thus 
Salmasius among the Protestants, and Arnauld or Tillemont 
among the Catholics).The point at issue, however, was not 
just to bring certain of the ancient philosophers within the 
bounds of the Christian faith or to preserve the latter from any 
pagan contamination; the problem was also to determine what 
foundation to give to an ethics whose prescriptive elements 
seemed to be shared, up to a point, by Greco-Roman philoso¬ 
phy and the Christian religion.The debate that developed at 
the end of the nineteenth century is not unconnected with this 
problematic either, even if it sets up an interference with prob¬ 
lems of historical method.Zahn, in his famous address, did 
not try to make a Christian of Epictetus, but to call attention 
to the signs of a knowledge of Christianity and to the traces 
of its influence.
