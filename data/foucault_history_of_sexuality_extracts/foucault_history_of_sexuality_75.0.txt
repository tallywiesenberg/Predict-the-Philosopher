1 Bonhoffer’s work, which replied to Zahn,

action in order to explain this or that aspect of it.2 But it was 
also a matter of knowing where to look for the basis of 
the moral imperative and whether it was possible to detach 
Christianity from a certain type of ethics that had long been 
associated with it.Now, in this debate it seems that the partici¬ 
pants granted, in a relatively confused way, three presupposi¬

ethics is to be sought in the code elements it contains; accord¬

resembled Christianity in its severe precepts, which repre¬

lastly, according to the third presupposition, it was in terms 
of loftiness and purity that Christian ethics could best be

there.One has to bear in mind, first, that the principles of 
sexual austerity were not defined for the first time in the 
philosophy of the imperial epoch.
