But the practice of absten¬ 
tion was demanded of it as well, so that it might preserve the 
spiritual value expected of it.Hence a very long time had 
passed during which concern for the body and for health, the 
relation to wives and to marriage, and the relationship with 
boys had been motifs for the elaboration of a severe ethics.And in a certain way, the sexual austerity that one encounters 
in the philosophers of the first centuries of our era has its roots 
in this ancient tradition.It is true that one should not ignore 
the carefully maintained continuity and the conscious reacti¬ 
vation evident in this thought of the first centuries, so mani¬ 
festly haunted by classical culture.Hellenistic philosophy and 
ethics experienced what Henri Marrou called “a long sum¬ 
mer.” But the fact remains that several modifications are 
perceptible: they prevent one from considering the moral 
philosophy of Musonius or that of Plutarch simply as the 
accentuation of the lessons of Xenophon, Plato, Isocrates, or 
Aristotle; they also prevent one from considering the recom¬ 
mendations of Soranus or Rufus of Ephesus as variations on 
the principles of Hippocrates or Diodes.
