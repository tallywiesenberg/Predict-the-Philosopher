The Care of the Self 


the change is marked by an increased apprehension, a broader 
and more detailed definition of the correlations between the 
sexual act and the body, a closer attention to the ambivalence 
of its effects and its disturbing consequences.And this is not 
just a greater preoccupation with the body; it is also a different 
way of thinking about sexual activity, and of fearing it because 
of its many connections with disease and with evil.With re¬ 
gard to wives and to the problematization of marriage, the 
modification mainly concerns the valorization of the conjugal 
bond and the dual relation that constitutes it; the husband’s 
right conduct and the moderation he needs to enjoin on him¬ 
self are not justified merely by considerations of status, but by 
the nature of the relationship, its universal form and the mu¬ 
tual obligations that derive from it.Finally, as regards boys, 
the need for abstinence is less and less perceived as a way of 
giving the highest spiritual values to the forms of love, and 
more and more as the sign of an imperfection that is specific 
to sexual activity.Now, in these modifications of preexisting themes one can 
see the development of an art of existence dominated by self¬ 
preoccupation.
