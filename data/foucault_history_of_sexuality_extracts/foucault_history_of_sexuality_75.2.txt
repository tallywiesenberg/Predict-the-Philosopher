This art of the self no longer focuses so much 
on the excesses that one can indulge in and that need to be 
mastered in order to exercise one’s domination over others.It 
gives increasing emphasis to the frailty of the individual faced 
with the manifold ills that sexual activity can give rise to.It 
also underscores the need to subject that activity to a universal 
form by which one is bound, a form grounded in both nature 
and reason, and valid for all human beings.It likewise empha¬ 
sizes the importance of developing all the practices and all the 
exercises by which one can maintain self-control and even¬ 
tually arrive at a pure enjoyment of oneself.It is not the ac¬ 
centuation of the forms of prohibition that is behind these 
modifications in sexual ethics.
