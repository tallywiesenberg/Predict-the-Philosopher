Problematization and apprehension go hand in 
hand; inquiry is joined to vigilance.A certain style of sexual 
conduct is thus suggested by this whole movement of moral, 
medical, and philosophical reflection.It is different from the 
style that had been delineated in the fourth century, but it is 
also different from the one that will be found in Christianity.Here sexual activity is linked to evil by its form and its effects, 
but in itself and substantially, it is not an evil.It finds its 
natural fulfillment in marriage, but—with certain exceptions 
—marriage is not an express, indispensable condition for it to 
cease being an evil.
