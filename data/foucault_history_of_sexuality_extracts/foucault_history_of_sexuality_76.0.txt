Translator’s 

Acknowledgments 


A number of people contributed to this translation, at 
Berkeley and elsewhere. Out of respect for the author’s work, 
they made an occasion of community for which I am grateful. 

Peter Brown generously shared his knowledge of classical 
matters and his familiarity with the author’s project. His criti¬ 
cal comments were an invaluable service. 

Stephen W. Foster reviewed the translation with a practiced 
eye and suggested many changes of phraseology, virtually all 
of which I incorporated into the text. 

Denis Hollier answered several questions that cropped up 
when my reading did not quite match the sophistication of the 
author’s prose. 

James Faubion drew up a list of reliable English versions of 
the major Greek texts. Without his recommendations, I would 
have risked many inaccuracies. 

Marie-Claude Perigon, my wife, helped me with various 
problems of micro-interpretation, that is, with the kind of 
difficulties every reader encounters but only translators have 
to resolve. 

I am indebted most to Paul Rabinow. He offered advice and 
encouragement—moral support—at every stage. 

I wish to dedicate this English version to the memory of 
Michel Foucault.

Modifications 


This series of studies is being published later than I had 
anticipated, and in a form that is altogether different. I will 
explain why. 

It was intended to be neither a history of sexual behaviors 
nor a history of representations, but a history of “sexuality” 
—the quotation marks have a certain importance. My aim was 
not to write a history of sexual behaviors and practices, tracing 
their successive forms, their evolution, and their dissemina¬ 
tion; nor was it to analyze the scientific, religious, or philo¬ 
sophical ideas through which these behaviors have been 
represented. I wanted first to dwell on that quite recent and 
banal notion of “sexuality”: to stand detached from it, brack¬ 
eting its familiarity, in order to analyze the theoretical and 
practical context with which it has been associated. The term 
itself did not appear until the beginning of the nineteenth 
century, a fact that should be neither underestimated nor 
overinterpreted. It does point to something other than a sim¬
