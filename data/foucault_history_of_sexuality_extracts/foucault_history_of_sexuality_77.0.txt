ple recasting of vocabulary, but obviously it does not mark the 
sudden emergence of that to which “sexuality” refers. The use 
of the word was established in connection with other 
phenomena: the development of diverse fields of knowledge 
(embracing the biological mechanisms of reproduction as well 
as the individual or social variants of behavior); the establish¬ 
ment of a set of rules and norms—in part traditional, in part 
new—which found support in religious, judicial, pedagogical,

and medical institutions; and changes in the way individuals 
were led to assign meaning and value to their conduct, their 
duties, their pleasures, their feelings and sensations, their 
dreams. In short, it was a matter of seeing how an “experi¬ 
ence” came to be constituted in modern Western societies, an 
experience that caused individuals to recognize themselves as 
subjects of a “sexuality,” which was accessible to very diverse 
fields of knowledge and linked to a system of rules and con¬ 
straints. What I planned, therefore, was a history of the expe¬ 
rience of sexuality, where experience is understood as the 
correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normativity, 
and forms of subjectivity in a particular culture. 

To speak of sexuality in this way, I had to break with a 
conception that was rather common. Sexuality was conceived 
of as a constant. The hypothesis was that where it was mani¬ 
fested in historically singular forms, this was through various 
mechanisms of repression to which it was bound to be sub¬ 
jected in every society. What this amounted to, in effect, was 
that desire and the subject of desire were withdrawn from the 
historical field, and interdiction as a general form was made 
to account for anything historical in sexuality. But rejection 
of this hypothesis was not sufficient by itself. To speak of 
“sexuality” as a historically singular experience also presup¬ 
posed the availability of tools capable of analyzing the peculiar 
characteristics and interrelations of the three axes that consti¬ 
tute it: (1) the formation of sciences (savoirs) that refer to it, 
(2) the systems of power that regulate its practice, (3) the 
forms within which individuals are able, are obliged, to recog¬ 
nize themselves as subjects of this sexuality. Now, as to the 
first two points, the work I had undertaken previously—hav¬ 
ing to do first with medicine and psychiatry, and then with 
punitive power and disciplinary practices—provided me with 
the tools I needed. The analysis of discursive practices made 
it possible to trace the formation of disciplines (savoirs) while 
escaping the dilemma of science versus ideology. And the 
analysis of power relations and their technologies made it

possible to view them as open strategies, while escaping the 
alternative of a power conceived of as domination or exposed 
as a simulacrum. 

But when I came to study the modes according to which 
individuals are given to recognize themselves as sexual sub¬ 
jects, the problems were much greater. At the time the notion 
of desire, or of the desiring subject, constituted if not a theory, 
then at least a generally accepted theoretical theme. This very 
acceptance was odd: it was this same theme, in fact, or varia¬ 
tions thereof, that was found not only at the very center of the 
traditional theory, but also in the conceptions that sought to 
detach themselves from it. It was this theme, too, that ap¬ 
peared to have been inherited, in the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries, from a long Christian tradition. While the experi¬ 
ence of sexuality, as a singular historical figure, is perhaps 
quite distinct from the Christian experience of the “flesh,” 
both appear nonetheless to be dominated by the principle of 
“desiring man.” In any case, it seemed to me that one could 
not very well analyze the formation and development of the 
experience of sexuality from the eighteenth century onward, 
without doing a historical and critical study dealing with de¬ 
sire and the desiring subject. In other words, without under¬ 
taking a “genealogy.” This does not mean that I proposed to 
write a history of the successive conceptions of desire, of 
concupiscence, or of libido, but rather to analyze the practices 
by which individuals were led to focus their attention on 
themselves, to decipher, recognize, and acknowledge them¬ 
selves as subjects of desire, bringing into play between them¬ 
selves and themselves a certain relationship that allows them 
to discover, in desire, the truth of their being, be it natural or 
fallen. In short, with this genealogy the idea was to investigate 
how individuals were led to practice, on themselves and on 
others, a hermeneutics of desire, a hermeneutics of which their 
sexual behavior was doubtless the occasion, but certainly not 
the exclusive domain. Thus, in order to understand how the
