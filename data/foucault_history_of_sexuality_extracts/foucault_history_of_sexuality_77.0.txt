ple recasting of vocabulary, but obviously it does not mark the 
sudden emergence of that to which “sexuality” refers. The use 
of the word was established in connection with other 
phenomena: the development of diverse fields of knowledge 
(embracing the biological mechanisms of reproduction as well 
as the individual or social variants of behavior); the establish¬ 
ment of a set of rules and norms—in part traditional, in part 
new—which found support in religious, judicial, pedagogical,

and medical institutions; and changes in the way individuals 
were led to assign meaning and value to their conduct, their 
duties, their pleasures, their feelings and sensations, their 
dreams. In short, it was a matter of seeing how an “experi¬ 
ence” came to be constituted in modern Western societies, an 
experience that caused individuals to recognize themselves as 
subjects of a “sexuality,” which was accessible to very diverse 
fields of knowledge and linked to a system of rules and con¬ 
straints. What I planned, therefore, was a history of the expe¬ 
rience of sexuality, where experience is understood as the 
correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normativity, 
and forms of subjectivity in a particular culture. 

To speak of sexuality in this way, I had to break with a 
conception that was rather common. Sexuality was conceived 
of as a constant. The hypothesis was that where it was mani¬ 
fested in historically singular forms, this was through various 
mechanisms of repression to which it was bound to be sub¬ 
jected in every society. What this amounted to, in effect, was 
that desire and the subject of desire were withdrawn from the 
historical field, and interdiction as a general form was made 
to account for anything historical in sexuality. But rejection 
of this hypothesis was not sufficient by itself. To speak of 
“sexuality” as a historically singular experience also presup¬ 
posed the availability of tools capable of analyzing the peculiar 
characteristics and interrelations of the three axes that consti¬ 
tute it: (1) the formation of sciences (savoirs) that refer to it, 
(2) the systems of power that regulate its practice, (3) the 
forms within which individuals are able, are obliged, to recog¬ 
nize themselves as subjects of this sexuality. Now, as to the 
first two points, the work I had undertaken previously—hav¬ 
ing to do first with medicine and psychiatry, and then with
