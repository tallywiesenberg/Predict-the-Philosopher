the tools I needed. The analysis of discursive practices made

possible to view them as open strategies, while escaping the 
alternative of a power conceived of as domination or exposed 
as a simulacrum. 

But when I came to study the modes according to which 
individuals are given to recognize themselves as sexual sub¬ 
jects, the problems were much greater. At the time the notion 
of desire, or of the desiring subject, constituted if not a theory, 
then at least a generally accepted theoretical theme. This very 
acceptance was odd: it was this same theme, in fact, or varia¬ 
tions thereof, that was found not only at the very center of the 
traditional theory, but also in the conceptions that sought to 
detach themselves from it. It was this theme, too, that ap¬ 
peared to have been inherited, in the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries, from a long Christian tradition. While the experi¬ 
ence of sexuality, as a singular historical figure, is perhaps 
quite distinct from the Christian experience of the “flesh,” 
both appear nonetheless to be dominated by the principle of 
“desiring man.” In any case, it seemed to me that one could 
not very well analyze the formation and development of the 
experience of sexuality from the eighteenth century onward, 
without doing a historical and critical study dealing with de¬ 
sire and the desiring subject. In other words, without under¬ 
taking a “genealogy.” This does not mean that I proposed to 
write a history of the successive conceptions of desire, of 
concupiscence, or of libido, but rather to analyze the practices 
by which individuals were led to focus their attention on 
themselves, to decipher, recognize, and acknowledge them¬ 
selves as subjects of desire, bringing into play between them¬ 
selves and themselves a certain relationship that allows them 
to discover, in desire, the truth of their being, be it natural or 
fallen. In short, with this genealogy the idea was to investigate 
how individuals were led to practice, on themselves and on 
others, a hermeneutics of desire, a hermeneutics of which their 
sexual behavior was doubtless the occasion, but certainly not 
the exclusive domain. Thus, in order to understand how the
