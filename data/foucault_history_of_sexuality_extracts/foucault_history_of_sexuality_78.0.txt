“sexuality,” it was essential first to determine how, for centu¬ 
ries, Western man had been brought to recognize himself as 
a subject of desire. 

A theoretical shift had seemed necessary in order to analyze 
what was often designated as the advancement of learning; it 
led me to examine the forms of discursive practices that ar¬ 
ticulated the human sciences. A theoretical shift had also been 
required in order to analyze what is often described as the 
manifestations of “power”; it led me to examine, rather, the 
manifold relations, the open strategies, and the rational tech¬ 
niques that articulate the exercise of powers. It appeared that 
I now had to undertake a third shift, in order to analyze what 
is termed “the subject.” It seemed appropriate to look for the 
forms and modalities of the relation to self by which the 
individual constitutes and recognizes himself qua subject. 
After first studying the games of truth (jeuxde verite) in their 
interplay with one another, as exemplified by certain empirical 
sciences in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and then 
studying their interaction with power relations, as exemplified 
by punitive practices—I felt obliged to study the games of 
truth in the relationship of self with self and the forming of 
oneself as a subject, taking as my domain of reference and field 
of investigation what might be called “the history of desiring 
man.” 

But it was clear that to undertake this genealogy would 
carry me far from my original project. I had to choose: either 
stick to the plan I had set, supplementing it with a brief 
historical survey of the theme of desire, or reorganize the 
whole study around the slow formation, in antiquity, of a 
hermeneutics of the self. I opted for the latter, reasoning that, 
after all, what I have held to, what I have tried to maintain 
for many years, is the effort to isolate some of the elements 
that might be useful for a history of truth. Not a history that 
would be concerned with what might be true in the fields of 
learning, but an analysis of the “games of truth,” the games 
of truth and error through which being is historically con-

stituted as experience; that is, as something that can and must 
be thought. What are the games of truth by which man pro¬ 
poses to think his own nature when he perceives himself to be 
mad; when he considers himself to be ill; when he conceives 
of himself as a living, speaking, laboring being; when he judges 
and punishes himself as a criminal? What were the games of 
truth by which human beings came to see themselves as desir¬ 
ing individuals? It seemed to me that by framing the question 
in this way, and by attempting to develop it for a period that 
was rather far from the horizons with which I was familiar, 
I would be going more closely into the inquiry that I have long 
been committed to—even if this approach were to demand a 
few years of additional work. This long detour carried risks, 
to be sure; but I was motivated, and I seemed to have discov¬ 
ered a certain theoretical advantage in the research that I 
envisaged. 

The risks? First, there was the likelihood of delaying and 
upsetting the publication schedule that I had projected. I am 
gratef ul to those who followed the advances and detours of my 
work—I am thinking of my auditors at the College de France 
—and to those who had the patience to wait for its outcome 
—Pierre Nora in particular. As to those for whom to work 
hard, to begin and begin again, to attempt and be mistaken, 
to go back and rework everything from top to bottom, and still 
find reason to hesitate from one step to the next—as to those, 
in short, for whom to work in the midst of uncertainty and 
apprehension is tantamount to failure, all I can say is that 
clearly we are not from the same planet. 

There was also the danger that I would be dealing with 
documents with which I was insufficiently acquainted.* I 

*1 am neither a Hellenist nor a Latinist. But it seemed to me that if I gave enough 
care, patience, modesty, and attention to the task, it would be possible to gain 
sufficient familiarity with the ancient Greek and Roman texts; that is, a familiarity 
that would allow me—in keeping with a practice that is doubtless fundamental to 
Western philosophy—to examine both the difference that keeps us at a remove from 
a way of thinking in which we recognize the origin of our own, and the proximity 
that remains in spite of that distance which we never cease to explore.
