“sexuality,” it was essential first to determine how, for centu¬ 
ries, Western man had been brought to recognize himself as 
a subject of desire. 

A theoretical shift had seemed necessary in order to analyze 
what was often designated as the advancement of learning; it 
led me to examine the forms of discursive practices that ar¬ 
ticulated the human sciences. A theoretical shift had also been 
required in order to analyze what is often described as the 
manifestations of “power”; it led me to examine, rather, the 
manifold relations, the open strategies, and the rational tech¬ 
niques that articulate the exercise of powers. It appeared that 
I now had to undertake a third shift, in order to analyze what 
is termed “the subject.” It seemed appropriate to look for the 
forms and modalities of the relation to self by which the 
individual constitutes and recognizes himself qua subject. 
After first studying the games of truth (jeuxde verite) in their 
interplay with one another, as exemplified by certain empirical 
sciences in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and then 
studying their interaction with power relations, as exemplified 
by punitive practices—I felt obliged to study the games of 
truth in the relationship of self with self and the forming of 
oneself as a subject, taking as my domain of reference and field 
of investigation what might be called “the history of desiring 
man.” 

But it was clear that to undertake this genealogy would 
carry me far from my original project. I had to choose: either 
stick to the plan I had set, supplementing it with a brief 
historical survey of the theme of desire, or reorganize the 
whole study around the slow formation, in antiquity, of a 
hermeneutics of the self. I opted for the latter, reasoning that, 
after all, what I have held to, what I have tried to maintain 
for many years, is the effort to isolate some of the elements 
that might be useful for a history of truth. Not a history that 
would be concerned with what might be true in the fields of 
learning, but an analysis of the “games of truth,” the games 
of truth and error through which being is historically con-
