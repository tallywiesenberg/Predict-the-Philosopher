would run the risk of adapting them, without fully realizing 
it, to alien forms of analysis or to modes of inquiry that would 
scarcely suit them. In dealing with this risk, I have benefited 
greatly from the works of Peter Brown and those of Pierre 
Hadot, and I have been helped more than once by the conver¬ 
sations we have had and the views they have expressed. In the 
effort to familiarize myself with the ancient texts, I also ran 
the contrary risk of losing the thread of the questions I wanted 
to raise; Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow at Berkeley 
enabled me, through their comments and their rigorous ques¬ 
tioning, to undertake a theoretical and methodological reformu¬ 
lation. Francois Wahl offered me invaluable advice. 

Paul Veyne has given me constant assistance throughout 
these years. He knows, what the true historian’s search for 
truth is about, but he also knows the labyrinth one enters 
when one sets out to trace the history of the games of truth 
and error. He is one of those individuals (rare nowadays) who 
are willing to face the hazard that the history of truth poses 
for all thought. His influence on what I have written here is 
pervasive. As for what motivated me, it is quite simple; I 
would hope that in the eyes of some people it might be suffi¬ 
cient in itself. It was curiosity—the only kind of curiosity, in 
any case, that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy: 
not the curiosity that seeks to assimilate what it is proper for 
one to know, but that which enables one to get free of oneself. 
After all, what would be the value of the passion for knowl¬ 
edge if it resulted only in a certain amount of knowledgeable¬ 
ness and not, in one way or another and to the extent possible, 
in the knower’s straying afield of himself? There are times in 
life when the question of knowing if one can think differently 
than one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is 
absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting 
at all. People will say, perhaps, that these games with oneself 
would better be left backstage; or, at best, that they might 
properly form part of those preliminary exercises that are 
forgotten once they have served their purpose. But, then, what
