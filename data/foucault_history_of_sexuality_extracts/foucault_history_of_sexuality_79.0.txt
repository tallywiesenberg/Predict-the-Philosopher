would run the risk of adapting them, without fully realizing 
it, to alien forms of analysis or to modes of inquiry that would 
scarcely suit them. In dealing with this risk, I have benefited 
greatly from the works of Peter Brown and those of Pierre 
Hadot, and I have been helped more than once by the conver¬ 
sations we have had and the views they have expressed. In the 
effort to familiarize myself with the ancient texts, I also ran 
the contrary risk of losing the thread of the questions I wanted 
to raise; Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow at Berkeley 
enabled me, through their comments and their rigorous ques¬ 
tioning, to undertake a theoretical and methodological reformu¬ 
lation. Francois Wahl offered me invaluable advice. 

Paul Veyne has given me constant assistance throughout 
these years. He knows, what the true historian’s search for 
truth is about, but he also knows the labyrinth one enters 
when one sets out to trace the history of the games of truth 
and error. He is one of those individuals (rare nowadays) who 
are willing to face the hazard that the history of truth poses 
for all thought. His influence on what I have written here is 
pervasive. As for what motivated me, it is quite simple; I 
would hope that in the eyes of some people it might be suffi¬ 
cient in itself. It was curiosity—the only kind of curiosity, in 
any case, that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy: 
not the curiosity that seeks to assimilate what it is proper for 
one to know, but that which enables one to get free of oneself. 
After all, what would be the value of the passion for knowl¬ 
edge if it resulted only in a certain amount of knowledgeable¬ 
ness and not, in one way or another and to the extent possible, 
in the knower’s straying afield of himself? There are times in 
life when the question of knowing if one can think differently 
than one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is 
absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting 
at all. People will say, perhaps, that these games with oneself 
would better be left backstage; or, at best, that they might 
properly form part of those preliminary exercises that are 
forgotten once they have served their purpose. But, then, what

is philosophy today—philosophical activity, I mean—if it is 
not the critical work that thought brings to bear on itself? In 
what does it consist, if not in the endeavor to know how and 
to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead 
of legitimating what is already known? There is always some¬ 
thing ludicrous in philosophical discourse when it tries, from 
the outside, to dictate to others, to tell them where their truth 
is and how to find it, or when it works up a case against them 
in the language of naive positivity. But it is entitled to explore 
what might be changed, in its own thought, through the prac¬ 
tice of a knowledge that is foreign to it. The “essay”—which 
should be understood as the assay or test by which, in the 
game of truth, one undergoes changes, and not as the simplis¬ 
tic appropriation of others for the purpose of communication 
—is the living substance of philosophy, at least if we assume 
that philosophy is still what it was in times past, i.e., an 
“ascesis,” askesis, an exercise of oneself in the activity of 
thought. 

The studies that follow, like the others I have done previ¬ 
ously, are studies of “history” by reason of the domain they 
deal with and the references they appeal to; but they are not 
the work of a “historian.” Which does not mean that they 
summarize or synthesize work done by others. Considered 
from the standpoint of their “pragmatics,” they are the record 
of a long and tentative exercise that needed to be revised and 
corrected again and again. It was a philosophical exercise. The 
object was to learn to what extent the effort to think one’s own 
history can free thought from what it silently thinks, and so 
enable it to think differently. 

Was I right to take these risks? That is for others to say. I 
only know that by shifting, as I did, the theme and chronologi¬ 
cal frame of reference of my study, I obtained a certain theo¬ 
retical benefit; I could go on to make two generalizations that 
enabled me both to widen its scope and to specify its method 
and its goal more precisely. 

It seemed that by starting from the modern era, and pro-
