is philosophy today—philosophical activity, I mean—if it is 
not the critical work that thought brings to bear on itself? In 
what does it consist, if not in the endeavor to know how and 
to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead 
of legitimating what is already known? There is always some¬ 
thing ludicrous in philosophical discourse when it tries, from 
the outside, to dictate to others, to tell them where their truth 
is and how to find it, or when it works up a case against them 
in the language of naive positivity. But it is entitled to explore 
what might be changed, in its own thought, through the prac¬ 
tice of a knowledge that is foreign to it. The “essay”—which 
should be understood as the assay or test by which, in the 
game of truth, one undergoes changes, and not as the simplis¬ 
tic appropriation of others for the purpose of communication 
—is the living substance of philosophy, at least if we assume 
that philosophy is still what it was in times past, i.e., an 
“ascesis,” askesis, an exercise of oneself in the activity of 
thought. 

The studies that follow, like the others I have done previ¬ 
ously, are studies of “history” by reason of the domain they 
deal with and the references they appeal to; but they are not 
the work of a “historian.” Which does not mean that they 
summarize or synthesize work done by others. Considered 
from the standpoint of their “pragmatics,” they are the record 
of a long and tentative exercise that needed to be revised and 
corrected again and again. It was a philosophical exercise. The 
object was to learn to what extent the effort to think one’s own 
history can free thought from what it silently thinks, and so 
enable it to think differently. 

Was I right to take these risks? That is for others to say. I 
only know that by shifting, as I did, the theme and chronologi¬ 
cal frame of reference of my study, I obtained a certain theo¬ 
retical benefit; I could go on to make two generalizations that 
enabled me both to widen its scope and to specify its method 
and its goal more precisely. 

It seemed that by starting from the modern era, and pro-
