putting sex into discourse. This notion will be developed in the next volume, The

The History of Sexuality 


tional libertine; but he conceived the idea of complementing 
his life—which he had almost totally dedicated to sexual 
activity—with a scrupulous account of every one of its epi¬ 
sodes. He sometimes excuses himself by stressing his concern 
to educate young people, this man who had eleven volumes 
published, in a printing of only a few copies, which were 
devoted to the least adventures, pleasures, and sensations of 
his sex. It is best to take him at his word when he lets into 
his text the voice of a pure imperative: “I recount the facts, 
just as they happened, insofar as I am able to recollect them; 
this is all that I can do”; “a secret life must not leave out 
anything; there is nothing to be ashamed of.. . one can never 
know too much concerning human nature.” 7 The solitary 
author of My Secret Life often says, in order to justify his 
describing them, that his strangest practices undoubtedly 
were shared by thousands of men on the surface of the earth. 
But the guiding principle for the strangest of these practices, 
which was the fact of recounting them all, and in detail, from 
day to day, had been lodged in the heart of modern man for 
over two centuries. Rather than seeing in this singular man 
a courageous fugitive from a “Victorianism” that would have 
compelled him to silence, I am inclined to think that, in an 
epoch dominated by (highly prolix) directives enjoining dis¬ 
cretion and modesty, he was the most direct and in a way the 
most naive representative of a plurisecular injunction to talk 
about sex. The historical accident would consist rather of the 
reticences of “Victorian puritanism”; at any rate, they were 
a digression, a refinement, a tactical diversion in the great 
process of transforming sex into discourse. 

This nameless Englishman will serve better than his queen 
as the central figure for a sexuality whose main features were 
already taking shape with the Christian pastoral. Doubtless, 
in contrast to the latter, for him it was a matter of augment¬ 
ing the sensations he experienced with the details of what he

The Repressive Hypothesis

said about them; like Sade, he wrote “for his pleasure alone,” 
in the strongest sense of the expression; he carefully mixed 
the editing and rereading of his text with erotic scenes which 
those writer’s activities repeated, prolonged, and stimulated. 
But after all, the Christian pastoral also sought to produce 
specific effects on desire, by the mere fact of transforming it 
—fully and deliberately—into discourse: effects of mastery 
and detachment, to be sure, but also an effect of spiritual 
reconversion, of turning back to God, a physical effect of 
blissful suffering from feeling in one’s body the pangs of 
temptation and the love that resists it. This is the essential 
thing: that Western man has been drawn for three centuries 
to the task of telling everything concerning his sex; that since 
the classical age there has been a constant optimization and 
an increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that 
this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multi¬ 
ple effects of displacement, intensification, reorientation, and 
modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of 
what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled 
to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected 
to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a 
deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by 
referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex? 
There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an 
ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of func¬ 
tioning and taking effect in its very economy. 

This technique might have remained tied to the destiny of 
Christian spirituality if it had not been supported and relayed 
by other mechanisms. In the first place, by a “public inter¬ 
est.” Not a collective curiosity or sensibility; not a new men¬ 
tality; but power mechanisms that functioned in such a way 
that discourse on sex—for reasons that will have to be exam¬ 
ined—became essential. Toward the beginning of the eigh¬ 
teenth century, there emerged a political, economic, and 
technical incitement to talk about sex. And not so much in
