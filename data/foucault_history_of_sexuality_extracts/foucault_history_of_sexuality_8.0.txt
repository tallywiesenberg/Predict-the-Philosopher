The History of Sexuality 


tional libertine; but he conceived the idea of complementing 
his life—which he had almost totally dedicated to sexual 
activity—with a scrupulous account of every one of its epi¬ 
sodes. He sometimes excuses himself by stressing his concern 
to educate young people, this man who had eleven volumes 
published, in a printing of only a few copies, which were 
devoted to the least adventures, pleasures, and sensations of 
his sex. It is best to take him at his word when he lets into 
his text the voice of a pure imperative: “I recount the facts, 
just as they happened, insofar as I am able to recollect them; 
this is all that I can do”; “a secret life must not leave out 
anything; there is nothing to be ashamed of.. . one can never 
know too much concerning human nature.” 7 The solitary 
author of My Secret Life often says, in order to justify his 
describing them, that his strangest practices undoubtedly 
were shared by thousands of men on the surface of the earth. 
But the guiding principle for the strangest of these practices, 
which was the fact of recounting them all, and in detail, from 
day to day, had been lodged in the heart of modern man for 
over two centuries. Rather than seeing in this singular man 
a courageous fugitive from a “Victorianism” that would have 
compelled him to silence, I am inclined to think that, in an 
epoch dominated by (highly prolix) directives enjoining dis¬ 
cretion and modesty, he was the most direct and in a way the 
most naive representative of a plurisecular injunction to talk 
about sex. The historical accident would consist rather of the 
reticences of “Victorian puritanism”; at any rate, they were 
a digression, a refinement, a tactical diversion in the great 
process of transforming sex into discourse. 

This nameless Englishman will serve better than his queen 
as the central figure for a sexuality whose main features were
