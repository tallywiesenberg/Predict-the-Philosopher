Consider the two fol¬ 
lowing examples.Criticism of the eighteenth-century mo¬ 
narchic institution in France was not directed against the 
juridico-monarchic sphere as such, but was made on behalf 
of a pure and rigorous juridical system to which all the 
mechanisms of power could conform, with no excesses or 
irregularities, as opposed to a monarchy which, notwith¬ 
standing its own assertions, continuously overstepped the 
legal framework and set itself above the laws.Political criti¬ 
cism availed itself, therefore, of all the juridical thinking that 
had accompanied the development of the monarchy, in order 
to condemn the latter; but it did not challenge the principle 
which held that law had to be the very form of power, and 
that power always had to be exercised in the form of law.Another type of criticism of political institutions appeared in 
the nineteenth century, a much more radical criticism in that 
it was concerned to show not only that real power escaped 
the rules of jurisprudence, but that the legal system itself was 
merely a way of exerting violence, of appropriating that 
violence for the benefit of the few, and of exploiting the 
dissymmetries and injustices of domination under cover of 
general law.But this critique of law is still carried out on the 
assumption that, ideally and by nature, power must be exer¬ 
cised in accordance with a fundamental lawfulness.
