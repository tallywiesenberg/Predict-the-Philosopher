For while many of its 
forms have persisted to the present, it has gradually been 
penetrated by quite new mechanisms of power that are prob¬ 
ably irreducible to the representation of law.As we shall see, 
these power mechanisms are, at least in part, those that, 
beginning in the eighteenth century, took charge of men’s 
existence, men as living bodies.And if it is true that the 
juridical system was useful for representing, albeit in a 
nonexhaustive way, a power that was centered primarily 
around deduction (prelevement) and death, it is utterly in¬ 
congruous with the new methods of power whose operation 
is not ensured by right but by technique, not by law but by 
normalization, not by punishment but by control, methods 
that are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond 
the state and its apparatus.We have been engaged for centu¬ 
ries in a type of society in which the juridical is increasingly 
incapable of coding power, of serving as its system of repre¬ 
sentation.Our historical gradient carries us further and fur¬ 
ther away from a reign of law that had already begun to 
recede into the past at a time when the French Revolution 
and the accompanying age of constitutions and codes seemed 
to destine it for a future that was at hand.
