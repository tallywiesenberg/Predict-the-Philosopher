It is this 
image that we must break free of, that is, of the theoretical 
privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power 
within the concrete and historical framework of its opera¬ 
tion.We must construct an analytics of power that no longer 
takes law as a model and a code.This history of sexuality, or rather this series of studies 
concerning the historical relationships of power and the dis¬ 
course on sex, is, I realize, a circular project in the sense that 
it involves two endeavors that refer back to one another.We 
shall try to rid ourselves of a juridical and negative represen¬ 
tation of power, and cease to conceive of it in terms of law, 
prohibition, liberty, and sovereignty.But how then do we 
analyze what has occurred in recent history with regard to 
this thing—seemingly one of the most forbidden areas of our 
lives and bodies—that is sex?
