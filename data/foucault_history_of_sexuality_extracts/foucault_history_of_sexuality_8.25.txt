How, if not by way of prohibi¬ 
tion and blockage, does power gain access to it?Through 
which mechanisms, or tactics, or devices?But let us assume 
in turn that a somewhat careful scrutiny will show that 
power in modern societies has not in fact governed sexuality 
through law and sovereignty; let us suppose that historical 
analysis has revealed the presence of a veritable “technol¬ 
ogy” of sex, one that is much more complex and above all 
much more positive than the mere effect of a “defense” could 
be; this being the case, does this example—which can only 
be considered a privileged one, since power seemed in this 
instance, more than anywhere else, to function as prohibition 
—not compel one to discover principles for analyzing power 
which do not derive from the system of right and the form 
of law?Hence it is a question of forming a different grid of 
historical decipherment by starting from a different theory of

examination of an entire historical material.We must at the
