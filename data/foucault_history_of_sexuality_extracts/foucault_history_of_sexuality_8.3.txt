Hence the objective is to analyze a certain form of knowl¬ 
edge regarding sex, not in terms of repression or law, but in 
terms of power.But the word power is apt to lead to a 
number of misunderstandings—misunderstandings with re¬ 
spect to its nature, its form, and its unity.By power, I do not 
mean “Power” as a group of institutions and mechanisms 
that ensure the subservience of the citizens of a given state.By power, I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation 
which, in contrast to violence, has the form of the rule.Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of domi¬ 
nation exerted by one group over another, a system whose 
effects, through successive derivations, pervade the entire 
social body.
