The analysis, made in terms of power, must not 
assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law, 
or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset; 
rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes.It 
seems to me that power must be understood in the first 
instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the 
sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own 
organization; as the process which, through ceaseless strug¬ 
gles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses 
them; as the support which these force relations find in one 
another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the con¬ 
trary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them 
from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they

take effect, whose general design or institutional crystalliza¬ 
tion is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation 
of the law, in the various social hegemonies.Power’s condi¬ 
tion of possibility, or in any case the viewpoint which permits 
one to understand its exercise, even in its more “peripheral” 
effects, and which also makes it possible to use its mech¬ 
anisms as a grid of intelligibility of the social order, must not 
be sought in the primary existence of a central point, in a 
unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and de¬ 
scended forms would emanate; it is the moving substrate of 
force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly 
engender states of power, but the latter are always local and 
unstable.The omnipresence of power: not because it has the 
privilege of consolidating everything under its invincible 
unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the 
next, at every point, or rather in every relation from one 
point to another.Power is everywhere; not because it em¬ 
braces everything, but because it comes from everywhere.
