And “Power,” insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert, 
and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that 
emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that 
rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their move¬ 
ment.One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not 
an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain 
strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attrib¬ 
utes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.Should we turn the expression around, then, and say that 
politics is war pursued by other means?If we still wish to 
maintain a separation between war and politics, perhaps we 
should postulate rather that this multiplicity of force rela¬ 
tions can be coded—in part but never totally—either in the 
form of “war,” or in the form of “politics”; this would imply 
two different strategies (but the one always liable to switch 
into the other) for integrating these unbalanced, heterogene¬ 
ous, unstable, and tense force relations.94

Continuing this line of discussion, we can advance a cer¬ 
tain number of propositions: 

—Power is not something that is acquired, seized, or shared, 
something that one holds on to or allows to slip away; 
power is exercised from innumerable points, in the inter¬ 
play of nonegalitarian and mobile relations.
