—Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority with 
respect to other types of relationships (economic proc¬ 
esses, knowledge relationships, sexual relations), but are 
immanent in the latter; they are the immediate effects of 
the divisions, inequalities, and disequilibriums which 
occur in the latter, and conversely they are the internal 
conditions of these differentiations; relations of power are 
not in superstructural positions, with merely a role of 
prohibition or accompaniment; they have a directly pro¬ 
ductive role, wherever they come into play.—Power comes from below; that is, there is no binary and 
all-encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at 
the root of power relations, and serving as a general matrix 
—no such duality extending from the top down and react¬ 
ing on more and more limited groups to the very depths 
of the social body.One must suppose rather that the mani¬ 
fold relationships of force that take shape and come into 
play in the machinery of production, in families, limited 
groups, and institutions, are the basis for wide-ranging 
effects of cleavage that run through the social body as a 
whole.These then form a general line of force that trav¬ 
erses the local oppositions and links them together; to be 
sure, they also bring about redistributions, realignments, 
homogenizations, serial arrangements, and convergences 
of the force relations.Major dominations are the hege¬ 
monic effects that are sustained by all these confronta¬ 
tions.
