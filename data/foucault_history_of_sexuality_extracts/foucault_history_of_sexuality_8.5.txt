in contrast to the latter, for him it was a matter of augment¬

said about them; like Sade, he wrote “for his pleasure alone,” 
in the strongest sense of the expression; he carefully mixed 
the editing and rereading of his text with erotic scenes which 
those writer’s activities repeated, prolonged, and stimulated. 
But after all, the Christian pastoral also sought to produce 
specific effects on desire, by the mere fact of transforming it 
—fully and deliberately—into discourse: effects of mastery 
and detachment, to be sure, but also an effect of spiritual 
reconversion, of turning back to God, a physical effect of 
blissful suffering from feeling in one’s body the pangs of 
temptation and the love that resists it. This is the essential 
thing: that Western man has been drawn for three centuries 
to the task of telling everything concerning his sex; that since 
the classical age there has been a constant optimization and 
an increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that 
this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multi¬ 
ple effects of displacement, intensification, reorientation, and 
modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of 
what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled 
to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected 
to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a 
deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by 
referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex? 
There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an 
ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of func¬ 
tioning and taking effect in its very economy. 

This technique might have remained tied to the destiny of 
Christian spirituality if it had not been supported and relayed 
by other mechanisms. In the first place, by a “public inter¬ 
est.” Not a collective curiosity or sensibility; not a new men¬ 
tality; but power mechanisms that functioned in such a way 
that discourse on sex—for reasons that will have to be exam¬ 
ined—became essential. Toward the beginning of the eigh¬ 
teenth century, there emerged a political, economic, and 
technical incitement to talk about sex. And not so much in
