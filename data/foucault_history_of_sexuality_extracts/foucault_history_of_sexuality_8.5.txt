effect of another instance that “explains” them, but rather 
because they are imbued, through and through, with cal¬ 
culation: there is no power that is exercised without a 
series of aims and objectives.But this does not mean that 
it results from the choice or decision of an individual 
subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides 
over its rationality; neither the caste which governs, nor 
the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those 
who make the most important economic decisions direct 
the entire network of power that functions in a society 
(and makes it function); the rationality of power is charac¬ 
terized by tactics that are often quite explicit at the re¬ 
stricted level where they are inscribed (the local cynicism 
of power), tactics which, becoming connected to one an¬ 
other, attracting and propagating one another, but finding 
their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by 
forming comprehensive systems: the logic is perfectly 
clear, the aims decipherable, and yet it is often the case 
that no one is there to have invented them, and few who 
can be said to have formulated them: an implicit charac¬ 
teristic of the great anonymous, almost unspoken strate¬ 
gies which coordinate the loquacious tactics whose “in¬ 
ventors” or decisionmakers are often without hypocrisy.—Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or 
rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position 
of exteriority in relation to power.Should it be said that 
one is always “inside” power, there is no “escaping” it, 
there is no absolute outside where it is concerned, because 
one is subject to the law in any case?
