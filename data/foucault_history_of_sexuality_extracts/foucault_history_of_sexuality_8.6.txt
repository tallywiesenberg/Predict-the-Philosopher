Instead there 
is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case: 
resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others 
that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted, ram¬ 
pant, or violent; still others that are quick to compromise, 
interested, or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist 
in the strategic field of power relations.But this does not 
mean that they are only a reaction or rebound, forming 
with respect to the basic domination an underside that is 
in the end always passive, doomed to perpetual defeat.Resistances do not derive from a few heterogeneous prin¬ 
ciples; but neither are they a lure or a promise that is of 
necessity betrayed.They are the odd term in relations of 
power; they are inscribed in the latter as an irreducible 
opposite.Hence they too are distributed in irregular fash¬ 
ion: the points, knots, or focuses of resistance are spread 
over time and space at varying densities, at times mobiliz¬ 
ing groups or individuals in a definitive way, inflaming 
certain points of the body, certain moments in life, certain 
types of behavior.
