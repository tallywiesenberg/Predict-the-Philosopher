Are there no great radical ruptures, 
massive binary divisions, then?Occasionally, yes.But 
more often one is dealing with mobile and transitory 
points of resistance, producing cleavages in a society that 
shift about, fracturing unities and effecting regroupings, 
furrowing across individuals themselves, cutting them up 
and remolding them, marking off irreducible regions in 
them, in their bodies and minds.Just as the network of 
power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes 
through apparatuses and institutions, without being exÂ¬ 
actly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of 
resistance traverses social stratifications and individual 
unities.And it is doubtless the strategic codification of 
these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible, 
somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on 
the institutional integration of power relationships.
