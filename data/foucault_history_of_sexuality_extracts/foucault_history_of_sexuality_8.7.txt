The Deployment of Sexuality

It is in this sphere of force relations that we must try to 
analyze the mechanisms of power.In this way we will escape 
from the system of Law-and-Sovereign which has captivated 
political thought for such a long time.And if it is true that 
Machiavelli was among the few—and this no doubt was the 
scandal of his “cynicism”—who conceived the power of the 
Prince in terms of force relationships, perhaps we need to go 
one step further, do without the persona of the Prince, and 
decipher power mechanisms on the basis of a strategy that 
is immanent in force relationships.To return to sex and the discourses of truth that have 
taken charge of it, the question that we must address, then, 
is not: Given a specific state structure, how and why is it that 
power needs to establish a knowledge of sex?Neither is the 
question: What over-all domination was served by the con¬ 
cern, evidenced since the eighteenth century, to produce true 
discourses on sex?
