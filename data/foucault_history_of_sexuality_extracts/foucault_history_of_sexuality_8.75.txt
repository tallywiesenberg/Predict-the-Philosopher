Nor is it: What law presided over both the 
regularity of sexual behavior and the conformity of what was 
said about it?It is rather: In a specific type'of discourse on 
sex, in a specific form of extortion of truth, appearing histori¬ 
cally and in specific places (around the child’s body, apropos 
of women’s sex, in connection with practices restricting 
births, and so on), what were the most immediate, the most 
local power relations at work?How did they make possible 
these kinds of discourses, and conversely, how were these 
discourses used to support power relations?How was the 
action of these power relations modified by their very exer¬ 
cise, entailing a strengthening of some terms and a weaken¬ 
ing of others, with effects of resistance and counterinvest¬ 
ments, so that there has never existed one type of stable 
subjugation, given once and for all?How were these power 
relations linked to one another according to the logic of a 
great strategy, which in retrospect takes on the aspect of a 
unitary and voluntarist politics of sex?
