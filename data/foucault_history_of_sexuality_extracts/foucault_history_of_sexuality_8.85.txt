If sexuality was con¬ 
stituted as an area of investigation, this was only because 
relations of power had established it as a possible object; and 
conversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was 
because techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis¬ 
course were capable of investing it.Between techniques of 
knowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, 
even if they have specific roles and are linked together on the 
basis of their difference.We will start, therefore, from what 
might be called “local centers” of power-knowledge: for ex¬ 
ample, the relations that obtain between penitents and 
confessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience.Here, guided by the theme of the “flesh” that must be mas¬ 
tered, different forms of discourse—self-examination, ques¬ 
tionings, admissions, interpretations, interviews—were the 
vehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of 
forms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge.Similarly, 
the body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his 
cradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of 
parents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten¬ 
tive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted, 
particularly since the eighteenth century, another “local cen¬ 
ter” of power-knowledge.
