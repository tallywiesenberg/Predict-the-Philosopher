The Deployment of Sexuality

2.Rules of continual variations 

We must not look for who has the power in the order of 
sexuality (men, adults, parents, doctors) and who is deprived 
of it (women, adolescents, children, patients); nor for who 
has the right to know and who is forced to remain ignorant.We must seek rather the pattern of the modifications which 
the relationships of force imply by the very nature of their 
process.The “distributions of power” and the “appropria¬ 
tions of knowledge” never represent only instantaneous 
slices taken from processes involving, for example, a cumula¬ 
tive reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal of 
relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase of two terms.Relations of power-knowledge are not static forms of distri¬ 
bution, they are “matrices of transformations.” The nine¬ 
teenth-century grouping made up of the father, the mother, 
the educator, and the doctor, around the child and his sex, 
was subjected to constant modifications, continual shifts.
