One of the more spectacular results of the latter was a strange 
reversal: whereas to begin with the child’s sexuality had been 
problematized within the relationship established between 
doctor and parents (in the form of advice, or recommenda¬ 
tions to keep the child under observation, or warnings of 
future dangers), ultimately it was in the relationship of the 
psychiatrist to the child that the sexuality of adults them¬ 
selves was called into question.3.Rule of double conditioning 

No “local center,” no “pattern of transformation” could 
function if, through a series of sequences, it did not eventu¬ 
ally enter into an over-all strategy.And inversely, no strategy 
could achieve comprehensive effects if did not gain support 
from precise and tenuous relations serving, not as its point 
of application or final outcome, but as its prop and anchor 
point.There is no discontinuity between them, as if one were 
dealing with two different levels (one microscopic and the

other macroscopic); but neither is there homogeneity (as if 
the one were only the enlarged projection or the miniaturiza¬ 
tion of the other); rather, one must conceive of the double 
conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tac¬ 
tics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them 
work.
