ceeding back through Christianity to antiquity, one would not 
be able to avoid raising a question that was at the same time 
very simple and very general: why is sexual conduct, why are 
the activities and pleasures that attach to it, an object of moral 
solicitude? Why this ethical concern—which, at certain times, 
in certain societies and groups, appears more important than 
the moral attention that is focused on other, likewise essential, 
areas of individual or collective life, such as alimentary behav¬ 
iors or the fulfillment of civic duties? A reply comes to mind 
immediately, I know: they have been the object of fundamen¬ 
tal interdictions, and transgressing the latter is considered a 
serious offense. But this is to make an answer of the question 
itself; and further, it shows a failure to recognize that the 
ethical concern over sexual conduct is not, in its intensity or 
its forms, always directly tied to the system of interdictions. 
It is often the case that the moral solicitude is strong precisely 
where there is neither obligation nor prohibition. In other 
words, the interdiction is one thing, the moral problematiza- 
tion is another. It seemed to me, therefore, that the question 
that ought to guide my inquiry was the following: how, why, 
and in what forms was sexuality constituted as a moral do¬ 
main? Why this ethical concern that was so persistent despite 
its varying forms and intensity? Why this “problematization”? 
But, after all, this was the proper task of a history of thought, 
as against a history of behaviors or representations: to define 
the conditions in which human beings “problematize” what 
they are, what they do, and the world in which they live. 

But in raising this very general question, and in directing it 
to Greek and Greco-Roman culture, it occurred to me that 
this problematization was linked to a group of practices that 
have been of unquestionable importance in our societies: I am 
referring to what might be called the “arts of existence.” What 
I mean by the phrase are those intentional and voluntary 
actions by which men not only set themselves rules of conduct, 
but also seek to transform themselves, to change themselves 
in their singular being, and to make their life into an oeuvre

that carries certain aesthetic values and meets certain stylistic 
criteria. These “arts of existence,” these “techniques of the 
self,” no doubt lost some of their importance and autonomy 
when they were assimilated into the exercise of priestly power 
in early Christianity, and later, into educative, medical, and 
psychological types of practices. Still, I thought that the long 
history of these aesthetics of existence and these technologies 
of the self remained to be done, or resumed. It has been a long 
time now since Burckhardt pointed out their significance for 
the epoch of the Renaissance, but their perpetuation, their 
history, and their development do not end there.* In any case, 
it seemed to me that the study of the problematization of 
sexual behavior in antiquity could be regarded as a chapter— 
one of the first chapters—of that general history of the “tech¬ 
niques of the self.” 

There is irony in those efforts one makes to alter one’s way 
of looking at things, to change the boundaries of what one 
knows and to venture out a ways from there. Did mine actu¬ 
ally result in a different way of thinking? Perhaps at most they 
made it possible to go back through what I was already think¬ 
ing, to think it differently, and to see what I had done from 
a new vantage point and in a clearer light. Sure of having 
traveled far, one finds that one is looking down on oneself 
from above. The journey rejuvenates things, and ages the 
relationship with oneself. I seem to have gained a better per¬ 
spective on the way I worked—gropingly, and by means of 
different or successive fragments—on this project, whose goal 
is a history of truth. It was a matter of analyzing, not behav¬ 
iors or ideas, nor societies and their “ideologies,” but the 
problematizations through which being offers itself to be, nec¬ 
essarily, thought—and the practices on the basis of which 
these problematizations are formed. The archaeological di- 

*It is not quite correct to imply that since Burckhardt the study of these arts and this 
aesthetics of existence has been completely neglected. One thinks of Benjamin’s study 
on Baudelaire. There is also an interesting analysis in Stephen Greenblatt’s recent 
book, Renaissance Self-Fashioning (1980).

mension of the analysis made it possible to examine the forms 
themselves; its genealogical dimension enabled me to analyze 
their formation out of the practices and the modifications 
undergone by the latter. There was the problematization of 
madness and illness arising out of social and medical practices, 
and defining a certain pattern of “normalization”; a prob¬ 
lematization of life, language, and labor in discursive practices
