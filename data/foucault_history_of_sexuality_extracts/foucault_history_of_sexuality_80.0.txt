ceeding back through Christianity to antiquity, one would not 
be able to avoid raising a question that was at the same time 
very simple and very general: why is sexual conduct, why are 
the activities and pleasures that attach to it, an object of moral 
solicitude? Why this ethical concern—which, at certain times, 
in certain societies and groups, appears more important than 
the moral attention that is focused on other, likewise essential, 
areas of individual or collective life, such as alimentary behav¬ 
iors or the fulfillment of civic duties? A reply comes to mind 
immediately, I know: they have been the object of fundamen¬ 
tal interdictions, and transgressing the latter is considered a 
serious offense. But this is to make an answer of the question 
itself; and further, it shows a failure to recognize that the 
ethical concern over sexual conduct is not, in its intensity or 
its forms, always directly tied to the system of interdictions. 
It is often the case that the moral solicitude is strong precisely 
where there is neither obligation nor prohibition. In other 
words, the interdiction is one thing, the moral problematiza- 
tion is another. It seemed to me, therefore, that the question 
that ought to guide my inquiry was the following: how, why, 
and in what forms was sexuality constituted as a moral do¬ 
main? Why this ethical concern that was so persistent despite 
its varying forms and intensity? Why this “problematization”? 
But, after all, this was the proper task of a history of thought, 
as against a history of behaviors or representations: to define 
the conditions in which human beings “problematize” what 
they are, what they do, and the world in which they live. 

But in raising this very general question, and in directing it 
to Greek and Greco-Roman culture, it occurred to me that 
this problematization was linked to a group of practices that 
have been of unquestionable importance in our societies: I am 
referring to what might be called the “arts of existence.” What 
I mean by the phrase are those intentional and voluntary 
actions by which men not only set themselves rules of conduct, 
but also seek to transform themselves, to change themselves 
in their singular being, and to make their life into an oeuvre

that carries certain aesthetic values and meets certain stylistic 
criteria. These “arts of existence,” these “techniques of the 
self,” no doubt lost some of their importance and autonomy 
when they were assimilated into the exercise of priestly power
