in early Christianity, and later, into educative, medical, and 
psychological types of practices. Still, I thought that the long 
history of these aesthetics of existence and these technologies 
of the self remained to be done, or resumed. It has been a long 
time now since Burckhardt pointed out their significance for 
the epoch of the Renaissance, but their perpetuation, their 
history, and their development do not end there.* In any case, 
it seemed to me that the study of the problematization of 
sexual behavior in antiquity could be regarded as a chapter— 
one of the first chapters—of that general history of the “tech¬ 
niques of the self.” 

There is irony in those efforts one makes to alter one’s way 
of looking at things, to change the boundaries of what one 
knows and to venture out a ways from there. Did mine actu¬ 
ally result in a different way of thinking? Perhaps at most they 
made it possible to go back through what I was already think¬ 
ing, to think it differently, and to see what I had done from 
a new vantage point and in a clearer light. Sure of having 
traveled far, one finds that one is looking down on oneself 
from above. The journey rejuvenates things, and ages the 
relationship with oneself. I seem to have gained a better per¬ 
spective on the way I worked—gropingly, and by means of 
different or successive fragments—on this project, whose goal 
is a history of truth. It was a matter of analyzing, not behav¬ 
iors or ideas, nor societies and their “ideologies,” but the 
problematizations through which being offers itself to be, nec¬ 
essarily, thought—and the practices on the basis of which 
these problematizations are formed. The archaeological di- 

*It is not quite correct to imply that since Burckhardt the study of these arts and this 
aesthetics of existence has been completely neglected. One thinks of Benjamin’s study 
on Baudelaire. There is also an interesting analysis in Stephen Greenblatt’s recent 
book, Renaissance Self-Fashioning (1980).

mension of the analysis made it possible to examine the forms 
themselves; its genealogical dimension enabled me to analyze 
their formation out of the practices and the modifications 
undergone by the latter. There was the problematization of 
madness and illness arising out of social and medical practices, 
and defining a certain pattern of “normalization”; a prob¬ 
lematization of life, language, and labor in discursive practices
