that conformed to certain “epistemic” rules; and a problemati¬ 
zation of crime and criminal behavior emerging from certain 
punitive practices conforming to a “disciplinary” model. And 
now I would like to show how, in classical antiquity, sexual 
activity and sexual pleasures were problematized through 
practices of the self, bringing into play the criteria of an “aes¬ 
thetics of existence.” 

These, then, are the reasons that led me to recenter my 
entire study on the genealogy of desiring man, from classical 
antiquity through the first centuries of Christianity. I have 
followed a simple chronological arrangement: this volume, 
The Use of Pleasure, is devoted to the manner in which sexual 
activity was problematized by philosophers and doctors in 
classical Greek culture of the fourth century B.C.; Care of the 
Self deals with the same problematization in the Greek and 
Latin texts of the first two centuries of our era; lastly, The 
Confessions of the Flesh deals with the formation of the doc¬ 
trine and ministry concerning the flesh. The documents I will 
refer to are for the most part “prescriptive” texts—that is, 
texts whose main object, whatever their form (speech, dia¬ 
logue, treatise, collection of precepts, etc.) is to suggest rules 
of conduct. I will appeal to the theoretical texts on the doc¬ 
trine of pleasures and passions only to look for clarifications. 
The domain I will be analyzing is made up of texts written for 
the purpose of offering rules, opinions, and advice on how to 
behave as one should: “practical” texts, which are themselves 
objects of a “practice” in that they were designed to be read, 
learned, reflected upon, and tested out, and they were in¬ 
tended to constitute the eventual framework of everyday con-

duct. These texts thus served as functional devices that would 
enable individuals to question their own conduct, to watch 
over and give shape to it, and to shape themselves as ethical 
subjects; in short, their function was “etho-poetic,” to trans¬ 
pose a word found in Plutarch. 

But since this analysis of desiring man is situated at the 
point where an archaelogy of problematizations and a 
genealogy of practices of the self intersect, I would like to 
dwell briefly, before getting started, on those two notions— 
that is, to account for the forms of “problematization” that I 
chose to examine, to indicate what is to be understood by 
“practices of the self,” and to explain how I was led, through 
certain paradoxes and difficulties, to substitute a history of 
ethical problematizations based on practices of the self, for a 
history of systems of morality based, hypothetically, on inter¬ 
dictions.

Forms of 
Problematization 


Suppose for a moment that we accept categories as general 
as those of “paganism,” “Christianity,” “morality,” and “sex¬ 
ual morality.” Suppose that we ask on which points the “sex¬ 
ual morality of Christianity” contrasted most sharply with the 
“sexual morality of ancient paganism.” Prohibition of incest, 
male domination, subjugation of women? These are not the 
replies that will be given, no doubt; the extent and constancy 
of those phenomena in their various forms are well known. 
Other points of differentiation will more likely be submitted. 
For example, the meaning of the sexual act itself: it will be said 
that Christianity associated it with evil, sin, the Fall, and 
death, whereas antiquity invested it with positive symbolic 
values. Or the definition of the legitimate partner: it would 
appear that, in contrast to what occurred in the Greek and 
Roman societies, Christianity drew the line at monogamous 
marriage and laid down the principle of exclusively procrea¬ 
tive ends within that conjugal relationship. Or the disallow¬ 
ance of relations between individuals of the same sex: it would 
seem that Christianity strictly excluded such relationships, 
while Greece exalted them and Rome accepted them, at least 
between men. To these three points of major opposition might 
be added the high moral and spiritual value that Christianity, 
unlike pagan morality, accorded to strict abstinence, lifelong 
chastity, and virginity. In short, regarding all these points that 
have been considered for such a long time to be so important
