chose to examine, to indicate what is to be understood by 
“practices of the self,” and to explain how I was led, through 
certain paradoxes and difficulties, to substitute a history of 
ethical problematizations based on practices of the self, for a 
history of systems of morality based, hypothetically, on inter¬ 
dictions.

Forms of 
Problematization 


Suppose for a moment that we accept categories as general 
as those of “paganism,” “Christianity,” “morality,” and “sex¬ 
ual morality.” Suppose that we ask on which points the “sex¬ 
ual morality of Christianity” contrasted most sharply with the 
“sexual morality of ancient paganism.” Prohibition of incest, 
male domination, subjugation of women? These are not the 
replies that will be given, no doubt; the extent and constancy 
of those phenomena in their various forms are well known. 
Other points of differentiation will more likely be submitted. 
For example, the meaning of the sexual act itself: it will be said 
that Christianity associated it with evil, sin, the Fall, and 
death, whereas antiquity invested it with positive symbolic 
values. Or the definition of the legitimate partner: it would 
appear that, in contrast to what occurred in the Greek and 
Roman societies, Christianity drew the line at monogamous 
marriage and laid down the principle of exclusively procrea¬ 
tive ends within that conjugal relationship. Or the disallow¬ 
ance of relations between individuals of the same sex: it would 
seem that Christianity strictly excluded such relationships, 
while Greece exalted them and Rome accepted them, at least 
between men. To these three points of major opposition might 
be added the high moral and spiritual value that Christianity, 
unlike pagan morality, accorded to strict abstinence, lifelong 
chastity, and virginity. In short, regarding all these points that 
have been considered for such a long time to be so important
