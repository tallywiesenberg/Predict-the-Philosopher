—the nature of the sexual act, monogamous fidelity, homosex¬ 
ual relations, chastity—it would seem that men of ancient 
times were rather indifferent, and that none of this claimed 
much of their attention or constituted very serious problems 
as far as they were concerned. 

But this picture is not accurate; moreover, it would be easy 
to show that it is not. One would only have to point out the 
direct borrowing and strict continuities between the first 
Christian doctrines and the moral philosophy of antiquity. 
The first great Christian text devoted to sexual practice in 
married life—Chapter X of Book II of The Pedagogue by 
Clement of Alexandria—is supported by a number of scrip¬ 
tural references, but it also draws on a set of principles and 
precepts borrowed directly from pagan philosophy. One al¬ 
ready notes a certain association of sexual activity with evil, 
along with the rule of procreative monogamy, a condemnation 
of relations between individuals of the same sex, and a glorifi¬ 
cation of self-restraint. Furthermore, given a longer historical 
frame to consider, one could trace the persistence of themes, 
anxieties, and exigencies that no doubt marked the Christian 
ethic and the morality of modern European societies; but not 
only, since they were already present at the core of Greek and 
Greco-Roman thought. Below is some evidence to consider, 
comprising: (1) the expression of a fear, (2) a model of con¬ 
duct, (3) the image of a stigmatized attitude, and (4) an exam¬ 
ple of abstinence. 

1. A fear. Young people afflicted with seminal weakness 
“of necessity become old in the habit of their body, dull, 
languid, dispirited, sluggish, stupidly silent, weak, wrinkled, 
incapable of any exertion, sallow, wan, effeminate; they lose 
their appetite, feel cold, a sense of weight in their limbs, and 
torpor in their legs, their strength fails, and they become 
paralyzed in every effort, and with many the disease goes on 
to palsy. For how could it be otherwise, that the power of the 
nerves should suffer when the generative principle is chilled?”
