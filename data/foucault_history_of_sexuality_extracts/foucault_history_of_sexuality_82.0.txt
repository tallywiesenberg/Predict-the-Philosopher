—the nature of the sexual act, monogamous fidelity, homosex¬ 
ual relations, chastity—it would seem that men of ancient 
times were rather indifferent, and that none of this claimed 
much of their attention or constituted very serious problems 
as far as they were concerned. 

But this picture is not accurate; moreover, it would be easy 
to show that it is not. One would only have to point out the 
direct borrowing and strict continuities between the first 
Christian doctrines and the moral philosophy of antiquity. 
The first great Christian text devoted to sexual practice in 
married life—Chapter X of Book II of The Pedagogue by 
Clement of Alexandria—is supported by a number of scrip¬ 
tural references, but it also draws on a set of principles and 
precepts borrowed directly from pagan philosophy. One al¬ 
ready notes a certain association of sexual activity with evil, 
along with the rule of procreative monogamy, a condemnation 
of relations between individuals of the same sex, and a glorifi¬ 
cation of self-restraint. Furthermore, given a longer historical 
frame to consider, one could trace the persistence of themes, 
anxieties, and exigencies that no doubt marked the Christian 
ethic and the morality of modern European societies; but not 
only, since they were already present at the core of Greek and 
Greco-Roman thought. Below is some evidence to consider, 
comprising: (1) the expression of a fear, (2) a model of con¬ 
duct, (3) the image of a stigmatized attitude, and (4) an exam¬ 
ple of abstinence. 

1. A fear. Young people afflicted with seminal weakness 
“of necessity become old in the habit of their body, dull, 
languid, dispirited, sluggish, stupidly silent, weak, wrinkled, 
incapable of any exertion, sallow, wan, effeminate; they lose 
their appetite, feel cold, a sense of weight in their limbs, and 
torpor in their legs, their strength fails, and they become 
paralyzed in every effort, and with many the disease goes on 
to palsy. For how could it be otherwise, that the power of the 
nerves should suffer when the generative principle is chilled?”

The Use of Pleasure 


This disease, which is “shameful in itself,” is “dangerous in 
that it leads to stagnation; harmful to society in that it goes 
against the propagation of the species; and because it is in all 
respects the source of countless ills, it requires prompt treat¬ 
ment.” 1 * One has no trouble recognizing in this text the obses¬ 
sive worries that medicine and pedagogy nurtured on the 
subject of pure sexual expenditure—that unproductive and 
partnerless activity—from the eighteenth century onward. 
The gradual exhaustion of the organism, the death of the 
individual, the destruction of his offspring, and finally, harm 
to the entire human race, were regularly promised, through an 
endlessly garrulous literature, to those who would make illicit 
use of their sex. These solicited fears seem to have been the 
“naturalistic” and scientific legacy, in medical thought of the 
nineteenth century, of a Christian tradition that consigned 
pleasure to the realm of death and evil. 

Now, this description is actually a translation—a free trans¬ 
lation, in the style of the period—of a text written by a Greek 
physician, Aretaeus, in the first century of our era. And one 
could find many other statements from the same epoch, testi¬ 
fying to this fear of the sexual act, which was liable, if it got 
out of control, to produce the most deleterious effects on the 
life of the individual. Soranus, for example, thought that sex¬ 
ual activity was in any case less favorable to health than 
virginity and plain abstinence. Even prior to that, medicine 
had earnestly recommended prudence and economy in the use 
of sexual pleasures: avoid their untimely enjoyment, take into 
account the conditions in which they are to be experienced, 
fear their peculiar violence and the effects of errors of regimen. 

*In his French translation, L. Renaud offers this comment on the passage from 
Aretaeus: “The gonorrhea in question differs essentially from the disease that goes 
by that name today, which is more correctly called blennorrhea. . . . Simple or true 
gonorrhea, of which Aretaeus is speaking here, is characterized by an involuntary 
discharge, outside coition, of the spermatic humor mixed with the prostatic humor. 
This shameful disease is often provoked by, and the result of, masturbation." 2 The 
French translation slightly alters the meaning of the Greek text, which can be found 
in the Corpus Medicorum Graecorum.

Some even advised to indulge only “if one wants to do harm 
to oneself.” A very ancient fear, therefore.
