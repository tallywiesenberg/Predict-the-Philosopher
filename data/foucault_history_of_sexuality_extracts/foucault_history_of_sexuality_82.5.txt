against the propagation of the species; and because it is in all 
respects the source of countless ills, it requires prompt treat¬ 
ment.” 1 * One has no trouble recognizing in this text the obses¬ 
sive worries that medicine and pedagogy nurtured on the 
subject of pure sexual expenditure—that unproductive and 
partnerless activity—from the eighteenth century onward. 
The gradual exhaustion of the organism, the death of the 
individual, the destruction of his offspring, and finally, harm 
to the entire human race, were regularly promised, through an 
endlessly garrulous literature, to those who would make illicit 
use of their sex. These solicited fears seem to have been the 
“naturalistic” and scientific legacy, in medical thought of the 
nineteenth century, of a Christian tradition that consigned 
pleasure to the realm of death and evil. 

Now, this description is actually a translation—a free trans¬ 
lation, in the style of the period—of a text written by a Greek 
physician, Aretaeus, in the first century of our era. And one 
could find many other statements from the same epoch, testi¬ 
fying to this fear of the sexual act, which was liable, if it got 
out of control, to produce the most deleterious effects on the 
life of the individual. Soranus, for example, thought that sex¬ 
ual activity was in any case less favorable to health than 
virginity and plain abstinence. Even prior to that, medicine 
had earnestly recommended prudence and economy in the use 
of sexual pleasures: avoid their untimely enjoyment, take into 
account the conditions in which they are to be experienced, 
fear their peculiar violence and the effects of errors of regimen. 

*In his French translation, L. Renaud offers this comment on the passage from 
Aretaeus: “The gonorrhea in question differs essentially from the disease that goes 
by that name today, which is more correctly called blennorrhea. . . . Simple or true 
gonorrhea, of which Aretaeus is speaking here, is characterized by an involuntary 
discharge, outside coition, of the spermatic humor mixed with the prostatic humor. 
This shameful disease is often provoked by, and the result of, masturbation." 2 The 
French translation slightly alters the meaning of the Greek text, which can be found 
in the Corpus Medicorum Graecorum.

to oneself.” A very ancient fear, therefore.
