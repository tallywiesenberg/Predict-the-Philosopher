Sales exhorted people to conjugal virtue. He held out a mirror 
to married couples, recommending the example of the ele¬ 
phant and the good morals it manifested with its mate. It was 
“only a large beast, but the most worthy of all the animals on 
earth, and the one with the most intelligence. ... It never 
changes females and it is tenderly loving with the one it has 
chosen, mating only every three years, and then only for five 
days, and so secretly that it is never seen in the act; but it can 
be seen again on the sixth day, when the first thing it does is 
go straight to the river and bathe its whole body, being unwill¬ 
ing to return to the herd before it is purified. Tell me if these 
are not good and honorable habits.” 3 Now this text is itself a 
variation on a theme that had been handed down by a long 
tradition (via Aldrovandi, Gesner, Vincent of Beauvais, and 
the famous Physiologus)\ one finds it already formulated in 
Pliny, whom Saint Francis of Sales follows rather closely in 
the Introduction to the Devout Life: “Owing to their modesty, 
elephants never mate except in secret... the female at the age 
of ten; and mating takes place for two years, on five days, so 
it is said, of each year and not more; and on the sixth day they 
give themselves a shower-bath in the river, not returning to the 
herd before. Adultery is unknown among them.” 4 Of course, 
Pliny was not proposing a schema as explicitly didactic as that 
of Saint Francis of Sales; he was, however, referring to a 
clearly recommended model of conduct. It is not the case that 
mutual faithfulness among marriage partners was a generally 
acknowledged and accepted imperative among the Greeks and 
Romans. But it was a lesson given emphasis in some philo¬ 
sophical currents such as late Stoicism; it was also a conduct 
that was valued as a manifestation of virtue, inner strength, 
and self-mastery. Thus, the younger Cato was praised because,

up to the age at which he decided to marry, he still had not 
had relations with any woman; or better yet, there was 
Laelius: “in the course of his long life, he knew but one 
woman, the wife of his youth.” 5 One can go back even further 
in the definition of this model of mutual conjugal fidelity. 
Nicocles, in the speech attributed to him by Isocrates, shows 
the moral and political importance he accorded to the achieve¬ 
ment of not “having approached any woman but my own 
wife” from the time of his marriage. 6 And in his ideal city, 
Aristotle would have sexual relations of a husband with an¬ 
other woman, or the wife with another man, considered “dis¬ 
honorable ... in any circumstances whatsoever.” 7 The sexual 
“fidelity” of a husband with respect to his legitimate wife was 
not required either by law or by custom; it was nevertheless 
a question that people raised and a form of austerity on which 
some moralists set a high value. 

3. An image. In nineteenth-century texts there is a 
stereotypical portrait of the homosexual or invert: not only his 
mannerisms, his bearing, the way he gets dolled up, his co¬ 
quetry, but also his facial expressions, his anatomy, the femi¬ 
nine morphology of his whole body, are regularly included in 
this disparaging description. The image alludes both to the 
theme of role reversal and to the principle of a natural stigma 
attached to this offense against nature. It was as if “nature 
herself had become an accessory to sexual mendacity.” 8 One 
could doubtless trace the long history of this image (to which 
actual behaviors may have corresponded, through a complex 
play of inductions and attitudes of defiance). In the deeply 
negative intensity of this stereotype, one might read the age- 
old difficulty, for our societies, of integrating these two 
phenomena—different phenomena at that—of the inversion of 
sexual roles and intercourse between individuals of the same 
sex. Now this image, with the repulsive aura that surrounds 
it, has come down through the centuries. It was already 
clearly delineated in the Greco-Roman literature of the impe-

rial age. One encounters it in the portrait of the Effeminatus 
drawn by the author of an anonymous treatise on physiog¬ 
nomy of the fourth century; in the description of the priests 
of Atargatis, whom Apuleius makes fun of in The Golden /Ixs; 
in the symbolization that Dio Chrysostom offers for the 
daimon of immoderation in one of his lectures on monarchy; 
in the fleeting evocation of the petty orators, with their per¬ 
fume and their curls, whom Epictetus calls on at the back of 
his class, asking them if they are men or women. 9 One could 
see it again in the portrait of decadent youth, such as Seneca 
the Elder notices around him, with great repugnance: “Libidi¬ 
nous delight in song and dance transfixes these effeminates. 
Braiding the hair, refining the voice till it is as caressing as a 
woman’s, competing in bodily softness with women, beautify¬ 
ing themselves with filthy fineries—this is the pattern our
