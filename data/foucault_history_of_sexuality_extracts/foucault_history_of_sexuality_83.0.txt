Sales exhorted people to conjugal virtue. He held out a mirror 
to married couples, recommending the example of the ele¬ 
phant and the good morals it manifested with its mate. It was 
“only a large beast, but the most worthy of all the animals on 
earth, and the one with the most intelligence. ... It never 
changes females and it is tenderly loving with the one it has 
chosen, mating only every three years, and then only for five 
days, and so secretly that it is never seen in the act; but it can 
be seen again on the sixth day, when the first thing it does is 
go straight to the river and bathe its whole body, being unwill¬ 
ing to return to the herd before it is purified. Tell me if these 
are not good and honorable habits.” 3 Now this text is itself a 
variation on a theme that had been handed down by a long 
tradition (via Aldrovandi, Gesner, Vincent of Beauvais, and 
the famous Physiologus)\ one finds it already formulated in 
Pliny, whom Saint Francis of Sales follows rather closely in 
the Introduction to the Devout Life: “Owing to their modesty, 
elephants never mate except in secret... the female at the age 
of ten; and mating takes place for two years, on five days, so 
it is said, of each year and not more; and on the sixth day they 
give themselves a shower-bath in the river, not returning to the 
herd before. Adultery is unknown among them.” 4 Of course, 
Pliny was not proposing a schema as explicitly didactic as that 
of Saint Francis of Sales; he was, however, referring to a 
clearly recommended model of conduct. It is not the case that 
mutual faithfulness among marriage partners was a generally 
acknowledged and accepted imperative among the Greeks and 
Romans. But it was a lesson given emphasis in some philo¬ 
sophical currents such as late Stoicism; it was also a conduct 
that was valued as a manifestation of virtue, inner strength, 
and self-mastery. Thus, the younger Cato was praised because,

The Use of Pleasure 


up to the age at which he decided to marry, he still had not 
had relations with any woman; or better yet, there was 
Laelius: “in the course of his long life, he knew but one 
woman, the wife of his youth.” 5 One can go back even further 
in the definition of this model of mutual conjugal fidelity. 
Nicocles, in the speech attributed to him by Isocrates, shows 
the moral and political importance he accorded to the achieve¬ 
ment of not “having approached any woman but my own 
wife” from the time of his marriage. 6 And in his ideal city, 
Aristotle would have sexual relations of a husband with an¬
