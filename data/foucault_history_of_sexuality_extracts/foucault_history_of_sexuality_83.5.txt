other woman, or the wife with another man, considered “dis¬ 
honorable ... in any circumstances whatsoever.” 7 The sexual 
“fidelity” of a husband with respect to his legitimate wife was 
not required either by law or by custom; it was nevertheless 
a question that people raised and a form of austerity on which 
some moralists set a high value. 

3. An image. In nineteenth-century texts there is a 
stereotypical portrait of the homosexual or invert: not only his 
mannerisms, his bearing, the way he gets dolled up, his co¬ 
quetry, but also his facial expressions, his anatomy, the femi¬ 
nine morphology of his whole body, are regularly included in 
this disparaging description. The image alludes both to the 
theme of role reversal and to the principle of a natural stigma 
attached to this offense against nature. It was as if “nature 
herself had become an accessory to sexual mendacity.” 8 One 
could doubtless trace the long history of this image (to which 
actual behaviors may have corresponded, through a complex 
play of inductions and attitudes of defiance). In the deeply 
negative intensity of this stereotype, one might read the age- 
old difficulty, for our societies, of integrating these two 
phenomena—different phenomena at that—of the inversion of 
sexual roles and intercourse between individuals of the same 
sex. Now this image, with the repulsive aura that surrounds 
it, has come down through the centuries. It was already 
clearly delineated in the Greco-Roman literature of the impe-

rial age. One encounters it in the portrait of the Effeminatus 
drawn by the author of an anonymous treatise on physiog¬ 
nomy of the fourth century; in the description of the priests 
of Atargatis, whom Apuleius makes fun of in The Golden /Ixs; 
in the symbolization that Dio Chrysostom offers for the 
daimon of immoderation in one of his lectures on monarchy; 
in the fleeting evocation of the petty orators, with their per¬ 
fume and their curls, whom Epictetus calls on at the back of 
his class, asking them if they are men or women. 9 One could 
see it again in the portrait of decadent youth, such as Seneca 
the Elder notices around him, with great repugnance: “Libidi¬ 
nous delight in song and dance transfixes these effeminates. 
Braiding the hair, refining the voice till it is as caressing as a 
woman’s, competing in bodily softness with women, beautify¬ 
ing themselves with filthy fineries—this is the pattern our
