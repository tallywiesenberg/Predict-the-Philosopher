youths set themselves.... Born feeble and spineless, they stay 
like that throughout their lives; taking others’ chastity by 
storm, careless of their own.” 10 But in its essential traits, the 
portrait is more ancient still. Socrates’ first speech in the Phae- 
drus alludes to it, when he voices disapproval of the love that 
is given to soft boys, too delicate to be exposed to the sun as 
they are growing up, and all made up with rouge and decked 
out in ornaments." And it is with these same traits that Aga- 
thon appears in The Thesmophoriazusae: pale complexion, 
smooth-shaven cheeks, woman’s voice, so much so that his 
interlocutor wonders if he is in the presence of a man or a 
woman. 12 It would be completely incorrect to interpret this as 
a condemnation of love of boys, or of what we generally refer 
to as homosexual relations; but at the same time, one cannot 
fail to see in it the effect of strongly negative judgments con¬ 
cerning some possible aspects of relations between men, as 
well as a definite aversion to anything that might denote a 
deliberate renunciation of the signs and privileges of the mas¬ 
culine role. The domain of male loves may have been “free” 
in Greek antiquity, much more so at any rate than it has been 
in modem European societies; the fact remains that one sees

The Use of Pleasure 


the very early expression of intense negative reactions and of 
forms of stigmatization that will extend well into the future. 

4. A model of abstention. The virtuous hero who is able to 
turn aside from pleasure, as if from a temptation into which 
he knows not to fall, is a familiar figure in Christianity—as 
common as the idea that this renunciation can give access to 
a spiritual experience of truth and love that sexual activity 
excludes. But equally well known in pagan antiquity was the 
figure of those athletes of self-restraint who were sufficiently 
masters of themselves and their cravings to be able to re¬ 
nounce sexual pleasure. Long before a thaumaturge like Apol¬ 
lonius of Tyana, who vowed chastity once and for all, and then 
had no more sexual relations for the rest of his life, 13 Greece 
had known and honored similar models. In some people, such 
extreme virtue was the visible mark of the mastery they 
brought to bear on themselves and hence of the power they 
were worthy of exercising over others. Thus Xenophon’s 
Agesilaus not only “kept at arm’s length those whose intimacy 
he did not desire,” but kept from embracing even the boy he 
did love; and he was careful to lodge only in temples or in a 
place where “all men’s eyes became witnesses to his recti¬ 
tude.” 14 But, for others, this abstention was linked directly to 
a form of wisdom that brought them into direct contact with 
some superior element in human nature and gave them access 
to the very essence of truth. The Socrates of the Symposium 
was like this, the one everybody wanted to be near, everybody 
was enamored of; the one whose wisdom everybody sought to 
appropriate—a wisdom that manifested and proved itself pre¬ 
cisely in the fact that he was himself able to keep from laying 
hands on the provocative beauty of Alcibiades. 15 The themat- 
ics of a relationship between sexual abstinence and access to 
truth was already quite prominent. 

We must not ask too much of these few references, however. 
It would be a mistake to infer that the sexual morality of

Christianity and that of paganism form a continuity. Several 
themes, principles, or notions may be found in the one and the 
other alike, true; but for all that, they do not have the same 
place or the same value within them. Socrates is not a desert 
Father struggling against temptation, and Nicocles is not a 
Christian husband; Aristophanes’ laughter at the expense of 
Agathon in drag has few traits in common with the disparage¬ 
ment of the invert that will be found much later in medical 
discourse. Moreover, one must also not lose sight of the fact 
that the Church and the pastoral ministry stressed the princi¬ 
ple of a morality whose precepts were compulsory and whose 
scope was universal (which did not rule out differences of 
prescription relating to the status of individuals, or the exis¬ 
tence of ascetic movements having their own aspirations). In 
classical thought, on the other hand, the demands of austerity 
were not organized into a unified, coherent, authoritarian 
moral system that was imposed on everyone in the same man¬ 
ner; they were more in the nature of a supplement, a “luxury” 
in relation to the commonly accepted morality. Further, they 
appeared in “scattered centers” whose origins were in differ¬ 
ent philosophical or religious movements. They developed in 
the midst of many separate groups. They proposed—more 
than they imposed—different styles of moderation or strict¬ 
ness, each having its specific character or “shape.” Py¬ 
thagorean austerity was not the same as that of the Stoics,
