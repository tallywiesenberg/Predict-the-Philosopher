did love; and he was careful to lodge only in temples or in a 
place where “all men’s eyes became witnesses to his recti¬ 
tude.” 14 But, for others, this abstention was linked directly to 
a form of wisdom that brought them into direct contact with 
some superior element in human nature and gave them access 
to the very essence of truth. The Socrates of the Symposium 
was like this, the one everybody wanted to be near, everybody 
was enamored of; the one whose wisdom everybody sought to 
appropriate—a wisdom that manifested and proved itself pre¬ 
cisely in the fact that he was himself able to keep from laying 
hands on the provocative beauty of Alcibiades. 15 The themat- 
ics of a relationship between sexual abstinence and access to 
truth was already quite prominent. 

We must not ask too much of these few references, however. 
It would be a mistake to infer that the sexual morality of

Christianity and that of paganism form a continuity. Several 
themes, principles, or notions may be found in the one and the 
other alike, true; but for all that, they do not have the same 
place or the same value within them. Socrates is not a desert 
Father struggling against temptation, and Nicocles is not a 
Christian husband; Aristophanes’ laughter at the expense of 
Agathon in drag has few traits in common with the disparage¬ 
ment of the invert that will be found much later in medical 
discourse. Moreover, one must also not lose sight of the fact 
that the Church and the pastoral ministry stressed the princi¬ 
ple of a morality whose precepts were compulsory and whose 
scope was universal (which did not rule out differences of 
prescription relating to the status of individuals, or the exis¬ 
tence of ascetic movements having their own aspirations). In 
classical thought, on the other hand, the demands of austerity 
were not organized into a unified, coherent, authoritarian 
moral system that was imposed on everyone in the same man¬ 
ner; they were more in the nature of a supplement, a “luxury” 
in relation to the commonly accepted morality. Further, they 
appeared in “scattered centers” whose origins were in differ¬ 
ent philosophical or religious movements. They developed in 
the midst of many separate groups. They proposed—more 
than they imposed—different styles of moderation or strict¬ 
ness, each having its specific character or “shape.” Py¬ 
thagorean austerity was not the same as that of the Stoics,
