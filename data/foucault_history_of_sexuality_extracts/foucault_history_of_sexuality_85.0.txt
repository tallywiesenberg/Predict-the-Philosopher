which was very different in turn from that recommended by 
Epicurus. From the few similarities I have managed to point 
out, it should not be concluded that the Christian morality of 
sex was somehow “pre-formed” in ancient thought; one ought 
to imagine instead that very early in the moral thought of 
antiquity, a thematic complex—a “quadri-thematics” of sex¬ 
ual austerity—formed around and apropos of the life of the 
body, the institution of marriage, relations between men, and 
the existence of wisdom. And, crossing through institutions, 
sets of precepts, extremely diverse theoretical references, and 
in spite of many alterations, this thematics maintained a cer-

The Use of Pleasure 


tain constancy as time went by: as if, starting in antiquity, 
there were four points of problematization on the basis of 
which—and according to schemas that were often very differ¬ 
ent—the concern with sexual austerity was endlessly refor¬ 
mulated. 

Now, it should be noted that these themes of austerity did 
not coincide with the lines of demarcation that may have been 
traced by the great social, civil, and religious interdictions. 
One might think that, generally speaking, where prohibitions 
are most fundamental, and where obligations are most coer¬ 
cive, moral systems develop the most insistent demands for 
austerity. Such a situation may arise, and the history of Chris¬ 
tianity or of modern Europe would doubtless afford examples 
of this.* But it seems in fact that this was not the case in 
antiquity. This appears very clearly in the dissymmetry that 
was a peculiar feature of all the moral reflection on sexual 
behavior of that age: women were generally subjected (except¬ 
ing the liberty they could be granted by a status like that of 
courtesan) to extremely strict constraints, and yet this ethics 
was not addressed to women; it was not their duties, or obliga¬ 
tions, that were recalled, justified, or spelled out. It was an 
ethics for men: an ethics thought, written, and taught by men, 
and addressed to men—to free men, obviously. A male ethics, 
consequently, in which women figured only as objects or, at 
most, as partners that one had best train, educate, and watch 
over when one had them under one’s power, but stay away 
from when they were under the power of someone else (father, 
husband, tutor). This is doubtless one of the most remarkable 
aspects of that moral reflection: it did not try to define a
