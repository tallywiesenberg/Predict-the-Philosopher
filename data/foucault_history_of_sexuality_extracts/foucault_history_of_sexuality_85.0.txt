which was very different in turn from that recommended by 
Epicurus. From the few similarities I have managed to point 
out, it should not be concluded that the Christian morality of 
sex was somehow “pre-formed” in ancient thought; one ought 
to imagine instead that very early in the moral thought of 
antiquity, a thematic complex—a “quadri-thematics” of sex¬ 
ual austerity—formed around and apropos of the life of the 
body, the institution of marriage, relations between men, and 
the existence of wisdom. And, crossing through institutions, 
sets of precepts, extremely diverse theoretical references, and 
in spite of many alterations, this thematics maintained a cer-

tain constancy as time went by: as if, starting in antiquity, 
there were four points of problematization on the basis of 
which—and according to schemas that were often very differ¬ 
ent—the concern with sexual austerity was endlessly refor¬ 
mulated. 

Now, it should be noted that these themes of austerity did 
not coincide with the lines of demarcation that may have been 
traced by the great social, civil, and religious interdictions. 
One might think that, generally speaking, where prohibitions 
are most fundamental, and where obligations are most coer¬ 
cive, moral systems develop the most insistent demands for 
austerity. Such a situation may arise, and the history of Chris¬ 
tianity or of modern Europe would doubtless afford examples 
of this.* But it seems in fact that this was not the case in 
antiquity. This appears very clearly in the dissymmetry that 
was a peculiar feature of all the moral reflection on sexual 
behavior of that age: women were generally subjected (except¬ 
ing the liberty they could be granted by a status like that of 
courtesan) to extremely strict constraints, and yet this ethics 
was not addressed to women; it was not their duties, or obliga¬ 
tions, that were recalled, justified, or spelled out. It was an 
ethics for men: an ethics thought, written, and taught by men, 
and addressed to men—to free men, obviously. A male ethics, 
consequently, in which women figured only as objects or, at 
most, as partners that one had best train, educate, and watch 
over when one had them under one’s power, but stay away 
from when they were under the power of someone else (father, 
husband, tutor). This is doubtless one of the most remarkable 
aspects of that moral reflection: it did not try to define a 
field of conduct and a domain of valid rules—subject to the 
necessary modulations—for the two sexes in common; it was 
an elaboration of masculine conduct carried out from the 

•The development of an ethics of marital relations, or more specifically, of reflections 
on the sexual behavior of husband and wife in the conjugal relationship (ideas that 
assumed such importance in the Christian pastoral ministry), can be seen as a conse¬ 
quence of the setting up of the Christian model of marriage—a slow, belated, and 
difficult occurrence, at that—in the course of the Middle Ages. 16

viewpoint of men in order to give form to their behavior. 

Better still: it did not speak to men concerning behaviors 
presumably owing to a few interdictions that were universally 
recognized and solemnly recalled in codes, customs, and reli¬ 
gious prescriptions. It spoke to them concerning precisely 
those conducts in which they were called upon to exercise 
their rights, their power, their authority, and their liberty: in 
the practice of pleasures that were not frowned upon, in a 
marital life where no rule or custom prevented the husband 
from having extramarital sexual relations, in relationships 
with boys, which—at least within certain limits—were ac¬ 
cepted, commonly maintained, and even prized. These themes 
of sexual austerity should be understood, not as an expression 
of, or commentary on, deep and essential prohibitions, but as 
the elaboration and stylization of an activity in the exercise of 
its power and the practice of its liberty. 

Which does not mean that this thematics of sexual austerity 
represents nothing more than an inconsequential refinement 
and a speculation unconnected with any specific concern. On 
the contrary, it is easy to see that each of these great figures 
of sexual austerity is tied to an axis of experience and to a 
cluster of concrete relationships: relations to the body, with 
the question of health, and behind it the whole game of life and 
death; the relation to the other sex, with the question of the 
spouse as privileged partner, in the game of the family institu¬ 
tion and the ties it creates; the relation to one’s own sex, with 
the question of partners that one can choose within it, and the 
problem of the adjustment between social roles and sexual 
roles; and finally, the relation to truth, where the question is 
raised of the spiritual conditions that enable one to gain access
