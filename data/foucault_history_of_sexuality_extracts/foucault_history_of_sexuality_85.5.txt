viewpoint of men in order to give form to their behavior. 

Better still: it did not speak to men concerning behaviors 
presumably owing to a few interdictions that were universally 
recognized and solemnly recalled in codes, customs, and reli¬ 
gious prescriptions. It spoke to them concerning precisely 
those conducts in which they were called upon to exercise 
their rights, their power, their authority, and their liberty: in 
the practice of pleasures that were not frowned upon, in a 
marital life where no rule or custom prevented the husband 
from having extramarital sexual relations, in relationships 
with boys, which—at least within certain limits—were ac¬ 
cepted, commonly maintained, and even prized. These themes 
of sexual austerity should be understood, not as an expression 
of, or commentary on, deep and essential prohibitions, but as 
the elaboration and stylization of an activity in the exercise of 
its power and the practice of its liberty. 

Which does not mean that this thematics of sexual austerity 
represents nothing more than an inconsequential refinement 
and a speculation unconnected with any specific concern. On 
the contrary, it is easy to see that each of these great figures 
of sexual austerity is tied to an axis of experience and to a 
cluster of concrete relationships: relations to the body, with 
the question of health, and behind it the whole game of life and 
death; the relation to the other sex, with the question of the 
spouse as privileged partner, in the game of the family institu¬ 
tion and the ties it creates; the relation to one’s own sex, with 
the question of partners that one can choose within it, and the 
problem of the adjustment between social roles and sexual 
roles; and finally, the relation to truth, where the question is 
raised of the spiritual conditions that enable one to gain access
