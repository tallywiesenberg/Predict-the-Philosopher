It thus seemed to me that a whole recentering was called 
for. Instead of looking for basic interdictions that were hidden 
or manifested in the demands of sexual austerity, it was neces¬ 
sary to locate the areas of experience and the forms in which 
sexual behavior was problematized, becoming an object of

tion. More specifically, it was logical to ask why the four great 
domains of relations in which it seemed that a free man in 
classical societies was able to develop and display his activity 
without encountering any major prohibition, were precisely 
the locuses of an intense problematization of sexual practice. 
Why was it in those areas—apropos of the body, of the wife, 
of boys, and of truth—that the practice of pleasures became 
a matter for debate? Why did the bringing of sexual activity 
into these relations occasion anxiety, discussion, and reflec¬ 
tion? Why did these axes of everyday experience give rise to 
a way of thinking that sought to rarefy sexual behavior, to 
moderate and condition it, and to define an austere style in the 
practice of pleasures? How did sexual behavior, insofar as it 
implied these different types of relations, come to be conceived 
as a domain of moral experience?

Everyone is aware of the word’s ambiguity. By “morality,” 
one means a set of values and rules of action that are recom¬ 
mended to individuals through the intermediary of various
