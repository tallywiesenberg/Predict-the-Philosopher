to wisdom. 

It thus seemed to me that a whole recentering was called 
for. Instead of looking for basic interdictions that were hidden 
or manifested in the demands of sexual austerity, it was neces¬ 
sary to locate the areas of experience and the forms in which 
sexual behavior was problematized, becoming an object of

concern, an element for reflection, and a material for styliza¬ 
tion. More specifically, it was logical to ask why the four great 
domains of relations in which it seemed that a free man in 
classical societies was able to develop and display his activity 
without encountering any major prohibition, were precisely 
the locuses of an intense problematization of sexual practice. 
Why was it in those areas—apropos of the body, of the wife, 
of boys, and of truth—that the practice of pleasures became 
a matter for debate? Why did the bringing of sexual activity 
into these relations occasion anxiety, discussion, and reflec¬ 
tion? Why did these axes of everyday experience give rise to 
a way of thinking that sought to rarefy sexual behavior, to 
moderate and condition it, and to define an austere style in the 
practice of pleasures? How did sexual behavior, insofar as it 
implied these different types of relations, come to be conceived 
as a domain of moral experience?

Morality and Practice 
of the Self 


In order to answer this question, some methodological con¬ 
siderations need to be brought in; more specifically, it is best 
to reflect on the object one has in view when one undertakes 
to study the forms and transformations of a “morality.” 

Everyone is aware of the word’s ambiguity. By “morality,” 
one means a set of values and rules of action that are recom¬ 
mended to individuals through the intermediary of various 
prescriptive agencies such as the family (in one of its roles), 
educational institutions, churches, and so forth. It is some¬ 
times the case that these rules and values are plainly set forth 
in a coherent doctrine and an explicit teaching. But it also 
happens that they are transmitted in a diffuse manner, so that, 
far from constituting a systematic ensemble, they form a com¬ 
plex interplay of elements that counterbalance and correct one 
another, and cancel each other out on certain points, thus 
providing for compromises or loopholes. With these qualifica¬ 
tions taken into account, we can call this prescriptive ensem¬ 
ble a “moral code.” But “morality” also refers to the real 
behavior of individuals in relation to the rules and values that 
are recommended to them: the word thus designates the man¬ 
ner in which they comply more or less fully with a standard 
of conduct, the manner in which they obey or resist an inter¬ 
diction or a prescription; the manner in which they respect or 
disregard a set of values. In studying this aspect of morality, 
one must determine how and with what margins of variation

or transgression individuals or groups conduct themselves in 
reference to a prescriptive system that is explicitly or implic¬ 
itly operative in their culture, and of which they are more or 
less aware. We can call this level of phenomena “the morality 
of behaviors.” 

There is more. For a rule of conduct is one thing; the 
conduct that may be measured by this rule is another. But 
another thing still is the manner in which one ought to “con¬ 
duct oneself’—that is, the manner in which one ought to form 
oneself as an ethical subject acting in reference to the prescrip¬ 
tive elements that make up the code. Given a code of actions, 
and with regard to a specific type of actions (which can be 
defined by their degree of conformity with or divergence from 
the code), there are different ways to “conduct oneself’ mor¬ 
ally, different ways for the acting individual to operate, not 
just as an agent, but as an ethical subject of this action. Take, 
for example, a code of sexual prescriptions enjoining the two 
marital partners to practice a strict and symmetrical conjugal 
fidelity, always with a view to procreation; there will be many 
ways, even within such a rigid frame, to practice that auster¬
