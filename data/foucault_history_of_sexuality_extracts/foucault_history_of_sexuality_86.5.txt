prescriptive agencies such as the family (in one of its roles), 
educational institutions, churches, and so forth. It is some¬ 
times the case that these rules and values are plainly set forth 
in a coherent doctrine and an explicit teaching. But it also 
happens that they are transmitted in a diffuse manner, so that, 
far from constituting a systematic ensemble, they form a com¬ 
plex interplay of elements that counterbalance and correct one 
another, and cancel each other out on certain points, thus 
providing for compromises or loopholes. With these qualifica¬ 
tions taken into account, we can call this prescriptive ensem¬ 
ble a “moral code.” But “morality” also refers to the real 
behavior of individuals in relation to the rules and values that 
are recommended to them: the word thus designates the man¬ 
ner in which they comply more or less fully with a standard 
of conduct, the manner in which they obey or resist an inter¬ 
diction or a prescription; the manner in which they respect or 
disregard a set of values. In studying this aspect of morality, 
one must determine how and with what margins of variation

or transgression individuals or groups conduct themselves in 
reference to a prescriptive system that is explicitly or implic¬ 
itly operative in their culture, and of which they are more or 
less aware. We can call this level of phenomena “the morality 
of behaviors.” 

There is more. For a rule of conduct is one thing; the 
conduct that may be measured by this rule is another. But 
another thing still is the manner in which one ought to “con¬ 
duct oneself’—that is, the manner in which one ought to form 
oneself as an ethical subject acting in reference to the prescrip¬ 
tive elements that make up the code. Given a code of actions, 
and with regard to a specific type of actions (which can be 
defined by their degree of conformity with or divergence from 
the code), there are different ways to “conduct oneself’ mor¬ 
ally, different ways for the acting individual to operate, not 
just as an agent, but as an ethical subject of this action. Take, 
for example, a code of sexual prescriptions enjoining the two 
marital partners to practice a strict and symmetrical conjugal 
fidelity, always with a view to procreation; there will be many 
ways, even within such a rigid frame, to practice that auster¬
