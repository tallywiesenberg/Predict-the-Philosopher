ity, many ways to “be faithful.” These differences can bear on 
several points worth considering. 

They concern what might be called the determination of the 
ethical substance; that is, the way in which the individual has 
to constitute this or that part of himself as the prime material 
of his moral conduct. Thus, one can relate the crucial aspects 
of the practice of fidelity to the strict observance of interdic¬ 
tions and obligations in the very acts one accomplishes. But 
one can also make the essence of fidelity consist in the mastery 
of desires, in the fervent combat one directs against them, in 
the strength with which one is able to resist temptations: what 
makes up the content of fidelity in this case is that vigilance 
and that struggle. In these conditions, the contradictory 
movements of the soul—much more than the carrying out of 
the acts themselves—will be the prime material of moral prac¬ 
tice. Alternatively, one can have it consist in the intensity,

vis-a-vis the partner, and in the quality of the relationship that 
permanently binds the two spouses. 

The differences can also have to do with the mode of subjec¬ 
tion (mode d'assujettissement); that is, with the way in which 
the individual establishes his relation to the rule and recog¬ 
nizes himself as obliged to put it into practice. One can, for 
example, practice conjugal fidelity and comply with the pre¬ 
cept that imposes it, because one acknowledges oneself to be 
a member of the group that accepts it, declares adherence to 
it out loud, and silently preserves it as a custom. But one can 
practice it, too, because one regards oneself as an heir to a 
spiritual tradition that one has the responsibility of maintain¬ 
ing or reviving; one can also practice fidelity in response to an 
appeal, by offering oneself as an example, or by seeking to give 
one’s personal life a form that answers to criteria of brilliance, 
beauty, nobility, or perfection. 

There are also possible differences in the forms of elabora¬ 
tion, of ethical work (travail ethique) that one performs on 
oneself, not only in order to bring one’s conduct into compli¬ 
ance with a given rule, but to attempt to transform oneself into 
the ethical subject of one’s behavior. Thus, sexual austerity
