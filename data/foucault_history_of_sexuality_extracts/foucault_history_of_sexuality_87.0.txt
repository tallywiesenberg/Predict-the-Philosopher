ity, many ways to “be faithful.” These differences can bear on 
several points worth considering. 

They concern what might be called the determination of the 
ethical substance; that is, the way in which the individual has 
to constitute this or that part of himself as the prime material 
of his moral conduct. Thus, one can relate the crucial aspects 
of the practice of fidelity to the strict observance of interdic¬ 
tions and obligations in the very acts one accomplishes. But 
one can also make the essence of fidelity consist in the mastery 
of desires, in the fervent combat one directs against them, in 
the strength with which one is able to resist temptations: what 
makes up the content of fidelity in this case is that vigilance 
and that struggle. In these conditions, the contradictory 
movements of the soul—much more than the carrying out of 
the acts themselves—will be the prime material of moral prac¬ 
tice. Alternatively, one can have it consist in the intensity,

continuity, and reciprocity of feelings that are experienced 
vis-a-vis the partner, and in the quality of the relationship that 
permanently binds the two spouses. 

The differences can also have to do with the mode of subjec¬ 
tion (mode d'assujettissement); that is, with the way in which 
the individual establishes his relation to the rule and recog¬ 
nizes himself as obliged to put it into practice. One can, for 
example, practice conjugal fidelity and comply with the pre¬ 
cept that imposes it, because one acknowledges oneself to be 
a member of the group that accepts it, declares adherence to 
it out loud, and silently preserves it as a custom. But one can 
practice it, too, because one regards oneself as an heir to a 
spiritual tradition that one has the responsibility of maintain¬ 
ing or reviving; one can also practice fidelity in response to an 
appeal, by offering oneself as an example, or by seeking to give 
one’s personal life a form that answers to criteria of brilliance, 
beauty, nobility, or perfection. 

There are also possible differences in the forms of elabora¬ 
tion, of ethical work (travail ethique) that one performs on 
oneself, not only in order to bring one’s conduct into compli¬ 
ance with a given rule, but to attempt to transform oneself into 
the ethical subject of one’s behavior. Thus, sexual austerity 
can be practiced through a long effort of learning, memoriza¬ 
tion, and assimilation of a systematic ensemble of precepts, 
and through a regular checking of conduct aimed at measur¬ 
ing the exactness with which one is applying these rules. It can 
be practiced in the form of a sudden, all-embracing, and defini¬ 
tive renunciation of pleasures; it can also be practiced in the 
form of a relentless combat whose vicissitudes—including mo¬ 
mentary setbacks—can have meaning and value in them¬ 
selves; and it can be practiced through a decipherment as 
painstaking, continuous, and detailed as possible, of the move¬ 
ments of desire in all its hidden forms, including the most 
obscure. 

Other differences, finally, concern what might be called the 
telos of the ethical subject: an action is not only moral in itself,

in its singularity; it is also moral in its circumstantial integra¬ 
tion and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of 
conduct. It is an element and an aspect of this conduct, and 
it marks a stage in its life, a possible advance in its continuity. 
A moral action tends toward its own accomplishment; but it 
also aims beyond the latter, to the establishing of a moral 
conduct that commits an individual, not only to other actions 
always in conformity with values and rules, but to a certain 
mode of being, a mode of being characteristic of the ethical 
subject. Many differences are possible here as well: conjugal 
fidelity can be associated with a moral conduct that aspires to 
an ever more complete mastery of the self; it can be a moral 
conduct that manifests a sudden and radical detachment vis-a- 
vis the world; it may strain toward a perfect tranquillity of 
soul, a total insensitivity to the agitations of the passions, or 
toward a purification that will ensure salvation after death and 
blissful immortality. 

In short, for an action to be “moral,” it must not be reduci¬ 
ble to an act or a series of acts conforming to a rule, a law, 
or a value. Of course all moral action involves a relationship 
with the reality in which it is carried out, and a relationship 
with the self. The latter is not simply “self-awareness” but 
self-formation as an “ethical subject,” a process in which the 
individual delimits that part of himself that will form the 
object of his moral practice, defines his position relative to the
