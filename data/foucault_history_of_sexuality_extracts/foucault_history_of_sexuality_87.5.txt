can be practiced through a long effort of learning, memoriza¬ 
tion, and assimilation of a systematic ensemble of precepts, 
and through a regular checking of conduct aimed at measur¬ 
ing the exactness with which one is applying these rules. It can 
be practiced in the form of a sudden, all-embracing, and defini¬ 
tive renunciation of pleasures; it can also be practiced in the 
form of a relentless combat whose vicissitudes—including mo¬ 
mentary setbacks—can have meaning and value in them¬ 
selves; and it can be practiced through a decipherment as 
painstaking, continuous, and detailed as possible, of the move¬ 
ments of desire in all its hidden forms, including the most 
obscure. 

Other differences, finally, concern what might be called the 
telos of the ethical subject: an action is not only moral in itself,

in its singularity; it is also moral in its circumstantial integra¬ 
tion and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of 
conduct. It is an element and an aspect of this conduct, and 
it marks a stage in its life, a possible advance in its continuity. 
A moral action tends toward its own accomplishment; but it 
also aims beyond the latter, to the establishing of a moral 
conduct that commits an individual, not only to other actions 
always in conformity with values and rules, but to a certain 
mode of being, a mode of being characteristic of the ethical 
subject. Many differences are possible here as well: conjugal 
fidelity can be associated with a moral conduct that aspires to 
an ever more complete mastery of the self; it can be a moral 
conduct that manifests a sudden and radical detachment vis-a- 
vis the world; it may strain toward a perfect tranquillity of 
soul, a total insensitivity to the agitations of the passions, or 
toward a purification that will ensure salvation after death and 
blissful immortality. 

In short, for an action to be “moral,” it must not be reduci¬ 
ble to an act or a series of acts conforming to a rule, a law, 
or a value. Of course all moral action involves a relationship 
with the reality in which it is carried out, and a relationship 
with the self. The latter is not simply “self-awareness” but 
self-formation as an “ethical subject,” a process in which the 
individual delimits that part of himself that will form the 
object of his moral practice, defines his position relative to the
