precept he will follow, and decides on a certain mode of being 
that will serve as his moral goal. And this requires him to act 
upon himself, to monitor, test, improve, and transform him¬ 
self. There is no specific moral action that does not refer to a 
unified moral conduct; no moral conduct that does not call for 
the forming of oneself as an ethical subject; and no forming 
of the ethical subject without “modes of subjectivation” and 
an “ascetics” or “practices of the self’ that support them. 
Moral action is indissociable from these forms of self-activity, 
and they do not differ any less from one morality to another 
than do the systems of values, rules, and interdictions.

These distinctions are bound to have effects that are not 
confined to theory. They also have consequences for historical 
analysis. Anyone who wishes to study the history of a “moral¬ 
ity” has to take into account the different realities that are 
covered by the term. A history of “moral behaviors” would 
study the extent to which actions of certain individuals or 
groups are consistent with the rules and values that are pre¬ 
scribed for them by various agencies. A history of “codes” 
would analyze the different systems of rules and values that 
are operative in a given society or group, the agencies or 
mechanisms of constraint that enforce them, the forms they 
take in their multifariousness, their divergences and their con¬ 
tradictions. And finally, a history of the way in which in¬ 
dividuals are urged to constitute themselves as subjects of 
moral conduct would be concerned with the models proposed 
for setting up and developing relationships with the self, for 
self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-examination, for the deci¬ 
pherment of the self by oneself, for the transformations that 
one seeks to accomplish with oneself as object. This last is 
what might be called a history of “ethics” and “ascetics,” 
understood as a history of the forms of moral subjectivation 
and of the practices of self that are meant to ensure it. 

If it is true, in fact, that every morality, in the broad sense, 
comprises the two elements I have just mentioned: codes of 
behavior and forms of subjectivation; if it is true that they can 
never be entirely dissociated, though they may develop in 
relative independence from one another—then we should not 
be surprised to find that in certain moralities the main empha¬ 
sis is placed on the code, on its systematicity, its richness, its 
capacity to adjust to every possible case and to embrace every 
area of behavior. With moralities of this type, the important 
thing is to focus on the instances of authority that enforce the 
code, that require it to be learned and observed, that penalize 
infractions; in these conditions, the subjectivation occurs basi¬ 
cally in a quasi-juridical form, where the ethical subject refers 
his conduct to a law, or set of laws, to which he must submit

at the risk of committing offenses that may make him liable 
to punishment. It would be quite incorrect to reduce Christian 
morality—one probably should say “Christian moralities”— 
to such a model; and yet it may not be wrong to think that 
the organization of the penitential system at the beginning of 
the thirteenth century, and its development up to the eve of 
the Reformation, brought about a very strong “juridification” 
—more precisely, a very strong “codification”—of the moral 
experience. It was against this codification that many spiritual 
movements reacted before the Reformation. 

On the other hand, it is easy to conceive of moralities in 
which the strong and dynamic element is to be sought in the 
forms of subjectivation and the practices of the self. In this 
case, the system of codes and rules of behavior may be rather 
rudimentary. Their exact observance may be relatively unim¬ 
portant, at least compared with what is required of the indi¬ 
vidual in the relationship he has with himself, in his different 
actions, thoughts, and feelings as he endeavors to form himself 
as an ethical subject. Here the emphasis is on the forms of 
^relations with the self, on the methods and techniques by 
which he works them out, on the exercises by which he makes 
of himself an object to be known, and on the practices that 
enable him to transform his own mode of being. These “ethics- 
oriented” moralities (which do not necessarily correspond to 
those involving “ascetic denial”) have been very important in 
Christianity, functioning alongside the “code-oriented” 
moralities. Between the two types there have been, at differ¬ 
ent times, juxtapositions, rivalries and conflicts, and com¬ 
promises. 

Now, it seems clear, from a first approach at least, that 
moral conceptions in Greek and Greco-Roman antiquity were 
much more oriented toward practices of the self and the ques¬
