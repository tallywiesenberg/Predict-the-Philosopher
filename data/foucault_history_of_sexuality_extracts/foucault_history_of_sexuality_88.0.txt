precept he will follow, and decides on a certain mode of being 
that will serve as his moral goal. And this requires him to act 
upon himself, to monitor, test, improve, and transform him¬ 
self. There is no specific moral action that does not refer to a 
unified moral conduct; no moral conduct that does not call for 
the forming of oneself as an ethical subject; and no forming 
of the ethical subject without “modes of subjectivation” and 
an “ascetics” or “practices of the self’ that support them. 
Moral action is indissociable from these forms of self-activity, 
and they do not differ any less from one morality to another 
than do the systems of values, rules, and interdictions.

These distinctions are bound to have effects that are not 
confined to theory. They also have consequences for historical 
analysis. Anyone who wishes to study the history of a “moral¬ 
ity” has to take into account the different realities that are 
covered by the term. A history of “moral behaviors” would 
study the extent to which actions of certain individuals or 
groups are consistent with the rules and values that are pre¬ 
scribed for them by various agencies. A history of “codes” 
would analyze the different systems of rules and values that 
are operative in a given society or group, the agencies or 
mechanisms of constraint that enforce them, the forms they 
take in their multifariousness, their divergences and their con¬ 
tradictions. And finally, a history of the way in which in¬ 
dividuals are urged to constitute themselves as subjects of 
moral conduct would be concerned with the models proposed 
for setting up and developing relationships with the self, for 
self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-examination, for the deci¬ 
pherment of the self by oneself, for the transformations that 
one seeks to accomplish with oneself as object. This last is 
what might be called a history of “ethics” and “ascetics,” 
understood as a history of the forms of moral subjectivation 
and of the practices of self that are meant to ensure it. 

If it is true, in fact, that every morality, in the broad sense, 
comprises the two elements I have just mentioned: codes of 
behavior and forms of subjectivation; if it is true that they can 
never be entirely dissociated, though they may develop in 
relative independence from one another—then we should not 
be surprised to find that in certain moralities the main empha¬ 
sis is placed on the code, on its systematicity, its richness, its
