capacity to adjust to every possible case and to embrace every 
area of behavior. With moralities of this type, the important 
thing is to focus on the instances of authority that enforce the 
code, that require it to be learned and observed, that penalize 
infractions; in these conditions, the subjectivation occurs basi¬ 
cally in a quasi-juridical form, where the ethical subject refers 
his conduct to a law, or set of laws, to which he must submit

at the risk of committing offenses that may make him liable 
to punishment. It would be quite incorrect to reduce Christian 
morality—one probably should say “Christian moralities”— 
to such a model; and yet it may not be wrong to think that 
the organization of the penitential system at the beginning of 
the thirteenth century, and its development up to the eve of 
the Reformation, brought about a very strong “juridification” 
—more precisely, a very strong “codification”—of the moral 
experience. It was against this codification that many spiritual 
movements reacted before the Reformation. 

On the other hand, it is easy to conceive of moralities in 
which the strong and dynamic element is to be sought in the 
forms of subjectivation and the practices of the self. In this 
case, the system of codes and rules of behavior may be rather 
rudimentary. Their exact observance may be relatively unim¬ 
portant, at least compared with what is required of the indi¬ 
vidual in the relationship he has with himself, in his different 
actions, thoughts, and feelings as he endeavors to form himself 
as an ethical subject. Here the emphasis is on the forms of 
^relations with the self, on the methods and techniques by 
which he works them out, on the exercises by which he makes 
of himself an object to be known, and on the practices that 
enable him to transform his own mode of being. These “ethics- 
oriented” moralities (which do not necessarily correspond to 
those involving “ascetic denial”) have been very important in 
Christianity, functioning alongside the “code-oriented” 
moralities. Between the two types there have been, at differ¬ 
ent times, juxtapositions, rivalries and conflicts, and com¬ 
promises. 

Now, it seems clear, from a first approach at least, that 
moral conceptions in Greek and Greco-Roman antiquity were 
much more oriented toward practices of the self and the ques¬
