tion of askesis than toward codifications of conducts and the 
strict definition of what is permitted and what is forbidden. If 
exception is made of the Republic and the Laws, one finds very 
few references to the principle of a code that would define in

detail the right conduct t o maintain, few references to the need 
for an authority charged with seeing to its application, few 
references to the possibility of punishments that would sanc¬ 
tion infractions. Although the necessity of respecting the law 
and the customs—the nomoi —was very often underscored, 
more important than the content of the law and its conditions 
of application was the attitude that caused one to respect 
them. The accent was placed on the relationship with the self 
that enabled a person to keep from being carried away by the 
appetites and pleasures, to maintain a mastery and superiority 
over them, to keep his senses in a state of tranquillity, to 
remain free from interior bondage to the passions, and to 
achieve a mode of being that could be defined by the full 
enjoyment of oneself, or the perfect supremacy of oneself over 
oneself. 

This explains the choice of method I have kept to through¬ 
out this study on the sexual morality of pagan and Christian 
antiquity; that is, I had to keep in mind the distinction be¬ 
tween the code elements of a morality and the elements of 
ascesis, neglecting neither their coexistence, their interrela¬ 
tions, their relative autonomy, nor their possible differences of 
emphasis. I had to take into account everything, in these 
moralities, that seemed to have to do with the privileged status 
of the practices of the self and the interest that may have been 
accorded them; with the effort that was made to develop them, 
perfect them, and teach them; and with the debate that went 
on concerning them. Consequently, the question that is so 
often raised regarding the continuity (or break) between the 
philosophical moralities of antiquity and Christian morality 
had to be reformulated; instead of asking what were the code 
elements that Christianity may have borrowed from ancient 
thought, and what were those that it added in its own right, 
in order to define what was permitted and what forbidden 
within a sexuality assumed to be constant, it seemed more 
pertinent to ask how, given the continuity, transfer, or modifi¬ 
cation of codes, the forms of self-relationship (and the prac-

The Use of Pleasure 


tices of the self that were associated with them) were defined, 
modified, recast, and diversified. 

I am not supposing that the codes are unimportant. But one 
notices that they ultimately revolve around a rather small 
number of rather simple principles: perhaps men are not much 
more inventive when it comes to interdictions than they are 
when it comes to pleasures. Their stability is also rather re¬ 
markable; the notable proliferation of codifications (concern¬ 
ing permitted or forbidden places, partners, and acts) 
occurred rather late in Christianity. On the other hand, it 
appears—at any rate this is the hypothesis I would like to 
explore here—that there is a whole rich and complex field of 
historicity in the way the individual is summoned to recognize 
himself as an ethical subject of sexual conduct. This will be a 
matter of seeing how that subjectivation was defined and 
transformed, from classical Greek thought up to the formula¬ 
tion of the Christian doctrine and pastoral ministry regarding 
the flesh. 

In this volume, I would like to take note of some general 
traits that characterized the way in which sexual behavior was 
considered by classical Greek thought as a domain of moral 
valuation and choice. I will start from the then common no¬ 
tion of “use of the pleasures ”—chresis aphrodision —and at¬ 
tempt to determine the modes of subjectivation to which it 
referred: the ethical substance, the types of subjection, the 
forms of elaboration of the self, and the moral teleology. Then, 
starting each time from a practice whose existence, status, and 
rules were native to Greek culture (the practice of the health 
regimen, that of household management, that of courtship), I 
will study the way in which medical and philosophical 
thought worked out this “use of the pleasures,” formulating 
several recurrent themes of austerity that would center on 
four great axes of experience: the relation to one’s body, the 
relation to one’s wife, the relation to boys, and the rela¬ 
tion to truth.
