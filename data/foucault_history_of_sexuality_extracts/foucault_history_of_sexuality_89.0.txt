detail the right conduct t o maintain, few references to the need 
for an authority charged with seeing to its application, few 
references to the possibility of punishments that would sanc¬ 
tion infractions. Although the necessity of respecting the law 
and the customs—the nomoi —was very often underscored, 
more important than the content of the law and its conditions 
of application was the attitude that caused one to respect 
them. The accent was placed on the relationship with the self 
that enabled a person to keep from being carried away by the 
appetites and pleasures, to maintain a mastery and superiority 
over them, to keep his senses in a state of tranquillity, to 
remain free from interior bondage to the passions, and to 
achieve a mode of being that could be defined by the full 
enjoyment of oneself, or the perfect supremacy of oneself over 
oneself. 

This explains the choice of method I have kept to through¬ 
out this study on the sexual morality of pagan and Christian 
antiquity; that is, I had to keep in mind the distinction be¬ 
tween the code elements of a morality and the elements of 
ascesis, neglecting neither their coexistence, their interrela¬ 
tions, their relative autonomy, nor their possible differences of 
emphasis. I had to take into account everything, in these 
moralities, that seemed to have to do with the privileged status 
of the practices of the self and the interest that may have been 
accorded them; with the effort that was made to develop them, 
perfect them, and teach them; and with the debate that went 
on concerning them. Consequently, the question that is so 
often raised regarding the continuity (or break) between the 
philosophical moralities of antiquity and Christian morality 
had to be reformulated; instead of asking what were the code 
elements that Christianity may have borrowed from ancient 
thought, and what were those that it added in its own right, 
in order to define what was permitted and what forbidden 
within a sexuality assumed to be constant, it seemed more 
pertinent to ask how, given the continuity, transfer, or modifi¬ 
cation of codes, the forms of self-relationship (and the prac-
