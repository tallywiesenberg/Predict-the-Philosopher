analysis, stocktaking, classification, and specification, of 
quantitative or causal studies. This need to take sex “into 
account,” to pronounce a discourse on sex that would not 
derive from morality alone but from rationality as well, was 
sufficiently new that at first it wondered at itself and sought 
apologies for its own existence. How could a discourse based 
on reason speak of that? “Rarely have philosophers directed 
a steady gaze to these objects situated between disgust and 
ridicule, where one must avoid both hypocrisy and scan¬ 
dal.” 8 And nearly a century later, the medical establishment, 
which one might have expected to be less surprised by what 
it was about to formulate, still stumbled at the moment of 
speaking: “The darkness that envelops these facts, the shame 
and disgust they inspire, have always repelled the observer’s 
gaze. . . . For a long time I hesitated to introduce the loath¬ 
some picture into this study.” 9 What is essential is not in all 
these scruples, in the “moralism” they betray, or in the hy¬ 
pocrisy one can suspect them of, but in the recognized neces¬ 
sity of overcoming this hesitation. One had to speak of sex; 
one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not 
determined by the division between licit and illicit, even if the 
speaker maintained the distinction for himself (which is what 
these solemn and preliminary declarations were intended to 
show): one had to speak of it as of a thing to be not simply 
condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems 
of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to 
function according to an optimum. Sex was not something 
one simply judged; it was a thing one administered. It was 
in the nature of a public potential; it called for management 
procedures; it had to be taken charge of by analytical dis¬ 
courses. In the eighteenth century, sex became a “police” 
matter—in the full and strict sense given the term at the time: 
not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization
