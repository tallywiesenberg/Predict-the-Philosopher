Thus the father in the family is not the “representa¬ 
tive” of the sovereign or the state; and the latter are not 
projections of the father on a different scale.The family does 
not duplicate society, just as society does not imitate the 
family.But the family organization, precisely to the extent 
that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the 
other power mechanisms, was used to support the great 
“maneuvers” employed for the Malthusian control of the 
birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicali- 
zation of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms.4.Rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses 

What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the 
surface of projection of these power mechanisms.
