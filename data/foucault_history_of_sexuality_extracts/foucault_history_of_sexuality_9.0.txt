analysis, stocktaking, classification, and specification, of 
quantitative or causal studies. This need to take sex “into 
account,” to pronounce a discourse on sex that would not 
derive from morality alone but from rationality as well, was 
sufficiently new that at first it wondered at itself and sought 
apologies for its own existence. How could a discourse based 
on reason speak of that? “Rarely have philosophers directed 
a steady gaze to these objects situated between disgust and 
ridicule, where one must avoid both hypocrisy and scan¬ 
dal.” 8 And nearly a century later, the medical establishment, 
which one might have expected to be less surprised by what 
it was about to formulate, still stumbled at the moment of 
speaking: “The darkness that envelops these facts, the shame 
and disgust they inspire, have always repelled the observer’s 
gaze. . . . For a long time I hesitated to introduce the loath¬ 
some picture into this study.” 9 What is essential is not in all 
these scruples, in the “moralism” they betray, or in the hy¬ 
pocrisy one can suspect them of, but in the recognized neces¬ 
sity of overcoming this hesitation. One had to speak of sex; 
one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not 
determined by the division between licit and illicit, even if the 
speaker maintained the distinction for himself (which is what 
these solemn and preliminary declarations were intended to 
show): one had to speak of it as of a thing to be not simply 
condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems 
of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to 
function according to an optimum. Sex was not something 
one simply judged; it was a thing one administered. It was 
in the nature of a public potential; it called for management 
procedures; it had to be taken charge of by analytical dis¬ 
courses. In the eighteenth century, sex became a “police” 
matter—in the full and strict sense given the term at the time: 
not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization

The Repressive Hypothesis

of collective and individual forces: “We must consolidate and 
augment, through the wisdom of its regulations, the internal 
power of the state; and since this power consists not only in 
the Republic in general, and in each of the members who 
constitute it, but also in the faculties and talents of those 
belonging to it, it follows that the police must concern them¬ 
selves with these means and make them serve the public 
welfare. And they can only obtain this result through the 
knowledge they have of those different assets.” 10 A policing 
of sex: that is, not the rigor of a taboo, but the necessity of 
regulating sex through useful and public discourses. 

A few examples will suffice. One of the great innovations 
in the techniques of power in the eighteenth century was the 
emergence of “population” as an economic and political 
problem: population as wealth, population as manpower or 
labor capacity, population balanced between its own growth 
and the resources it commanded. Governments perceived 
that they were not dealing simply with subjects, or even with 
a “people,” but with a “population,” with its specific 
phenomena and its peculiar variables: birth and death rates, 
life expectancy, fertility, state of health, frequency of ill¬ 
nesses, patterns of diet and habitation. All these variables 
were situated at the point where the characteristic move¬ 
ments of life and the specific effects of institutions inter¬ 
sected: “States are not populated in accordance with the 
natural progression of propagation, but by virtue of their 
industry, their products, and their different institutions. 

. . . Men multiply like the yields from the ground and in 
proportion to the advantages and resources they find in their 
labors.” 11 At the heart of this economic and political problem 
of population was sex: it was necessary to analyze the birth¬ 
rate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate 
births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the 
ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmar-
