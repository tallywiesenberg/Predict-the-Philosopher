We 
must make allowance for the complex and unstable process 
whereby discourse can be both an instrument and an effect 
of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of 
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy.Dis¬ 
course transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but 
also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes 
it possible to thwart it.In like manner, silence and secrecy 
are a shelter for power, anchoring its prohibitions; but they 
also loosen its holds and provide for relatively obscure areas 
of tolerance.Consider for example the history of what was 
once “the” great sin against nature.The extreme discretion 
of the texts dealing with sodomy—that utterly confused cate¬ 
gory—and the nearly universal reticence in talking about it 
made possible a twofold operation: on the one hand, there 
was an extreme severity (punishment by fire was meted out 
well into the eighteenth century, without there being any 
substantial protest expressed before the middle of the cen¬ 
tury), and on the other hand, a tolerance that must have been 
widespread (which one can deduce indirectly from the infre¬ 
quency of judicial sentences, and which one glimpses more 
directly through certain statements concerning societies of 
men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts).
