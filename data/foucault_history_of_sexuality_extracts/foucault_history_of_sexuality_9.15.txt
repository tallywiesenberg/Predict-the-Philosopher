There is no question that the appearance in nineteenth-cen¬ 
tury psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole se¬ 
ries of discourses on the species and subspecies of homosexu¬ 
ality, inversion, pederasty, and “psychic hermaphrodism” 
made possible a strong advance of social controls into this 
area of “perversity”; but it also made possible the formation 
of a “reverse” discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its 
own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or “naturality” be 
acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same 
categories by which it was medically disqualified.There is 
not, on the one side, a discourse of power, and opposite it, 
another discourse that runs counter to it.Discourses are 
tactical elements or blocks operating in the field of force

relations; there can exist different and even contradictory 
discourses within the same strategy; they can, on the con¬ 
trary, circulate without changing their form from one strat¬ 
egy to another, opposing strategy.We must not expect the 
discourses on sex to tell us, above all, what strategy they 
derive from, or what moral divisions they accompany, or 
what ideology—dominant or dominated—they represent; 
rather we must question them on the two levels of their 
tactical productivity (what reciprocal effects of power and 
knowledge they ensure) and their strategical integration 
(what conjunction and what force relationship make their 
utilization necessary in a given episode of the various con¬ 
frontations that occur).In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a concep¬ 
tion of power which replaces the privilege of the law with the 
viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with 
the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty 
with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force 
relations, wherein far-reaching, but never completely stable, 
effects of domination are produced.
