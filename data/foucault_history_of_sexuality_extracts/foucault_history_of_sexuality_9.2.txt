The strategical model, 
rather than the model based on law.And this, not out of a 
speculative choice or theoretical preference, but because in 
fact it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that 
the force relationships which for a long time had found 
expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually be¬ 
came invested in the order of political power.3

Sexuality must not be described as a stubborn drive, by 
nature alien and of necessity disobedient to a power which 
exhausts itself trying to subdue it and often fails to control 
it entirely.It appears rather as an especially dense transfer 
point for relations of power: between men and women, young 
people and old people, parents and offspring, teachers and 
students, priests and laity, an administration and a popula¬ 
tion.Sexuality is not the most intractable element in power 
relations, but rather one of those endowed with the greatest 
instrumentality: useful for the greatest number of maneuvers 
and capable of serving as a point of support, as a linchpin, 
for the most varied strategies.
