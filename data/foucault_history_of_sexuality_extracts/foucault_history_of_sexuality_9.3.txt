A hysterization of women’s bodies: a threefold process 
whereby the feminine body was analyzed—qualified and dis¬ 
qualified—as being thoroughly saturated with sexuality; 
whereby it was integrated into the sphere of medical prac¬ 
tices, by reason of a pathology intrinsic to it; whereby, finally, 
it was placed in organic communication with the social body 
(whose regulated fecundity it was supposed to ensure), the 
family space (of which it had to be a substantial and func¬ 
tional element), and the life of children (which it produced 
and had to guarantee, by virtue of a biologico-moral respon¬ 
sibility lasting through the entire period of the children’s 
education): the Mother, with her negative image of “nervous 
woman,” constituted the most visible form of this hysteriza¬ 
tion.2.A pedagogization of children's sex: a double assertion 
that practically all children indulge or are prone to indulge 
in sexual activity; and that, being unwarranted, at the same 
time “natural” and “contrary to nature,” this sexual activity 
posed physical and moral, individual and collective dangers; 
children were defined as “preliminary” sexual beings, on this 
side of sex, yet within it, astride a dangerous dividing line.Parents, families, educators, doctors, and eventually psy¬ 
chologists would have to take charge, in a continuous way, 
of this precious and perilous, dangerous and endangered 
sexual potential: this pedagogization was especially evident 
in the war against onanism, which in the West lasted nearly 
two centuries.3.
