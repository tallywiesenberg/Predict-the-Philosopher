couples; a political socialization achieved through the “re- 
sponsibilization” of couples with regard to the social body as 
a whole (which had to be limited or on the contrary rein¬ 
vigorated), and a medical socialization carried out by at¬ 
tributing a pathogenic value—for the individual and the spe¬ 
cies—to birth-control practices.4.A psychiatrization of perverse pleasure: the sexual in¬ 
stinct was isolated as a separate biological and psychical 
instinct; a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of 
anomalies by which it could be afflicted; it was assigned a role 
of normalization or pathologization with respect to all be¬ 
havior; and finally, a corrective technology was sought for 
these anomalies.Four figures emerged from this preoccupation with sex, 
which mounted throughout the nineteenth century—four 
privileged objects of knowledge, which were also targets and 
anchorage points for the ventures of knowledge: the hysteri¬ 
cal woman, the masturbating child, the Malthusian couple, 
and the perverse adult.Each of them corresponded to one of 
these strategies which, each in its own way, invested and 
made use of the sex of women, children, and men.
