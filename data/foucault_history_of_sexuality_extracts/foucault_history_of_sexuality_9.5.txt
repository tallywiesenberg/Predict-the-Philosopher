Particularly from the eighteenth 
century onward, Western societies created and deployed a 
new apparatus which was superimposed on the previous one, 
and which, without completely supplanting the latter, helped 
to reduce its importance.I am speaking of the deployment of 
sexuality: like the deployment of alliance, it connects up with 
the circuit of sexual partners, but in a completely different 
way.The two systems can be contrasted term by term.The 
deployment of alliance is built around a system of rules 
defining the permitted and the forbidden, the licit and the 
illicit, whereas the deployment of sexuality operates accord¬ 
ing to mobile, polymorphous, and contingent techniques of 
power.The deployment of alliance has as one of its chief 
objectives to reproduce the interplay of relations and main¬ 
tain the law that governs them; the deployment of sexuality, 
on the other hand, engenders a continual extension of areas 
and forms of control.
