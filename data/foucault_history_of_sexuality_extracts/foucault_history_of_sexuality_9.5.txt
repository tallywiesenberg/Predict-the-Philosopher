augment, through the wisdom of its regulations, the internal 
power of the state; and since this power consists not only in 
the Republic in general, and in each of the members who

belonging to it, it follows that the police must concern them¬

knowledge they have of those different assets.” 10 A policing

problem: population as wealth, population as manpower or

and the resources it commanded. Governments perceived

rate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate 
births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the 
ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmar-
