“Sexuality” was taking 
shape, born of a technology of power that was originally 
focused on alliance.Since then, it has not ceased to operate 
in conjunction with a system of alliance on which it has 
depended for support.The family cell, in the form in which 
it came to be valued in the course of the eighteenth century, 
made it possible for the main elements of the deployment of 
sexuality (the feminine body, infantile precocity, the regula¬ 
tion of births, and to a lesser extent no doubt, the specifica¬ 
tion of the perverted) to develop along its two primary 
dimensions: the husband-wife axis and the parents-children 
axis.The family, in its contemporary form, must not be 
understood as a social, economic, and political structure of 
alliance that excludes or at least restrains sexuality, that 
diminishes it as much as possible, preserving only its useful 
functions.On the contrary, its role is to anchor sexuality and 
provide it with a permanent support.
