It is manifested as a thing that is strictly forbidden 
in the family insofar as the latter functions as a deployment 
of alliance; but it is also a thing that is continuously de¬ 
manded in order for the family to be a hotbed of constant 
sexual incitement.If for more than a century the West has 
displayed such a strong interest in the prohibition of incest, 
if more or less by common accord it has been seen as a social 
universal and one of the points through which every society 
is obliged to pass on the way to becoming a culture, perhaps 
this is because it was found to be a means of self-defense, not 
against an incestuous desire, but against the expansion and 
the implications of this deployment of sexuality which had 
been set up, but which, among its its many benefits, had the 
disadvantage of ignoring the laws and juridical forms of 
alliance.By asserting that all societies without exception, 
and consequently our own, were subject to this rule of rules, 
one guaranteed that this deployment of sexuality, whose 
strange effects were beginning to be felt—among them, the 
affective intensification of the family space—would not be 
able to escape from the grand and ancient system of alliance.Thus the law would be secure, even in the new mechanics of 
power.For this is the paradox of a society which, from the 
eighteenth century to the present, has created so many tech¬ 
nologies of power that are foreign to the concept of law: it 
fears the effects and proliferations of those technologies and 
attempts to recode them in forms of law.
