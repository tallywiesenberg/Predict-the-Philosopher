If one considers the 
threshold of all culture to be prohibited incest, then sexuality

The History of Sexuality 


has been, from the dawn of time, under the sway of law and 
right.By devoting so much effort to an endless reworking of 
the transcultural theory of the incest taboo, anthropology 
has proved worthy of the whole modern deployment of sexu¬ 
ality and the theoretical discourses it generates.What has taken place since the seventeenth century can be 
interpreted in the following manner: the deployment of 
sexuality which first developed on the fringes of familial 
institutions (in the direction of conscience and pedagogy, for 
example) gradually became focused on the family: the alien, 
irreducible, and even perilous effects it held in store for the 
deployment of alliance (an awareness of this danger was 
evidenced in the criticism often directed at the indiscretion 
of the directors, and in the entire controversy, which oc¬ 
curred somewhat later, over the private or public, institu¬ 
tional or familial education of children 2 ) were absorbed by 
the family, a family that was reorganized, restricted no 
doubt, and in any case intensified in comparison with the 
functions it formerly exercised in the deployment of alliance.In the family, parents and relatives became the chief agents 
of a deployment of sexuality which drew its outside support 
from doctors, educators, and later psychiatrists, and which 
began by competing with the relations of alliance but soon 
“psychologized” or “psychiatrized” the latter.Then these 
new personages made their appearance: the nervous woman, 
the frigid wife, the indifferent mother—or worse, the mother 
beset by murderous obsessions—the impotent, sadistic, 
perverse husband, the hysterical or neurasthenic girl, the 
precocious and already exhausted child, and the young 
homosexual who rejects marriage or neglects his wife.
