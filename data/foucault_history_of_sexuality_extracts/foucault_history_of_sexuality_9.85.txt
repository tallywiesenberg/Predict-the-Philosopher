system to assert its prerogatives in the order of sexuality.Then a pressing demand emanated from the family: a 
plea for help in reconciling these unfortunate conflicts be¬

this deployment of sexuality which had invested it from

form, the family broadcast the long complaint of its sex¬ 
ual suffering to doctors, educators, psychiatrists, priests, 
and pastors, to all the “experts” who would listen.It was

what had always been hinted at and inculcated in it: the 
family, the keystone of alliance, was the germ of all the 
misfortunes of sex.And lo and behold, from the mid¬ 
nineteenth century onward, the family engaged in search¬ 
ing out the slightest traces of sexuality in its midst, 
wrenching from itself the most difficult confessions, solic¬ 
iting an audience with everyone who might know some¬ 
thing about the matter, and opening itself unreservedly to 
endless examination.
