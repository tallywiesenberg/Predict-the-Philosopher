The family was the crystal in the de¬ 
ployment of sexuality: it seemed to be the source of a sex¬ 
uality which it actually only reflected and diffracted.By 
virtue of its permeability, and through that process of re¬ 
flections to the outside, it became one of the most valu¬ 
able tactical components of the deployment.But this development was not without its tensions and 
problems.Charcot doubtless constituted a central figure in 
this as well.For many years he was the most noteworthy of 
all those to whom families, burdened down as they were with 
this sexuality that saturated them, appealed for mediation 
and treatment.
