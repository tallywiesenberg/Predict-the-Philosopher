the system of alliance, in order to deal with it directly 
through a medical practice whose technicity and autonomy 
were guaranteed by the neurological model.Medicine thus 
assumed final responsibility, according to the rules of a spe¬ 
cific knowledge, for a sexuality which it had in fact urged 
families to concern themselves with as an essential task and 
a major danger.Moreover, Charcot noted on several occa¬ 
sions how difficult it was for families to “yield” the patient 
whom they nonetheless had brought to the doctor, how they 
laid siege to the mental hospitals where the subject was being 
kept out of view, and the ways in which they were constantly 
interfering with the doctor’s work.Their worry was unwar¬ 
ranted, however: the therapist only intervened in order to 
return to them individuals who were sexually compatible 
with the family system; and while this intervention manipu¬ 
lated the sexual body, it did not authorize the latter to define 
itself in explicit discourse.
