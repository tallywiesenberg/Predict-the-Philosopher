The Moral 
Pro b lema tization 
of Pleasures 





One would have a difficult time finding among the Greeks 
(or the Romans either, for that matter) anything resembling 
the notion of “sexuality” or “flesh.” I mean a notion that 
refers to a single entity and allows diverse phenomena to be 
grouped together, despite the apparently loose connections 
between them, as if they were of the same nature, derived from 
the same origin, or brought the same type of causal mech¬ 
anisms into play: behaviors, but also sensations, images, 
desires, instincts, passions. 1 

Of course the Greeks had a whole stock of words available 
for designating different actions or acts that we call “sexual.” 
They had a vocabulary for referring to specific practices; they 
had vaguer terms that referred in a general way to what we 
call sexual “intercourse,” “union,” or “relations”: for exam¬ 
ple, synousia, homilia, plesiasmos, mixis, ocheia. But the blan¬ 
ket category that covered all these actions, acts, and practices 
is much more difficult to grasp. The Greeks were fond of using 
a nominalized adjective: ta aphrodisia, 2 which the Romans 
translated roughly as venerea. “Things” or “pleasures of 
love,” “sexual relations,” “carnal acts,” “sensual pleasures”— 
one renders the term as best one can, but the difference be¬ 
tween the notional sets, theirs and ours, makes it hard to 
translate precisely. Our idea of “sexuality” does not just cover 
a wider area; it applies to a reality of another type, and it 
functions quite differently in our morals and knowledge. 
Moreover, we do not have a concept that specifies and sub¬ 
sumes a set analogous to that of aphrodisia. Perhaps I will be 
excused if occasionally I leave the Greek term in its original 
form. 

I do not aim in this section to give an exhaustive account,

The Use of Pleasure 


or even a systematic summary, of the different philosophical 
or medical doctrines that dealt in one way or another, from 
the fifth century to the beginning of the third, with pleasure 
in general and with sexual pleasures in particular. Preliminary 
to studying the four types of stylization of sexual conduct that 
were developed in a dietetics concerned with the body, an 
economics concerned with marriage, an erotics concerned 
with the subject of boys, and a philosophy concerned with 
truth, I intend simply to bring out a few general traits that 
served as a framework for them, seeing that these traits were 
common to the different reflections on the aphrodisia. One can 
grant the familiar proposition that the Greeks of that epoch 
accepted certain sexual behaviors much more readily than the 
Christians of the Middle Ages or the Europeans of the modern 
period; one can also grant that laxity and misconduct in this 
regard provoked less scandal back then and made one liable 
to less recrimination, especially as there was no institution— 
whether pastoral or medical—that claimed the right to deter¬ 
mine what was permitted or forbidden, normal or abnormal, 
in this area; one can also grant that the Greeks attributed 
much less importance to all these questions than we do. But 
once all that is granted or assumed, one point still remains 
irreducible: they nonetheless concerned themselves with such 
matters, and there were Greek thinkers, moralists, philoso¬ 
phers, and doctors who believed that what the laws of the city 
prescribed or prohibited, what the general customs tolerated 
or rejected, could not suffice to regulate properly the sexual 
conduct of a man who cared about himself. The manner in 
which this kind of pleasure was enjoyed was considered by 
them to be an ethical problem. 

What I would like to define in the next few pages are just 
those general aspects which their preoccupation with these 
questions shared; that is, the general form of the moral inquiry 
that they pursued concerning the aphrodisia. And for this we 
will need to consult texts that are radically different from one 
another—essentially those of Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle.
