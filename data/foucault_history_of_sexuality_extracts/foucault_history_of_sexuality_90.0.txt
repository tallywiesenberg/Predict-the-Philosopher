The Moral 
Pro b lema tization 
of Pleasures 





One would have a difficult time finding among the Greeks 
(or the Romans either, for that matter) anything resembling 
the notion of “sexuality” or “flesh.” I mean a notion that 
refers to a single entity and allows diverse phenomena to be 
grouped together, despite the apparently loose connections 
between them, as if they were of the same nature, derived from 
the same origin, or brought the same type of causal mech¬ 
anisms into play: behaviors, but also sensations, images, 
desires, instincts, passions. 1 

Of course the Greeks had a whole stock of words available 
for designating different actions or acts that we call “sexual.” 
They had a vocabulary for referring to specific practices; they 
had vaguer terms that referred in a general way to what we 
call sexual “intercourse,” “union,” or “relations”: for exam¬ 
ple, synousia, homilia, plesiasmos, mixis, ocheia. But the blan¬ 
ket category that covered all these actions, acts, and practices 
is much more difficult to grasp. The Greeks were fond of using 
a nominalized adjective: ta aphrodisia, 2 which the Romans 
translated roughly as venerea. “Things” or “pleasures of 
love,” “sexual relations,” “carnal acts,” “sensual pleasures”— 
one renders the term as best one can, but the difference be¬ 
tween the notional sets, theirs and ours, makes it hard to 
translate precisely. Our idea of “sexuality” does not just cover 
a wider area; it applies to a reality of another type, and it 
functions quite differently in our morals and knowledge. 
Moreover, we do not have a concept that specifies and sub¬ 
sumes a set analogous to that of aphrodisia. Perhaps I will be 
excused if occasionally I leave the Greek term in its original 
form. 

I do not aim in this section to give an exhaustive account,
