might give each one its peculiar meaning and its differential 
value, but rather the “field of problematization” that they had 
in common and that made each of them possible. The object, 
therefore, will be to elicit, in its general features, the constitu¬ 
tion of the aphrodisia as a domain of moral concern. I will 
consider four notions that are often encountered in the reflec¬ 
tion on sexual ethics: the notion of aphrodisia, through which 
one can grasp what was recognized as the “ethical substance” 
in sexual behavior; the notion of “use,” of chresis, which 
allows one to perceive the type of subjection that the practice 
of pleasures had to undergo in order to be morally valorized; 
the notion of enkrateia, of mastery, that defines the attitude 
that was required with respect to oneself in order to make 
oneself into an ethical subject; and lastly, the notion of “mod¬ 
eration,” of sophrosyne, that characterized the ethical subject 
in his fulfillment. It should thus be possible to determine what 
structured the moral experience of sexual pleasures—its on¬ 
tology, its deontology, its ascetics, its teleology.

Aphrodisia 


The Suda gives a definition of aphrodisia that will be re¬ 
peated by Hesychius: aphrodisia are “the works, the acts of 
Aphrodite” (erga Aphrodites). Doubtless one should not ex¬ 
pect to see a very rigorous attempt at conceptualization in 
such a work as the one mentioned, but it is a fact that the 
Greeks had not evinced, either in their theoretical reflection 
or in their practical thinking, a very insistent concern for 
defining precisely what they meant by aphrodisia —whether it 
was a question of determining the nature of the thing desig¬ 
nated, of delimiting its scope, or of drawing up an inventory 
of its elements. In any case, they had nothing resembling those 
long lists of possible acts, such as one finds later in the peniten¬ 
tial books, the manuals of confession, or in works on psy¬ 
chopathology; no table that served to define what was licit, 
permitted, or normal, and to describe the vast family of pro¬ 
hibited gestures. Nor was there anything resembling the con¬ 
cern—which was so characteristic of the question of the flesh 
or of sexuality—for discovering the insidious presence of a 
power of undetermined limits and multiple masks beneath 
what appeared inoffensive or innocent. Neither classification 
nor decipherment. They might take great pains to fix the 
optimal age to marry and have children, and the best season 
for having sexual relations, but they would never say, like a 
Christian spiritual director, which gestures to make or avoid 
making, which preliminary caresses were allowed, which posi-

tion to take, or in which conditions one could interrupt the 
act. To the insufficiently prepared, Socrates recommended to 
flee from the sight of a handsome boy, even if it meant a year’s 
exile,' and the Phaedrus evokes the lover’s long struggle 
against his own desire; but nowhere is there a statement, as 
there will be in Christian spirituality, of the precautions that 
have to be taken in order to prevent desire from entering the 
soul surreptitiously, or to detect its secret traces. Even stran¬ 
ger perhaps: the doctors who set forth, in some detail, the 
elements of the aphrodisia regimen are practically silent con¬ 
cerning the forms that the acts themselves may take; they say 
very little—aside from a few references to the “natural posi¬ 
tion”—regarding what is in accord with or contrary to the will 
of nature. 

Was this due to modesty? Possibly. For, as much as we like 
to credit the Greeks with a great liberty of morals, the repre¬ 
sentation of sexual acts that they suggest in their written 
works—and even in their erotic literature—seems to have 
been characterized by a good deal of reserve,* despite the 
impression one gets from the entertainments they staged or 
from certain iconographic representations that have been 
rediscovered. 3 In any case, one does sense that Xenophon, 
Aristotle, and later Plutarch would not have thought it decent 
to dispense the sort of presumptive and pragmatic advice on 
sexual relations with one’s lawful wife that the Christian au¬ 
thors lavishly distributed on the subject of conjugal pleasures. 
They were not prepared, as the directors of conscience would 
be, to regulate the process of demands and refusals, of first 
caresses, of the modalities of union, of the pleasures one ex¬ 
perienced and the conclusion they should properly be given. 
But there was a positive reason for this attitude that we may 
perceive retrospectively as “reticence” or “reserve.” It was 
due to their conception of the aphrodisia, to the kind of ques¬ 
tioning they directed to them, which was not oriented in the
