might give each one its peculiar meaning and its differential 
value, but rather the “field of problematization” that they had 
in common and that made each of them possible. The object, 
therefore, will be to elicit, in its general features, the constitu¬ 
tion of the aphrodisia as a domain of moral concern. I will 
consider four notions that are often encountered in the reflec¬ 
tion on sexual ethics: the notion of aphrodisia, through which 
one can grasp what was recognized as the “ethical substance” 
in sexual behavior; the notion of “use,” of chresis, which 
allows one to perceive the type of subjection that the practice 
of pleasures had to undergo in order to be morally valorized; 
the notion of enkrateia, of mastery, that defines the attitude 
that was required with respect to oneself in order to make 
oneself into an ethical subject; and lastly, the notion of “mod¬ 
eration,” of sophrosyne, that characterized the ethical subject 
in his fulfillment. It should thus be possible to determine what 
structured the moral experience of sexual pleasures—its on¬ 
tology, its deontology, its ascetics, its teleology.

Aphrodisia 


The Suda gives a definition of aphrodisia that will be re¬ 
peated by Hesychius: aphrodisia are “the works, the acts of 
Aphrodite” (erga Aphrodites). Doubtless one should not ex¬ 
pect to see a very rigorous attempt at conceptualization in 
such a work as the one mentioned, but it is a fact that the 
Greeks had not evinced, either in their theoretical reflection 
or in their practical thinking, a very insistent concern for 
defining precisely what they meant by aphrodisia —whether it 
was a question of determining the nature of the thing desig¬ 
nated, of delimiting its scope, or of drawing up an inventory 
of its elements. In any case, they had nothing resembling those 
long lists of possible acts, such as one finds later in the peniten¬ 
tial books, the manuals of confession, or in works on psy¬ 
chopathology; no table that served to define what was licit, 
permitted, or normal, and to describe the vast family of pro¬ 
hibited gestures. Nor was there anything resembling the con¬ 
cern—which was so characteristic of the question of the flesh 
or of sexuality—for discovering the insidious presence of a 
power of undetermined limits and multiple masks beneath 
what appeared inoffensive or innocent. Neither classification 
nor decipherment. They might take great pains to fix the 
optimal age to marry and have children, and the best season 
for having sexual relations, but they would never say, like a
