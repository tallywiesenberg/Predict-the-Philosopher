The Use of Pleasure 


least toward the search for their profound nature, their 
canonical forms, or their secret potential. 

1. The aphrodisia are the acts, gestures, and contacts that 
produce a certain form of pleasure. When Saint Augustine in 
his Confessions recalls the friendships of his youth, the inten¬ 
sity of his affections, the pleasures of the days spent together, 
the conversations, the enthusiasms and good times, he won¬ 
ders if, underneath its seeming innocence, all that did not 
pertain to the flesh, to that “glue” which attaches us to the 
flesh. 4 But when Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics wants to 
determine exactly which people deserve to be called “self- 
indulgent,” his definition is cautiously restrictive: self-indul¬ 
gence— akolasia —relates only to the pleasures of the body; 
and among these, the pleasures of sight, hearing, and smell 
must be excluded. 5 It is not self-indulgent to “delight in” 
(charein) colors, shapes, or paintings, nor in theater or music; 
one can, without self-indulgence, delight in the scent of fruit, 
roses, or incense; and, he says in the Eudemian Ethics, 6 any¬ 
one who would become so intensely absorbed in looking at a 
statue or in listening to a song as to lose his appetite or taste 
for lovemaking could not be reproached for self-indulgence, 
any more than could someone who let himself be seduced by 
the Sirens. For there is pleasure that is liable to akolasia only 
where there is touch and contact: contact with the mouth, the 
tongue, and the throat (for the pleasures of food and drink), 
or contact with other parts of the body (for the pleasure of 
sex). Moreover, Aristotle remarks that it would be unjust to 
suspect self-indulgence in the case of certain pleasures ex¬ 
perienced on the surface of the body, such as the noble pleas¬ 
ures that are produced by massages and heat in the 
gymnasium: “for the contact characteristic of the self-indul¬ 
gent man does not affect the whole body but only certain 
parts.” 7 * 

*One should, however, note the importance attributed by many Greek texts to the 
gaze and to the eyes in the genesis of desire or love; but it is not that the pleasure
