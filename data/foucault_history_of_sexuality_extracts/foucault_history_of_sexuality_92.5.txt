It will be one of the characteristic traits of the Christian 
experience of the “flesh,” and later of “sexuality,” that the 
subject is expected to exercise suspicion often, to be able to 
recognize from afar the manifestations of a stealthy, resource¬ 
ful, and dreadful power. Reading these signs will be all the 
more important as this power has the ability to cloak itself in 
many forms other than sexual acts. There is no similar suspi¬ 
cion inhabiting the experience of the aphrodisia. To be sure, 
in the teaching and the exercise of moderation, it is recom¬ 
mended to be wary of sounds, images, and scents; but this is 
not because attachment to them would be only the masked 
form of a desire whose essence is sexual: it is because there are 
musical forms capable of weakening the soul with their 
rhythms, and because there are sights capable of affecting the 
soul like a venom, and because a particular scent, a particular 
image, is apt to call up the “memory of the thing desired.” 9 
And when philosophers are laughed at for claiming to love 
only the beautiful souls of boys, they are not suspected of 
harboring murky feelings of which they may not be conscious, 
but simply of waiting for the tete-a-tete in order to slip their 
hand under the tunic of their heart’s desire. 10 

What of the form and variety of these acts? Greek natural 
history gives some descriptions, at least as concerns animals: 
Aristotle remarks that mating is not the same among all ani¬ 
mals and does not take place in the same manner." And in the 
part of Book VI of the History of Animals that deals more 
specifically with viviparous animals, he describes the different 
forms of copulation that can be observed: they vary according 
to the form and location of the organs, the position taken by 
the partners, and the duration of the act. But he also evokes 
the types of behavior that characterize the mating season: wild 

of the gaze is self-indulgent; rather, it is thought to make an opening through which 
the soul is reached. In this connection, see Xenophon’s Memorabilia. * As for the kiss, 
it was very highly valued as a physical pleasure and a communication of souls despite 
the danger it carried. As a matter of fact, an entire historical study could be under¬ 
taken on the “pleasure body” and its transformations.
