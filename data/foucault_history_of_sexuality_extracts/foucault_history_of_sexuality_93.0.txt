boars preparing for battle, elephants whose frenzy extends to 
the destruction of their keeper’s house, or stallions that group 
their females together by tracing a big circle around them 
before throwing themselves against their rivals. 12 With regard 
to the human animal, while the description of organs and their 
functioning may be detailed, the subject of sexual behavior, 
with its possible variants, is barely touched upon. Which does 
not mean, however, that there was, in Greek medicine, philos¬ 
ophy, or ethics, a zone of strict silence around the sexual 
activity of humans. It is not that people were careful to avoid 
talking about these pleasurable acts; but when they were the 
subject of questioning, what was at issue was not the form they 
assumed, it was the activity they manifested. Their dynamics 
was much more important than their morphology. 

This dynamics was defined by the movement that linked the 
aphrodisia to the pleasure that was associated with them and 
to the desire to which they gave rise. The attraction exerted 
by pleasure and the force of the desire that was directed to¬ 
ward it constituted, together with the action of the aphrodisia 
itself, a solid unity. The dissociation—or partial dissociation 
at least—of this ensemble would later become one of the basic 
features of the ethics of the flesh and the notion of sexuality. 
This dissociation was to be marked, on the one hand, by a 
certain “elision” of pleasure (a moral devaluation through the 
injunction given in the preaching by the Christian clergy 
against the pursuit of sensual pleasure as a goal of sexual 
practice; a theoretical devaluation shown by the extreme diffi¬ 
culty of finding a place for pleasure in the conception of sexu¬ 
ality); it would also be marked by an increasingly intense 
problematization of desire (in which the primordial sign of a 
fallen nature or the structure characteristic of the human 
condition would be visible). In the experience of the aphrodisia 
on the other hand, act, desire, and pleasure formed an ensem¬ 
ble whose elements were distinguishable certainly, but closely 
bound to one another. It was precisely their close linkage that 
constituted one of the essential characteristics of that form of

activity. Nature intended (for reasons we shall consider) that 
the performance of the act be associated with a pleasure, and 
it was this pleasure that gave rise to epithumia, to desire, in 
a movement that was naturally directed toward what “gives 
pleasure,” according to a principle that Aristotle cites: desire 
is always “desire for the agreeable thing” (he gar epithumia 
tou hedeos estin). 13 It is true—Plato always comes back to the 
idea—that for the Greeks there could not be desire without 
privation, without the want of the thing desired and without 
a certain amount of suffering mixed in; but the appetite, Plato 
explains in the Philebus, can be aroused only by the represen¬ 
tation, the image or the memory of the thing that gives pleas¬ 
ure; he concludes that there can be no desire except in the soul, 
for while the body is affected by privation, it is the soul and 
only the soul that can, through memory, make present the 
thing that is to be desired and thereby arouse the epithumia . 14 
Thus, what seems in fact to have formed the object of moral 
reflection for the Greeks in matters of sexual conduct was not 
exactly the act itself (considered in its different modalities), or 
desire (viewed from the standpoint of its origin or its aim), or 
even pleasure (evaluated according to the different objects or 
practices that can cause it); it was more the dynamics that 
joined all three in a circular fashion (the desire that leads to 
the act, the act that is linked to pleasure, and the pleasure that 
occasions desire). The ethical question that was raised was 
not: which desires? which acts? which pleasures? but rather: 
with what force is one transported “by the pleasures and 
desires”? The ontology to which this ethics of sexual behavior 
referred was not, at least not in its general form, an ontology 
of deficiency and desire; it was not that of a nature setting the 
standard for acts; it was an ontology of a force that linked 
together acts, pleasures, and desires. It was this dynamic rela¬ 
tionship that constituted what might be called the texture of 
the ethical experience of the aphrodisia. * 

*The frequency of expressions that link pleasures and desires very closely together 
should be noted. These expressions show that what is at stake in the ethical system

The Use of Pleasure 


This dynamics is analyzed in terips of two major variables. 
The first is quantitative; it has to do with the degree of activity 
that is shown by the number and frequency of acts. What 
differentiates men from one another, for medicine and moral 
philosophy alike, is not so much the type of objects toward 
which they are oriented, nor the mode of sexual practice they 
prefer; above all, it is the intensity of that practice. The divi¬
