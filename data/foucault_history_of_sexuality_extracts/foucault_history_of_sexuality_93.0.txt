boars preparing for battle, elephants whose frenzy extends to 
the destruction of their keeper’s house, or stallions that group 
their females together by tracing a big circle around them 
before throwing themselves against their rivals. 12 With regard 
to the human animal, while the description of organs and their 
functioning may be detailed, the subject of sexual behavior, 
with its possible variants, is barely touched upon. Which does 
not mean, however, that there was, in Greek medicine, philos¬ 
ophy, or ethics, a zone of strict silence around the sexual 
activity of humans. It is not that people were careful to avoid 
talking about these pleasurable acts; but when they were the 
subject of questioning, what was at issue was not the form they 
assumed, it was the activity they manifested. Their dynamics 
was much more important than their morphology. 

This dynamics was defined by the movement that linked the 
aphrodisia to the pleasure that was associated with them and 
to the desire to which they gave rise. The attraction exerted 
by pleasure and the force of the desire that was directed to¬ 
ward it constituted, together with the action of the aphrodisia 
itself, a solid unity. The dissociation—or partial dissociation 
at least—of this ensemble would later become one of the basic 
features of the ethics of the flesh and the notion of sexuality. 
This dissociation was to be marked, on the one hand, by a 
certain “elision” of pleasure (a moral devaluation through the 
injunction given in the preaching by the Christian clergy 
against the pursuit of sensual pleasure as a goal of sexual 
practice; a theoretical devaluation shown by the extreme diffi¬ 
culty of finding a place for pleasure in the conception of sexu¬ 
ality); it would also be marked by an increasingly intense 
problematization of desire (in which the primordial sign of a 
fallen nature or the structure characteristic of the human 
condition would be visible). In the experience of the aphrodisia 
on the other hand, act, desire, and pleasure formed an ensem¬ 
ble whose elements were distinguishable certainly, but closely 
bound to one another. It was precisely their close linkage that 
constituted one of the essential characteristics of that form of

activity. Nature intended (for reasons we shall consider) that 
the performance of the act be associated with a pleasure, and 
it was this pleasure that gave rise to epithumia, to desire, in
