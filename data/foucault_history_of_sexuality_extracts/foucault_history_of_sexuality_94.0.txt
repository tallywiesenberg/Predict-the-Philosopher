sion is between lesser and greater: moderation or excess. It is 
rather rare, when a notable personage is depicted, for his 
preference for one form of sexual practice or another to be 
pointed up.* On the other hand, it is always important for his 
moral characterization to note whether he has been able to 
show moderation in his involvement with women or boys, like 
Agesilaus, who carried moderation to the point that he refused 
to kiss the young man that he loved; or whether he surrend¬ 
ered, like Alcibiades or Arcesilaus, to the appetite for the 
pleasures that one can enjoy with both sexes. 18 This point is 
supported by the famous passage of the first book of the Laws: 
it is true that Plato draws a sharp opposition in this passage 
between the relationship “according to nature” that joins man 
and woman for procreative ends, and relations “against na¬ 
ture” of male with male and female with female. 19 But this 
opposition, as marked as it is from the standpoint of natural¬ 
ness, is referred by Plato to the more basic distinction between 
self-restraint and self-indulgence. The practices that contra¬ 
vene nature and the principle of procreation are not explained 
as the effect of an abnormal nature or of a peculiar form of 
desire; they are merely the result of immoderation: “a lack of 

of the aphrodisia is the dynamic ensemble consisting of desire and pleasure associated 
with the act. The epithumiai-hedonai pair occurs quite commonly in Plato . 15 Fre¬ 
quent, too, are expressions that speak of pleasure as a force that persuades, transports, 
triumphs, as in Xenophon’s Memorabilia . 16 

*lt sometimes happens that a man’s particular fondness for boys will be mentioned 
for narrative purposes. Xenophon does this in the Anabasis, in regard to a certain 
Episthenes. But when he draws a negative portrait of Menon, he does not reproach 
him for this kind of taste, but for misusing such pleasures: obtaining a command too 
young, or loving an overage boy while still being beardless himself . 17 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

self-restraint with regard to pleasure” (akrateia hedones) is 
their source . 20 And when, in the Timaeus, Plato declares that 
lust should be considered as the effect, not of a bad volition 
of the soul, but of a sickness of the body, this disorder is 
described in terms of a grand pathology of excess: the sperm, 
instead of remaining enclosed in the marrow and its bony 
casing, overflows and starts to stream through the whole body, 
so that the latter becomes like a tree whose vegetative power 
exceeds all limits; the individual is thus driven to distraction
