sion is between lesser and greater: moderation or excess. It is 
rather rare, when a notable personage is depicted, for his 
preference for one form of sexual practice or another to be 
pointed up.* On the other hand, it is always important for his 
moral characterization to note whether he has been able to 
show moderation in his involvement with women or boys, like 
Agesilaus, who carried moderation to the point that he refused 
to kiss the young man that he loved; or whether he surrend¬ 
ered, like Alcibiades or Arcesilaus, to the appetite for the 
pleasures that one can enjoy with both sexes. 18 This point is 
supported by the famous passage of the first book of the Laws: 
it is true that Plato draws a sharp opposition in this passage 
between the relationship “according to nature” that joins man 
and woman for procreative ends, and relations “against na¬ 
ture” of male with male and female with female. 19 But this 
opposition, as marked as it is from the standpoint of natural¬ 
ness, is referred by Plato to the more basic distinction between 
self-restraint and self-indulgence. The practices that contra¬ 
vene nature and the principle of procreation are not explained 
as the effect of an abnormal nature or of a peculiar form of 
desire; they are merely the result of immoderation: “a lack of 

of the aphrodisia is the dynamic ensemble consisting of desire and pleasure associated 
with the act. The epithumiai-hedonai pair occurs quite commonly in Plato . 15 Fre¬ 
quent, too, are expressions that speak of pleasure as a force that persuades, transports, 
triumphs, as in Xenophon’s Memorabilia . 16 

*lt sometimes happens that a man’s particular fondness for boys will be mentioned 
for narrative purposes. Xenophon does this in the Anabasis, in regard to a certain 
Episthenes. But when he draws a negative portrait of Menon, he does not reproach 
him for this kind of taste, but for misusing such pleasures: obtaining a command too 
young, or loving an overage boy while still being beardless himself . 17 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

self-restraint with regard to pleasure” (akrateia hedones) is 
their source . 20 And when, in the Timaeus, Plato declares that 
lust should be considered as the effect, not of a bad volition 
of the soul, but of a sickness of the body, this disorder is 
described in terms of a grand pathology of excess: the sperm, 
instead of remaining enclosed in the marrow and its bony 
casing, overflows and starts to stream through the whole body, 
so that the latter becomes like a tree whose vegetative power 
exceeds all limits; the individual is thus driven to distraction 
for a large part of his existence by “pleasures and pains in 
excess .” 21 This idea that immorality in the pleasures of sex is 
always connected with exaggeration, surplus, and excess is 
found again in the third book of the Nicomachean Ethics: 
Aristotle explains that for the natural desires that are common 
to everyone, the only offenses that one can commit are quan¬ 
titative in nature: they pertain to “the more” (to pleion); so 
that natural desire only consists in satisfying needs, “to eat or 
drink whatever offers itself till one is surfeited is to exceed the 
natural amount [ toi plethei ].” It is true that Aristotle also 
makes allowance for the particular pleasures of individuals. It 
happens that people commit different types of offenses, either 
by not taking their pleasure “where they should,” or by behav¬ 
ing “like the crowd,” or again, by not taking their pleasure “as 
they ought.” But, Aristotle adds, “self-indulgent individuals 
exceed [ hyperballousi ] in all these ways; they both delight in 
some things that they ought not to delight in, and if one ought 
to delight in some of the things they delight in, they do so 
more than one ought and than most men do.” What consti¬ 
tutes self-indulgence in this sphere is excess, “and that is 
culpable.” 22 * It appears, then, that the primary dividing 
line laid down by moral judgment in the area of sexual behav¬ 
ior was not prescribed by the nature of the act, with its possi¬ 
ble variations, but by the activity and its quantitative 
gradations. 

*It should be noted, however, that Aristotle gives his attention on several occasions 
to the question of the “disgraceful pleasures" that some individuals tend to seek.*’

The Use of Pleasure 


The practice of the pleasures was also related to another 
variable that might be labeled “role or polarity specific.” Cor¬ 
responding to the term aphrodisia was the verb aphrodisiazein. 
It refers to sexual activity in general: people thus spoke of the 
moment when animals reached an age at which they were 
capable of aphrodisiazein. 24 It also denotes the accomplish¬ 
ment of a sexual act of any kind: thus, in Xenophon, Antis- 
thenes mentions the desire to aphrodisiazein, which he 
sometimes has. 25 But the verb can also be employed in its 
active sense, in which case it relates specifically to the so-called 
“masculine” role in intercourse, and to the active function 
defined by penetration. And inversely, one can use it in its 
passive form— aphrodisiasthenai —designating in this case the
