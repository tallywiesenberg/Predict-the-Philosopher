for a large part of his existence by “pleasures and pains in 
excess .” 21 This idea that immorality in the pleasures of sex is 
always connected with exaggeration, surplus, and excess is 
found again in the third book of the Nicomachean Ethics: 
Aristotle explains that for the natural desires that are common 
to everyone, the only offenses that one can commit are quan¬ 
titative in nature: they pertain to “the more” (to pleion); so 
that natural desire only consists in satisfying needs, “to eat or 
drink whatever offers itself till one is surfeited is to exceed the 
natural amount [ toi plethei ].” It is true that Aristotle also 
makes allowance for the particular pleasures of individuals. It 
happens that people commit different types of offenses, either 
by not taking their pleasure “where they should,” or by behav¬ 
ing “like the crowd,” or again, by not taking their pleasure “as 
they ought.” But, Aristotle adds, “self-indulgent individuals 
exceed [ hyperballousi ] in all these ways; they both delight in 
some things that they ought not to delight in, and if one ought 
to delight in some of the things they delight in, they do so 
more than one ought and than most men do.” What consti¬ 
tutes self-indulgence in this sphere is excess, “and that is 
culpable.” 22 * It appears, then, that the primary dividing 
line laid down by moral judgment in the area of sexual behav¬ 
ior was not prescribed by the nature of the act, with its possi¬ 
ble variations, but by the activity and its quantitative 
gradations. 

*It should be noted, however, that Aristotle gives his attention on several occasions 
to the question of the “disgraceful pleasures" that some individuals tend to seek.*’

The Use of Pleasure 


The practice of the pleasures was also related to another 
variable that might be labeled “role or polarity specific.” Cor¬ 
responding to the term aphrodisia was the verb aphrodisiazein. 
It refers to sexual activity in general: people thus spoke of the 
moment when animals reached an age at which they were 
capable of aphrodisiazein. 24 It also denotes the accomplish¬ 
ment of a sexual act of any kind: thus, in Xenophon, Antis- 
thenes mentions the desire to aphrodisiazein, which he 
sometimes has. 25 But the verb can also be employed in its 
active sense, in which case it relates specifically to the so-called 
“masculine” role in intercourse, and to the active function 
defined by penetration. And inversely, one can use it in its 
passive form— aphrodisiasthenai —designating in this case the
