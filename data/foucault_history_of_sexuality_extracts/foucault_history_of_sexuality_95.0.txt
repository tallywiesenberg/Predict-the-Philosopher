other role in sexual union: the “passive” role of the object 
partner. This role is the one that nature had set aside for 
women—Aristotle speaks of the age at which girls become 
capable of aphrodisiasthenai ; 26 it is the role that could be 
imposed by force on someone who was thus reduced to being 
the object of the other’s pleasure; 27 it is also the role accepted 
by the boy or man who let himself be penetrated by his partner 
—the author of the Problems thus speculates about what 
causes some men to take pleasure in aphrodisiazeisthai . 28 

It is doubtless correct to say that there is no noun in the 
Greek vocabulary that would consolidate, into a common 
notion, whatever might be specific to male sexuality and fe¬ 
male sexuality. 29 But it should be remarked that in the practice 
of sexual pleasures two roles and two poles can be clearly 
distinguished, just as they can be distinguished in the repro¬ 
ductive function; these consisted of two positional values: that 
of the subject and that of the object, that of the agent and that 
of the “patient”—as Aristotle says, “the female, as female, is 
passive, and the male, as male, is active.” 30 Whereas the expe¬ 
rience of the “flesh” would be considered as an experience 
common to men and women, even if it did not take the same 
form in both, and whjle “sexuality” would be marked by the 
great caesura between male and female sexuality, the aphrodi-

si a were thought of as an activity involving two actors, each 
having its role and function—the one who performs the activ¬ 
ity and the one on whom it is performed. 

From this viewpoint, and in this ethics (always bearing in 
mind that it was a male ethics, made by and for men), it can 
be said that the dividing line fell mainly between men and 
women, for the simple reason that there was a strong differen¬ 
tiation between the world of men and that of women in many 
ancient societies. But more generally, it fell between what 
might be called the “active actors” in the drama of pleasures, 
and the “passive actors”: on one side, those who were the 
subjects of sexual activity (and who were expected to carry it 
out in a measured and opportune manner); and on the other, 
those who were the object-partners, the supporting players 
with whom it was carried out. The first were men, naturally, 
but more specifically they were adult free men; the second
