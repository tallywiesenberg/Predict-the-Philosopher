other role in sexual union: the “passive” role of the object 
partner. This role is the one that nature had set aside for 
women—Aristotle speaks of the age at which girls become 
capable of aphrodisiasthenai ; 26 it is the role that could be 
imposed by force on someone who was thus reduced to being 
the object of the other’s pleasure; 27 it is also the role accepted 
by the boy or man who let himself be penetrated by his partner 
—the author of the Problems thus speculates about what 
causes some men to take pleasure in aphrodisiazeisthai . 28 

It is doubtless correct to say that there is no noun in the 
Greek vocabulary that would consolidate, into a common 
notion, whatever might be specific to male sexuality and fe¬ 
male sexuality. 29 But it should be remarked that in the practice 
of sexual pleasures two roles and two poles can be clearly 
distinguished, just as they can be distinguished in the repro¬ 
ductive function; these consisted of two positional values: that 
of the subject and that of the object, that of the agent and that 
of the “patient”—as Aristotle says, “the female, as female, is 
passive, and the male, as male, is active.” 30 Whereas the expe¬ 
rience of the “flesh” would be considered as an experience 
common to men and women, even if it did not take the same 
form in both, and whjle “sexuality” would be marked by the 
great caesura between male and female sexuality, the aphrodi- 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

si a were thought of as an activity involving two actors, each 
having its role and function—the one who performs the activ¬ 
ity and the one on whom it is performed. 

From this viewpoint, and in this ethics (always bearing in 
mind that it was a male ethics, made by and for men), it can 
be said that the dividing line fell mainly between men and 
women, for the simple reason that there was a strong differen¬ 
tiation between the world of men and that of women in many 
ancient societies. But more generally, it fell between what 
might be called the “active actors” in the drama of pleasures, 
and the “passive actors”: on one side, those who were the 
subjects of sexual activity (and who were expected to carry it 
out in a measured and opportune manner); and on the other, 
those who were the object-partners, the supporting players 
with whom it was carried out. The first were men, naturally, 
but more specifically they were adult free men; the second 
included women of course, but women made up only one 
element of a much larger group that was sometimes referred 
to as a way of designating the objects of possible pleasure: 
“women, boys, slaves.” In the text known as the Hippocratic 
Oath, the doctor pledges to refrain from erga aphrodisia in 
every house he enters, with any person whatsoever, whether 
a woman, a free man, or a slave. 31 

Hence the second major variable that engaged moral valua¬ 
tion, in addition to the “quantity of activity” criterion, was the 
question of remaining in one’s role or abandoning it, being the 
subject of the activity or its object, joining those who under¬ 
went it—even if one was a man—or remaining with those 
who actively performed it. For a man, excess and passivity 
were the two main forms of immorality in the practice of the 
aphrodisia. 

2. While sexual activity had thus to become an object of 
moral differentiation and valuation, the reason for this was not 
that the sexual act was bad in itself, nor that it bore the mark 
of a primordial fall from grace. Even when the current form

The Use of Pleasure 


of sexual relations and love was referred back, as it was by 
Aristophanes in the Symposium, to an original tragedy involv¬ 
ing the pride of humans and punishment by the gods, neither 
the act nor pleasure was considered bad for all that; on the 
contrary, they tended toward the restoration of the highest 
state of being that man had achieved. 32 In general, sexual 
activity was perceived as natural (natural and indispensable) 
since it was through this activity that living creatures were 
able to reproduce, the species as a whole was able to escape 
extinction, 33 and cities, families, names, and religions were 
able to endure far longer than individuals, who were destined 
to pass away. The desires that led to the aphrodisia were 
classed by Plato among the most natural and necessary; and 
the pleasures that could be obtained from the aphrodisia had 
their cause, according to Aristotle, in necessary things that 
concerned the body and the life of the body in general. 34 In 
short, as Rufus of Ephesus was to point out, seeing that sexual 
activity was deeply and harmoniously grounded in nature, 
there was no way that it could be considered bad. 35 In this 
respect, the moral experience of the aphrodisia was of course
