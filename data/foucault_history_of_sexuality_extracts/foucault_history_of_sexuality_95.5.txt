included women of course, but women made up only one 
element of a much larger group that was sometimes referred 
to as a way of designating the objects of possible pleasure: 
“women, boys, slaves.” In the text known as the Hippocratic 
Oath, the doctor pledges to refrain from erga aphrodisia in 
every house he enters, with any person whatsoever, whether 
a woman, a free man, or a slave. 31 

Hence the second major variable that engaged moral valua¬ 
tion, in addition to the “quantity of activity” criterion, was the 
question of remaining in one’s role or abandoning it, being the 
subject of the activity or its object, joining those who under¬ 
went it—even if one was a man—or remaining with those 
who actively performed it. For a man, excess and passivity 
were the two main forms of immorality in the practice of the 
aphrodisia. 

2. While sexual activity had thus to become an object of 
moral differentiation and valuation, the reason for this was not 
that the sexual act was bad in itself, nor that it bore the mark 
of a primordial fall from grace. Even when the current form

the act nor pleasure was considered bad for all that; on the 
contrary, they tended toward the restoration of the highest 
state of being that man had achieved. 32 In general, sexual 
activity was perceived as natural (natural and indispensable) 
since it was through this activity that living creatures were 
able to reproduce, the species as a whole was able to escape 
extinction, 33 and cities, families, names, and religions were 
able to endure far longer than individuals, who were destined 
to pass away. The desires that led to the aphrodisia were 
classed by Plato among the most natural and necessary; and 
the pleasures that could be obtained from the aphrodisia had 
their cause, according to Aristotle, in necessary things that 
concerned the body and the life of the body in general. 34 In 
short, as Rufus of Ephesus was to point out, seeing that sexual 
activity was deeply and harmoniously grounded in nature, 
there was no way that it could be considered bad. 35 In this 
respect, the moral experience of the aphrodisia was of course
