radically different from the experience of the flesh that would 
develop later. 

But as natural and even necessary as it may have been 
considered, it was nonetheless the object of a moral concern. 
It called for a delimitation that would enable one to determine 
the proper degree and extent to which it could be practiced. 
'And yet, if it could pose questions of good and evil, this was 
not in spite of its naturalness, or because the latter might have 
been altered; it was precisely because of the way in which it 
had been organized by nature. Two traits marked the pleasure 
with which it was associated. First, there was its inferior char¬ 
acter: bearing in mind that for Aristippus and the Cyrenaics 
“pleasure does not differ from pleasure,” 36 sexual pleasure was 
generally characterized as being, not a bearer of evil, but 
ontologically or qualitatively inferior—for several reasons: it 
was common to animals and men (and thus did not constitute

a specifically human trait); it was mixed with privation and 
suffering (in contrast to the pleasures of sight and hearing); it 
depended on the body and its necessities and it was aimed at 
restoring the organism to its state prior to need. 37 But there 
was also the fact that this conditioned, subordinate, and in¬ 
ferior pleasure was extremely acute; as Plato explains at the 
beginning of the Laws, if nature arranged for men and women 
to be attracted to one another, it was in order that procreation 
might be possible and the survival of the species might be 
ensured. 38 Now, this purpose was so important and it was so 
essential that humans produce descendants, that nature at¬ 
tached an extremely intense pleasure to the act of procreation. 
Just as animals are reminded of the need to nourish them¬ 
selves, thus assuring their individual survival, by the natural 
pleasure that is associated with eating and drinking, so the 
necessity of begetting offspring, of leaving a progeny behind, 
is constantly recalled by the pleasure and the desire that ac¬ 
company the mating of the sexes. The Laws thus refers to the 
existence of three basic appetites, relating to food, drink, and 
reproduction. All three are strong, imperative, and intense, 
but the third one in particular, although “the latest to 
emerge,” is “the keenest lust.” 39 Socrates asks his interlocutor 
in the Republic whether he knows of “a greater and sharper 
pleasure than the sexual.” 40 

It was just this natural acuteness of pleasure, together with 
the attraction it exerted on desire, that caused sexual activity 
to go beyond the limits that were set by nature when she made 
the pleasure of the aphrodisia an inferior, subordinate, and 
conditioned pleasure. Because of this intensity, people were 
induced to overturn the hierarchy, placing these appetites and 
their satisfaction uppermost, and giving them absolute power 
over the soul. Also because of it, people were led to go beyond 
the satisfaction of needs and to continue looking for pleasure 
even after the body had been restored. The tendency to rebel¬ 
lion and riotousness was the “stasiastic” potential of the sex¬ 
ual appetite; and the tendency to exaggeration, to excess, was

its “hyperbolic” potential. 41 Nature had invested human be¬ 
ings with this necessary and redoubtable force, which was 
always on the point of overshooting the objective that was set 
for it. One understands why, in these conditions, sexual activ¬ 
ity required a moral discrimination that was, as we have seen, 
more dynamic than morphological. If it was necessary, as 
Plato said, to bridle it with the three strongest restraints: fear, 
law, and true reason; if it was necessary, as Aristotle thought, 
for desire to obey reason the way a child obeyed his tutor; if 
Aristippus himself advised that, while it was all right to “use” 
pleasures, one had to be careful not to be carried away by 
them 42 —the reason was not that sexual activity was a vice, nor 
that it might deviate from a canonical model; it was because 
sexual activity was associated with a force, an energeia, that 
was itself liable to be excessive. In the Christian doctrine of 
the flesh, the excessive force of pleasure had its principle in the 
Fall and in the weakness that had marked human nature ever 
since. For classical Greek thought, this force was potentially 
excessive by nature, and the moral question was how to con¬ 
front this force, how to control it and regulate its economy in 
a suitable way. 

The fact that sexual activity appeared in the form of a play 
of forces established by nature, but subject to abuse, related 
it to eating and the moral problems the latter tended to pose. 
This association between the ethics of sex and the ethics of the 
table was a constant factor in ancient culture. One could find 
countless examples of it. When, in the first book of the
