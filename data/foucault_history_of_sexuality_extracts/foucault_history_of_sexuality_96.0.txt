radically different from the experience of the flesh that would 
develop later. 

But as natural and even necessary as it may have been 
considered, it was nonetheless the object of a moral concern. 
It called for a delimitation that would enable one to determine 
the proper degree and extent to which it could be practiced. 
'And yet, if it could pose questions of good and evil, this was 
not in spite of its naturalness, or because the latter might have 
been altered; it was precisely because of the way in which it 
had been organized by nature. Two traits marked the pleasure 
with which it was associated. First, there was its inferior char¬ 
acter: bearing in mind that for Aristippus and the Cyrenaics 
“pleasure does not differ from pleasure,” 36 sexual pleasure was 
generally characterized as being, not a bearer of evil, but 
ontologically or qualitatively inferior—for several reasons: it 
was common to animals and men (and thus did not constitute

a specifically human trait); it was mixed with privation and 
suffering (in contrast to the pleasures of sight and hearing); it 
depended on the body and its necessities and it was aimed at 
restoring the organism to its state prior to need. 37 But there 
was also the fact that this conditioned, subordinate, and in¬ 
ferior pleasure was extremely acute; as Plato explains at the 
beginning of the Laws, if nature arranged for men and women 
to be attracted to one another, it was in order that procreation 
might be possible and the survival of the species might be 
ensured. 38 Now, this purpose was so important and it was so 
essential that humans produce descendants, that nature at¬ 
tached an extremely intense pleasure to the act of procreation. 
Just as animals are reminded of the need to nourish them¬ 
selves, thus assuring their individual survival, by the natural 
pleasure that is associated with eating and drinking, so the 
necessity of begetting offspring, of leaving a progeny behind, 
is constantly recalled by the pleasure and the desire that ac¬ 
company the mating of the sexes. The Laws thus refers to the 
existence of three basic appetites, relating to food, drink, and 
reproduction. All three are strong, imperative, and intense, 
but the third one in particular, although “the latest to 
emerge,” is “the keenest lust.” 39 Socrates asks his interlocutor 
in the Republic whether he knows of “a greater and sharper 
pleasure than the sexual.” 40
