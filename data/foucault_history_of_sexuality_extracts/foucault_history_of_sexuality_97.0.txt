Memorabilia, he wants to show how useful Socrates was to his 
disciples, by his example and his observations, Xenophon sets 
forth the precepts and conduct of his master “concerning 
eating and drinking and the pleasures of love.” 43 The inter¬ 
locutors of the Republic, when they deal with the education 
of guardians, come to agree that moderation (sophrosyne) 
demands the threefold mastery of the pleasures of drink, sex, 
and food (potoi, aphrodisia, edodai ). 44 And Aristotle follows 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

suit: in the Nicomachean Ethics, the three examples he gives 
of “common pleasures” are those of eating, drinking, and, for 
youths and vigorous men, the “pleasures of the bed.” 45 In 
these three forms of pleasure, he recognizes the same type of 
danger: that of exceeding what is necessary; he even identifies 
a physiological principle that they hold in common, noting 
pleasures of contact and touch in all three (according to him, 
food and drink do not cause their particular pleasure except 
by coming in contact with the tongue and especially the 
throat). 46 When he speaks in the Symposium, the doctor Eryx- 
imachus claims for his art the prerogative of advising on the 
manner in which one must make use of the pleasures of the 
bed and the table; according to him, it is doctors who ought 
to say how to enjoy rich food without making oneself sick; it 
also rests with them to prescribe, to those who practice physi¬ 
cal love—Eros Pandemos—how to have an orgasm without 
any resulting ill effects. 44 

It would be interesting, surely, to trace the long history of 
the connections between alimentary ethics and sexual ethics, 
as manifested in doctrines, but also in religious rituals and 
dietary rules; one would need to discover how, over a long 
period of time, the play of alimentary prescriptions became 
uncoupled from that of sexual morals, by following the evolu¬ 
tion of their respective importance (with the rather belated 
moment, no doubt, when the problem of sexual conduct be¬ 
came more worrisome than that of alimentary behaviors) and 
the gradual differentiation of their specific structure (the mo¬ 
ment when sexual desire began to be questioned in terms other 
than alimentary appetite). In any case, in the reflection of the 
Greeks in the classical period, it does seem that the moral 
problematization of food, drink, and sexual activity was car¬ 
ried out in a rather similar manner. Foods, wines, and rela¬ 
tions with women and boys constituted analogous ethical 
material; they brought forces into play that were natural, but 
that always tended to be excessive; and they all raised the

The Use of Pleasure 


same question: how could one, how must one “make use” 
(chresthai) of this dynamics of pleasures, desires, and acts? 
A question of right use. As Aristotle expresses it, “all men 
enjoy in some way or another both savoury foods and wines 
and sexual intercourse, but not all men do so as they ought 
[ouch' hos dei].”**

Chresis 


How does a man enjoy his pleasure “as one ought”? To 
what principles does he refer in order to moderate, limit, 
regulate that activity? What sort of validity might these princi¬ 
ples have that would enable a man to justify his having to obey 
them? Or, in other words, what is the mode of subjection that 
is implied in this moral problematization of sexual conduct? 

The goal of moral reflection on the aphrodisia was much 
less to establish a systematic code that would determine the 
canonical form of sexual acts, trace out the boundary of the 
prohibitions, and assign practices to one side or the other of 
a dividing line, than to work out the conditions and modalities 
of a “use”; that is, to define a style for what the Greeks called 
chresis aphrodision, the use of pleasures. The common expres¬ 
sion chresis aphrodision related, in a general way, to sexual 
activity (for example, people would speak of times of the year 
or the age in one’s life when it was good to chresthai aphrodisi- 
ois).' But the term also referred to the manner in which an 
individual managed his sexual activity, his way of conducting 
himself in such matters, the regimen he allowed himself or 
imposed on himself, the conditions in which he accomplished 
sexual acts, the share he allotted them in his life.* It was not
