The Use of Pleasure 


same question: how could one, how must one “make use” 
(chresthai) of this dynamics of pleasures, desires, and acts? 
A question of right use. As Aristotle expresses it, “all men 
enjoy in some way or another both savoury foods and wines 
and sexual intercourse, but not all men do so as they ought 
[ouch' hos dei].”**

Chresis 


How does a man enjoy his pleasure “as one ought”? To 
what principles does he refer in order to moderate, limit, 
regulate that activity? What sort of validity might these princi¬ 
ples have that would enable a man to justify his having to obey 
them? Or, in other words, what is the mode of subjection that 
is implied in this moral problematization of sexual conduct? 

The goal of moral reflection on the aphrodisia was much 
less to establish a systematic code that would determine the 
canonical form of sexual acts, trace out the boundary of the 
prohibitions, and assign practices to one side or the other of 
a dividing line, than to work out the conditions and modalities 
of a “use”; that is, to define a style for what the Greeks called 
chresis aphrodision, the use of pleasures. The common expres¬ 
sion chresis aphrodision related, in a general way, to sexual 
activity (for example, people would speak of times of the year 
or the age in one’s life when it was good to chresthai aphrodisi- 
ois).' But the term also referred to the manner in which an 
individual managed his sexual activity, his way of conducting 
himself in such matters, the regimen he allowed himself or 
imposed on himself, the conditions in which he accomplished 
sexual acts, the share he allotted them in his life.* It was not
