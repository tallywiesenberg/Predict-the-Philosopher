•Plato talks about the right “possession and practice” (ktesis te kai chreia) of women 
and children, so that what was at issue was the whole range of relationships and forms 
of relations that one could have with them . 2 Polybius speaks of the chreia aphrodisi¬ 
on which, along with indulgence in luxurious clothes and food, characterized the 
habits of hereditary rulers and provoked discontent and revolution . 1

The Use of Pleasure 


a question of what was permitted or forbidden among the 
desires that one felt or the acts that one committed, but of 
prudence, reflection, and calculation in the way one dis¬ 
tributed and controlled his acts. In the use of pleasures, while 
it was necessary to respect the laws and customs of the land, 
to keep from offending the gods, and to heed the will of nature, 
the moral rules to which one conformed were far removed 
from anything that might form a clearly defined code. * It was 
much more a question of a variable adjustment in which one 
had to take different factors into account: the element of want 
and natural necessity; that of opportuneness, which was tem¬ 
poral and circumstantial; that of the status of the individual 
himself. Chresis had to be decided on the basis of these differ¬ 
ent considerations. Thus, one can see a threefold strategy at 
work in this reflection on the use of pleasures: that of need, 
timeliness, and status. 

1. The strategy of need. The scandalous gesture of Dioge¬ 
nes is well known: when he needed to satisfy his sexual appe¬ 
tite, he would relieve himself in the marketplace. 5 Like many 
of the Cynics’ provocations, this one had a double meaning. 
It owed its impact to the public character of the act, of course, 
which went against every convention in Greece; it was cus¬ 
tomary to assert the need for privacy as a reason for making 
love only at night, and the care one took not to let oneself be 
seen engaging in this kind of activity was regarded as a sign 
that the practice of aphrodisia was not something that hon¬ 
ored the most noble qualities of mankind. It was against this 
rule of privacy that Diogenes directed his “performance” criti¬ 
cism. Diogenes Laertius reports that in fact he was in the habit 
of “doing everything in public, the works of Demeter and 
Aphrodite alike,” reasoning as follows: “If breakfast be not 
absurd, neither is it absurd to breakfast in the market-place.” 6 
But this parallel with food gave Diogenes’ action an additional

with regard to the pleasures of the body “as the nomos requires .” 4 



The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

meaning: the practice of the aphrodisia, which could not be 
shameful since it was natural, was nothing more or less than 
the satisfaction of a need; and just as the Cynic looked for the 
simplest food that might gratify his stomach (it seems that he 
tried eating raw meat), he likewise found in masturbation the 
most direct means of appeasing his sexual appetite. He even 
regretted that it was not possible to satisfy hunger and thirst 
in so simple a manner: “Would to heaven that it were enough 
to rub one’s stomach in order to allay one’s hunger.” 

In this, Diogenes was only pushing to its logical extreme 
one of the great precepts of the chresis aphrodision. He was 
reducing to a minimum the behavior that Antisthenes had 
already advocated in Xenophon’s Symposium: “If I ever feel 
a natural desire to have sex with women, I am so well satisfied 
with whatever chance puts in my way that those to whom I 
make my advances are more than glad to welcome me because 
they have no one else to consort with them. In a word, all these 
items appeal to me as being so conducive to enjoyment that 
I could not pray for greater pleasure in performing any one 
of them, but could pray rather for less—so much more plea¬ 
surable do I regard some of them than is good for one.” 7 
Antisthenes’ regimen is not very far removed in principle 
(even if the practical consequences are quite different) from 
several precepts or examples that Socrates, according to Xeno¬ 
phon, gave to his disciples. For if he recommended that those 
who were insufficiently fortified against the pleasures of love 
flee from the sight of beautiful boys, and go into exile if neces¬ 
sary, he did not in any case advocate a total, definitive, and 
unconditional abstention. The Socratic lesson, at least as 
Xenophon presents it, was that people should “limit them¬ 
selves to such indulgence as the soul would reject unless the 
need of the body were pressing, and such as would do no harm 
when the need was there.” 8 

But in this need-regulated use of the aphrodisia, the objec¬ 
tive was not to reduce pleasure to nothing; on the contrary,
