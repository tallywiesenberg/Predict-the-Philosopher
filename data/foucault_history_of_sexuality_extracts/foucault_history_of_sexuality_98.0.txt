•Plato talks about the right “possession and practice” (ktesis te kai chreia) of women 
and children, so that what was at issue was the whole range of relationships and forms 
of relations that one could have with them . 2 Polybius speaks of the chreia aphrodisi¬ 
on which, along with indulgence in luxurious clothes and food, characterized the 
habits of hereditary rulers and provoked discontent and revolution . 1

The Use of Pleasure 


a question of what was permitted or forbidden among the 
desires that one felt or the acts that one committed, but of 
prudence, reflection, and calculation in the way one dis¬ 
tributed and controlled his acts. In the use of pleasures, while 
it was necessary to respect the laws and customs of the land, 
to keep from offending the gods, and to heed the will of nature, 
the moral rules to which one conformed were far removed 
from anything that might form a clearly defined code. * It was 
much more a question of a variable adjustment in which one 
had to take different factors into account: the element of want 
and natural necessity; that of opportuneness, which was tem¬ 
poral and circumstantial; that of the status of the individual 
himself. Chresis had to be decided on the basis of these differ¬ 
ent considerations. Thus, one can see a threefold strategy at 
work in this reflection on the use of pleasures: that of need, 
timeliness, and status. 

1. The strategy of need. The scandalous gesture of Dioge¬ 
nes is well known: when he needed to satisfy his sexual appe¬ 
tite, he would relieve himself in the marketplace. 5 Like many 
of the Cynics’ provocations, this one had a double meaning. 
It owed its impact to the public character of the act, of course, 
which went against every convention in Greece; it was cus¬ 
tomary to assert the need for privacy as a reason for making 
love only at night, and the care one took not to let oneself be 
seen engaging in this kind of activity was regarded as a sign 
that the practice of aphrodisia was not something that hon¬ 
ored the most noble qualities of mankind. It was against this 
rule of privacy that Diogenes directed his “performance” criti¬ 
cism. Diogenes Laertius reports that in fact he was in the habit 
of “doing everything in public, the works of Demeter and 
Aphrodite alike,” reasoning as follows: “If breakfast be not 
absurd, neither is it absurd to breakfast in the market-place.” 6
