need that awakened desire. Everyone knew that pleasure was 
dulled if it offered no satisfaction to the keenness of a desire: 
“To my friends, meat and drink bring sweet and simple enjoy¬ 
ment [hedeia . . . apolausis apragmon]," 1 says Virtue in Prodi- 
cus’ speech as reported by Socrates, “for they wait till they 
crave them.’’ 9 And in a discussion with Euthydemus, Socrates 
remarks that “hunger or thirst or desire [aphrodision epi- 
thumia] or lack of sleep are the sole causes of pleasure in 
eating and drinking and sexual indulgence, and in resting or 
sleeping, after a time of waiting and resistance until the mo¬ 
ment comes when these will give the greatest possible satisfac¬ 
tion [hos eni hedista]." 10 But if pleasure must be sustained 
through desire, this did not mean that, conversely, desires 
must be increased by recourse to pleasures that were not of a 
natural kind. It is fatigue, says Prodicus, and not continuous 
idleness, that ought to make one feel like sleeping; and if it was 
proper to satisfy sexual desires when they appeared, it was not 
good to create desires that went beyond needs. Need ought to 
serve as a guiding principle in this strategy, which clearly 
could never take the form of a precise codification or a law 
applicable to everyone alike in every circumstance. The strat¬ 
egy made possible an equilibrium in the dynamics of pleasure 
and desire: it kept this dynamics from “running away,” from 
becoming excessive, by setting the satisfaction of a need as its 
internal limit; and it prevented this natural force from revolt¬ 
ing, from usurping a place that was not its own, because it 
provided only for what was necessary to the body and was 
intended by nature, and nothing more. 

At the same time it enabled one to avoid immoderation, 
which was, strictly speaking, a behavior that did not have its 
basis in nature. It was for this reason that it could assume two 
forms against which the ethical regimen of pleasures had to 
struggle. There was an immoderation that might be called an 
immoderation of “plethora” or “fulfillment.” 11 There was also 
what might be called an immoderation of “artifice,” which 
was a product of the first type of immoderation: it consisted

in seeking sensual pleasures in the gratification of unnatural 
desires; it was this type that led people to “get three cooks to 
give zest to eating, to buy costly wines, and to run to and fro 
in search of snow in the summer”; it was this type, too, that 
“used men as women” 12 in order to find new pleasures in the 
aphrodisia. Understood in this way, moderation could not 
take the form of an obedience to a system of laws or a codifica¬ 
tion of behaviors; nor could it serve as a principle for nullify¬ 
ing pleasures; it was an art, a practice of pleasures that was 
capable of self-limitation through the “use” of those pleasures 
that were based on need: “Self-control alone,” says Socrates, 
“causes them to endure the sufferings I have named, and 
therefore she alone causes them to experience any pleasure 
worth mentioning in such enjoyments.” 13 And this is how 
Socrates himself experienced them in everyday life, according 
to Xenophon: “He ate just sufficient food to make eating a 
pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found 
appetite the best sauce; and any kind of drink he found pleas¬ 
ant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.” 14 

2. The strategy of timeliness. Another strategy consisted in 
determining the opportune time, the kairos. This was one of 
the most important objectives, and one of the most delicate, 
in the art of making use of the pleasures. Plato emphasizes the 
point in the Laws: fortunate was the one (whether an individ¬ 
ual or a state) who knew what needed to be done in this sphere, 
“at the right time and in the right amount”; whoever, on the 
contrary, acted “without knowledge [anepistemonos] and at 
the wrong time [ektos ton kairon ]” would “live a life that is 
just the opposite.” 15 

One has to keep in mind that this theme of the “right time” 
had always had considerable importance for the Greeks, not 
only as a moral problem, but also as a question of science and 
technique. The exercise of practical skills as in medicine, gov¬ 
ernment, and navigation (a grouping that was quite traditional 
for them) implied that one was not content with knowing
