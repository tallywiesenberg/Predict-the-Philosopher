The Use of Pleasure 


need that awakened desire. Everyone knew that pleasure was 
dulled if it offered no satisfaction to the keenness of a desire: 
“To my friends, meat and drink bring sweet and simple enjoy¬ 
ment [hedeia . . . apolausis apragmon]," 1 says Virtue in Prodi- 
cus’ speech as reported by Socrates, “for they wait till they 
crave them.’’ 9 And in a discussion with Euthydemus, Socrates 
remarks that “hunger or thirst or desire [aphrodision epi- 
thumia] or lack of sleep are the sole causes of pleasure in 
eating and drinking and sexual indulgence, and in resting or 
sleeping, after a time of waiting and resistance until the mo¬ 
ment comes when these will give the greatest possible satisfac¬ 
tion [hos eni hedista]." 10 But if pleasure must be sustained 
through desire, this did not mean that, conversely, desires 
must be increased by recourse to pleasures that were not of a 
natural kind. It is fatigue, says Prodicus, and not continuous 
idleness, that ought to make one feel like sleeping; and if it was 
proper to satisfy sexual desires when they appeared, it was not 
good to create desires that went beyond needs. Need ought to 
serve as a guiding principle in this strategy, which clearly 
could never take the form of a precise codification or a law 
applicable to everyone alike in every circumstance. The strat¬ 
egy made possible an equilibrium in the dynamics of pleasure 
and desire: it kept this dynamics from “running away,” from 
becoming excessive, by setting the satisfaction of a need as its 
internal limit; and it prevented this natural force from revolt¬ 
ing, from usurping a place that was not its own, because it 
provided only for what was necessary to the body and was 
intended by nature, and nothing more. 

At the same time it enabled one to avoid immoderation, 
which was, strictly speaking, a behavior that did not have its 
basis in nature. It was for this reason that it could assume two 
forms against which the ethical regimen of pleasures had to 
struggle. There was an immoderation that might be called an 
immoderation of “plethora” or “fulfillment.” 11 There was also 
what might be called an immoderation of “artifice,” which 
was a product of the first type of immoderation: it consisted
