The Moral Problematization of Pleasures

in seeking sensual pleasures in the gratification of unnatural 
desires; it was this type that led people to “get three cooks to 
give zest to eating, to buy costly wines, and to run to and fro 
in search of snow in the summer”; it was this type, too, that 
“used men as women” 12 in order to find new pleasures in the 
aphrodisia. Understood in this way, moderation could not 
take the form of an obedience to a system of laws or a codifica¬ 
tion of behaviors; nor could it serve as a principle for nullify¬ 
ing pleasures; it was an art, a practice of pleasures that was 
capable of self-limitation through the “use” of those pleasures 
that were based on need: “Self-control alone,” says Socrates, 
“causes them to endure the sufferings I have named, and 
therefore she alone causes them to experience any pleasure 
worth mentioning in such enjoyments.” 13 And this is how 
Socrates himself experienced them in everyday life, according 
to Xenophon: “He ate just sufficient food to make eating a 
pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found 
appetite the best sauce; and any kind of drink he found pleas¬ 
ant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.” 14 

2. The strategy of timeliness. Another strategy consisted in 
determining the opportune time, the kairos. This was one of 
the most important objectives, and one of the most delicate, 
in the art of making use of the pleasures. Plato emphasizes the 
point in the Laws: fortunate was the one (whether an individ¬ 
ual or a state) who knew what needed to be done in this sphere, 
“at the right time and in the right amount”; whoever, on the 
contrary, acted “without knowledge [anepistemonos] and at 
the wrong time [ektos ton kairon ]” would “live a life that is 
just the opposite.” 15 

One has to keep in mind that this theme of the “right time” 
had always had considerable importance for the Greeks, not 
only as a moral problem, but also as a question of science and 
technique. The exercise of practical skills as in medicine, gov¬ 
ernment, and navigation (a grouping that was quite traditional 
for them) implied that one was not content with knowing
