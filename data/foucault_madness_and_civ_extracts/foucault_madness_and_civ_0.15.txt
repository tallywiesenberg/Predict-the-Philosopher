Rather than to review historically the 
concept of madness, the author has chosen to re-create, mostly 
from original documents, mental illness, folly, and unreason as 
they must have existed in their time, place, and proper social 
perspective.In a sense, he has tried to re-create the negative part 
of the concept, that which has disappeared under the retroactive 
influence of present-day ideas and the passage of time.Too 
many historical books about psychic disorders look at the past in 
the light of the present; they single out only what has positive 
and direct relevance to present-day psychiatry.This book 
belongs to the few which demonstrate how skillful, sensitive 
scholarship uses history to enrich, deepen, and reveal new 
avenues for thought and investigation.No oversimplifications, no black-and-white statements, no 
sweeping generalizations are ever allowed in this book; folly is 
brought back to life as a complex social phenomenon, part and 
parcel of the human condition.
