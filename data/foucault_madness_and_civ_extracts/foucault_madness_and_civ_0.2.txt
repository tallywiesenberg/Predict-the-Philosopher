Most of the time, for the sake of 
clarity, we examine madness through one of its facets; as M. 
Foucault animates one facet of the problem after the other, he 
always keeps them related to each other.The end of the Middle 
Ages emphasized the comic, but just as often the tragic aspect of 
madness, as in Tristan and Iseult , for example.The Renaissance, 
with Erasmusâ€™s Praise of Folly , demonstrated how fascinating 
imagination and some of its vagaries were to the thinkers of that 
day.The French Revolution, Pinel, and Tuke emphasized 
political, legal, medical, or religious aspects of madness; and 
today, our so-called objective medical approach, in spite of the

benefits that it has brought to the mentally ill, continues to look 
at only one side of the picture.Folly is so human that it has 
common roots with poetry and tragedy; it is revealed as much in 
the insane asylum as in the writings of a Cervantes or a 
Shakespeare, or in the deep psychological insights and cries of 
revolt of a Nietzsche.
