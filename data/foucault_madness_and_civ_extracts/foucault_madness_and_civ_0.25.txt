Correctly or incorrectly, the author feels 
that Freud’s death instinct also stems from the tragic elements 
which led men of all epochs to worship, laugh at, and dread folly 
simultaneously.Fascinating as Renaissance men found it—they 
painted it, praised it, sang about it—it also heralded for them 
death of the body by picturing death of the mind.Nothing is more illuminating than to follow with M. Foucault 
the many threads which are woven in this complex book, 
whether it speaks of changing symptoms, commitment 
procedures, or treatment.For example: he sees a definite 
connection between some of the attitudes toward madness and 
the disappearance, between 1200 and 1400, of leprosy.In the 
middle of the twelfth century, France had more than 2,000 
leprosariums, and England and Scotland 220 for a population of 
a million and a half people.
