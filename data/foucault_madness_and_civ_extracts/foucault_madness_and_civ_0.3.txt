As leprosy vanished, in part because 
of segregation, a void was created and the moral values attached 
to the leper had to find another scapegoat.Mental illness and 
unreason attracted that stigma to themselves, but even this was 
neither complete, simple, nor immediate.Renaissance men developed a delightful, yet horrible way of 
dealing with their mad denizens: they were put on a ship and 
entrusted to mariners because folly, water, and sea, as everyone 
then “knew,” had an affinity for each other.Thus, “Ships of 
Fools” crisscrossed the seas and canals of Europe with their 
comic and pathetic cargo of souls.Some of them found pleasure 
and even a cure in the changing surroundings, in the isolation of 
being cast off, while others withdrew further, became worse, or 
died alone and away from their families.
