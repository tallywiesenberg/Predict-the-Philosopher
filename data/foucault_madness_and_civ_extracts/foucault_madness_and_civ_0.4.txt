But this legislation was prompted, as 
often as not, by a desire to protect the poor, the criminal, the 
man imprisoned for debts, and the juvenile delinquent from the 
frightening bestiality of the madman.As the madman had 
replaced the leper, the mentally ill person was now a subhuman 
and beastly scapegoat; hence the need to protect others.While 
the Quaker Tuke applied his religious principles, first to 
demented “friends” and later to foes also, partly to convert them, 
the great Pinel was not sure at times that he was dealing with 
sick people; he often marveled at their unbelievable endurance of 
physical hardship, and often cited the ability of schizophrenic 
women to sleep naked in subfreezing temperatures without 
suffering any ill effects.Were not these people more healthy, 
more resistant than ordinary human beings?Didn’t they have too 
much animal spirit in them?
