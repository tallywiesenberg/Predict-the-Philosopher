This is doubtless an uncomfortable region.To explore it we must 
renounce the convenience of terminal truths, and never let ourselves be 
guided by what we may know of madness.None of the concepts oj 
psychopathology, even and especially in the implicit process oj 
retrospections, can play an organizing role.What is constitutive is the 
action that divides madness, and not the science elaborated once this 
division is made and calm restored.What is originative is the caesura 
that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason; reasons 
subjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as madness, 
crime, or disease, derives explicitly from this point.
