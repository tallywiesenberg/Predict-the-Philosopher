The 
language of psychiatry, which is a monologue of reason about 
madness, has been established only on the basis of such a silence.I have not tried to write the history of that language, but rather the 
archaeology of that silence.The Greeks had a relation to something that they called '$€>'•<;■.This 
relation was not merely one of condemnation; the existence oj 
Thrasymachus or of Callicles suffices to prove it, even if their language 
has reached us already enveloped in the reassuring dialectic of Socrates.But the Greek Logos had no contrary.
