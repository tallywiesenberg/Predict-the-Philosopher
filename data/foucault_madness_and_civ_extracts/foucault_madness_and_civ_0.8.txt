In our 
era; the experience of madness remains silent in the composure of a 
knowledge which, knowing too much about madness> forgets it.But 
from one of these experiences to the other , the shift has been made by a 
world without images, without positive character , in a kind of silent 
transparency which reveals—as mute institution , act without 
commentary , immediate knowledge—a great motionless structure; this 
structure is one of neither drama nor knowledge; it is the point where 
history is immobilized in the tragic category which both establishes 
and impugns it.12

haunt but had left sterile and long uninhabitable.For centuries, 
these reaches would belong to the non-human.
