The two 
largest were in the immediate vicinity of Paris: Saint-Germain 
and Saint-Lazare:l we shall hear their names again in the history 
of another sickness.This is because from the fifteenth century 
on, all were emptied; in the next century Saint-Germain became 
a reformatory for young criminals; and before the time of Saint 
Vincent there was only one leper left at Saint-Lazare, “Sieur 
Langlois, practitioner in the civil court.” The lazar house of 
Nancy, which was among the largest in Europe, had only four

1635 the inhabitants of Reims formed a solemn procession to 
thank God for having delivered their city from this scourge.For a century already, royal authority had undertaken the 
control and reorganization of the immense fortune represented 
by the endowments of the lazar houses; in a decree of December 
19, 1543, Francois I had a census and inventory taken “to 
remedy the great disorder that exists at present in the lazar 
houses”; in his turn, Henri IV in an edict of 1606 prescribed a 
revision of their accounts and allotted “the sums obtained from 
this investigation to the sustenance of poor noblemen and 
crippled soldiers.” The same request for regulation is recorded on 
October 24, 1612, but the excess revenues were now to be used 
for feeding the poor.
