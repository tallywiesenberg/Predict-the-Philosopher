In fact, the question of the leprosariums was not settled in 
France before the end of the seventeenth century; and the 
problemâ€™s economic importance provoked more than one 
conflict.Were there not still, in the year 1677, 44 lazar houses in 
the province of Dauphine alone?On February 20, 1672, Louis 
XIV assigned to the Orders of Saint-Lazare and Mont-Carmel 
the effects of all the military and hospital orders; they were 
entrusted with the administration of the lazar houses of the 
kingdom.Some twenty years later, the edict of 1672 was 
revoked, and by a series of staggered measures from March 1693 
to July 1695 the goods of the lazar houses were thenceforth 
assigned to other hospitals and welfare establishments.The few 
lepers scattered in the 1,200 still-existing houses were collected 
at Saint-Mesmin near Orleans.
