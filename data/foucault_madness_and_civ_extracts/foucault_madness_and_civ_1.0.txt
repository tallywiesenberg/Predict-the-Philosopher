These decrees were first applied 
in Paris, where the Parlement transferred the revenue in question 
to the establishments of the Hopital General; this example was 
imitated by the provincial authorities; Toulouse transferred the 
effects of its lazar houses to the Hopital des Incurables (1696); 
those of Beaulieu in Normandy went to the Hotel-Dieu in Caen; 


16 



those of Voley were assigned to the Hopital de Sainte-Foy.Only 
Saint-Mesmin and the wards of Ganets, near Bordeaux, 
remained as a reminder.England and Scotland alone had opened 220 lazar houses for a 
million and a half inhabitants in the twelfth century.But as early 
as the fourteenth century they began to empty out; by the time 
Edward III ordered an inquiry into the hospital of Ripon—in 
1342—there were no more lepers; he assigned the institution’s 
effects to the poor.At the end of the twelfth century, 
Archbishop Puisel had founded a hospital in which by 1434 only 
two beds were reserved for lepers, should any be found.
