INTRODUCTION 


MICHEL FOUCAULT has achieved something truly creative 
in this book on the history of madness during the so-called 
classical age: the end of the sixteenth and the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. Rather than to review historically the 
concept of madness, the author has chosen to re-create, mostly 
from original documents, mental illness, folly, and unreason as 
they must have existed in their time, place, and proper social 
perspective. In a sense, he has tried to re-create the negative part 
of the concept, that which has disappeared under the retroactive 
influence of present-day ideas and the passage of time. Too 
many historical books about psychic disorders look at the past in 
the light of the present; they single out only what has positive 
and direct relevance to present-day psychiatry. This book 
belongs to the few which demonstrate how skillful, sensitive 
scholarship uses history to enrich, deepen, and reveal new 
avenues for thought and investigation. 

No oversimplifications, no black-and-white statements, no 
sweeping generalizations are ever allowed in this book; folly is 
brought back to life as a complex social phenomenon, part and 
parcel of the human condition. Most of the time, for the sake of 
clarity, we examine madness through one of its facets; as M. 
Foucault animates one facet of the problem after the other, he 
always keeps them related to each other. The end of the Middle 
Ages emphasized the comic, but just as often the tragic aspect of 
madness, as in Tristan and Iseult , for example. The Renaissance, 
with Erasmus’s Praise of Folly , demonstrated how fascinating 
imagination and some of its vagaries were to the thinkers of that 
day. The French Revolution, Pinel, and Tuke emphasized 
political, legal, medical, or religious aspects of madness; and
