In 1348, 
the great leprosarium of Saint Albans contained only three 
patients; the hospital of Romenal in Kent was abandoned 
twenty-four years later, for lack of lepers.At Chatham, the lazar 
house of Saint Bartholomew, established in 1078, had been one 
of the most important in England; under Elizabeth, it cared for 
only two patients; it was finally closed in 1627.The same regression of leprosy occurred in Germany, perhaps 
a little more slowly; and the same conversion of the lazar houses, 
hastened by the Reformation, which left municipal 
administrations in charge of welfare and hospital establishments; 
this was the case in Leipzig, in Munich, in Hamburg.In 1542, 
the effects of the lazar houses of Schleswig-Holstein were 
transferred to the hospitals.In Stuttgart a magistrateâ€™s report of 
1589 indicates that for fifty years already there had been no 
lepers in the house provided for them.
