At Lipplingen, the lazar 
house was soon peopled with incurables and madmen.A strange disappearance, which was doubtless not the long- 
sought effect of obscure medical practices, but the spontaneous 
result of segregation and also the consequence, after the 
Crusades, of the break with the Eastern sources of infection.Leprosy withdrew, leaving derelict these low places and these 
rites which were intended, not to suppress it, but to keep it at a 
sacred distance, to fix it in an inverse exaltation.What doubtless

remained longer than leprosy, and would persist when the lazar 
houses had been empty for years, were the values and images 
attached to the figure of the leper as well as the meaning of his 
exclusion, the social importance of that insistent and fearful 
figure which was not driven off without first being inscribed 
within a sacred circle.If the leper was removed from the world, and from the 
community of the Church visible, his existence was yet a 
constant manifestation of God, since it was a sign both of His 
anger and of His grace: “My friend,” says the ritual of the 
Church of Vienne, “it pleaseth Our Lord that thou shouldst be 
infected with this malady, and thou hast great grace at the hands 
of Our Lord that he desireth to punish thee for thy iniquities in 
this world.” And at the very moment when the priest and his 
assistants drag him out of the church with backward step, the 
leper is assured that he still bears witness for God: “And 
howsoever thou mayest be apart from the Church and the 
company of the Sound, yet art thou not apart from the grace of 
God.” Brueghefs lepers attend at a distance, but forever, that 
climb to Calvary on which the entire people accompanies Christ.
