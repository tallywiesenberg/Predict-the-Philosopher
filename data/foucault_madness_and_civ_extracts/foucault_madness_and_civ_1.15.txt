Hieratic witnesses of evil, they accomplish their salvation in and 
by their very exclusion: in a strange reversibility that is the 
opposite of good works and prayer, they are saved by the hand 
that is not stretched out.The sinner who abandons the leper at 
his door opens his way to heaven.“For which have patience in 
thy malady; for Our Lord hateth thee not because of it, keepeth 
thee not from his company; but if thou hast patience thou wilt be 
saved, as was the leper who died before the gate of the rich man 
and was carried straight to paradise.” Abandonment is his 
salvation; his exclusion offers him another form of communion.Leprosy disappeared, the leper vanished, or almost, from 
memory; these structures remained.Often, in these same places, 
the formulas of exclusion would be repeated, strangely similar 
two or three centuries later.
