we shall see what salvation was expected from this exclusion, for 
them and for those who excluded them as well.With an

would remain—essentially that major form of a rigorous division 
which is social exclusion but spiritual reintegration.Something new appears in the imaginary landscape of the 
Renaissance; soon it will occupy a privileged place there: the 
Ship of Fools, a strange “drunken boat” that glides along the 
calm rivers of the Rhineland and the Flemish canals.The Narrenschiff, of course, is a literary composition, probably 
borrowed from the old Argonaut cycle, one of the great mythic 
themes recently revived and rejuvenated, acquiring an 
institutional aspect in the Burgundy Estates.Fashion favored the 
composition of these Ships, whose crew of imaginary heroes, 
ethical models, or social types embarked on a great symbolic 
voyage which would bring them, if not fortune, then at least the 
figure of their destiny or their truth.
