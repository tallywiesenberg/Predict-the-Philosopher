Thus Symphorien 
Champier composes a Ship of Princes and Battles of Nobility in 
1502, then a Ship of Virtuous Ladies in 1503; there is also a Ship of 
Health , alongside the Blauwe Schute of Jacob van Oestvoren in 
1413, Sebastian Brant’s Narrenschiff (1494), and the work of 
Josse Bade: Stultiferae naviculae scaphae fatuarum mulierum 
(1498).Bosch’s painting, of course, belongs to this dream fleet.But of all these romantic or satiric vessels, the Narrenschiff is 
the only one that had a real existence—for they did exist, these 
boats that conveyed their insane cargo from town to town.Madmen then led an easy wandering existence.The towns drove 
them outside their limits; they were allowed to wander in the 
open countryside, when not entrusted to a group of merchants 
and pilgrims.
