The custom was especially frequent in Germany; in 
Nuremberg, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the presence 
of 63 madmen had been registered; 31 were driven away; in the 


19 



fifty years that followed, there are records of 21 more obligatory 
departures; and these are only the madmen arrested by the 
municipal authorities.Frequently they were handed over to 
boatmen: in Frankfort, in 1399, seamen were instructed to rid 
the city of a madman who walked about the streets naked; in the 
first years of the fifteenth century, a criminal madman was 
expelled in the same manner from Mainz.Sometimes the sailors 
disembarked these bothersome passengers sooner than they had 
promised; witness a blacksmith of Frankfort twice expelled and 
twice returning before being taken to Kreuznach for good.Often 
the cities of Europe must have seen these “ships of fools” 
approaching their harbors.It is not easy to discover the exact meaning of this custom.
