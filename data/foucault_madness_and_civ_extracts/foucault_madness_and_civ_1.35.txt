One might suppose it was a general means of extradition by 
which municipalities sent wandering madmen out of their own 
jurisdiction; a hypothesis which will not in itself account for the 
facts, since certain madmen, even before special houses were 
built for them, were admitted to hospitals and cared for as such; 
at the Hotel-Dieu in Paris, their cots were set up in the 
dormitories.Moreover, in the majority of the cities of Europe 
there existed throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance a 
place of detention reserved for the insane; there was for example 
the Chatelet of Melun or the famous Tour aux Fous in Caen; 
there were the numberless Narrturmer of Germany, like the gates 
of Liibeck or the Jungpfer of Hamburg.Madmen were thus not 
invariably expelled.One might then speculate that among them 
only foreigners were driven away, each city agreeing to care for 
those madmen among its own citizens.Do we not in fact find 
among the account books of certain medieval cities subsidies for 
madmen or donations made for the care of the insane?
