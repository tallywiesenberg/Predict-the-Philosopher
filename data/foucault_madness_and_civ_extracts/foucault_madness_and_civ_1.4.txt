However, 
the problem is not so simple, for there existed gathering places 
where the madmen, more numerous than elsewhere, were not 
autochthonous.First come the shrines: Saint-Mathurin de 
Larchant, Saint-Hildevert de Gournay, Besan^on, Gheel;

pilgrimages to these places were organized, often supported, by 
cities or hospitals.It is possible that these ships of fools, which 
haunted the imagination of the entire early Renaissance, were 
pilgrimage boats, highly symbolic cargoes of madmen in search 
of their reason: some went down the Rhineland rivers toward 
Belgium and Gheel; others sailed up the Rhine toward the Jura 
and Besan^on.But other cities, like Nuremberg, were certainly not shrines 
and yet contained great numbers of madmen-many more, in any 
case, than could have been furnished by the city itself.These 
madmen were housed and provided for in the city budget, and 
yet they were not given treatment; they were simply thrown into 
prison.
