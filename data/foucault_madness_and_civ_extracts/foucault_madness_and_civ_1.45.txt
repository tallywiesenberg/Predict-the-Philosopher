We may suppose that in certain important cities—centers 
of travel and markets—madmen had been brought in 
considerable numbers by merchants and mariners and “lost” 
there, thus ridding their native cities of their presence.It may 
have happened that these places of “counterpilgrimage” have 
become confused with the places where, on the contrary, the 
insane were taken as pilgrims.Interest in cure and in exclusion 
coincide: madmen were confined in the holy locus of a miracle.It is possible that the village of Gheel developed in this manner 
—a shrine that became a ward, a holy land where madness hoped 
for deliverance, but where man enacted, according to old themes, 
a sort of ritual division.What matters is that the vagabond madmen, the act of driving 
them away, their departure and embarkation do not assume their 
entire significance on the plane of social utility or security.
