Other 
meanings much closer to rite are certainly present; and we can 
still discern some traces of them.Thus access to churches was 
denied to madmen, although ecclesiastical law did not deny them 
the use of the sacraments.The Church takes no action against a 
priest who goes mad; but in Nuremberg in 1421 a mad priest 
was expelled with particular solemnity, as if the impurity was 
multiplied by the sacred nature of his person, and the city put on

its budget the money given him as a viaticum.It happened that 
certain madmen were publicly whipped, and in the course of a 
kind of a game they were chased in a mock race and driven out 
of the city with quarterstaff blows.So many signs that the 
expulsion of madmen had become one of a number of ritual 
exiles.
