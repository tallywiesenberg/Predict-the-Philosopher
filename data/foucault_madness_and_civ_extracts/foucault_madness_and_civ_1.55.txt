Thus we better understand the curious implication assigned to 
the navigation of madmen and the prestige attending it.On the 
one hand, we must not minimize its incontestable practical 
effectiveness: to hand a madman over to sailors was to be 
permanently sure he would not be prowling beneath the city 
walls; it made sure that he would go far away; it made him a 
prisoner of his own departure.But water adds to this the dark 
mass of its own values; it carries off, but it does more: it purifies.Navigation delivers man to the uncertainty of fate; on water, 
each of us is in the hands of his own destiny; every embarkation 
is, potentially, the last.It is for the other world that the madman 
sets sail in his foolsâ€™ boat; it is from the other world that he 
comes when he disembarks.
