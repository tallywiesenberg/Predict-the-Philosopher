The madman’s voyage is at once a 
rigorous division and an absolute Passage.In one sense, it simply 
develops, across a half-real, half-imaginary geography, the 
madman’s liminal position on the horizon of medieval concern— 
a position symbolized and made real at the same time by the 
madman’s privilege of being confined within the city gates', his 
exclusion must enclose him; if he cannot and must not have 
another prison than the threshold itself, he is kept at the point of 
passage.He is put in the interior of the exterior, and inversely.A 
highly symbolic position, which will doubtless remain his until 
our own day, if we are willing to admit that what was formerly a 
visible fortress of order has now become the castle of our 
conscience.Water and navigation certainly play this role.
