At the end of 
the sixteenth century, De Lancre sees in the sea the origin of the 
demoniacal leanings of an entire people: the hazardous labor of 
ships, dependence on the stars, hereditary secrets, estrangement 
from women—the very image of the great, turbulent plain itself 
makes man lose faith in God and all his attachment to his home; 
he is then in the hands of the Devil, in the sea of Satan’s ruses.3 
In the classical period, the melancholy of the English was easily 
explained by the influence of a maritime climate, cold, humidity, 
the instability of the weather; all those fine droplets of water that 
penetrated the channels and fibers of the human body and made 
it lose its firmness, predisposed it to madness.Finally, neglecting 
an immense literature that stretches from Ophelia to the Lorelei, 
let us note only the great half-anthropological, half-cosmological 
analyses of Heinroth, which interpret madness as the 
manifestation in man of an obscure and aquatic element, a dark 
disorder, a moving chaos, the seed and death of all things, which 
opposes the mind’s luminous and adult stability.But if the navigation of madmen is linked in the Western 
mind with so many immemorial motifs, why, so abruptly, in the 
fifteenth century, is the theme suddenly formulated in literature 
and iconography?Why does the figure of the Ship of Fools and 
its insane crew all at once invade the most familiar landscapes?Why, from the old union of water and madness, was this ship 
born one day, and on just that day?
