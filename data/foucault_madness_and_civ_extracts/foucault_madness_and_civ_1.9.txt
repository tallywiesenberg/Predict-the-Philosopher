In farces and soties, the character of the Madman, the 
Fool, or the Simpleton assumes more and more importance.He 
is no longer simply a ridiculous and familiar silhouette in the 
wings: he stands center stage as the guardian of truth-playing 
here a role which is the complement and converse of that taken 
by madness in the tales and the satires.If folly leads each man 
into a blindness where he is lost, the madman, on the contrary, 
reminds each man of his truth; in a comedy where each man 
deceives the other and dupes himself, the madman is comedy to 
the second degree: the deception of deception; he utters, in his 
simpleton s language which makes no show of reason, the words 
of reason that release, in the comic, the comedy: he speaks love 
to lovers, the truth of life to the young, the middling reality of 
things to the proud, to the insolent, and to liars.Even the old 
feasts of fools, so popular in Flanders and northern Europe, were 
theatrical events, and organized into social and moral criticism, 
whatever they may have contained of spontaneous religious 

In learned literature, too, Madness or Folly was at work, at the 
very heart of reason and truth.It is Folly which embarks all men 
without distinction on its insane ship and binds them to the 
vocation of a common odyssey (Van Oestvoren’s Blauwe Schute , 
Brant’s Narrenschifj)\ it is Folly whose baleful reign Thomas 
Murner conjures up in his Narrenbeschworung ; it is Folly which 
gets the best of Love in Corroz’s satire Contre fol amour , or 
argues with Love as to which of the two comes first, which of the 
two makes the other possible, and triumphs in Louise Labe’s 
dialogue, Debat de folie et d'amour.
