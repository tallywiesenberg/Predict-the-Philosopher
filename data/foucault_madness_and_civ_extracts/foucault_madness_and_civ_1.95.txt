Folly also has its academic 
pastimes; it is the object of argument, it contends against itself; it

is denounced, and defends itself by claiming that it is closer to 
happiness and truth than reason, that it is closer to reason than 
reason itself; Jakob Wimpfeling edits the Monopolium 
philo soph orum, and Judocus Gallus the Monopolium et societas , 
vulgo des lichtschijfs.Finally, at the center of all these serious 
games, the great humanist texts: the Moria rediviva of Flayder 
and Erasmusâ€™s Praise of Folly.And confronting all these 
discussions, with their tireless dialectic, confronting these 
discourses constantly reworded and reworked, a long dynasty of 
images, from Hieronymus Bosch with The Cure of Madness and 
The Ship of Fools , down to Brueghel and his Dulle Griet\ 
woodcuts and engravings transcribe what the theater, what 
literature and art have already taken up: the intermingled themes 
of the Feast and of the Dance of Fools.Indeed, from the 
fifteenth century on, the face of madness has haunted the 
imagination of Western man.A sequence of dates speaks for itself: the Dance of Death in the 
Cimetiere des Innocents doubtless dates from the first years of 
the fifteenth century, the one in the Chaise-Dieu was probably 
composed around 1460; and it was in 1485 that Guyot Marchant 
published his Danse macabre.
