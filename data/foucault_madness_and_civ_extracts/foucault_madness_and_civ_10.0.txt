as the continuous and constant form of existence. And where 
once man s madness had been not to see that death’s term was 
approaching, so that it was necessary to recall him to wisdom 
with the spectacle of death, now wisdom consisted of 
denouncing madness everywhere, teaching men that they were

no more than dead men already, and that if the end was near, it 
was to the degree that madness, become universal, would be one 
and the same with death itself. This is what Eustache 
Deschamps prophesies: 

We are cowardly and weak, 

Covetous, old, evil-tongued. 

Fools are all I see, in truth. 

The end is near, 

All goes ill ... 

The elements are now reversed. It is no longer the end of time 
and of the world which will show retrospectively that men were 
mad not to have been prepared for them; it is the tide of 
madness, its secret invasion, that shows that the world is near its 
final catastrophe; it is man s insanity that invokes and makes 
necessary the world’s end. 

In its various forms—plastic or literary—this experience of 
madness seems extremely coherent. Painting and text constantly 
refer to one another—commentary here and illustration there. 
We find the same theme of the Narrentanz over and over in 
popular festivals, in theatrical performances, in engravings and 
woodcuts, and the entire last part of the Praise of Folly is 
constructed on the model of a long dance of madmen in which 
each profession and each estate parades in turn to form the great 
round of unreason. It is likely that in Bosch’s Temptation of Saint 
Anthony in Lisbon, many figures of the fantastic fauna which 
invade the canvas are borrowed from traditional masks; some 
perhaps are transferred from the Malleus maleficarum. As for the 
famous Ship of Fools , is it not a direct translation of Brant’s 
Narrenschiff whose title it bears, and of which it seems to 
illustrate quite precisely canto XXVII, also consecrated to 
stigmatizing “drunkards and gluttons”? It has even been
