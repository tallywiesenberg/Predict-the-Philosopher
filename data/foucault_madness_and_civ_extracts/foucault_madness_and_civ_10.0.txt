And that is why madness is not exhausted in 
the waking modality of the dream, and why it overflows into 
error.It is true that in the dream, the imagination forges 
“impossible things and miracles,” or that it assembles lifelike 
figures “by an irrational method”; but, Zacchias remarks, “there 
is no error in these things, and consequently nothing insane.” 
Madness occurs when the images, which are so close to the 
dream, receive the affirmation or negation that constitutes error.It is in this sense that the Encyclopedic proposed its famous 
definition of madness: to depart from reason “with confidence 
and in the firm conviction that one is following it—that, it seems 
to me, is what is called being mad?Error is the other element 
always present with the dream, in the classical definition of 
insanity.The madman, in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, is not so much the victim of an illusion, of a 
hallucination of his senses, or of a movement of his mind.
