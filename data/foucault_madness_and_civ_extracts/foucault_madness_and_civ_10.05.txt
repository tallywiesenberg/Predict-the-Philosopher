He is 
not abused ; he deceives himself.If it is true that on one hand the 
madman’s mind is led on by the oneiric arbitrariness of images, 
on the other, and at the same time, he imprisons himself in the 
circle of an erroneous consciousness: “We call madmen,” 
Sauvages was to say, “those who are actually deprived of reason 
or who persist in some notable error; it is this constant error of the 
soul manifest in its imagination, in its judgments, and in its 
desires, which constitutes the characteristic of this category.” 

Madness begins where the relation of man to truth is

disturbed and darkened.It is in this relation, at the same time as 
in the destruction of this relation, that madness assumes its 
general meaning and its particular forms.Dementia, Zacchias 
says, using the term here in the most general sense of madness, 
“lay in this, that the intellect did not distinguish true from false.” 
But this breakdown, if we can understand it only as negation, has 
positive structures which give it singular forms.According to the 
different forms of access to the truth, there will be different types 
of madness.
