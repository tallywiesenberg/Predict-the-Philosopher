It is in this sense that Chrichton, for example, 
distinguishes in the order of vesanias, first the class deliria , which 
alter that relation to the truth which takes shape in perception 
(“general delirium of the mental faculties, in which the diseased 
perceptions are taken for realities”); then the class hallucinations, 
which alter representation (“error of the mind in which imaginary 
objects are taken for realities, or else real objects are falsely 
represented”); and last, the class dementias , which without 
abolishing or altering the faculties that afford access to truth, 
weaken them and diminish their powers.But we can also analyze madness starting with truth itself and 
with the forms proper to it.It is in this manner that the 
Encyclopedie distinguishes “physical truth” from “moral truth.” 
“Physical truth consists in the accurate relation of our sensations 
with physical objects”; there will be a form of madness 
determined by the impossibility of acceding to this form of truth; 
a kind of madness of the physical world which includes illusions, 
hallucinations, all perceptual disturbances; “it is a madness to 
hear choirs of angels, as certain enthusiasts do.” “Moral truth,” 
on the other hand, “consists in the exactitude of the relations we 
discern either between moral objects, or between those objects 
and ourselves.” There will be a form of madness consisting of the 
loss of these relations; such is the madness of character, of 
conduct, and of the passions.“Veritable madnesses, then, are all 
the derangements of our mind, all the illusions of self-love, and 
all our passions when they are carried to the point of blindness;

for blindness is the distinctive characteristic of madness.”!8 

Blindness : one of the words which comes closest to the essence 
of classical madness.
