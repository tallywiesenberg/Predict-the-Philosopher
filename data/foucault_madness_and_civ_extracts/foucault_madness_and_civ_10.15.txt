It refers to that night of quasi-sleep which 
surrounds the images of madness, giving them, in their solitude, 
an invisible sovereignty; but it refers also to ill-founded beliefs, 
mistaken judgments, to that whole background of errors 
inseparable from madness.The fundamental discourse of 
delirium, in its constitutive powers, thus reveals to what extent, 
despite analogies of form, despite the rigor of its meaning, it was 
not a discourse of reason.It spoke, but in the night of blindness; 
it was more than the loose and disordered text of a dream, since 
it deceived itself; but it was more than an erroneous proposition, 
since it was plunged into that total obscurity which is that of 
sleep.Delirium, as the principle of madness, is a system of false 
propositions in the general syntax of the dream.Madness is precisely at the point of contact between the 
oneiric and the erroneous; it traverses, in its variations, the 
surface on which they meet, the surface which both joins and 
separates them.
