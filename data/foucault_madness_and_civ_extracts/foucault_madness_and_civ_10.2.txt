With error, madness shares non-truth, and 
arbitrariness in affirmation or negation; from the dream, 
madness borrows the flow of images and the colorful presence of 
hallucinations.But while error is merely non-truth, while the 
dream neither affirms nor judges, madness fills the void of error 
with images, and links hallucinations by affirmation of the false.In a sense, it is thus plenitude, joining to the figures of night the 
powers of day, to the forms of fantasy the activity of the waking 
mind; it links the dark content with the forms of light.But is not 
such plenitude actually the culmination of the void?The presence 
of images offers no more than night-ringed hallucinations, 
figures inscribed at the corners of sleep, hence detached from any 
sensuous reality; however vivid they are, however rigorously 
established in the body, these images are nothingness, since they 
represent nothing; as for erroneous judgment, it judges only in

appearance: affirming nothing true or real, it does not affirm at 
all; it is ensnared in the non-being of error.
