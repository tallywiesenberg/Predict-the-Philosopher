Joining vision and blindness, image and judgment, 
hallucination and language, sleep and waking, day and night, 
madness is ultimately nothing, for it unites in them all that is 
negative.But the paradox of this nothing is to manifest itself, to 
explode in signs, in words, in gestures.Inextricable unity of order 
and disorder, of the reasonable being of things and this 
nothingness of madness!For madness, if it is nothing, can 
manifest itself only by departing from itself, by assuming an 
appearance in the order of reason and thus becoming the 
contrary of itself.Which illuminates the paradoxes of the 
classical experience: madness is always absent, in a perpetual 
retreat where it is inaccessible, without phenomenal or positive 
character; and yet it is present and perfectly visible in the singular 
evidence of the madman.
