Meaningless disorder as madness is, it 
reveals, when we examine it, only ordered classifications, 
rigorous mechanisms in soul and body, language articulated 
according to a visible logic.All that madness can say of itself is 
merely reason, though it is itself the negation of reason.In short, 
a rational hold over madness is always possible and necessary , to the 
very degree that madness is non-reason.There is only one word which summarizes this experience, 
Unreason', all that, for reason, is closest and most remote, 
emptiest and most complete; all that presents itself to reason in 
familiar structures—authorizing a knowledge, and then a science, 
which seeks to be positive—and all that is constantly in retreat 
from reason, in the inaccessible domain of nothingness.And if, now, we try to assign a value, in and of itself, outside 
its relations with the dream and with error, to classical unreason, 
we must understand it not as reason diseased, or as reason lost or 
alienated, but quite simply as reason dazzled.
