Dazzlement is night in broad daylight, the darkness that rules

at the very heart of what is excessive in lightâ€™s radiance.Dazzled 
reason opens its eyes upon the sun and sees nothing, that is, does 
not see\ in dazzlement, the recession of objects toward the depths 
of night has as an immediate correlative the suppression of vision 
itself; at the moment when it sees objects disappear into the 
secret night of light, sight sees itself in the moment of its 
disappearance.To say that madness is dazzlement is to say that the madman 
sees the daylight, the same daylight as the man of reason (both 
live in the same brightness); but seeing this same daylight, and 
nothing but this daylight and nothing in it, he sees it as void, as 
night, as nothing; for him the shadows are the way to perceive 
daylight.Which means that, seeing the night and the 
nothingness of the night, he does not see at all.And believing he 
sees, he admits as realities the hallucinations of his imagination 
and all the multitudinous population of night.
