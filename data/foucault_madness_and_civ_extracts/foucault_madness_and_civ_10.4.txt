That is why 
delirium and dazzlement are in a relation which constitutes the 
essence of madness, exactly as truth and light, in their 
fundamental relation, constitute classical reason.In this sense, the Cartesian formula of doubt is certainly the 
great exorcism of madness.Descartes closes his eyes and plugs up 
his ears the better to see the true brightness of essential daylight; 
thus he is secured against the dazzlement of the madman who, 
opening his eyes, sees only night, and not seeing at all, believes 
he sees when he imagines.In the uniform lucidity of his closed 
senses, Descartes has broken with all possible fascination, and if 
he sees, he is certain of seeing that which he sees.While before 
the eyes of the madman, drunk on a light which is darkness, rise 
and multiply images incapable of criticizing themselves (since the 
madman sees them), but irreparably separated from being (since 
the madman sees nothing).
