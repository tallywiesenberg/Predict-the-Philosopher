This is no 
longer the fatal time of the planets, it is not yet the lyrical time of 
the seasons; it is the universal but absolutely divided time of 
brightness and darkness.A form which thought entirely masters 
in a mathematical science—Cartesian physics is a kind of 
mathesis of light—but which at the same time traces the great 
tragic caesura in human existence: one that dominates the 
theatrical time of Racine and the space of Georges de la Tour in 
the same imperious fashion.The circle of day and night is the 
law of the classical world: the most reduced but the most 
demanding of the world’s necessities, the most inevitable but the 
simplest of nature’s legalities.A law which excludes all dialectic and all reconciliation; which 
establishes, consequently, both the flawless unity of knowledge 
and the uncompromising division of tragic existence; it rules over 
a world without twilight, which knows no effusion, nor the 
attenuated cares of lyricism; everything must be either waking or 
dream, truth or darkness, the light of being or the nothingness of 
shadow.Such a law prescribes an inevitable order, a serene 
division which makes truth possible and confirms it forever.
