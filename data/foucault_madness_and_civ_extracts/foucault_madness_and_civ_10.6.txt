And these 
fantastic nights, in their turn, are haunted by a light which forms 
a kind of infernal reflection of the day: the burning of Troy, the 
torches of the Praetorians, the pale light of the dream.In 
classical tragedy, day and night are arranged like a pair of 
mirrors, endlessly reflect each other, and afford that simple 
couple a sudden profundity which envelops in a single movement 
all of man’s life and his death.In the same fashion, in De la 
Tour’s Madeleine au miroir , light and shadow confront each other 
divide and at the same time unite a face and its reflection, a skull 
and its image, a vigil and a silence; and in the Image Saint-Alexis , 
the page holding the torch reveals under the shadow of the vault 
the man who was his master—a grave and luminous boy 
encounters all of human misery; a child brings death to light.On the other side, facing tragedy and its hieratic language, is 
the confused murmur of madness.Here, too, the great law of the 
division has been violated; shadow and light mingle in the fury of 
madness, as in the tragic disorder.
