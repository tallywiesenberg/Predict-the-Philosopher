of Troy remained Andromache’s truth, as Athalie’s night 
presaged the truth of the already advancing day; night,

madman, conversely, finds in daylight only the inconsistency of 
the night’s figures; he lets the light be darkened by all the 
illusions of the dream; his day is only the most superficial night oj 
appearance.It is to this degree that tragic man, more than any

other, is engaged in being, is the bearer of his truth, since, like 
Phedre, he flings in the face of the pitiless sun all the secrets of 
the night; while the madman is entirely excluded from being.And how could he not be, lending as he does the day s illusory 
reflection to the night’s non-being?
