We understand that the tragic hero—in contrast to the 
baroque character of the preceding period—can never be mad; 
and that conversely madness cannot bear within itself those 
values of tragedy, which we have known since Nietzsche and 
Artaud.In the classical period, the man of tragedy and the man 
of madness confront each other, without a possible dialogue, 
without a common language; for the former can utter only the 
decisive words of being, uniting in a flash the truth of light and 
the depth of darkness; the latter endlessly drones out the 
indifferent murmur which cancels out both the day’s chatter and 
the lying dark.Madness designates the equinox between the vanity of night’s 
hallucinations and the non-being of light’s judgments.And this much, which the archaeology of knowledge has been 
able to teach us bit by bit, was already offered to us in a simple 
tragic fulguration, in the last words of Andromaque.As if, at the moment when madness was vanishing from the 
tragic act, at the moment when tragic man was to separate 
himself for over two centuries from the man of unreason—as if, 
at this very moment, an ultimate figuration were demanded of 
madness.
