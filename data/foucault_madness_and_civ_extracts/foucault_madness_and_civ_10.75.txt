The curtain which falls on the last scene of 
Andromaque also falls on the last of the great tragic incarnations 
of madness.But in this presence on the threshold of its own 
disappearance, in this madness incarcerating itself for good, is 
articulated what it is and will be for the entire classical age.Is it 
not precisely at the moment of its disappearance that it can best 
present its truth, its truth of absence, its truth which is that of 
day at the limits of night?This had to be the last scene of the

first great classical tragedy; or if one prefers, the first time in 
which the classical truth of madness is expressed in a tragic 
movement which is the last of the preclassical theater.A truth, in 
any case, that is instantaneous, since its appearance can only be 
its disappearance; the lightning-flash is seen only in the already 
advancing night.
