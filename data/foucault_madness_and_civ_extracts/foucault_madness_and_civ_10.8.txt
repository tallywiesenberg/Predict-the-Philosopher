Orestes, in his frenzy, passes through a triple circle of night: 
three concentric figurations of dazzlement.Day has just dawned 
over Pyrrhus’s palace; night is still there, edging this light with 
shadow, and peremptorily indicating its limit.On this morning 
which is a festival morning, the crime has been committed, and 
Pyrrhus has closed his eyes on the dawning day: a fragment of 
shadow cast here on the steps of the altar, on the threshold of 
brightness and of darkness.The two great cosmic themes of 
madness are thus present in various forms, as omen, decor, and 
counterpoint of Orestes’ frenzy.1 It can then begin: in a pitiless 
clarity which denounces the murder of Pyrrhus and the treachery 
of Hermione, in that dawn where everything finally explodes in a 
truth so old and at the same time so young, a first circle of 
shadow: a dark cloud into which, all around Orestes, the world 
begins to withdraw; the truth appears in this paradoxical 
twilight, in this matinal night where the cruelty of truth will be 
transformed into the fury of hallucination:
