form and mask, the madman is obliged to objectify himself in 
the eyes of reason as the perfect stranger, that is, as the man 
whose strangeness does not reveal itself. The city of reason 
welcomes him only with this qualification and at the price of this 
surrender to anonymity. 

We see that at the Retreat the partial suppression of physical 
constraint was part of a system whose essential element was the 
constitution of a “self-restraint” in which the patient’s freedom, 
engaged by work and the observation of others, was ceaselessly 
threatened by the recognition of guilt. Instead of submitting to a 
simple negative operation that loosened bonds and delivered 
one’s deepest nature from madness, it must be recognized that 
one was in the grip of a positive operation that confined madness 
in a system of rewards and punishments, and included it in the 
movement of moral consciousness. A passage from a world of 
Censure to a universe of Judgment. But thereby a psychology of 
madness becomes possible, for under observation madness is 
constantly required, at the surface of itself, to deny its 
dissimulation. It is judged only by its acts; it is not accused of 
intentions, nor are its secrets to be fathomed. Madness is 
responsible only for that part of itself which is visible. All the rest 
is reduced to silence. Madness no longer exists except as seen. 
The proximity instituted by the asylum, an intimacy neither 
chains nor bars would ever violate again, does not allow 
reciprocity: only the nearness of observation that watches, that 
spies, that comes closer in order to see better, but moves ever 
farther away, since it accepts and acknowledges only the values of 
the Stranger. The science of mental disease, as it would develop 
in the asylum, would always be only of the order of observation

and classification. It would not be a dialogue. It could not be that 
until psychoanalysis had exorcised this phenomenon of 
observation, essential to the nineteenth-century asylum, and 
substituted for its silent magic the powers of language, It would 
be fairer to say that psychoanalysis doubled the absolute 
observation of the watcher with the endless monologue of the 
person watched—thus preserving the old asylum structure of 
non-reciprocal observation but balancing it, in a non- 
symmetrical reciprocity, by the new structure of language 
without response. 

Surveillance and Judgment: already the outline appears of a 
new personage who will be essential in the nineteenth-century 
asylum. Tuke himself suggests this personage, when he tells the
