system of education must be applied, a new direction given to 
their ideas; they must first be subjugated, then encouraged, then 
applied to work, and this work made agreeable by attractive 
means."8 For a long time already, the law had regarded the 
insane as minors, but this was a juridical situation, abstractly 
defined by interdiction and trusteeship; it was not a concrete 
mode of relation between man and man. Minority status became 
for Tuke a style of existence to be applied to the mad, and for the 
guards a mode of sovereignty. Great emphasis was placed on the 
concept of the “family” which organized the community of the 
insane and their keepers at the Retreat. Apparently this “family”

placed the patient in a milieu both normal and natural; in reality 
it alienated him still more: the juridical minority assigned to the 
madman was intended to protect him as a subject of law; this 
ancient structure, by becoming a form of coexistence, delivered 
him entirely, as a psychological subject, to the authority and 
prestige of the man of reason, who assumed for him the concrete 
figure of an adult, in other words, both domination and 
destination. 

In the great reorganization of relations between madness and 
reason, the family, at the end of the eighteenth century, played a 
decisive part—simultaneously imaginary landscape and real social 
structure; it is from the family that Tuke starts out, and toward it 
that he progresses. Lending it the prestige of primitive values not 
yet compromised in the social, Tuke makes the family play a role 
of disalienation; it was, in his myth, the antithesis of that 
“milieu” which the eighteenth century saw as the origin of all 
madness. But he introduced it as well, in a very real way, into the 
world of the asylum, where it appears both as truth and as norm 
for all relations that may obtain between the madman and the 
man of reason. Thus minority under family tutelage, a juridical 
status in which the madman’s civil status is alienated, becomes a 
concrete situation in which his concrete liberty is alienated. The 
entire existence of madness, in the world now being prepared for 
it, was enveloped in what we may call, in anticipation, a “parental 
complex.” The prestige of patriarchy is revived around madness 
in the bourgeois family. It is this historical sedimentation which 
psychoanalysis would later bring to light, according it through a 
new myth the meaning of a destiny that supposedly marked all of 
Western culture and perhaps all civilization, whereas it had been 
slowly deposited by it and only solidified quite recently at the 
turn of this century, when madness was doubly alienated within 
the family—by the myth of a disalienation in patriarchal purity, 
and by a truly alienating situation in an asylum constituted in the
