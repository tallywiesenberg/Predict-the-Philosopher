structures and symbols, would be, par excellence , inadapted and 
out of time. And exactly where animality manifested a presence 
without history, an eternal return, would slowly reappear the 
immemorial scars of old hatreds, old family profanations, the 
forgotten signs of incest and punishment. 

Pinel advocates no religious segregation. Or rather, a 
segregation that functions in the opposite direction from that 
practiced by Tuke. The benefits of the renovated asylum were 
offered to all, or almost all, except the fanatics “who believe 
themselves inspired and seek to make converts.” Bicetre and La 
Salpetriere, according to Pinefs intention, form a complementary 
figure to the Retreat. 

Religion must not be the moral substratum of life in the 
asylum, but purely and simply a medical object: “Religious 
opinions in a hospital for the insane must be considered only in a 
strictly medical relation, that is, one must set aside all other 
considerations of public worship and political belief, and 
investigate only whether it is necessary to oppose the exaltation 
of ideas and feelings that may originate in this source, in order to 
effect the cure of certain alienated minds.”9 A source of strong 
emotions and terrifying images which it arouses through fears of 
the Beyond, Catholicism frequently provokes madness; it 
generates delirious beliefs, entertains hallucinations, leads men to 
despair and to melancholia. We must not be surprised if, 
“examining the registers of the insane asylum at Bicetre, we find 
inscribed there many priests and monks, as well as country 
people maddened by a frightening picture of the future.” Still less 
surprising is it to see the number of religious madnesses vary. 
Under the Old Regime and during the Revolution, the strength 
of superstitious beliefs, or the violence of the struggles in which 
the Republic opposed the Catholic Church, multiplied 
melancholias of religious origin. With the return of peace, the

Concordat having erased the struggles, these forms of delirium 
disappeared; in the Year X, 50 per cent of the melancholics in 
Bicetre were suffering from religious madness, 33 per cent the 
following year, and only 18 per cent in the Year XII. The asylum 
must thus be freed from religion and from all its iconographic 
connections; “melancholics by devotion” must not be allowed 
their pious books; experience “teaches that this is the surest 
means of perpetuating insanity or even of making it incurable, 
and the more such permission is granted, the less we manage to 
calm anxiety and scruples.” Nothing takes us further from Tuke 
and his dreams of a religious community that would at the same
