The asylum is a religious domain without religion, a domain 
of pure morality, of ethical uniformity. Everything that might 
retain the signs of the old differences was eliminated. The last 
vestiges of rite were extinguished. Formerly the house of 
confinement had inherited, in the social sphere, the almost 
absolute limits of the lazar house; it was a foreign country. Now 
the asylum must represent the great continuity of social morality. 
The values of family and work, all the acknowledged virtues, 
now reign in the asylum. But their reign is a double one. First, 
they prevail in fact, at the heart of madness itself; beneath the 
violence and disorder of insanity, the solid nature of the essential 
virtues is not disrupted. There is a primitive morality which is 
ordinarily not affected even by the worst dementia; it is this

morality which both appears and functions in the cure: “I can 
generally testify to the pure virtues and severe principles often 
manifested by the cure. Nowhere except in novels have I seen 
spouses more worthy of being cherished, parents more tender, 
lovers more passionate, or persons more attached to their duties 
than the majority of the insane fortunately brought to the period 
of convalescence.”10 This inalienable virtue is both the truth and 
the resolution of madness. Which is why, if it reigns, it must 
reign as well. The asylum reduces differences, represses vice, 
eliminates irregularities. It denounces everything that opposes 
the essential virtues of society: celibacy—“the number of girls 
fallen into idiocy is seven times greater than the number of 
married women for the Year XI and the Year XIII; for dementia, 
the proportion is two to four times greater; we can thus deduce 
that marriage constitutes for women a kind of preservative 
against the two sorts of insanity which are most inveterate and 
most often incurable”; debauchery, misconduct, and “extreme 
perversity of habits”—“vicious habits such as drunkenness, 
limitless promiscuity, an apathetic lack of concern can gradually 
degrade the reason and end in outright insanity”; laziness—“it is 
the most constant and unanimous result of experience that in all 
public asylums, as in prisons and hospitals, the surest and 
perhaps the sole guarantee of the maintenance of health and 
good habits and order is the law of rigorously executed 
mechanical work.” The asylum sets itself the task of the 
homogeneous rule of morality, its rigorous extension to all those 
who tend to escape from it. 

But it thereby generates an indifference; if the law does not
