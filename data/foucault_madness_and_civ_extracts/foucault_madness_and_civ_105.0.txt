itself, madness had no immediate grasp of its own character. 
With Pinel, on the contrary, observation operated only within 
the space defined by madness, without surface or exterior limits. 
Madness would see itself, would be seen by itself—pure spectacle 
and absolute subject. 

“Three insane persons, each of whom believed himself to be a 
king, and each of whom took the title Louis XVI, quarreled one 
day over the prerogatives of royalty, and defended them 
somewhat too energetically. The keeper approached one of them, 
and drawing him aside, asked: ‘Why do you argue with these 
men who are evidently mad? Doesn’t everyone know that you 
should be recognized as Louis XVI?’ Flattered by this homage, 
the madman immediately withdrew, glancing at the others with 
a disdainful hauteur. The same trick worked with the second 
patient. And thus in an instant there no longer remained any 
trace of an argument.”13 This is the first phase, that of 
exaltation. Madness is made to observe itself, but in others: it

appears in them as a baseless pretense—in other words, as 
absurd. However, in this observation that condemns others, the 
madman assures his own justification and the certainty of being 
adequate to his delirium. The rift between presumption and 
reality allows itself to be recognized only in the object. It is 
entirely masked, on the contrary, in the subject, which becomes 
immediate truth and absolute judge: the exalted sovereignty that 
denounces the others’ false sovereignty dispossesses them and 
thus confirms itself in the unfailing plenitude of presumption. 
Madness, as simple delirium, is projected onto others; as perfect 
unconsciousness, it is entirely accepted. 

It is at this point that the mirror, as an accomplice, becomes 
an agent of demystification. Another inmate of Bicetre, also 
believing himself a king, always expressed himself “in a tone of 
command and with supreme authority.” One day when he was 
calmer, the keeper approached him and asked why, if he were a 
sovereign, he did not put an end to his detention, and why he 
remained mingled with madmen of all kinds. Resuming this 
speech the following days, “he made him see, little by little, the 
absurdity of his pretensions, showed him another madman who 
had also been long convinced that he possessed supreme power 
and had become an object of mockery. At first the maniac felt 
shaken, soon he cast doubts upon his title of sovereign, and 
finally he came to realize his chimerical vagaries. It was in two 
weeks that this unexpected moral revolution took place, and after 
several months of tests, this worthy father was restored to his
