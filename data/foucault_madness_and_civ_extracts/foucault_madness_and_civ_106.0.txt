madness is ceaselessly called upon to judge itself. But beyond 
this, it is at every moment judged from without; judged not by 
moral or scientific conscience, but by a sort of invisible tribunal 
in permanent session. The asylum Pinel dreamed of and partly 
realized at Bicetre, but especially at La Salpetriere, is a juridical 
microcosm. To be efficacious, this judgment must be 
redoubtable in aspect; all the iconographic apanage of the judge 
and the executioner must be present in the mind of the madman, 
so that he understands what universe of judgment he now 
belongs to. The decor of justice, in all its terror and 
implacability, will thus be part of the treatment. One of the 
inmates at Bicetre suffered from a religious delirium animated by 
a fear of hell; he believed that the only way he could escape 
eternal damnation was by rigorous abstinence. It was necessary to 
compensate this fear of a remote justice by the presence of a 
more immediate and still more redoubtable one: “Could the 
irresistible curse of his sinister ideas be counterbalanced other 
than by the impression of a strong and deep fear?” One evening, 
the director came to the patient’s door “with matter likely to 
produce fear—an angry eye, a thundering tone of voice, a group 
of the staff armed with strong chains that they shook noisily. 
They set some soup beside the madman and gave him precise 
orders to eat it during the night, or else suffer the most cruel 
treatment. They retired, and left the madman in the most 
distressed state of indecision between the punishment with 
which he was threatened and the frightening prospect of the 
torments in the life to come. After an inner combat of several 
hours, the former idea prevailed, and he decided to take some 
nourishment. ”15 

The asylum as a juridical instance recognized no other. It 
judged immediately, and without appeal. It possessed its own 
instruments of punishment, and used them as it saw fit. The old 
confinement had generally been practiced outside of normal

juridical forms, but it imitated the punishment of criminals, 
using the same prisons, the same dungeons, the same physical 
brutality. The justice that reigned in Pinefs asylum did not 
borrow its modes of repression from the other justice, but 
invented its own. Or rather, it used the therapeutic methods that 
had become known in the eighteenth century, but used them as
