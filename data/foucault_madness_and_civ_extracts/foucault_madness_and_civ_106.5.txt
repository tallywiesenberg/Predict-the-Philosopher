chastisements. And this is not the least of the paradoxes of 
Pinefs “philanthropic” and “liberating” enterprise, this 
conversion of medicine into justice, of therapeutics into 
repression. In the medicine of the classical period, baths and 
showers were used as remedies as a result of the physicians’ 
vagaries about the nature of the nervous system: the intention 
was to refresh the organism, to relax the desiccated fibers; it is 
true that they also added, among the happy consequences of the 
cold shower, the psychological effect of the unpleasant surprise 
which interrupted the course of ideas and changed the nature of 
sentiments; but we were still in the landscape of medical 
speculation. With Pinel, the use of the shower became frankly 
juridical; the shower was the habitual punishment of the ordinary 
police tribunal that sat permanently at the asylum: “Considered 
as a means of repression, it often suffices to subject to the general 
law of manual labor a madman who is susceptible to it, in order 
to conquer an obstinate refusal to take nourishment, and to 
subjugate insane persons carried away by a sort of turbulent and 
reasoned humor.” 

Everything was organized so that the madman would 
recognize himself in a world of judgment that enveloped him on 
all sides; he must know that he is watched, judged, and 
condemned; from transgression to punishment, the connection 
must be evident, as a guilt recognized by all: “We profit from the 
circumstance of the bath, remind him of the transgression, or of 
the omission of an important duty, and with the aid of a faucet 
suddenly release a shower of cold water upon his head, which 
often disconcerts the madman or drives out a predominant idea

by a strong and unexpected impression; if the idea persists, the 
shower is repeated, but care is taken to avoid the hard tone and 
the shocking terms that would cause rebellion; on the contrary, 
the madman is made to understand that it is for his sake and 
reluctantly that we resort to such violent measures; sometimes we 
add a joke, taking care not to go too far with it.”16 This almost 
arithmetical obviousness of punishment, repeated as often as 
necessary, the recognition of transgression by its repression—all 
this must end in the internalization of the juridical instance, and 
the birth of remorse in the inmate’s mind: it is only at this point 
that the judges agree to stop the punishment, certain that it will 
continue indefinitely in the inmate’s conscience. One maniac had 
the habit of tearing her clothes and breaking any object that 
came into her hands; she was given showers, she was put into a 
straitjacket, she finally appeared “humiliated and dismayed”; but
