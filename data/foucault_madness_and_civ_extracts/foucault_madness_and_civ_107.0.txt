fearing that this shame might be transitory and this remorse too 
superficial, “the director, in order to impress a feeling of terror 
upon her, spoke to her with the most energetic firmness, but 
without anger, and announced to her that she would henceforth 
be treated with the greatest severity.” The desired result was not 
long in coming: “Her repentance was announced by a torrent of 
tears which she shed for almost two hours.” The cycle is 
complete twice over: the transgression is punished and its author 
recognizes her guilt. 

There were, however, madmen who escaped from this 
movement and resisted the moral synthesis it brought about. 
These latter would be set apart in the heart of the asylum, 
forming a new confined population, which could not even relate 
to justice. When we speak of Pinel and his work of liberation, we 
too often omit this second reclusion. We have already seen that 
he denied the benefits of asylum reform to “fanatics who believe 
themselves inspired and seek to make converts, and who take a 
perfidious pleasure in inciting the other madmen to disobedience

on the pretext that it is better to obey God than man.” But 
confinement and the dungeon will be equally obligatory for 
“those who cannot be subjected to the general law of work and 
who, in malicious activity, enjoy tormenting the other inmates, 
provoking and ceaselessly inciting them to subjects of discord,” 
and for women “who during their seizures have an irresistible 
propensity to steal anything they can lay their hands on.” 
Disobedience by religious fanaticism, resistance to work, and 
theft, the three great transgressions against bourgeois society, the 
three major offenses against its essential values, are not excusable, 
even by madness; they deserve imprisonment pure and simple, 
exclusion in the most rigorous sense of the term, since they all 
manifest the same resistance to the moral and social uniformity 
that forms the raison d'etre of Pinefs asylum. 

Formerly, unreason was set outside of judgment, to be 
delivered, arbitrarily, to the powers of reason. Now it is judged, 
and not only upon entering the asylum, in order to be 
recognized, classified, and made innocent forever; it is caught, on 
the contrary, in a perpetual judgment, which never ceases to 
pursue it and to apply sanctions, to proclaim its transgressions, to 
require honorable amends, to exclude, finally, those whose 
transgressions risk compromising the social order. Madness 
escaped from the arbitrary only in order to enter a kind of 
endless trial for which the asylum furnished simultaneously 
police, magistrates, and torturers; a trial whereby any
