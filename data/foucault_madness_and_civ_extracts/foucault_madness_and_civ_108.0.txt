becomes almost obligatory for the confinement of madmen. But 
within the asylum itself, the doctor takes a preponderant place, 
insofar as he converts it into a medical space. However, and this 
is the essential point, the doctor s intervention is not made by 
virtue of a medical skill or power that he possesses in himself and 
that would be justified by a body of objective knowledge. It is not 
as a scientist that homo medicus has authority in the asylum, but 
as a wise man. If the medical profession is required, it is as a 
juridical and moral guarantee, not in the name of science. A man 
of great probity, of utter virtue and scruple, who had had long 
experience in the asylum would do as well. For the medical 
enterprise is only a part of an enormous moral task that must be 
accomplished at the asylum, and which alone can ensure the cure 
of the insane: “Must it not be an inviolable law in the 
administration of any establishment for the insane, whether 
public or private, to grant the maniac all the liberty that the 
safety of his person and of that of others permits, and to 
proportion his repression to the greater or lesser seriousness of 
danger of his deviations ..., to gather all the facts that can serve 
to enlighten the physician in treatment, to study with care the 
particular varieties of behavior and temperament, and 
accordingly to use gentleness or firmness, conciliatory terms or 
the tone of authority and an inflexible severity?”! o According to 
Samuel Tuke, the first doctor appointed at the Retreat was 
recommended by his “indefatigable perseverance”; doubtless he 
had no particular knowledge of mental illnesses when he entered 
the asylum, but “he entered on his office with the anxiety and 
ardor of a feeling mind, upon the exertion of whose skill, 
depended the dearest interest of many of his fellow-creatures.” 
He tried the various remedies that his own common sense and 
the experience of his predecessors suggested. But he was soon 
disappointed, not because the results were bad, or that the 
number of cures was minimal: “Yet the medical means were so

imperfectly connected with the progress of recovery, that he 
could not avoid suspecting them, to be rather concomitants than 
causes.” He then realized that there was little to be done using 
the medical methods known up to that time. The concern for 
humanity prevailed within him, and he decided to use no 
medicament that would be too disagreeable to the patient. But it 
must not be thought that the doctor s role had little importance
