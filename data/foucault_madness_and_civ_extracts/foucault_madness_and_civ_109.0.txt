girl she would henceforth be treated with all the severity she 
deserved, for she herself was opposed to her cure and 
dissimulated with insurmountable obstinacy the basic cause of 
her illness.” Through this new rigor and these threats, the sick 
girl felt “profoundly moved ... she ended by acknowledging her 
wrongs and making a frank confession that she had suffered a 
loss of reason as the result of a forbidden romantic attachment, 
naming the person who had been its object.” After this first 
confession, the cure became easy: “a most favorable alteration 
occurred ... she was henceforth soothed and could not 
sufficiently express her gratitude toward the keeper who had 
brought an end to her continual agitation, and had restored 
tranquillity and calm to her heart.” There is not a moment of the 
story that could not be transcribed in psychoanalytical terms. To 
such a degree was it true that the medical personage, according 
to Pinel, had to act not as the result of an objective definition of 
the disease or a specific classifying diagnosis, but by relying upon

that prestige which envelops the secrets of the Family, of 
Authority, of Punishment, and of Love; it is by bringing such 
powers into play, by wearing the mask of Father and of Judge, 
that the physician, by one of those abrupt short cuts that leave 
aside mere medical competence, became the almost magic 
perpetrator of the cure, and assumed the aspect of a 
Thaumaturge; it was enough that he observed and spoke, to 
cause secret faults to appear, insane presumptions to vanish, and 
madness at last to yield to reason. His presence and his words 
were gifted with that power of disalienation, which at one blow 
revealed the transgression and restored the order of morality. 

It is a curious paradox to see medical practice enter the 
uncertain domain of the quasi-miraculous at the very moment 
when the knowledge of mental illness tries to assume a positive 
meaning. On the one hand, madness puts itself at a distance in 
an objective field where the threats of unreason disappear; but at 
this same moment, the madman tends to form with the doctor, 
in an unbroken unity, a “couple” whose complicity dates back to 
very old links. Life in the asylum as Tuke and Pinel constituted it 
permitted the birth of that delicate structure which would 
become the essential nucleus of madness—a structure that 
formed a kind of microcosm in which were symbolized the 
massive structures of bourgeois society and its values: Family- 
Child relations, centered on the theme of paternal authority; 
Transgression-Punishment relations, centered on the theme of 
immediate justice; Madness-Disorder relations, centered on the
