We 
accede, beyond what is manifested in madness, to delirium , to 
that essential and constitutive structure which had secretly 
sustained madness from the first.This delirium has a name, 
Hermione; Hermione who no longer reappears as a hallucinatory 
vision, but as the ultimate truth of madness.It is significant that 
Hermione intervenes at this very moment of the frenzy: not 
among the Eumenides, nor ahead of themâ€”to guide them; but 
behind and separated from them by the night into which they 
have dragged Orestes and in which they themselves are now 
scattered.Hermione intervenes as a figure of delirium, as the 
truth which secretly reigned from the start, and of which the 
Eumenides were ultimately only the servants.Here we are at the 
opposite of Greek tragedy, where the Erinnyes were the final 
destiny and truth which, in the night of time, had awaited the 
hero; his passion was merely their instrument.
