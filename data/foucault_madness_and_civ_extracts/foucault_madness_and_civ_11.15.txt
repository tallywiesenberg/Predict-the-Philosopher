Unreason can appear only for a 
moment, the instant when language enters silence, when 
delirium itself is stilled, when the heart is at last devoured.In the tragedies of the early seventeenth century, madness, 
too, released drama; but it did so by liberating truth; madness 
still had access to language, to a renewed language of explanation 
and of reality reconquered.It could be at most only the 
penultimate moment of the tragedy.Not the last, as in 
Andromaque , in which no truth is uttered except the truth, in 
delirium, of a passion which has found with madness the 
perfection of its fulfillment.The movement proper to unreason, which classical learning

trajectory in the concision of tragic language.
