After which, 
silence could reign, and madness disappear in the—always 
withdrawn—presence of unreason.What we now know of unreason affords us a better 
understanding of what confinement was.This gesture, which banished madness to a neutral and 
uniform world of exclusion, did not mark a halt in the evolution 
of medical techniques, nor in the progress of humanitarian ideas.It assumed its precise meaning in this fact: that madness in the 
classical period ceased to be the sign of another world, and that it 
became the paradoxical manifestation of non-being.Ultimately, 
confinement did seek to suppress madness, to eliminate from the 
social order a figure which did not find its place within it; the 
essence of confinement was not the exorcism of a danger.
