Confinement merely manifested what madness, in its essence, 
was: a manifestation of non-being; and by providing this 
manifestation, confinement thereby suppressed it, since it 
restored it to its truth as nothingness.Confinement is the 
practice which corresponds most exactly to madness experienced 
as unreason, that is, as the empty negativity of reason; by 
confinement, madness is acknowledged to be nothing.That is, on 
one hand madness is immediately perceived as difference: 
whence the forms of spontaneous and collective judgment 
sought, not from physicians, but from men of good sense, to 
determine the confinement of a madman; and on the other hand, 
confinement cannot have any other goal than a correction (that 
is, the suppression of the difference, or the fulfillment of this 
nothingness in death); whence those options for death so often 
to be found in the registers of confinement, written by the 
attendants, and which are not the sign of confinementâ€™s savagery, 
its inhumanity or perversion, but the strict expression of its 
meaning: an operation to annihilate nothingness.20

Confinement sketches, on the surface of phenomena and in a 
hasty moral synthesis, the secret and distinct structure of 
madness.Then did confinement establish its practices in this profound 
intuition?Was it because madness under the effect of 
confinement had really vanished from the classical horizon that it 
was ultimately stigmatized as non-being?
