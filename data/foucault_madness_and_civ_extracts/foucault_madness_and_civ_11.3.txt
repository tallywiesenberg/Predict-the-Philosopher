Questions whose 
answers refer to each other in a perfect circularity.It is futile, no 
doubt, to lose oneself in the endless cycle of these forms of 
interrogation.Better to let classical culture formulate, in its 
general structure, the experience it had of madness, an experience 
which crops up with the same meanings, in the identical order of 
its inner logic, in both the order of speculation and the order of 
institutions, in both discourse and decree, in both word and 
watchwordâ€”wherever, in fact, a signifying element can assume 
for us the value of a language.126

ASPECTS OF MADNESS 


IN this chapter we do not wish to write a history of the different 
notions of psychiatry in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, but rather to show the specific faces by which madness 
was recognized in classical thought.Faces still haunted by 
mythical figures, but which have often been essential in the 
organization of our practical knowledge.
