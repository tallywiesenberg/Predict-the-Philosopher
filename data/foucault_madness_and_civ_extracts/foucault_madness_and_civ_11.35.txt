I. Mania and Melancholia 


The notion of melancholia was fixed, in the sixteenth century, 
between a certain definition by symptoms and an explanatory 
principle concealed in the very term that designated it.Among 
the symptoms, we find all the delirious ideas an individual can 
form about himself: “Some think themselves to be beasts, whose 
voice and actions they imitate.Some think that they are vessels 
of glass, and for this reason recoil from passers-by, lest they 
break; others fear death, which they yet cause most often to 
themselves.Still others imagine that they are guilty of some 
crime, so that they tremble with terror when they see another 
coming toward them, thinking he seeks to take them prisoner 

and sentence them to death.” Delirious themes that remain 
isolated and do not compromise reason’s totality.Thomas 
Sydenham would even observe that melancholics “are people 
who, apart from their complaint, are prudent and sensible, and 
who have an extraordinary penetration and sagacity.
