Thus 
Aristotle rightly observed that melancholics have more 
intelligence than other men.” 

Now this clear and coherent syndrome was designated by a 
word that implied an entire causal system, that of melancholia: “I 
beg you to regard closely the thoughts of melancholies, their 
words, visions, actions, and you will discover how all their senses 
are depraved by a melancholic humor spread through their 
brain.”2 Partial delirium and the action of black bile were 
juxtaposed in the notion of melancholia, unrelated for the 
moment beyond a disjunct confrontation of a group of signs by a 
signifying name.Yet in the eighteenth century a unity would be 
found, or rather an exchange would be made—the nature of that 
cold, black humor having become the major coloration of 
delirium, its positive value in contrast to mania, dementia, and

frenzy, its essential principle of cohesion.And while Hermann 
Boerhaave still defined melancholia as merely “a long, persistent 
delirium without fever, during which the sufferer is obsessed by 
only one thought,” Dufour, several years later, shifted the weight 
of his definition to “fear and sadness,” which were now supposed 
to explain the partial character of the delirium: “Hence it is that 
melancholies love solitude and shun company; this makes them 
more attached to the object of their delirium or to their 
dominant passion, whatever it may be, while they seem 
indifferent to anything else.” The concept is fixed not by a new 
rigor in observation, nor by a discovery in the realm of causes, 
but by a qualitative transmission proceeding from a cause implied 
in the designation to a significant perception in the effects.For a long time—until the beginning of the seventeenth 
century—the discussion of melancholia remained fixed within 
the tradition of the four humors and their essential qualities: 
stable qualities actually inherent in a substance, which alone 
could be considered as their cause.For Jean Fernel, the 
melancholic humor, related to earth and to autumn, is a juice 
“thick in consistency, cold and dry in temperament.” But in the 
first half of the century, a debate began over the origin of 
melancholia: must one necessarily have a melancholic 
temperament to be afflicted with melancholia?
