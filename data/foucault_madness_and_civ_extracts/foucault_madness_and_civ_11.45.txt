Is the 
melancholic humor always cold and dry—is it never warm, or 
humid?Is it the substance which acts, or the qualities which are 
transmitted?The results of this long debate may be summarized 
as follows: 

1.The causality of substances is increasingly replaced by a 
movement of qualities , which, without any vehicular means, are 
immediately transmitted from body to soul, from humor to ideas, 
from organs to conduct.Thus, for Duncan’s Apologist the best 
proof that the melancholic juice produces melancholia is that in 
it one finds the very qualities of the disease: “The melancholic 
juice possesses to a far greater degree the conditions necessary to

produce melancholia than your fiery angers; since by its coldness, 
it diminishes the quantity of spirits; by its dryness, it renders 
them capable of preserving for a long time the type of a strong 
and persistent imagination; and by its blackness, it deprives them 
of their natural clarity and subtlety.”3
