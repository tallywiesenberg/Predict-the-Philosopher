There is, besides this mechanics of qualities, a dynamics 
that analyzes the strength to be found imprisoned in each.Thus 
cold and dryness can enter into conflict with the temperament, 
and this opposition will generate symptoms of melancholia 
violent in proportion to the struggle: the strength that prevails 
and sweeps away all that resists it.Thus women, whose nature is 
little inclined to melancholy, fall a prey to it all the more 
seriously: “They are cruelly used and violently disturbed by it, for 
melancholia being more opposed to their temperament, it 
removes them further from their natural constitution.”4

is generated.
