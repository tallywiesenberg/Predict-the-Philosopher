A quality may alter in the course of its development 
and become the opposite of what it was.Thus when “the entrails 
are heated, when all simmers within the body ... and all the 
juices are consumed,” then this conflagration can turn to cold 
melancholia—producing “almost the same thing caused by the 
flow of wax in a torch turned upside down....This cooling of the 
body is the ordinary effect which follows immoderate heat once 
it has thrown off and exhausted its vigor.”5 There is a kind of 
dialectic of qualities which, free from any constraint of substance, 
from any predetermination, makes its way through reversals and 
contradictions.4.
