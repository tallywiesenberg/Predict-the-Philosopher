Finally, qualities may be altered by accidents, circumstances, 
the conditions of life; so that a being who is dry and cold can 
become warm and humid, if his way of life inclines him to it; as 
in the case of women: they “remain in idleness, their bodies tend 
to perspire less [than those of men], and heat, spirits, and 
humors remain within.”6

Thus freed from a confining substantial basis, qualities would 
be able to play an organizing and integrating role in the notion 
of melancholia.On the one hand, they would trace, among the 
symptoms and manifestations, a certain profile of sadness, of 
blackness, of slowness, of immobility.On the other, they would 
suggest a causal basis which would no longer be the physiology 
of a humor, but the pathology of an idea, of a fear, of a terror.The morbid entity was not defined from observed signs nor from 
supposed causes; but somewhere between, and beyond both, it 
was perceived as a certain qualitative coherence, which had its 
own laws of transmission, of development, and of 
transformation.It is the secret logic of this quality that controls 
the development of the idea of melancholia, not medical theory.
