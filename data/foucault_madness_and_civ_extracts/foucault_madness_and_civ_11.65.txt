This is evident as early as Thomas Willis’s texts.At first glance, the coherence of their analyses is vouched for 
on the level of speculative reflection.Willis’s explanation is 
borrowed whole from animal spirits and their mechanical 
properties.Melancholia is “a madness without fever or frenzy, 
accompanied by fear and sadness.” To the extent that it is 
delirium—that is, an essential break with truth—its origin 
resides in a disordered movement of the spirits and in a defective 
state of the brain; but can that fear, that anxiety which makes 
melancholics “sad and punctilious,” be explained by movements 
alone?Might there be a mechanism of fear and a circulation of 
spirits that is peculiar to sadness?
