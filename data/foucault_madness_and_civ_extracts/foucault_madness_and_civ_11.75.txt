In melancholia, the spirits are swept by an agitation, but a 
feeble agitation, without power or violence: a sort of impotent 
jostling which does not follow marked paths, nor open roads 
(aperta opercula ), but traverses the cerebral matter by endlessly 
creating new pores; yet the spirits do not wander far upon the 
paths they trace; very soon their agitation languishes, their 

strength fails, and the movement stops: “they do not reach far.”?Thus such disturbance, common to all delirium, can produce on 
the surface of the body neither those violent movements nor 
those cries that may be observed in mania and frenzy; 
melancholia never reaches violence; it is madness at the limits of 
its powerless ness.This paradox is the result of the secret 
alterations of the spirits.Usually they have the quasi-immediate 
rapidity and the absolute transparence of luminous rays; but in 
melancholia, they are charged with darkness; they become 
“obscure, opaque, shadowy”; and the images of things which they 
bear to the brain and to the mind are veiled with “shadow and 
with shades.” They become heavy and closer to a dark chemical 
vapor than to pure light.A chemical vapor that would be of an 
acid nature, rather than sulfurous or alcoholic: for in acid vapors 
the particles are mobile, and even incapable of rest, but their 
activity is weak, without effect; when they are distilled, nothing 
remains in the alembic but an insipid phlegm.
