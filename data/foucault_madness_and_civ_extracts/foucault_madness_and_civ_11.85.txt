Now it was from the body’s liquid and solid elements 
that the secret of disease was sought.The Medical Dictionary 
which Robert James published in England in 1743 proposes, 
under Mania , a comparative etiology of that disease and of 
melancholia: “It is evident that the brain is the seat ... of all 
diseases of this nature....It is there that the Creator has fixed, 
although in a manner which is inconceivable, the lodging of the 
soul, the mind, genius, imagination, memory, and all sensations.... All these noble functions will be changed, depraved, 
diminished, and totally destroyed, if the blood and the humors 
corrupted in quality and quantity are no longer carried to the 
brain in a uniform and temperate manner, but instead circulate 
there with violence and impetuosity, or move about slowly, with 
difficulty or with languor.” It is this languishing flow, these 
choked vessels, this heavy, clogged blood that the heart labors to 
distribute throughout the organism, and which has difficulty 
penetrating into the very fine arterioles of the brain, where the 
circulation ought to be very rapid in order to maintain the 
movement of thought—it is all this distressing obstruction which 
explains melancholia.Heaviness, encumbrance—here again the 
primitive qualities guide analysis.
