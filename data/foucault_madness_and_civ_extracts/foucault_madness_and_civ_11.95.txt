But should the sensation become even 
stronger, then the tension increases to such a degree in the other 
fibers that they become incapable of vibrating; the state of 
rigidity is such that the flow of blood is stopped and the animal 
spirits immobilized.Melancholia has set in.In the other form of 
disease, the “liquid form,” the humors are impregnated with 
black bile; they become thicker; clogged with these humors, the 
blood thickens and stagnates in the meninges until it compresses 
the principal organs of the nervous system.Then we find again 
the rigidity of the fibers, but in this case it is no more than a 
consequence of a humoral phenomenon.Lorry distinguishes two 
melancholias: actually it is the same group of qualities, affording 
melancholia its real unity, that he employs successively in two 
explanatory systems.
