competence, it was thought, and by the patient first of all, that it

was in the esotericism of his knowledge, in some almost 
daemonic secret of knowledge, that the doctor had found the 
power to unravel insanity; and increasingly the patient would 
accept this self-surrender to a doctor both divine and satanic, 
beyond human measure in any case; increasingly he would 
alienate himself in the physician, accepting entirely and in 
advance all his prestige, submitting from the very first to a will 
he experienced as magic, and to a science he regarded as 
prescience and divination, thus becoming the ideal and perfect 
correlative of those powers he projected upon the doctor, pure 
object without any resistance except his own inertia, quite ready 
to become precisely that hysteric in whom Charcot exalted the 
doctor’s marvelous powers. If we wanted to analyze the profound 
structures of objectivity in the knowledge and practice of 
nineteenth-century psychiatry from Pinel to Freud, 20 we should 
have to show in fact that such objectivity was from the start a 
reification of a magical nature, which could only be accomplished 
with the complicity of the patient himself, and beginning from a 
transparent and clear moral practice, gradually forgotten as 
positivism imposed its myths of scientific objectivity; a practice 
forgotten in its origins and its meaning, but always used and 
always present. What we call psychiatric practice is a certain 
moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth 
century, preserved in the rites of asylum life, and overlaid by the 
myths of positivism. 

But if the doctor soon became a thaumaturge for the patient, 
he could not be one in his own positivist doctor’s eyes. That 
obscure power whose origin he no longer knew, in which he 
could not decipher the patient’s complicity, and in which he 
would not consent to acknowledge the ancient powers which 
constituted it, nevertheless had to be given some status; and since 
nothing in positivist understanding could justify such a transfer 
of will or similar remote-control operations, the moment would

soon come when madness itself would be held responsible for 
such anomalies. These cures without basis, which must be 
recognized as not being false cures, would soon become the true 
cures of false illnesses. Madness was not what one believed, nor
