competence, it was thought, and by the patient first of all, that it

was in the esotericism of his knowledge, in some almost 
daemonic secret of knowledge, that the doctor had found the 
power to unravel insanity; and increasingly the patient would 
accept this self-surrender to a doctor both divine and satanic, 
beyond human measure in any case; increasingly he would 
alienate himself in the physician, accepting entirely and in 
advance all his prestige, submitting from the very first to a will 
he experienced as magic, and to a science he regarded as 
prescience and divination, thus becoming the ideal and perfect 
correlative of those powers he projected upon the doctor, pure 
object without any resistance except his own inertia, quite ready 
to become precisely that hysteric in whom Charcot exalted the 
doctor’s marvelous powers. If we wanted to analyze the profound 
structures of objectivity in the knowledge and practice of 
nineteenth-century psychiatry from Pinel to Freud, 20 we should 
have to show in fact that such objectivity was from the start a 
reification of a magical nature, which could only be accomplished 
with the complicity of the patient himself, and beginning from a 
transparent and clear moral practice, gradually forgotten as 
positivism imposed its myths of scientific objectivity; a practice 
forgotten in its origins and its meaning, but always used and 
always present. What we call psychiatric practice is a certain 
moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth 
century, preserved in the rites of asylum life, and overlaid by the 
myths of positivism. 

But if the doctor soon became a thaumaturge for the patient, 
he could not be one in his own positivist doctor’s eyes. That 
obscure power whose origin he no longer knew, in which he 
could not decipher the patient’s complicity, and in which he 
would not consent to acknowledge the ancient powers which 
constituted it, nevertheless had to be given some status; and since 
nothing in positivist understanding could justify such a transfer 
of will or similar remote-control operations, the moment would

soon come when madness itself would be held responsible for 
such anomalies. These cures without basis, which must be 
recognized as not being false cures, would soon become the true 
cures of false illnesses. Madness was not what one believed, nor 
what it believed itself to be; it was infinitely less than itself: a 
combination of persuasion and mystification. We can see here 
the genesis of Babinskf s pithiatism. And by a strange reversal, 
thought leaped back almost two centuries to the era when 
between madness, false madness, and the simulation of madness, 
the limit was indistinct—identical symptoms confused to the 
point where transgression replaced unity; further still, medical 
thought finally effected an identification over which all Western 
thought since Greek medicine had hesitated: the identification of 
madness with madness—that is, of the medical concept with the 
critical concept of madness. At the end of the nineteenth 
century, and in the thought of Babinski’s contemporaries, we 
find that prodigious postulate, which no medicine had yet dared 
formulate: that madness, after all, was only madness. 

Thus while the victim of mental illness is entirely alienated in 
the real person of his doctor, the doctor dissipates the reality of 
the mental illness in the critical concept of madness. So that 
there remains, beyond the empty forms of positivist thought, 
only a single concrete reality: the doctor-patient couple in which 
all alienations are summarized, linked, and loosened. And it is to 
this degree that all nineteenth-century psychiatry really 
converges on Freud, the first man to accept in all its seriousness 
the reality of the physician-patient couple, the first to consent 
not to look away nor to investigate elsewhere, the first not to 
attempt to hide it in a psychiatric theory that more or less 
harmonized with the rest of medical knowledge; the first to 
follow its consequences with absolute rigor. Freud demystified all 
the other asylum structures: he abolished silence and observation, 
he eliminated madness’s recognition of itself in the mirror of its 
own spectacle, he silenced the instances of condemnation. But 


287 



on the other hand he exploited the structure that enveloped the 
medical personage; he amplified its thaumaturgical virtues, 
preparing for its omnipotence a quasi-divine status. He focussed 
upon this single presence—concealed behind the patient and 
above him, in an absence that is also a total presence—all the 
powers that had been distributed in the collective existence of the 
asylum; he transformed this into an absolute Observation, a pure 
and circumspect Silence, a Judge who punishes and rewards in a 
judgment that does not even condescend to language; he made it 
the Mirror in which madness, in an almost motionless 
movement, clings to and casts off itself. 

To the doctor, Freud transferred all the structures Pinel and
