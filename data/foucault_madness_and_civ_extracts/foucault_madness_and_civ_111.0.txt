Tuke had set up within confinement. He did deliver the patient 
from the existence of the asylum within which his “liberators” 
had alienated him; but he did not deliver him from what was 
essential in this existence; he regrouped its powers, extended 
them to the maximum by uniting them in the doctor s hands; he 
created the psychoanalytical situation where, by an inspired 
short-circuit, alienation becomes disalienating because, in the

voices of unreason, nor to decipher in themselves the signs of the 
madman. Psychoanalysis can unravel some of the forms of 
madness; it remains a stranger to the sovereign enterprise of 
unreason. It can neither liberate nor transcribe, nor most 
certainly explain, what is essential in this enterprise. 

Since the end of the eighteenth century, the life of unreason 
no longer manifests itself except in the lightning-flash of works 
such as those of Holderlin, of Nerval, of Nietzsche, or of Artaud

before that grovel of flesh in the void, that nakedness among 
bare walls, something related to a contemporary pathos: the 
symbolic tinsel that crowned the insane kings left in full view 
suppliant bodies, bodies vulnerable to chains and whips, which
