product of her imagination, the landscape that Dulle Griet 
moved through was marked by a whole human language. Goya s 
Monk, with that hot beast against his back, its paws on his 
shoulders and its mouth panting at his ear, remains alone: no 
secret is revealed. All that is present is the most internal, and at 
the same time the most savagely free, of forces: the power which 
hacks apart the bodies in the Gran Disparate, which breaks free 
and assaults our eyes in the Raging Madness. Beyond that point, 
the faces themselves decompose; this is no longer the madness of 
the Caprichos , which tied on masks truer than the truth of faces; 
this is a madness beneath the mask, a madness that eats away 
faces, corrodes features; there are no longer eyes or mouths, but 
glances shot from nowhere and staring at nothing (as in the 
Witches Sabbath ); or screams from black holes (as in the 
Pilgrimage of Saint Isidore). Madness has become man’s 
possibility of abolishing both man and the world—and even

those images that challenge the world and deform man. It is, far 
beyond dreams, beyond the nightmare of bestiality, the last 
recourse: the end and the beginning of everything. Not because it 
is a promise, as in German lyricism, but because it is the 
ambiguity of chaos and apocalypse: Goya s Idiot who shrieks and 
twists his shoulder to escape from the nothingness that 
imprisons him—is this the birth of the first man and his first 
movement toward liberty, or the last convulsion of the last dying 
man? 

And this madness that links and divides time, that twists the 
world into the ring of a single night, this madness so foreign to 
the experience of its contemporaries, does it not transmit—to 
those able to receive it, to Nietzsche and to Artaud—those barely 
audible voices of classical unreason, in which it was always a 
question of nothingness and night, but amplifying them now to 
shrieks and frenzy? But giving them for the first time an 
expression, a droit de cite , and a hold on Western culture which 
makes possible all contestations, as well as total contestation? But 
restoring their primitive savagery? 

Sade’s calm, patient language also gathers up the final words 
of unreason and also gives them, for the future, a remoter 
meaning. Between Goyas broken drawings and that 
uninterrupted stream of words continuing from the first volume 
of Justine to the tenth of Juliette , there is doubtless nothing in 
common except a certain movement that retraces the course of 
contemporary lyricism, drying up its sources, rediscovering the
