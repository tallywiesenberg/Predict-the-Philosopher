violence, the limitless application of the right of death—this 
entire society, whose only link is the very rejection of a link, 
appears to be a dismissal of nature—the only cohesion asked of 
individuals is intended to protect, not a natural existence, but the 
free exercise of sovereignty over and against nature. 4 The 
relation established by Rousseau is precisely reversed; sovereignty 
no longer transposes the natural existence; the latter is only an 
object for the sovereign, which permits him to measure his total 
liberty. Followed to its logical conclusion, desire leads only in 
appearance to the rediscovery of nature. Actually, for Sade there 
is no return to the natal terrain, no hope that the first rejection of 
social order may surreptitiously become the re-established order 
of happiness, through a dialectic of nature renouncing and thus 
confirming itself. The solitary madness of desire that still for 
Hegel, as for the eighteenth-century philosophers, plunges man 
into a natural world that is immediately resumed in a social 
world, for Sade merely casts man into a void that dominates 
nature in a total absence of proportion and community, into the 
endlessly repeated nonexistence of gratification. The night of 
madness is thus limitless; what might have been supposed to be 
man’s violent nature was only the infinity of non-nature. 

Here is the source of Sade’s great monotony: as he advances, 
the settings dissolve; the surprises, the incidents, the pathetic or 
dramatic links of the scenes vanish. What was still vicissitude in 
Justine —an event experienced, hence new—becomes in Juliette a 
sovereign game, always triumphant, without negativity, and 
whose perfection is such that its novelty can only be its similarity 
to itself. As with Goya, there are no longer any backgrounds for 
these meticulous Disparates. And yet in this absence of decor, 
which can as easily be total night as absolute day (there are no 
shadows in Sade), we advance slowly toward a goal: the death of 
Justine. Her innocence had exhausted even the desire to torment 
it. We cannot say that crime had not overcome her virtue; we

must say inversely that her natural virtue had brought her to the 
point of having exhausted all the possible means of being an 
object for crime. And at this point, when crime can do nothing 
more than drive her from the domain of its sovereignty (Juliette 
expels her from the Chateau de Noirceuil), Nature in her turn, so 
long dominated, scorned, profaned,5 submits entirely to that
