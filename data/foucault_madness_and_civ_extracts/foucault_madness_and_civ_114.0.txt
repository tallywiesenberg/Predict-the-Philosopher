as madness if it was called a work of art. But by admitting this 
very fact, there was no reduction of one by the other, but rather 
(remembering Montaigne) a discovery of the central incertitude 
where the work of art is born, at the moment when it stops being 
born and is truly a work of art. In this opposition, to which 
Tasso and Swift bore witness after Lucretius—and which it was 
vain to attempt to separate into lucid intervals and crises—was 
disclosed a distance where the very truth of a work of art raised a 
problem: was it madness, or a work of art? Inspiration, or 
hallucination? A spontaneous babble of words, or the pure 
origins of language? Must its truth, even before its birth, be 
taken from the wretched truth of men, or discovered far beyond 
its origin, in the being that it presumes? The madness of the 
writer was, for other men, the chance to see being born, over and 
over again, in the discouragement of repetition and disease, the 
truth of the work of art. 

The madness of Nietzsche, the madness of Van Gogh or of 
Artaud, belongs to their work perhaps neither more nor less

profoundly, but in quite another way. The frequency in the 
modern world of works of art that explode out of madness no 
doubt proves nothing about the reason of that world, about the 
meaning of such works, or even about the relations formed and 
broken between the real world and the artists who produced such 
works. And yet this frequency must be taken seriously, as if it 
were the insistence of a question: from the time of Holderlin and 
Nerval, the number of writers, painters, and musicians who have 
“succumbed” to madness has increased; but let us make no 
mistake here; between madness and the work of art, there has 
been no accommodation, no more constant exchange, no 
communication of languages; their opposition is much more 
dangerous than formerly; and their competition now allows no 
quarter; theirs is a game of life and death. Artaud’s madness does 
not slip through the fissures of the work of art; his madness is 
precisely the absence of the work of art , the reiterated presence of 
that absence, its central void experienced and measured in all its 
endless dimensions. Nietzsche’s last cry, proclaiming himself 
both Christ and Dionysos, is not on the border of reason and 
unreason, in the perspective of the work of art, their common 
dream, finally realized and immediately vanishing, of a 
reconciliation of the “shepherds of Arcady and the fishermen of 
Tiberias”; it is the very annihilation of the work of art, the point 
where it becomes impossible and where it must fall silent; the 
hammer has just fallen from the philosopher’s hands. And Van
