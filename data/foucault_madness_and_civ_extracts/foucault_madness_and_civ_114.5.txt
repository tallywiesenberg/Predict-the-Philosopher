Gogh, who did not want to ask “permission from doctors to 
paint pictures,” knew quite well that his work and his madness 
were incompatible. 

Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms 
the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the 
truth of the work of art; it draws the exterior edge, the line of 
dissolution, the contour against the void. Artaud’s oeuvre 
experiences its own absence in madness, but that experience, the 
fresh courage of that ordeal, all those words hurled against a

fundamental absence of language, all that space of physical 
suffering and terror which surrounds or rather coincides with the 
void—that is the work of art itself: the sheer cliff over the abyss 
of the work’s absence. Madness is no longer the space of 
indecision through which it was possible to glimpse the original 
truth of the work of art, but the decision beyond which this truth 
ceases irrevocably, and hangs forever over history. It is of little 
importance on exactly which day in the autumn of 1888 
Nietzsche went mad for good, and after which his texts no 
longer afford philosophy but psychiatry: all of them, including 
the postcard to Strindberg, belong to Nietzsche, and all are 
related to The Birth of Tragedy. But we must not think of this 
continuity in terms of a system, of a thematics, or even of an 
existence: Nietzsche’s madness—that is, the dissolution of his 
thought—is that by which his thought opens out onto the 
modern world. What made it impossible makes it immediate for 
us; what took it from Nietzsche offers it to us. This does not 
mean that madness is the only language common to the work of 
art and the modern world (dangers of the pathos of malediction, 
inverse and symmetrical danger of psychoanalyses); but it means 
that, through madness, a work that seems to drown in the world, 
to reveal there its non-sense, and to transfigure itself with the 
features of pathology alone, actually engages within itself the 
world’s time, masters it, and leads it; by the madness which 
interrupts it, a work of art opens a void, a moment of silence, a 
question without answer, provokes a breach without 
reconciliation where the world is forced to question itself. What 
is necessarily a profanation in the work of art returns to that 
point, and, in the time of that work swamped in madness, the 
world is made aware of its guilt. Henceforth, and through the 
mediation of madness, it is the world that becomes culpable (for 
the first time in the Western world) in relation to the work of 
art; it is now arraigned by the work of art, obliged to order itself 
by its language, compelled by it to a task of recognition, of
