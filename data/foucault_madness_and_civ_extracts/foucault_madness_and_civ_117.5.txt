8. “A soldier became melancholic because of his parents’ 
rejection of a girl he desperately loved. He was distracted, 
complained of a severe headache, and of a continual 
heaviness in that part. He grew visibly thinner; his face 
turned pale and he became so weak that he voided his 
excrement without noticing it.... There was no delirium, 
although the patient gave no positive answers and seemed to 
be entirely absorbed. He never asked for either food or 
drink.” (Gazette salutaire, March 17, 1763)
