prison; but I did not know that the hospital had been built 
to nurture sickness, the prison to nurture crime.‚Äù (Mirabeau

9. In nineteenth-century evolutionism, madness is indeed a 
return, but along a chronological path\ it is not the absolute 
collapse of time. It is a question of time turned back, not of 
repetition in the strict sense. Psychoanalysis, which has tried 
to confront madness and unreason again, has found itself 
faced with this problem of time; fixation, death-wish, 
collective unconscious, archetype define more or less happily 
this heterogeneity of two temporal structures: that which is 
proper to the experience of Unreason and to the knowledge 
it envelops; that which is proper to the knowledge of 
madness, and to the science it authorizes.
