Only the theoretical edifice has been 
doubled.The qualitative basis in experience remains the same.A symbolic unity formed by the languor of the fluids, by the 
darkening of the animal spirits and the shadowy twilight they 
spread over the images of things, by the viscosity of the blood 
that laboriously trickles through the vessels, by the thickening of 
vapors that have become blackish, deleterious, and acrid, by 
visceral functions that have become slow and somehow slimyâ€” 
this unity, more a product of sensibility than of thought or 
theory, gives melancholia its characteristic stamp.It is this undertaking, more than faithful observation, which 
reorganizes melancholias symptoms and mode of appearance.The theme of a partial delirium increasingly disappears as a 
major symptom of melancholics in favor of qualitative data like 
sadness, bitterness, a preference for solitude, immobility.
