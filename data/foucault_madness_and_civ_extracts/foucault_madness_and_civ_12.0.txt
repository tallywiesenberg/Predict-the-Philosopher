dark rage, the sterile madness that lie in men’s hearts. 

At the opposite pole to this nature of shadows, madness 
fascinates because it is knowledge. It is knowledge, first, because 
all these absurd figures are in reality elements of a difficult, 
hermetic, esoteric learning. These strange forms are situated, 
from the first, in the space of the Great Secret, and the Saint 
Anthony who is tempted by them is not a victim of the violence 
of desire but of the much more insidious lure of curiosity; he is 
tempted by that distant and intimate knowledge which is 
offered, and at the same time evaded, by the smile of the gryllos; 
his backward movement is nothing but that step by which he 
keeps from crossing the forbidden limits of knowledge; he knows

already—and that is his temptation—what Jerome Cardan will 
say later: “Wisdom, like other precious substances, must be torn 
from the bowels of the earth.” This knowledge, so inaccessible, 
so formidable, the Fool, in his innocent idiocy, already possesses. 
While the man of reason and wisdom perceives only fragmentary 
and all the more unnerving images of it, the Fool bears it intact 
as an unbroken sphere: that crystal ball which for all others is 
empty is in his eyes filled with the density of an invisible 
knowledge. Brueghel mocks the sick man who tries to penetrate 
this crystal sphere, but it is this iridescent bubble of knowledge— 
an absurd but infinitely precious lantern—that sways at the end 
of the stick Dulle Griet bears on her shoulder. And it is this 
sphere which figures on the reverse of the Garden of Delights. 
Another symbol of knowledge, the tree (the forbidden tree, the 
tree of promised immortality and of sin), once planted in the 
heart of the earthly paradise, has been uprooted and now forms 
the mast of the Ship of Fools, as seen in the engraving that 
illustrates Josse Bade’s Stultiferae naviculae ; it is this tree, without 
a doubt, that sways over Bosch’s Ship of Fools. 

What does it presage, this wisdom of fools? Doubtless, since it 
is a forbidden wisdom, it presages both the reign of Satan and 
the end of the world; ultimate bliss and supreme punishment; 
omnipotence on earth and the infernal fall. The Ship of Fools 
sails through a landscape of delights, where all is offered to 
desire, a sort of renewed paradise, since here man no longer 
knows either suffering or need; and yet he has not recovered his 
innocence. This false happiness is the diabolical triumph of the 
Antichrist; it is the End, already at hand. Apocalyptic dreams are 
not new, it is true, in the fifteenth century; they are, however, 
very different in nature from what they had been earlier. The
