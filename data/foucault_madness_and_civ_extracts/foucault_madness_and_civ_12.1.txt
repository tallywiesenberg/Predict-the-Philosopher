Whether it is a question of mania or melancholia, the 
cause of the disease is always in the movement of the animal 
spirits.But this movement is quite particular in mania: it is 
continuous, violent, always capable of piercing new pores in the 
cerebral matter, and it creates, as the material basis of incoherent 
thoughts, explosive gestures, continuous words which betray 
mania.Is not such pernicious mobility that of an infernal water, 
sulfurous liquid, those aquae stygiae , ex nitro , vitriolo , antimonio , 
arsenico , et similibus exstillatae : its particles are in perpetual 
movement; they are capable of provoking new pores and new 
channels in any substance; and they have strength enough to 
spread themselves far, exactly as the maniacal spirits are capable 
of spreading agitation through all the parts of the body.An 
infernal water gathers in the secrecy of its movements all the 
images in which mania takes its concrete form.It constitutes, in 
an indissociable way, both its chemical myth and its dynamic 
truth.
