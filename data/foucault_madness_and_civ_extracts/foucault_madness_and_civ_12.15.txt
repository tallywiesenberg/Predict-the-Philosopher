In the course of the eighteenth century, the image, with all its 
mechanical and metaphysical implications, of animal spirits in 
the channels of the nerves, was frequently replaced by the image, 
more strictly physical but of an even more symbolic value, of a 
tension to which nerves, vessels, and the entire system of organic 
fibers were subject.Mania was thus a tension of the fibers carried 
to its paroxysm, the maniac a sort of instrument whose strings, 
by the effect of an exaggerated traction, began to vibrate at the 
remotest and faintest stimulus.Maniacal delirium consisted of a 
continual vibration of the sensibility.Through this image, the 
differences from melancholia became precise and were organized 
into a rigorous antithesis: the melancholic can no longer enter 
into a resonance with the external world, because his fibers are 
relaxed or because they have been immobilized by too great a 
tension (we see how the mechanics of tension explains 
melancholic immobility as well as maniacal agitation): only a few 
fibers vibrate in the melancholic, those which correspond to the

precise point of his delirium.On the contrary, the maniac 
vibrates to any and every stimulus; his delirium is universal; 
stimuli do not vanish into the density of his immobility, as in the 
melancholicâ€™s case; when his organism returns them, they have 
been multiplied, as if the maniac had accumulated a 
supplementary energy in the tension of his fibers.
