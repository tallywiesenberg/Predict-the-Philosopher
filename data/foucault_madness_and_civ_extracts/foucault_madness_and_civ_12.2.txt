It is this very 
fact, moreover, that makes the maniac, in his turn, insensible, 
not with the somnolent insensibility of the melancholic, but with 
an insensibility taut with interior vibrations; this is doubtless why 
maniacs “fear neither heat nor cold, tear off their clothes, sleep 
naked in the dead of winter without feeling the cold.” It is also 
why they substitute for the real world, which nonetheless 
continues to solicit them, the unreal and chimerical world of 
their delirium: “The essential symptoms of mania result from the 
fact that objects do not present themselves to the sufferers as 
they are in reality.”!0 The delirium of maniacs is not determined 
by a particular error of judgment; it constitutes a defect in the 
transmission of sense impressions to the brain, a flaw in 
communication.In the psychology of madness, the old idea of 
truth as “the conformity of thought to things” is transposed in 
the metaphor of a resonance, a kind of musical fidelity of the 
fibers to the sensations which make them vibrate.This theme of manic tension develops, beyond a medicine of 
solids, into intuitions that are still more qualitative.The rigidity 
of fibers in a maniac always belongs to a dry landscape; mania is 
regularly accompanied by a wasting of the humors, and by a 
general aridity in the entire organism.The essence of mania is 
desertic, sandy.
