V: “this inequality in weight, which seems at first 
of little consequence, is no longer so slight if we consider the fact 
that the specific difference between the total mass of the brain of 
a madman and that of a normal man is around 7 gros less in the 
adult, in whom the brain’s entire mass ordinarily weighs three 
limes .” Mania’s dessication and lightness show even on the scale.Were not this internal dryness and this heat further proved by 
the ease with which maniacs endured great cold?It was an 
established fact that they had been seen walking naked in the 
snow, that there was no need to warm them when they were 
confined in the asylum, that they could even be cured by cold.Since Jean-Baptiste van Helmont, the immersion of maniacs in 
ice water had been widely practiced, and Menuret states that he 
knew a maniac who, having escaped from the prison where he 
was kept, “walked several leagues in a violent rain without a hat 
and almost without clothing, and who by this means recovered 
perfect health.” Montchau, who cured a maniac by “pouring ice 
water upon him, from as high above as possible,” was not 
astonished by so favorable a result; to explain it he united all the 
themes of organic calefaction that had succeeded and intersected 
each other since the seventeenth century: “One need not be 
surprised that ice water produces such a prompt and perfect cure 
precisely when boiling blood, furious bile, and mutinous liquors 
carried disturbance and irritation everywhere”; by the impression

of coldness, “the vessels contracted more violently and freed 
themselves of the liquors that crammed them; the irritation of 
the solid parts caused by the extreme heat of the liquors they 
contained ceased, and when the nerves relaxed, the course of the 
spirits that had proceeded irregularly from one side to the other 
was re-established in its natural state.” 

The world of melancholia was humid, heavy, and cold; that of 
mania was parched, dry, compounded of violence and fragility; a 
world which heat—unfelt but everywhere manifested—made 
arid, friable, and always ready to relax under the effect of a moist 
coolness.In the development of all these qualitative 
simplifications, mania attained both its full scope and its unity.
