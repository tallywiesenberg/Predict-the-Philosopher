No doubt this entire universe of heat and cold, of humidity 
and dryness, reminded medical thought, about to accede to 
positivism, of the circumstances of its own origin.But this 
blazon of images was not simply reminiscence; it was also an 
undertaking.In order to form the practical experience of mania 
or melancholia, this gravitation, against a background of images, 
of qualities attracted to each other by a whole system of sensuous 
and affective affinities was essential.If mania, if melancholia 
henceforth assumed the aspects our science knows them by, it is 
not because in the course of centuries we have learned to “open 
our eyes” to real symptoms; it is not because we have purified our 
perception to the point of transparency; it is because in the 
experience of madness, these concepts were organized around 
certain qualitative themes that lent them their unity, gave them 
their significant coherence, made them finally perceptible.We 
have passed from a simple notional description (fury without 
fever, delirious idee fixe) to a qualitative realm, apparently less 
organized, simpler, less precisely limited, but which alone was 
able to constitute recognizable, palpable units really present in the 
total experience of madness.
