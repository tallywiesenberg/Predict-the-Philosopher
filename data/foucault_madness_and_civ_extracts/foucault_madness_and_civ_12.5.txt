Certainly Willis’s methods are of 
great interest, chiefly in this particular: the transition from one 
affection to the other is seen not as a phenomenon of observation 
for which it was then a matter of discovering the explanation, but 
rather as the consequence of a profound natural affinity which 
was of the order of their secret nature.Willis does not cite a 
single case of alternation which he had occasion to observe; what 
he first discovered was an internal relation which engendered 
strange metamorphoses: “After melancholia, we must consider 
mania, with which it has so many affinities that these complaints 
often change into one another”: it happens, in fact, that the 
melancholic predisposition, if aggravated, becomes frenzy; 
frenzy, on the contrary, when it decreases and loses its force, 
finally grows calm and turns to melancholic diathesis.A rigorous 
empiricism would see two related diseases here, or even two 
successive symptoms of the same disease.However, Willis does 
not pose the problem in terms of symptoms nor in terms of 
disease; he merely seeks the link connecting two states in the 
dynamics of animal spirits.In the melancholic, we remember, 
the spirits were somber and dim; they cast their shadows over the 
images of things and formed a kind of dark tide; in the maniac, 
on the contrary, the spirits seethed in a perpetual ferment; they 
were carried by an irregular movement, constantly repeated; a 
movement that eroded and consumed, and even without fever, 
sent out its heat.
