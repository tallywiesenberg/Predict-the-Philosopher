Between mania and melancholia, the affinity is 
evident: not the affinity of symptoms linked in experience, but 
the affinity—more powerful and so much more evident in the 
landscapes of the imagination—that unites in the same fire both 
smoke and flame.“If we can say that in melancholia, the brain

and the animal spirits are obscured by smoke and a dense vapor, 
mania seems to ignite a kind of conflagration hitherto muffled by 
them.” The flame in its rapid movement dissipates the smoke; 
but the smoke, when it falls back, smothers the flame and 
extinguishes its brightness.The combination of mania and 
melancholy is not, for Willis, a disease; it is a secret fire in which 
flame and smoke are in conflict; it is the vehicle of that light and 
that shadow.Virtually all of the physicians of the eighteenth century 
acknowledged the proximity of mania and melancholia.Several, 
however, refused to call them two manifestations of the same 
disease.
