Many observed a succession without perceiving a 
symptomatic unity.Sydenham prefers to divide the domain of 
mania itself: on one hand, ordinary mania—due to “an 
overexcited and too rapid blood”; on the other, a mania which, as 
a general rule, “degenerates into stupidity.” The latter “results 
from the weakness of the blood which too long a fermentation 
has deprived of its most spirituous parts.” Even more often, it is 
acknowledged that the succession of mania and melancholia is a 
phenomenon either of metamorphosis or of remote causality.For 
Joseph Lieutaud, a melancholia that lasts a long time and whose 
delirium is exacerbated loses its traditional symptoms and 
assumes a strange resemblance to mania: “the last stage of 
melancholia has many affinities with mania.” But the status of 
this analogy is not elaborated.For Dufour, the link is even 
looser: it is a remote causal connection, melancholia being able to 
provoke mania, as well as “worms in the frontal sinuses, or 
dilated or varicose vessels.” Without the support of an image, no 
observation succeeded in transforming the evidence of succession 
into a symptomatic structure that was both precise and essential.Of course the image of flame and smoke disappeared in 
Willis’s successors; but it was still by images that the work of 
organization was accomplished—images increasingly functional, 
more firmly fixed in the great physiological themes of circulation

had borrowed them from.
