We have thus passed quite 
naturally from the image of an immobile congestion to images of 
dryness, of hardness, of rapid movement, and this by a sequence 
in which the principles of classical mechanics are at every 
moment influenced, deflected, distorted by a fidelity to 
iconographic themes which are the true organizers of this 
functional unity.Subsequently other images will be added, but will no longer

play a constitutive role; they will function only as so many 
interpretive variations upon the theme of a previously acquired 
unity.Witness for example the explanation Spengler proposed 
for the alternation between mania and melancholia, borrowing 
its principle from the electric battery.First there is a 
concentration of nervous power and of its fluid in a certain 
region of the system; only this sector is agitated, all the rest is in 
a state of sleep: this is the melancholic phase.But when it 
reaches a certain degree of intensity, this local charge suddenly 
expands into the entire system, which it agitates violently for a 
certain time, until its discharge is complete: this is the manic 
episode.
