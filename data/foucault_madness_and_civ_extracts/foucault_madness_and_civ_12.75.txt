At this level of elaboration, the image is too complex 
and too complete, it is borrowed from a model too remote to 
have an organizing role in the perception of a pathological unity.It is, on the contrary, suggested by that perception, which itself is 
based on unifying, though much more elementary, images.It is these images which are secretly present in the text of 
James’s Dictionary , one of the first in which the manic-depressive 
cycle is given as an observed phenomenon, as a unity easily 
perceived by an unprejudiced scrutiny.“It is absolutely necessary 
to reduce melancholia and mania to a single species of disease, 
and consequently to consider them in one and the same glance, 
for we find from our experiments and our day-to-day 
observations that one and the other have the same origin and the 
same cause....The most exact observations and our daily 
experience confirm the fact, for we see that melancholics, 
especially those in whom the disposition is inveterate, easily 
become maniacal, and when the mania ceases, the melancholia 
begins again, in such a way that there is a passage and return 
from one to the other after certain periods of time.’Tl What was 
constituted, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, under 
the influence of images, was therefore a perceptual structure, and 
not a conceptual system or even a group of symptoms.
