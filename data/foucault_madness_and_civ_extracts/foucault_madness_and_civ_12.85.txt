To what degree is it legitimate to treat them as mental 
diseases, or at least as forms of madness?2.Are we entitled to treat them together, as if they constituted 
a virtual couple, similar to that formed quite early by mania and 
melancholia?A glance at the classifications is enough to convince us; 
hypochondria does not always appear beside dementia and 
mania; hysteria is very rarely found there.Felix Plater mentioned 
neither one among the lesions of the senses; and at the end of 
the classical period, Cullen still catalogued them in another 
category than that of the vesanias: hypochondria among the 
“adynamias, or diseases which consist of a weakness or a loss of 
movement in the vital or animal functions”; hysteria among “the 
spasmodic affections of the natural functions.” 

Moreover, in nosographic charts one rarely finds these two 
diseases grouped in a logical proximity, or even combined in the 
form of an opposition.
