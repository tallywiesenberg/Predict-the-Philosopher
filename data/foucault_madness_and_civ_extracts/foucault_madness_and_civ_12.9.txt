Sauvages classifies hypochondria among 
the hallucinations—“hallucinations that concern only the 
health”—hysteria among the forms of convulsion.Linnaeus 
employs the same distinctions.Are they not both faithful to the 
teaching of Willis, who had studied hysteria in his book De 
morbis convulsivis and hypochondria in the section of De anima 
brutorum which dealt with diseases of the head, giving it the 
name of passio colica?Here it is certainly a question of two quite 
different diseases: in one case, the overheated spirits are subject 
to a reciprocal pressure which may give the impression that they 
are exploding—provoking those irregular or preternatural 
movements whose insane aspect constitutes hysterical 
convulsions.On the contrary, in passio colica , the spirits are

them ( infest a et improportionnata) ; they then provoke 
disturbances, irritations, corrugationes in the sensitive fibers.
