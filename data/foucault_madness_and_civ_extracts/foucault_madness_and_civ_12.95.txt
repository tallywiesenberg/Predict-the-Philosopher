Willis therefore advises us not to be surprised by certain 
analogies of symptoms: certainly, we have seen convulsions 
produce pains as if the violent movement of hysteria could 
provoke the sufferings of hypochondria.But the resemblances 
are deceptive.“The substance is not the same, but a little 
different.” 

But beneath these fixed distinctions of the nosographers, a 
slow labor was being performed which tended increasingly to 
identify hysteria and hypochondria, as two forms of one and the 
same disease.In 1725 Richard Blackmore published a Treatise oj 
the Spleen and Vapours , or Hypochondriacal and Hysterical 
Affections', in it the two illnesses were defined as two varieties of a 
single affection—either a “morbific constitution of the spirits” or 
a “disposition to leave their reservoirs and to consume 
themselves.” For Whytt, in the middle of the eighteenth century, 
the identification was complete; the system of symptoms is 
henceforth identical: “An extraordinary sensation of cold and 
heat, of pains in several parts of the body; syncopes and vaporous 
convulsions; catalepsy and tetanus; gas in the stomach and 
intestines; an insatiable appetite for food; vomiting of black 
matter; a sudden and abundant flow of clear, pale urine; marasma 
or nervous atrophy; nervous cough; palpitations of the heart; 
variations in the pulse; periodic headaches; vertigo and dizzy 
spells; diminution and failure of eyesight; depression, despair, 
melancholia or even madness; nightmares or incubi.” 

Moreover, during the classical period hysteria and 
hypochondria slowly joined the domain of mental diseases.Richard Mead could still write apropos of hypochondria: “It is an 
illness of the whole body.” And we must restore its true value to 
Willis’s text on hysteria: “Among the diseases of women, 
hysterical affection is of such bad repute that like the semi-

damnati it must bear the faults of numerous other affections; if a 
disease of unknown nature and hidden origin appears in a 
woman in such a manner that its cause escapes us, and that the 
therapeutic course is uncertain, we immediately blame the bad 
influence of the uterus, which, for the most part, is not 
responsible; and when we are dealing with an inhabitual 
symptom, we declare that there is a trace of hysteria hidden 
beneath it all, and what has so often been the subterfuge of so 
much ignorance we take as the object of our treatment and our 
remedies.” With all due regard to the traditional commentators 
on this text, which is inevitably cited in any study on hysteria, it 
does not mean that Willis suspected the absence of an organic 
basis in symptoms of hysterical affection.
