Lautre'amont et Sade (Paris, 1949), p. 235. 

2. Ibid., loc. cit.,p. 225. 

3. Infamy must be able to go as far as “to dismember nature and 
dislocate the universe.” Cent vingt journees de Sodome (Paris, 
1935), Vol. II, p. 369. 

4. This cohesion imposed on the socii consists, in effect, of not 
admitting among themselves the validity of the right of 
death, which they can exercise over others, but of 
recognizing among themselves an absolute right of free 
disposal; each must be able to belong to the other. 

5. Cf. the episode of the volcano at the end of Juliette (Pauvert 
edition, Paris, 1954), Vol. VI, pp. 31-33. 

6. “One would have said that Nature, weary of her own works, 
was ready to mingle all the elements together in order to 
force them into new forms.” Ibid., p. 270.
