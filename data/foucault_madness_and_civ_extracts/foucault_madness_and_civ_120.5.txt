CONCLUSION 


1. Cent vingt journees de Sodome , quoted by Maurice Blanchot, 
Lautre'amont et Sade (Paris, 1949), p. 235. 

2. Ibid., loc. cit.,p. 225.

5. Cf. the episode of the volcano at the end of Juliette (Pauvert 
edition, Paris, 1954), Vol. VI, pp. 31-33. 

6. “One would have said that Nature, weary of her own works, 
was ready to mingle all the elements together in order to 
force them into new forms.” Ibid., p. 270.
