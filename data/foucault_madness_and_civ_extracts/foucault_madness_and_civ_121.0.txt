BOOKS BY 

MICHEL FOUCAULT 


“The brilliance of his style, his irony, and his ease of paradox 
endear Foucault’s writing to sophisticated readers.” 

—Washington Post Book World 


THE ORDER OF THINGS 
AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES 
With vast erudition, Foucault cuts across disciplines and reaches 
back into the seventeenth century to trace the great rift that 
separates classical systems of knowledge from their modern 
counterparts. 

“An extraordinary range of information and imagination, and its 
theses ought to be taken note of and learned from.” 

—New Republic

THE BIRTH OF THE CLINIC 
AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF MEDICAL PERCEPTION 
In The Birth of the Clinic , Foucault shows how our definition of 
pure science is shaped by social and cultural attitudes, and he 
sheds new light on the origins of our current notions of health 
and sickness, life and death. 

“Learned [and] rewarding.”
