HISTORY OF SEXUALITY, VOLUME III 
THE CARE OF THE SELF 

The third and final volume of Michel Foucault’s widely 
acclaimed examination of “the experience of sexuality in Western 
society.” 

“A monument to the audacity and ambition of modern French 
scholarship and philosophy. He leaves us in his debt.” 

—San Francisco Chronicle 

History/Psychology/0-394-74115-2 

DISCIPLINE AND PUNISH 
THE BIRTH OF THE PRISON 
In this brilliant study, Foucault sweeps aside centuries of sterile 
debate about prison reform and gives a highly provocative 
account of how penal institutions and the power to punish 
became a part of our lives. 

“Must be reckoned with by humanists, social scientists and 
political activists.” 

—The New York Times Book Review
