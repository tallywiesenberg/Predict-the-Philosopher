He merely says, and in 
an explicit way, that the idea of hysteria is a catchall for the 
fantasies, not of the person who is or believes himself ill, but of 
the ignorant doctor who pretends to know why.Nor does the 
fact that hysteria is classified by Willis among diseases of the 
head indicate that he considered it a disorder of the mind; but 
only that he attributed its origin to a change in the nature, the 
origin, and the initial course of the animal spirits.However, at the end of the eighteenth century, hypochondria 
and hysteria figured, almost without dispute, on the escutcheon 
of mental disease.In 1755 Alberti published at Halle his 
dissertation De morbis imaginariis hypochondriacorum\ and 
Lieutaud, while defining hypochondria by its spasms, recognized 
that “the mind is affected as much as and perhaps more than the 
body; hence the term hypochondriac has become almost an 
offensive name avoided by physicians who would please.” As for 
hysteria, Joseph Raulin no longer ascribes to it any organic 
reality, at least in his basic definition, establishing it from the 
start in a pathology of the imagination: “This disease in which 
women invent, exaggerate, and repeat all the various absurdities 
of which a disordered imagination is capable, has sometimes 
become epidemic and contagious.”

There were thus two essential lines of development, during the 
classical period, for hysteria and hypochondria.One united them 
to form a common concept which was that of a “disease of the 
nerves”; the other shifted their meaning and their traditional 
pathological basis—sufficiently indicated by their names—and 
tended to integrate them gradually into the domain of diseases of 
the mind, beside mania and melancholia.
