soldiery, and is among the twelve dualities that dispute the 
sovereignty of the human soul: Faith and Idolatry, Hope and 
Despair, Charity and Avarice, Chastity and Lust, Prudence and 
Folly, Patience and Anger, Gentleness and Harshness, Concord 
and Discord, Obedience and Rebellion, Perseverance and 
Inconstancy, Fortitude and Cowardice, Humility and Pride. In 
the Renaissance, Folly leaves this modest place and comes to the 
fore. Whereas according to Hugues de Saint-Victor the 
genealogical tree of the Vices, that of the Old Adam, had pride 
as its root, Folly now leads the joyous throng of all human 
weaknesses. Uncontested coryphaeus, she guides them, sweeps 
them on, and names them: “Recognize them here, in the group 
of my companions.... She whose brows are drawn is Philautia 
(Self-Love). She whom you see laugh with her eyes and applaud 
with her hands is Colacia (Flattery). She who seems half asleep is 
Lethe (Forgetfulness). She who leans upon her elbows and folds 
her hands is Misoponia (Sloth). She who is crowned with roses 
and anointed with perfume is Hedonia (Sensuality). She whose 
eyes wander without seeing is Anoia (Stupidity). She whose 
abundant flesh has the hue of flowers is Tryphe (Indolence). 
And here among these young women are two gods: the god of 
Good Cheer and the god of Deep Sleep.”-' The absolute 
privilege of Folly is to reign over whatever is bad in man. But 
does she not also reign indirectly over all the good he can do: 
over ambition, that makes wise politicians; over avarice, that 
makes wealth grow; over indiscreet curiosity, that inspires 
philosophers and men of learning? Louise Labe merely follows 
Erasmus when she has Mercury implore the gods: “Do not let 
that beautiful Lady perish who has given you so much pleasure.” 

But this new royalty has little in common with the dark reign 
of which we were just speaking and which communicated with 
the great tragic powers of this world. 

True, madness attracts, but it does not fascinate. It rules all

that is easy, joyous, frivolous in the world. It is madness, folly, 
which makes men “sport and rejoice,” as it has given the gods 
“Genius, Beauty, Bacchus, Silenus, and the gentle guardian of 
gardens.”6 All within it is brilliant surface: no enigma is 
concealed. 

No doubt, madness has something to do with the strange 
paths of knowledge. The first canto of Brant’s poem is devoted
