But this integration 
was not achieved, as in the case of mania and melancholia, on 
the level of primitive qualities, perceived and imagined in their 
iconographic values.We are dealing here with an entirely 
different type of integration.The physicians of the classical period certainly tried to 
discover the qualities peculiar to hysteria and hypochondria.But 
they never reached the point of perceiving that particular 
coherence, that qualitative cohesion which gave mania and 
melancholia their unique contour.All qualities were 
contradictorily invoked, each annulling the others, leaving 
untouched the problem of what was the ultimate nature of these 
two diseases.
