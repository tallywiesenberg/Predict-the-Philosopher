Long after Ferrand, one finds the qualifying theme of 
humid heat used to characterize the secret distillations of hysteria 
and of hypochondria; but the image yielded to a more abstract 
motif.Already in Nicolas Chesneau, the flame of the feminine 
alembic had grown quite colorless: “I say that the hysterical 
affection is not a simple one, but that we understand by this 
name several diseases caused by a malign vapor which arises in 
some way or other, is corrupted, and undergoes an extraordinary 
effervescence.” For others, on the contrary, the heat rising from 
the hypochondriac regions is completely dry: hypochondriacal 
melancholia is a “hot, dry” illness, caused by “humors of the like 
quality.” But some perceived no heat in either hysteria or 
hypochondria: the quality peculiar to these maladies was on the 
contrary languor, inertia, and a cold humidity like that of the 
stagnant humors: “I think that these affections [hypochondriacal 
and hysterical], when they last for some time, come from the 
fibers of the brain and the nerves when they are slack and 
therefore feeble, without action or elasticity; as a consequence of 
which the nervous fluid is impoverished and without force.”12 
There is probably no text that bears better witness to the 
qualitative instability of hysteria than George Cheyne’s book The 
English Malady', according to Cheyne, the disease maintains its 
unity only in an abstract manner; its symptoms are dispersed into 
different qualitative regions and attributed to mechanisms that 
belong to each of these regions in its own right.All symptoms of 
spasm, cramp, and convulsion derive from a pathology of heat 
symbolized by “harmful, bitter, or acrimonious vapors.” On the 
contrary, all psychological or organic signs of weakness 
—“depression, syncopes, inactivity of the mind, lethargic torpor, 
melancholia, and sadness”—manifest a condition of fibers which

have become too humid or too weak, doubtless under the effect 
of cold, viscous, thick humors that obstruct the glands and the 
vessels, serous and sanguine alike.As for paralyses, they signify 
both a chilling and an immobilization of the fibers, “an 
interruption of vibrations,” frozen so to speak in the general 
inertia of solids.
