It was as difficult for the phenomena of hysteria and 
hypochondria to find a place within the compass of qualities as it 
was easy for mania and melancholia to be established there.The medicine of movement was just as indecisive in dealing 
with them, its analyses just as unstable.It was quite clear, at least 
to any perception that did not reject its own images, that mania 
was related to an excessive mobility; melancholia, on the 
contrary, to a diminution of movement.For hysteria and for 
hypochondria as well, the choice was a difficult one.Georg Ernst 
Stahl opts instead for an increasing heaviness of the blood, which 
becomes so abundant and so thick that it is no longer capable of 
circulating regularly through the portal vein; it has a tendency to 
stagnate, to collect there, and the crisis is a result “of the effort it 
makes to effect an issue either by the higher or the lower parts.” 
For Boerhaave, on the contrary, and for Van Swieten, hysterical 
movement is due to an excessive mobility of all the fluids, which 
become so volatile, so inconsistent, that they are agitated by the 
least movement: “In weak constitutions,” Van Swieten explains, 
“the blood is dissolved; it barely coagulates, the serum is thus 
without consistency, without quality; the lymph resembles the 
serum, as do the other fluids which the latter provides....
