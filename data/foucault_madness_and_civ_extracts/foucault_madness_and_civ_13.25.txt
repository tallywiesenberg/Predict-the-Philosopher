In this 
way, it becomes probable that the so-called immaterial hysterical 
affection and hypochondriacal disease derive from the 
dispositions of the particular state of the fibers.” It is to this 
sensibility, this mobility, that we must attribute the sufferings, 
the spasms, the singular pains so readily suffered by “young girls 
of pale complexion, and individuals too much given to study and 
meditation.” Hysteria is indiscriminately mobile or immobile,

fluid or dense, given to unstable vibrations or clogged by 
stagnant humors.No one has managed to discover the actual 
nature of its movements.We receive the same impression in the realm of chemical 
analogies: for Lange, hysteria is a product of fermentation, quite 
precisely of the fermentation “of salts, sent into different parts of 
the body,” with “the humors that are located there.” For others, 
it is of an alkaline nature.Michael Ettmiiller, on the contrary, 
considers that diseases of this kind belong to a chain of acid 
reactions, “the immediate cause being the acid rawness of the 
stomach; the chyle being acid, the quality of the blood is 
corrupted; it no longer furnishes spirits; the lymph is acid, the 
bile without strength; the nervous system suffers irritation, the 
digestive leaven, spoiled, is less volatile and too acid.” Viridet 
undertakes to reconstitute, apropos of “vapors which we 
experience,” a dialectic of alkalis and acids whose movements and 
violent collisions, in the brain and the nerves, provoke the signs 
of hysteria and hypochondria.Certain particularly volatile animal 
spirits are alkaline salts that move with great speed and transform 
themselves into vapors when they become too tenuous; but there 
are other vapors that are volatilized acids; the ether gives these 
latter enough movement to carry them to the brain and the 
nerves where, “encountering the alkalis, they cause infinite ills.” 

Strange, the qualitative instability of these hysterical and 
hypochondriacal illnesses; strange, the confusion of their 
dynamic properties and the secret nature of their chemistry!
