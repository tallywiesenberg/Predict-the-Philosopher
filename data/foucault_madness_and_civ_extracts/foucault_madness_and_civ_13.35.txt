Jean Liebault, translating or rather adapting Marinello’s book to 
seventeenth-century standards, still accepted, despite some 
restrictions, the idea of a spontaneous movement of the womb; if 
it shifted position “it was to be more at ease; not that this was 
done out of prudence, behest, or animal stimulus, but to preserve 
health and to experience the enjoyment of something delectable.” 
No doubt, it was no longer deemed possible for the womb to 
change place or to course through the body somersaulting as it 
went, for it was “strictly attached” by its neck, by ligaments, by 
vessels, and finally by the tunic of the peritoneum; yet it could 
change position: “And so the womb, though it be so strictly 
attached to the parts we have described that it may not change 
place, yet often changes position, and makes curious and so to 
speak petulant movements in the womans body.These 
movements are various: to wit, ascending, descending, 
convulsive, vagrant, prolapsed.The womb rises to the liver, 
spleen, diaphragm, stomach, breast, heart, lung, gullet, and 
head.” The physicians of the classical period were almost 
unanimous in refusing to accept such an explanation.At the beginning of the seventeenth century, Le Pois could 
write, speaking of hysterical convulsions: “Of all these one source 
is the father, and this not through sympathy but through 
idiopathy.” More precisely, their origin is in an accumulation of 
fluids toward the posterior part of the skull: “Just as a river results 
from the confluence of a quantity of smaller vessels which join to 
form it, so the sinuses that are on the surface of the brain and 
terminate in the posterior part of the head amass the liquid 
because of the head’s inclined position.The heat of the parts

then causes the liquid to warm and affect the origin of the 
nerves.” Willis, in his turn, makes a minute critique of the 
uterine explanation: it is especially from affections of the brain 
and the nervous system “that all the derangements and 
irregularities which obtain in the movement of the blood during 
this illness derive.” And yet all these analyses did not thereby 
abolish the idea of an essential link between hysteria and the 
womb.
