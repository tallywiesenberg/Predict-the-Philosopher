But the link is differently conceived: it is no longer 
regarded as the trajectory of a real displacement through the 
body, but as a sort of secret propagation through the pathways of 
the organism and through functional proximities.We cannot say 
that the seat of the disease had become the brain, nor that Willis 
had made possible a psychological analysis of hysteria.But the 
brain now played the part of a relay station and the distributor of 
a disease whose origin was visceral: the womb occasioned it along 
with all the other viscera.Until the end of the eighteenth 
century, until Pinel, the uterus and the womb remained present 
in the pathology of hysteria, but as the result of a privileged 
diffusion by the humors and nerves, and not by a special prestige 
of their nature.Stahl justifies the parallelism of hysteria and hypochondria by 
a curious comparison of menstrual flow and hemorrhoids.
