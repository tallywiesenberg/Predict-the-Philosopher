He 
explains, in his analysis of spasmodic movements, that the 
hysterical affection is a violent pain, “accompanied by tension 
and compression, which makes itself principally felt below the 
hypochondriac regions.” It is called a hypochondriacal disease 
when it attacks men “in whom nature makes an effort to be rid of 
excess blood by vomiting or hemorrhoids”; it is called a hysterical 
affection when it attacks women “the course of whose periods is 
not as it should be.However, there is no essential difference 
between these two affections.” Hoffmans opinion is quite 
similar, in spite of many theoretical differences.The cause of 
hysteria is in the womb—loosening and weakening—but the seat 
of the disease is to be sought, as in the case of hypochondria, in

the stomach and the intestines; the blood and the vital humors 
begin to stagnate “in the membranous and nervous tunics of the 
intestines”; gastric disturbances result, which spread thence 
throughout the whole body.At the very center of the organism, 
the stomach serves as a relay station and diffuses the maladies 
that come from the interior and subterranean cavities of the 
body: “It is not to be doubted that the spasmodic affections 
experienced by hypochondriacs and hysterics have their seat in 
the nervous parts, and especially in the membranes of the 
stomach and the intestines, from which they are communicated 
by the intercostal nerve to the head, to the chest, to the kidneys, 
to the liver, and to all the principal organs of the body.” 

The role Hoffmann assigns to the intestines, the stomach, and 
the intercostal nerve is indicative of the manner in which the 
problem was presented in the classical period.It was not so much 
a question of escaping the old localization in the uterus, but of 
discovering the principle and the pathways of a diverse, 
polymorphous disease dispersed throughout the entire body.
