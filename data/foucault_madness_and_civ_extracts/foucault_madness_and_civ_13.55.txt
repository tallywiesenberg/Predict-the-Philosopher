This theme remained 
almost stationary until the beginning of the eighteenth century, 
despite the complete reorganization of physiological concepts.And strangely enough, it was during the eighteenth century, 
when no theoretical or experimental innovation in pathology had 
occurred, that the theme was suddenly modified, changed 
directionâ€”that a dynamics of corporeal space was replaced by a 
morality of sensibility.It was then, and only then, that the ideas 
of hysteria and hypochondria were to veer, and definitively enter 
the world of madness.We must try now to reconstitute the evolution of the theme, 
in each of its three stages: 

1. a dynamics of organic and moral penetration; 

2. a physiology of corporeal continuity; 

3. an ethic of nervous sensibility.If corporeal space is perceived as a solid and continuous whole, 
the disordered movement of hysteria and of hypochondria could 
result only from an element whose extreme tenuousness and 
incessant mobility permitted it to penetrate into the place 
occupied by the solids themselves.
