the punishment of a disorderly and useless science. If madness is 
the truth of knowledge, it is because knowledge is absurd, and 
instead of addressing itself to the great book of experience, loses 
its way in the dust of books and in idle debate; learning becomes 
madness through the very excess of false learning.
