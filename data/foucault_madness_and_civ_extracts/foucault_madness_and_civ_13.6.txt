As Nathaniel Highmore put 
it, the animal spirits, “because of their igneous tenuity, can 
penetrate even the densest, the most compact bodies ..., and 
because of their activity, can penetrate the entire microcosm in a 
single instant.” The spirits, if their mobility increased, if 
penetration occurred, chaotically and in an untimely manner, in 
all the parts of the body to which they were unsuited, provoked a 
thousand diverse signs of disturbance.Hysteria, for Highmore as 
for Willis, his adversary, and for Sydenham as well, was the 
disease of a body indiscriminately penetrable to all the efforts of 
the spirits, so that the internal order of organs gave way to the 
incoherent space of masses passively subject to the chaotic 
movement of the spirits.These latter “move impetuously and in 
excessive quantity upon such or such a part, there causing spasms

or even pain ... and disturbing the function of the organs, both 
those which they abandon and those toward which they move, 
neither being able to avoid serious damage from this unequal 
distribution of spirits, which is entirely contrary to the laws of 
animal economy.” 13 The hysterical body was thus given over to 
that disorder of the spirits which, outside of all organic laws and 
any functional necessity, could successively seize upon all the 
available spaces of the body.The effects varied according to the regions affected, and the 
disease, undifferentiated in the pure source of its movement, 
assumed various configurations depending on the spaces it 
traversed and the surfaces where it appeared: “Having 
accumulated in the stomach, they rush in a host and with 
impetuosity upon the muscles of the larynx and the pharynx, 
producing spasms throughout the entire area they traverse, and 
causing in the stomach a swelling which resembles a large ball.” 
A little higher, the hysterical affection, “seizing upon the colon 
and upon the region which is below the heart cavity, causes there 
an insupportable pain which resembles the iliac affection.” 
Should it rise still higher, the disease attacks “the vital parts and 
causes so violent a palpitation of the heart that the sick person 
does not doubt that his attendants must be able to hear the 
sound his heart makes as it beats against his ribs.” Finally, if it 
attacks “the exterior part of the head, between the cranium and 
the pericranium, and there remains fixed in a single spot, it 
causes an extreme pain that is accompanied by violent fits of 
vomiting.” 14 Each part of the body determines in its own right 
and by its own nature the form of the symptom produced.Hysteria thus appears as the most real and the most deceptive of 
diseases; real because it is based upon a movement of the animal 
spirits; illusory as well, because it generates symptoms that seem 
provoked by a disorder inherent in the organs, whereas they are 
only the formation, at the level of these organs, of a central or

rather general disorder; it is the derangement of internal mobility 
that assumes the appearance, on the body’s surface, of a local 
symptom.
