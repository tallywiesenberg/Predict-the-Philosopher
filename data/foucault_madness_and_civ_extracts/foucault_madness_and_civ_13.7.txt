disease attacks women more than men, because they have a more 
delicate, less firm constitution, because they lead a softer life, and 
because they are accustomed to the luxuries and commodities of 
life and not to suffering.” And already, in the lines of this text, 
this spatial density yields one of its meanings: it is also a moral 
density; the resistance of the organs to the disordered penetration 
of the spirits is perhaps one and the same thing as that strength 
of soul which keeps the thoughts and the desires in order.This 
internal space which has become permeable and porous is 
perhaps only the laxity of the heart.Which explains why so few 
women are hysterical when they are accustomed to a hard and 
laborious life, yet strongly incline to become so when they lead a 
soft, idle, luxurious, and lax existence; or if some sorrow manages 
to conquer their resolution: “When women consult me about 
some complaint whose nature I cannot determine, I ask if the 
malady from which they are suffering attacks them only when 
they have some sorrow ...: if they admit as much, I am fully 
assured that their complaint is an hysterical affection.”!6 

Thus we have a new formulation of the old moral intuition 
that from the time of Hippocrates and Plato had made the 
womb a living and perpetually mobile animal, and distributed the 
spatial ordering of its movements; this intuition perceived in 
hysteria the incoercible agitation of desires in those who had 
neither the possibility of satisfying them nor the strength to 
master them; the image of the female organ rising to the breast 
and to the head gave a mythical expression to an upheaval in the 
great Platonic tripartition and in the hierarchy that was intended 
to assure its immobility.For Sydenham, for the disciples of 
Descartes, the moral intuition is identical; but the spatial 
landscape in which it is expressed has changed; Plato’s vertical 
and hieratic order is replaced by a volume which is traversed by 
incessant motion whose disorder is no longer a revolution of the 
depths to the heights but a lawless whirlwind in a chaotic space.160 


This “interior body” which Sydenham tried to penetrate with 
“the eyes of the mind” was not the objective body available to the 
dull gaze of a neutralized observation; it was the site where a 
certain manner of imagining the body and of deciphering its 
internal movements combined with a certain manner of investing 
it with moral values.
