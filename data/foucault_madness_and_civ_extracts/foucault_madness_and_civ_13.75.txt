The development is completed, the work 
done on the level of this ethical perception.In this perception the 
ever pliant images of medical theory are inflected and altered; in 
it, too, the great moral themes are formulated and gradually alter 
their initial aspect.This penetrable body must, however, be a continuous body.The dispersion of the disease through the organs is only the 
reverse of a movement of propagation which permits it to pass 
from one to another and to affect them all in succession.If the 
body of the hypochondriac or the hysteric is a porous body, 
separated from itself, distended by the invasion of disease, this 
invasion can be effected only by means of a certain spatial 
continuity.
