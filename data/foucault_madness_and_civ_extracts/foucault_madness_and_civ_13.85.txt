- But what is still more 
admirable, a nervous fiber can transmit simultaneously the 
stimulus of a voluntary movement and the impression left on the 
organ by the senses.Simon-Andre Tissot conceived this double 
function of one and the same fiber as the combination of an 
undulatory movement for voluntary stimulus (“this is the 
movement of a fluid enclosed in a malleable container, in a 
bladder, for example, that when I press it would eject liquid 
through a tube”) and a corpuscular movement for sensation (“this 
is the movement of a succession of ivory balls”).Thus sensation 
and movement can be produced at the same time in the same 
nerve: any tension and any relaxation in the fiber will alter both 
movements and sensations, as we can observe in all nervous 
diseases.And yet, despite all these unifying virtues of the nervous 
system, is it certain that we can explain, by the real network of its 
fibers, the cohesion of such diverse disorders as those which 
characterize hysteria or hypochondria?How conceive the liaison 
among the signs that from one part of the body to the other 
betray the presence of a nervous affection?
