How explain, and by 
tracing what line of connection, that in certain “delicate and 
highly sensitive” women a heady perfume or the too vivid 
description of a tragic event or even the sight of a combat 
produces such an impression that they “fall into syncopes or 
suffer convulsions”?One seeks in vain: no precise liaison of the 
nerves; no path proceeding from the original cause; but only a

remote, indirect action which is rather on the order of a 
physiological solidarity.This is because the different parts of the 
body possess a “very determined faculty, which is either general 
and extends throughout the entire system of animal economy, or 
particular and influences certain parts principally.” This very 
distinct property of both “the faculty of feeling and that of 
moving” which permits the organs to communicate with each 
other and to suffer together, to react to a stimulus, however 
distant—is sympathy.As a matter of fact, Whytt succeeded 
neither in isolating sympathy in the ensemble of the nervous 
system, nor in defining it in relation to sensibility and to 
movement Sympathy exists in the organs only insofar as it is 
received there through the intermediary of the nerves; it is the 
more marked in proportion to their mobility, and at the same 
time it is one of the forms of sensibility: “All sympathy, all 
consensus presupposes sentiment and consequently can exist only 
by the mediation of the nerves, which are the only instruments 
by which sensation operates.”!^ But the nervous system is no 
longer invoked here to explain the exact transmission of a 
movement or a sensation, but to justify, in its totality and its 
mass, the body’s sensibility with regard to its own phenomena, 
and its own echo across the volumes of its organic space.Diseases of the nerves are essentially disorders of sympathy; 
they presuppose a state of general vigilance in the nervous system 
which makes each organ susceptible of entering into sympathy 
with any other: “In such a state of sensibility of the nervous 
system, the passions of the soul, violations of diet, sudden 
alternation of heat and cold or of heaviness and humidity of the 
atmosphere, will very readily produce morbific symptoms; so that 
with such a constitution, one will not enjoy steady or constant 
health, but generally suffer a continual succession of more or less 
severe pains.” Doubtless this exaggerated sensibility is 
compensated by zones of insensibility, of sleep, as it were; in a

general way, hysterical sufferers are those in whom this internal 
sensibility is the most exquisite, hypochondriacs possessing it, on 
the contrary, in a relatively blunted form.
