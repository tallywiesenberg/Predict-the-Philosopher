And of course women 
belong to the first category: is not the womb, with the brain, the 
organ that maintains most sympathy with the whole organism?It 
suffices to cite “the vomiting that generally accompanies the 
inflammation of the womb; the nausea, the disordered appetite 
that follow conception; the constriction of the diaphragm and of 
the muscles of the abdomen during childbirth; the headache, the 
heat and the pains in the back, the intestinal colic suffered when 
the time of the menstrual flow approaches.” The entire female 
body is riddled by obscure but strangely direct paths of sympathy; 
it is always in an immediate complicity with itself, to the point of 
forming a kind of absolutely privileged site for the sympathies; 
from one extremity of its organic space to the other, it encloses a 
perpetual possibility of hysteria.The sympathetic sensibility of 
her organism, radiating through her entire body, condemns 
woman to those diseases of the nerves that are called vapors.“The women whose systems have generally more mobility than 
those of men are more subject to nervous diseases, which are also 
more serious in them.” 1 And Whytt assures us he has witnessed 
that “the pain of a toothache caused convulsions in a young girl 
whose nerves were weak, and an unconsciousness lasting several 
hours and returning when the pain became more acute.” 

Diseases of the nerves are diseases of corporeal continuity.A 
body too close to itself, too intimate in each of its parts, an 
organic space which is, in a sense, strangely constricted: this is 
what the theme common to hysteria and hypochondria has now 
become; the rapprochement of the body with itself assumes, for 
some, the aspect of a precise—all too precise—image: such is the 
celebrated “shriveling of the nervous system” described by 
Pomme.
