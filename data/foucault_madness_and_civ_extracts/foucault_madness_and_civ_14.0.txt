rapport that man maintains with himself. The mythological 
personification of madness in Erasmus is only a literary device. 
In fact, only “follies” exist—human forms of madness: “I count as 
many images as there are men”; one need only glance at states, 
even the wisest and best governed: “So many forms of madness 
abound there, and each day sees so many new ones born, that a 
thousand Democrituses would not suffice to mock them.” There 
is no madness but that which is in every man, since it is man 
who constitutes madness in the attachment he bears for himself 
and by the illusions he entertains. Philautia is the first figure 
Folly leads out in her dance, but that is because they are linked 
by a privileged relation: self-attachment is the first sign of 
madness, but it is because man is attached to himself that he 
accepts error as truth, lies as reality, violence and ugliness as 
beauty and justice. “This man, uglier than a monkey, imagines 
himself handsome as Nereus; that one thinks he is Euclid 
because he has traced three lines with a compass; that other one 
thinks he can sing like Hermogenes, whereas he is the ass before 
the lyre, and his voice sounds as false as that of the rooster 
pecking his hen.” In this delusive attachment to himself, man 
generates his madness like a mirage. The symbol of madness will 
henceforth be that mirror which, without reflecting anything 
real, will secretly offer the man who observes himself in it the

dream of his own presumption. Madness deals not so much with 
truth and the world, as with man and whatever truth about 
himself he is able to perceive. 

It thus gives access to a completely moral universe. Evil is not 
punishment or the end of time, but only fault and flaw. A 
hundred and sixteen cantos of Brant’s poem are devoted to 
portraits of the insane passengers on the Ship: there are misers, 
slanderers, drunkards; there are those who indulge in disorder 
and debauchery; those who interpret the Scriptures falsely; those 
who practice adultery. Locher, Brant’s translator, notes in his 
Latin preface the purpose and meaning of the work; it is 
concerned to teach “what evil there may be, what good; what 
vices; whither virtue, whither error may lead”; and this while 
castigating, according to the wickedness each man is guilty of, 
“the unholy, the proud, the greedy, the extravagant, the 
debauched, the voluptuous, the quick-tempered, the gluttonous, 
the voracious, the envious, the poisoners, the faith-breakers” ... 
in short, all that man has been able to invent in the way of 
irregularities in his conduct.
