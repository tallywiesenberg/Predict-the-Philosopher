Is this sympathy, basically, a property hidden in each organ— 
that “sentiment” which Cheyne spoke of—or a real propagation 
through an intermediary element?And is the pathological 
proximity which characterizes these nervous diseases an 
exasperation of this sentiment, or a greater mobility of this 
interstitial body?It is a curious but doubtless characteristic phenomenon of 
medical thought in the eighteenth century, in the period when 
physiologists tried to define most precisely the functions and the 
role of the nervous system (sensibility and irritability; sensation 
and movement), that physicians used these ideas indiscriminately 
in the undifferentiated unity of pathological perception, 
articulating them according to a schema entirely different from 
that proposed by physiology.Sensibility and movement are not distinguished.
