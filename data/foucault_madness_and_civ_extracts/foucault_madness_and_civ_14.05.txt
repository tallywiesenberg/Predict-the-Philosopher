Tissot 
explains that the child has more sensibility than anyone else 
because in him everything is lighter and more mobile; irritability, 
in the sense in which Haller understood a property of the 
nervous fiber, is identified with irritation, understood as the 
pathological state of an organ aroused by a prolonged stimulus.It 
would thus be acknowledged that nervous diseases were states of 
irritation combined with an excessive mobility of the fibers.“On occasion one sees persons for whom the smallest moving 
cause occasions much more movement than it produces in 
healthy persons; they cannot sustain the slightest alien 
impression.The faintest sound, the weakest light affords them 
extraordinary symptoms.”20 By this deliberately preserved 
ambiguity in the notion of irritation, medicine at the end of the 
eighteenth century could in effect show the continuity between 
disposition (irritability) and the pathological event (irritation); 
but it could also maintain both the theme of a disorder proper to 
an organ which suffers, but in a fashion all its own, a general 
attack (it is the sensibility particular to the organ which assures

this nonetheless discontinuous communication), and the idea of 
a propagation in the organism of a single disorder that can attack 
it in each of its parts (it is the mobility of the fiber which is 
responsible for this continuity, despite the diverse forms it 
assumes in the organs).But if the notion of “irritated fiber” certainly plays this role of 
concerted confusion, it also permits a decisive distinction in 
pathology.
