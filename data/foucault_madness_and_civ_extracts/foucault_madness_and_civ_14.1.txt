On one hand, nervous sufferers are the most irritable, 
that is, have the most sensibility: tenuousness of fiber, delicacy of 
organism; but they also have an easily impressionable soul, an 
unquiet heart, too strong a sympathy for what happens around 
them.This sort of universal resonance—simultaneously 
sensation and mobility—constitutes the first determination of 
the illness.Women who have “frail fibers,” who are easily carried 
away, in their idleness, by the lively movements of their 
imagination, are more often attacked by nervous diseases than 
men who are “more robust, drier, hardened by work.” But this 
excess of irritation has this peculiarity: that in its vivacity it 
attenuates, and sometimes ends by extinguishing, the sensations 
of the soul; as if the sensibility of the nervous organ itself 
overcharged the soul’s capacity to feel, and appropriated for its 
own advantage the multiplicity of sensations aroused by its 
extreme mobility; the nervous system “is in such a state of 
irritation and reaction that it is then incapable of transmitting to 
the soul what it is experiencing; all its figures are disordered; it 
can no longer interpret them.”21 Thus appears the idea of a 
sensibility which is not sensation, and of an inverse relation 
between that delicacy which derives as much from the soul as 
from the body, and a certain numbness of the sensations that 
prevents nervous shocks from reaching the soul.The hysteric’s 
unconsciousness is only the reverse of his sensibility.It is this 
relation, which the notion of sympathy could not define, which 
was contributed by the concept of irritability, though so little
