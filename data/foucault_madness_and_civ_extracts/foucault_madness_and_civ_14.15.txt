But by this very fact, the moral significance of “nervous 
complaints” was profoundly altered.Insofar as diseases of the 
nerves had been associated with the organic movements of the 
lower parts of the body (even by the many and confused paths of 
sympathy), they were located within a certain ethic of desire: 
they represented the revenge of a crude body; it had been as the 
result of an excessive violence that one became ill. From now on 
one fell ill from too much feeling; one suffered from an excessive 
solidarity with all the beings around one.One was no longer 
compelled by one’s secret nature; one was the victim of 
everything which, on the surface of the world, solicited the body 
and the soul.And as a result, one was both more innocent and more guilty.More innocent, because one was swept by the total irritation of 
the nervous system into an unconsciousness great in proportion 
to one’s disease.
