But more guilty, much more guilty, because 
everything to which one was attached in the world, the life one 
had led, the affections one had had, the passions and the 
imaginations one had cultivated too complacently—all combined 
in the irritation of the nerves, finding there both their natural 
effect and their moral punishment.All life was finally judged by 
this degree of irritation: abuse of things that were not natural, 
the sedentary life of cities, novel reading, theatergoing, 
immoderate thirst for knowledge, “too fierce a passion for the 
sex, or that other criminal habit, as morally reprehensible as it is 
physically harmful.”22 The innocence of the nervous sufferer, 
who no longer even feels the irritation of his nerves, is at bottom 
only the just punishment of a deeper guilt: the guilt which makes 
him prefer the world to nature: “Terrible state!...This is the 
torment of all effeminate souls whom inaction has plunged into 
dangerous sensuality, and who, to rid themselves of the labors 
imposed by nature, have embraced all the phantoms of opinion.167
