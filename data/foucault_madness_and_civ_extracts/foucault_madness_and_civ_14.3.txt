But 
once the mind becomes blind through the very excess of 
sensibilityâ€”then madness appears.But on the other hand, such an identification gives madness a 
new content of guilt, of moral sanction, of just punishment 
which was not at all a part of the classical experience.It burdens 
unreason with all these new values: instead of making blindness 
the condition of possibility for all the manifestations of madness, 
it describes blindness, the blindness of madness, as the 
psychological effect of a moralfault.And thereby compromises what 
had been essential in the experience of unreason.What had been 
blindness would become unconsciousness, what had been error 
would become fault, and everything in madness that designated 
the paradoxical manifestation of non-being would become the 
natural punishment of a moral evil.
