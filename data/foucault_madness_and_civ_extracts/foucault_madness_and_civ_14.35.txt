In short, that whole vertical 
hierarchy which constituted the structure of classical madness, 
from the cycle of material causes to the transcendence of 
delirium, would now collapse and spread over the surface of a 
domain which psychology and morality would soon occupy

together and contest with each other.The “scientific psychiatry” of the nineteenth century became 
possible.It was in these “diseases of the nerves” and in these “hysterias,”

THE therapeutics of madness did not function in the hospital, 
whose chief concern was to sever or to “correct.” And yet in the 
non-hospital domain, treatment continued to develop 
throughout the classical period: long cures for madness were 
elaborated whose aim was not so much to care for the soul as to 
cure the entire individual, his nervous fiber as well as the course 
of his imagination.The madman s body was regarded as the 
visible and solid presence of his disease: whence those physical 
cures whose meaning was borrowed from a moral perception and 
a moral therapeutics of the body.
