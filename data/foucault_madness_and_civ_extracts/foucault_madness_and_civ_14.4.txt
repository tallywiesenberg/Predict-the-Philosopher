1.Consolidation.There exists in madness, even in its most 
agitated forms, an element of weakness.If in madness the spirits 
are subjected to irregular movements, it is because they have not 
enough strength or weight to follow the gravity of their natural 
course; if spasms and convulsions so often occur in nervous 
illnesses, it is because the fiber is too mobile, or too irritable, or 
too sensitive to vibrations; in any case, it lacks robustness.Beneath the apparent violence of madness, which sometimes 
seems to multiply the strength of maniacs to considerable 
proportions, there is always a secret weakness, an essential lack of 
resistance; the madman s frenzies, in fact, are only a passive 
violence.
