What is wanted, then, is a cure that will give the spirits 
or the fibers a vigor, but a calm vigor, a strength no disorder can 
mobilize, since from the start it will be subject to the course of 
natural law.More than the image of vivacity and vigor, it is one 
of robustness that prevails, enveloping the theme in a new 
resistance, a young elasticity, but subjugated and already 
domesticated.A force must be found within nature to reinforce 
nature itself.171 



The ideal remedy would “take the part” of the spirits, and 
“help them conquer the cause that ferments them.” To take the 
part of the spirits would be to struggle against the vain agitation 
to which they are subject in spite of themselves; it would also 
permit them to escape from all the chemical ebullition that heats 
and troubles them; finally it would give them enough solidity to 
resist the vapors that try to suffocate them, to make them inert, 
and to carry them off in their whirlwind.Against the vapors, the 
spirits are reinforced “by the most stinking odors”; disagreeable 
sensation vivifies the spirits, which in a sense rebel and 
vigorously flock to the place where the assault must be repelled; 
to this effect “asafetida, oil of amber, burnt leather and feathers 
will be used—that is, whatever can provide the soul with strong 
and disagreeable feelings.” Against fermentation, theriac must be 
given, “anti-epileptic spirits of Charras,” or best of all, the 
famous Queen of Hungary water; 1 acidity disappears and the 
spirits regain their true influence.
