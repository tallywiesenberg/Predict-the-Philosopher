Finally, to restore their true 
mobility, Lange recommends that the spirits be subjected to 
sensations and movements that are both agreeable, measured, 
and regular: “When the animal spirits are dispersed and 
disunited, remedies are necessary which calm their movement 
and return them to their natural situation, such things as give the 
soul a sweet and moderate feeling of pleasure: agreeable odors, 
walks in delightful spots, the sight of persons who are in the 
habit of providing diversion, and Music.” This firm gentleness, a 
proper gravity, ultimately a vivacity intended only to protect the 
body—all these are means to consolidate, within the organism, 
the fragile elements connecting body and soul.But there is probably no better fortifying procedure than the 
use of the substance which is both the most solid and the most 
docile, the most resistant but the most pliable in the hands of the 
man who knows how to forge it to his purposes: iron.Iron 
unites, in its privileged nature, all those qualities that quickly

become contradictory when they are isolated.Nothing resists 
better, nothing can better obey; it is a gift of nature, but it is also 
at the disposal of all of man s techniques.How could man help 
nature and lend it an abundance of strength by a surer means— 
that is, one closer to nature and more obedient to man—than by 
the application of iron?
