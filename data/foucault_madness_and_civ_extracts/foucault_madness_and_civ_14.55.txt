The old example of Dioscorides is always 
cited, who gave to the inertia of water the vigorous virtues 
foreign to it by plunging into it a bar of red-hot iron.The ardor 
of fire, the calm mobility of water, the rigor of a metal treated 
until it had become suppleâ€”all these elements, united, conferred 
upon water powers of reinforceent, of vivification, of 
consolidation, which it could transmit to the organism.But iron 
is efficacious even aside from any preparation; Sydenham 
recommends it in its simplest form, by the direct absorption of 
iron filings.Whytt instances a man who, in order to cure himself 
of a weakness of the stomach nerves involving a permanent state 
of hypochondria, took 230 grains of iron every day.This was 
because to all its virtues, iron added the remarkable property of 
transmitting itself directly, without intermediary or 
transformation.
