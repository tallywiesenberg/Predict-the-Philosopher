What it communicated was not its substance but 
its strength; paradoxically, though itself so resistant, it 
immediately dissolved in the organism, depositing there only its 
qualities, without rust or waste.It is evident here that an imagery 
of wonder-working iron governs discursive thought and prevails 
over observation itself.If experiments were made, it was not to 
reveal a positive sequence of effects, but to emphasize this 
immediate communication of qualities.Wright fed a dog Mars 
salts; he observed that an hour later the chyle, if mixed with 
tincture of nut gall, did not display that purple color it invariably 
assumed if the iron had been absorbed.This must have been 
because the iron, without mixing with the digestion, without 
passing into the blood, without penetrating the organism 
substantially, fortified the membranes and fibers directly.
