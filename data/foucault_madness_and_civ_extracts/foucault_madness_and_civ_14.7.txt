The ideal was a sort of total purification: the simplest but also 
the most impossible of cures.It would consist of substituting for 
the melancholicâ€™s overcharged, thick blood, encumbered with 
bitter humors, a light, clear blood whose new movement would 
dissipate the delirium.In 1662 Moritz Hoffman suggested blood 
transfusion as a remedy for melancholia.Some years later, the 
idea had attained sufficient currency for the Philosophical 
Society of London to plan a series of experiments upon the 
subjects confined in Bedlam; Allen, the doctor entrusted with 
the enterprise, refused.But Jean-Baptiste Denis tried it upon one 
of his patients stricken with amorous melancholia; he drew off 
ten ounces of blood, which he replaced with a slightly smaller 
quantity taken from the femoral artery of a calf; the following 
day he began again, but this time the operation involved only a 
few ounces.
