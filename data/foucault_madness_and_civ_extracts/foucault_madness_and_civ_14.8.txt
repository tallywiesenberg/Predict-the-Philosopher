Whence the therapeutics that attack deterioration 
itself, and seek either to deflect the corrupt substances or to 
dissolve the corrupting ones: techniques of deflection and 
techniques of detersion.To the first belong all the strictly physical methods that seek 
to create wounds or sores on the surface of the body, both centers 
of infection that relieve the organism, and centers of evacuation 
into the outside world.Thus Fallowes explains the beneficial 
mechanism of his oleum cephalicum ; in madness, “black vapors 
clog the very fine vessels through which the animal spirits must 
pass”; the blood is thus deprived of direction; it encumbers the 
veins of the brain where it stagnates, unless it is agitated by a 
confused movement “that distracts the ideas.” Oleum cephalicum 
has the advantage of provoking “little pustules on the head”; they 
are anointed with oil to keep them from drying out and so that 
“the black vapors lodged in the brain” may continue to escape.But burning and cauterizing the body at any point produces the 
same effect.It was even supposed that diseases of the skin such 
as scabies, eczema, or smallpox could put an end to a fit of 
madness; the corruption then left the viscera and the brain, to 
spread on the surface of the body, where it was released 
externally.
