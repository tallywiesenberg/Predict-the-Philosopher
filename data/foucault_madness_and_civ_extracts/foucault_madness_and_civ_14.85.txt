By the end of the century, it became customary to 
inoculate scabies in the most resistant cases of mania.In his 
Instructions of 1785, addressed to the directors of hospitals, 
Francois Doublet recommends that if bleedings, purges, baths, 
and showers do not cure mania, the use of “cauters, setons, 
superficial abscesses, inoculation of scabies” will.But the principal task is to dissolve the fermentations which, 
having formed in the body, give rise to madness.To accomplish 
this, the chief agent is bitters.Bitterness has all the harsh virtues 
of sea water; it purifies by wearing away, it works its corrosion on 
everything useless, unhealthy, and impure that the disease may 
have deposited in the body and the soul.
