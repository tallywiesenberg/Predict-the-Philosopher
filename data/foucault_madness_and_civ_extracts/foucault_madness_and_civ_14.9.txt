Bitter and active, coffee

is useful for “fat persons whose thickened humors circulate with 
difficulty”; it dries without burning—for it is the property of 
such substances to dissipate superfluous humidity without 
dangerous heat; there is in coffee, as it were, fire without flame, a 
purifying power that does not calcine; coffee reduces impurities: 
“those who take it feel by long experience that it restores the 
stomach, consumes its superfluous humidity, dissipates wind, 
dissolves the phlegm of the bowels, where it performs a mild 
abstersion, and what is most considerable, prevents the fumes 
from rising to the head and consequently reduces the aches and 
pains customarily suffered there; finally, it affords strength, vigor, 
and cleanliness to the animal spirits, without leaving any great 
impression of heat, even upon the most inured persons who are 

accustomed to use it.” Bitter, but tonic also, is the quinine 
Whytt freely prescribes to persons “whose nervous system is very 
delicate”; it is efficacious against “weakness, discouragement, and 
depression”; two years of a cure consisting only of a tincture of 
quinine, “occasionally discontinued for a month at most,” were 
sufficient to cure a woman suffering from a nervous complaint.For delicate persons, quinine must be associated with “a 
bitterness pleasant to the taste”; but if the organism is able to 
withstand stronger attacks, vitriol, mixed with quinine, cannot be 
too strongly recommended.Twenty or thirty drops of elixir of 
vitriol are sovereign.Quite naturally, soaps and soap products inevitably enjoy 
privileged effects in this purificatory enterprise.“Soap dissolves 
almost anything that is concrete.”4 Tissot believes that soap can 
be consumed directly, and that it will calm many nervous 
ailments; but more often it is sufficient to consume, first thing in 
the morning, by themselves or with bread, “soapy fruits”—that 
is, cherries, strawberries, currants, figs, oranges, grapes, ripe 
pears, and “other fruits of this nature.” But there are cases where 
the difficulty is so serious, the obstruction so irreducible, that no

soap can conquer it.
