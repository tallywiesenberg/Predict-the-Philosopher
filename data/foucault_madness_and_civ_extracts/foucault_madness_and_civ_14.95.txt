Soluble tartar is then recommended.Muzzell was the first to have the idea of prescribing tartar for 
“madness and melancholia/’ and published several triumphant 
observations on the subject.Whytt confirms them, and shows at 
the same time that tartar functions as a detersive, since it is 
especially efficacious against obstructive illnesses: “Insofar as I 
have observed it, soluble tartar is more useful in maniac or 
melancholic affections produced by harmful humors amassed in 
the primary canals, than for those produced by a flaw in the 
brain.” Among the dissolvants, Raulin also cites honey, chimney 
soot, Oriental saffron, wood lice, powdered lobster claw, and 
bezoar.Halfway between these internal methods of dissolution and 
the external techniques of deflection, we find a series of practices 
of which the most frequent are applications of vinegar.As an 
acid, vinegar dissolves obstructions, destroys foreign bodies as 
they are fermenting.
