particular episode (Pichou’s Les Folies de Cardenio is a variation 
on the theme of the “Ragged Knight” of the Sierra Morena), or, 
in a more indirect fashion, satire on novels of fantasy (as in 
Subligny’s La Fausse Cle'lie , and within the story itself, as in the 
episode of Julie dArviane). The chimeras are transmitted from 
author to reader, but what was fantasy on one side becomes 
hallucination on the other; the writer’s stratagem is quite naively

accepted as an image of reality. In appearance, this is nothing but 
the simple-minded critique of novels of fantasy, but just under 
the surface lies an enormous anxiety concerning the 
relationships, in a work of art, between the real and the 
imaginary, and perhaps also concerning the confused 
communication between fantastic invention and the fascinations 
of delirium. “We owe the invention of the arts to deranged 
imaginations; the Caprice of Painters, Poets, and Musicians is 
only a name moderated in civility to express their Madness .”8 
Madness, in which the values of another age, another art, 
another morality are called into question, but which also reflects 
—blurred and disturbed, strangely compromised by one another 
in a common chimera—all the forms, even the most remote, of 
the human imagination. 

Immediately following this first form: the madness of vain 
presumption. But it is not with a literary model that the madman 
identifies; it is with himself, and by means of a delusive 
attachment that enables him to grant himself all the qualities, all 
the virtues or powers he lacks. He inherits the old Philautia of 
Erasmus. Poor, he is rich; ugly, he admires himself; with chains 
still on his feet, he takes himself for God. Such a one was 
Osuma’s master of arts who believed he was Neptune.9 Such is 
the ridiculous fate of the seven characters of Desmarets de Saint- 
Sorlin’s Les Visionnaires,of Chateaufort in Cyrano de Bergerac’s 
Le Pedant joue , of M. de Richesource in Sir Politik. Measureless 
madness, which has as many faces as the world has characters, 
ambitions, and necessary illusions. Even in its extremities, this is 
the least extreme of madnesses; it is, in the heart of every man, 
the imaginary relation he maintains with himself. It engenders 
the commonest of his faults. To denounce it is the first and last 
element of all moral criticism. 

To the moral world, also, belongs the madness of just 
punishment, which chastises, along with the disorders of the
