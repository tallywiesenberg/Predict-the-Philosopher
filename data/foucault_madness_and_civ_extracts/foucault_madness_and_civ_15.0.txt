But in external application, it can serve as a 
revulsive, and draw harmful humors and liquids to the surface.It 
is curious but quite characteristic of the therapeutic thinking of 
this period that no contradiction was admitted between these 
two modes of action.Given what it is by nature —detersive and 
revulsive—vinegar would act in any situation according to this 
double determination, even though one of these two modes of 
action can no longer be analyzed in a rational and discursive 
fashion.It functions, then, directly, without intermediary, 
through the simple contact of two natural elements.Hence it is 
recommended to rub the head, shaved if possible, with vinegar.
