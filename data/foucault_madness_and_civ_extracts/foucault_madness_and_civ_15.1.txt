Here two themes intersect: the theme of 
ablution, with all that relates it to the rites of purity and rebirth; 
and the much more physiological theme of impregnation or 
immersion, which modifies the essential qualities of liquids and 
solids.Despite their different origin, and the gap between their 
levels of conceptual elaboration, they form, up to the end of the 
eighteenth century, a unity coherent enough so that their 
opposition is not experienced as such.The idea of nature, with 
its ambiguities, serves as their element of cohesion.Water, the 
simple and primitive liquid, belongs to all that is purest in 
nature; all the dubious modifications man has been able to add to 
nature’s essential kindness cannot change the beneficence of 
water; when civilization, life in society, the imaginary desires 
aroused by novel reading and theatergoing provoke nervous 
ailments, the return to water’s limpidity assumes the meaning of 
a ritual of purification; in that transparent coolness, one is reborn 
to one’s first innocence.But at the same time, the water naturally 
inherent in the composition of all bodies restores each to its own 
equilibrium; water serves as a universal physiological regulator.
