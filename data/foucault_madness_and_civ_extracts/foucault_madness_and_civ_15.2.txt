When Doublet 
published his Instructions shortly before the Revolution, he 
prescribed, for the four major pathological forms he recognized 
(frenzy, mania, melancholia, imbecility), the regular use of baths, 
adding the use of cold showers for the first two.And at this 
period, Cheyne had already long since recommended that “all 
those who need to fortify their temperament” install baths in 
their house, and use them every two, three, or four days; or “if 
they have not the means, to bathe in some manner either in a 
lake or in running water, whenever they have occasion.” 

The advantages of water are evident, to a medicine dominated 
by the concern to equilibrate liquids and solids.For if water has

powers of impregnation, which place it first among the 
humectants, it has, insofar as it can receive supplementary 
qualities like cold and heat, the virtues of constriction, of cooling 
or of heating, and it can even have those effects of consolidation 
attributed to substances like iron.In fact, the interplay of 
qualities is very labile, in the fluid substance of water; just as it 
penetrates easily into the web of all the tissues, it may be easily 
impregnated by all the qualitative influences to which it is 
subjected.Paradoxically, its universal use in the eighteenth 
century was not the result of a general recognition of its effect 
and mode of action, but of the ease with which the most 
contradictory forms and modalities could be attributed to its 
action.
