It is the locus of all possible therapeutic themes, forming 
an inexhaustible reservoir of operative metaphors.In this fluid 
element occurs the universal exchange of qualities.Of course, cold water cools.Otherwise would it be used in 
frenzy and mania—diseases of heat, in which the spirits boil, 
solids stretch, liquids seethe to the point of evaporation, leaving 
the brains of these sufferers “dry and fragile,” as anatomy can 
daily testify?Reasonably enough, Barthelemy-Camille Boissieu 
cites cold water among the essential means of cooling cures; as a 
bath, it comes first among the “antiphlogistics” which tear from 
the body the excessive igneous particles found there; as a drink, it 
is a “procrastinative dilution” which diminishes the resistance of 
fluids to the actions of solids, and thus indirectly lowers the 
general heat of the body.
