But it can just as well be said that cold water heats and hot 
water cools.It is precisely this thesis which Darut defends.Cold 
baths attack the blood that is at the periphery of the body and 
“drive it more vigorously toward the heart.” But the heart being 
the seat of natural heat, there the blood is heated, especially 
because “the heart, which struggles alone against the other parts, 
makes new efforts to drive out the blood and to overcome the 
resistance of the capillaries.Whence a great intensity of

circulation, the division of the blood, the fluidity of the humors, 
the destruction of the encumbrances, the augmentation of the 
forces of natural heat, of the appetite of the digestive forces, of 
the activity of the body and the mind.” The paradox of the hot 
bath is symmetrical: it draws the blood to the periphery, as well 
as the humors, perspiration, and all liquids, useful or harmful.Thus the vital centers are relieved; the heart now must function 
slowly; and the organism is thereby cooled.
