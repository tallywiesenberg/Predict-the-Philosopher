Is not this fact 
confirmed by “those syncopes, those lipothymias, that weakness, 
that lack of vigor” which accompany the too constant use of hot 
baths?Further still: so rich is water’s polyvalence, so great its aptitude 
for submitting to the qualities it bears, that it even manages to 
lose its efficacity as a liquid, and to act as a desiccant.Water can 
conjure away humidity.It revives the old principle “like to like,” 
but in another sense, and by the intermediary of an entire visible 
mechanism.For some, it is cold water that dries, heat on the 
contrary preserving water’s humidity.
