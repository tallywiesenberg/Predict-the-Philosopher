Heat, in fact, dilates the 
pores of the organism, distends its membranes, and permits 
humidity to impregnate them by a secondary effect.Heat clears 
the way for liquids.It is precisely for this reason that all the hot 
drinks the seventeenth century used and abused risk becoming 
harmful: relaxation, general humidity, softness of the entire 
organism—this is what threatens those who consume too many 
such infusions.And since these are the distinctive traits of the 
female body, as opposed to virile dryness and solidity, the abuse 
of hot drinks risks leading to a general feminization of the 
human race: “Most men are censured, not without reason, for 
having degenerated in contracting the softness, the habits, and 
the inclinations of women; there is lacking only a resemblance in 
bodily constitution.Excessive use of humectants immediately 
accelerates the metamorphosis and makes the two sexes almost as 
alike in the physical as in the moral realm.
