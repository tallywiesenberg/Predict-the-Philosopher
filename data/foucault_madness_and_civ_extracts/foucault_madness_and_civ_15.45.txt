there will be no more plowmen, artisans, soldiers, for they will 
soon be robbed of the strength and vigor necessary to their 
profession.” In cold water, it is the cold that vanquishes all the 
powers of humidity, for by tightening the tissues, it closes them 
to all possibility of impregnation: “Do we not see how much the 
vessels, the tissues of our flesh tighten when we wash in cold 
water or when we are numbed with cold?”6 Cold baths thus have 
the paradoxical property of consolidating the organism, of 
guaranteeing it against the softness of humidity, of “giving tone 
to the parts,” as Hoffmann said, “and augmenting the systaltic 
power of the heart and the vessels.” 

But in other qualitative intuitions, the relationship is reversed; 
here it is heat that dries up water s humectant properties, while 
cold ceaselessly preserves and renews them.Against diseases of 
the nerves due to “a shriveling of the nervous system” and “the 
dryness of the membranes,” Pomme does not recommend hot 
baths—which abet the heat that reigns in the body—but tepid or 
cold baths that can permeate the tissues of the organism and 
restore their suppleness.Is this not the method spontaneously 
practiced in America?And are not its effects, its very mechanism 
visible to the naked eye in the development of the cure, since at 
the most acute point of the crisis, the sufferers float in the water 
of the bath—to such an extent has internal heat rarified the air 
and the liquids of their bodies; yet if they remain a long time in 
the bath water, “three, four, or even six hours a day,” then 
relaxation takes place, the water gradually impregnates the 
membranes and the fibers, the body becomes heavy and sinks 
naturally to the bottom.At the end of the eighteenth century, the powers of water 
wane in the very excess of its qualitative versatility: cold, it can 
heat; hot, it can cool; instead of humidifying, it is even capable of 
solidifying, of petrifying by cold, or of sustaining a fire with its 
own heat.
