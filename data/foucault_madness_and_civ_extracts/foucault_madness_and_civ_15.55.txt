By Pinefs day, water was still used, 
but it had again become entirely limpid, its qualitative overtones 
had been eliminated, and its mode of action could no longer be 
anything but mechanical.Showers, hitherto less used than baths and drinks, now 
become the favored technique.And paradoxically, water regains, 
beyond all the physiological variations of the preceding epoch, its 
simple function of purification.The only quality attributed to it 
is violence, an irresistible flow washing away all the impurities 
that form madness; by its own curative power, it reduces the 
individual to his simplest possible expression, to his merest and 
purest form of existence, thus affording him a second birth; it is a 
matter, Pinel explains, “of destroying even the smallest traces of 
the extravagant ideas of the insane, which can be done only by 
obliterating, so to speak, these ideas in a state close to that of 
death.” Whence the famous techniques used in asylums like 
Charenton at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the 
nineteenth century: the shower proper—“the insane man, 
fastened to an armchair, was placed beneath a reservoir filled 
with cold water which poured directly upon his head through a 
large pipe”; and surprise baths—“the sufferer came down the 
corridors to the ground floor, and arrived in a square vaulted 
room, in which a pool had been constructed; he was pushed over 

backwards and into the water.”?Such violence promised the 
rebirth of a baptism.
