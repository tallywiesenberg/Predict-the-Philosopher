The 
animating idea of this therapeutic theme is the restitution of a 
movement that corresponds to the prudent mobility of the 
exterior world.Since madness can be dumb immobility, 
obstinate fixation as well as disorder and agitation, the cure 
consists in reviving in the sufferer a movement that will be both 
regular and real, in the sense that it will obey the rules of the 
world’s movements.Physicians of the period evoke the firm belief of the ancients, 
who attributed salutary effects to various forms of walking and 
running: simple walking, which both limbers and strengthens the 
body; running at an ever increasing speed, which better 
distributes the juices and humors throughout the body, at the 
same time that it diminishes the weight of the organs; running 
fully dressed, which heats and loosens the tissues, softens too 
rigid fibers.Sydenham especially recommends horseback riding 
in cases of melancholia and hypochondria: “But the best thing I 
have yet found to fortify and animate the blood and the spirits, is 
to ride almost every day, and in this manner to make rather long 
excursions in the fresh air.This exercise, by the extraordinary 
jolting it causes the lungs and especially the viscera of the lower 
stomach, rids the blood of the excremental humors that reside 
there, gives resilience to the fibers, re-establishes the functions of 
the organs, reanimates natural heat, evacuates degenerate juices 
by perspiration or other means, or else re-establishes them in 
their previous state, dissipates obstructions, opens all passages,

and finally, through the continual movement it causes the blood, 
renews it, so to speak, and accords it an extraordinary vigor.”8 
The rolling of the sea, the most regular, the most natural 
movement in the world, and the one most in accord with cosmic 
order—that same movement which De Lancre once considered 
so dangerous for the human heart, offering as it did so many 
hazardous temptations, improbable and always unfulfilled 
dreams, constitutive of the image, in fact, of infinite evil—was 
considered by the eighteenth century as a powerful regulator of 
organic mobility.
