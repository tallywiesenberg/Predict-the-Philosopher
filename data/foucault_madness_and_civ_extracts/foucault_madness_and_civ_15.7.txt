In it, the very rhythm of nature spoke.Gilchrist wrote an entire treatise “on the use of sea voyages in 
Medicine”; Whytt found the remedy difficult to apply to those 
subject to melancholia; it is “difficult to convince such patients to 
undertake a long sea voyage; but a case must be cited of 
hypochondriacal vapors that immediately disappeared in a young 
man who was constrained to travel in a ship for four or five 
weeks.” 

Travel has the additional interest of acting directly upon the 
flow of ideas, or at least by a more direct means, since it passes 
only through the sensations.The variety of the landscape 
dissipates the melancholic’s obstinacy: a remedy in use since 
antiquity, but which the eighteenth century prescribed with a 
new insistence, and whose forms it varied, from real travel to the 
imaginary voyages of literature and the theater.Antoine le 
Camus prescribes “in order to relax the brain” in all cases of 
vaporous affections: “walks, journeys, rides, exercise in the fresh 
air, dancing, spectacles, diverting reading, occupations that can 
cause the obsessive idea to be forgotten.” The country, by the 
gentleness and variety of its landscapes, wins melancholics from 
their single obsession “by taking them away from the places that 
might revive the memory of their sufferings.” 

But inversely, the agitation of mania can be corrected by the 
good effects of a regular movement.This is no longer a restoring

of motion but a regulation of agitation, momentarily stopping its 
course, fixing the attention.
