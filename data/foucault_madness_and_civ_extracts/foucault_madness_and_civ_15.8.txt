We see how even in empiricism, the means of cure encounter the 
great organizing structures of the experience of madness in the 
classical period.Being both error and sin, madness is 
simultaneously impurity and solitude; it is withdrawn from the 
world, and from truth; but it is by that very fact imprisoned in 
evil.Its double nothingness is to be the visible form of that non- 
being which is evil, and to utter, in the void and in the

sensational appearances of its delirium, the non-being of error.It 
is totally pure , since it is nothing if not the evanescent point of a 
subjectivity from which all presence of the truth has been 
removed; and totally impure , since this nothingness is the non- 
being of evil.The technique of cure, down to its physical 
symbols most highly charged with iconographic intensity— 
consolidation and return to movement on the one hand, 
purification and immersion on the other—is secretly organized 
around these two fundamental themes: the subject must be 
restored to his initial purity, and must be wrested from his pure 
subjectivity in order to be initiated into the world; the non-being 
that alienates him from himself must be annihilated, and he 
must be restored to the plenitude of the exterior world, to the 
solid truth of being.
