The techniques were to subsist longer than their meaning.When, outside the experience of unreason, madness had received 
a purely psychological and moral status, when the relations of 
error and fault by which classicism defined madness were 
crammed into the single notion of guilt, the techniques still 
remained, but with a much more restricted significance; all that 
was sought was a mechanical effect, or a moral punishment.It 
was in this manner that the methods of regulating movement 
degenerated into the famous “rotatory machine” whose 
mechanism and efficacity were demonstrated by Mason Cox at 
the beginning of the nineteenth century: 10 a perpendicular pillar 
is attached to both floor and ceiling; the sufferer is attached to a 
chair or a bed hung from a horizontal arm moving around the 
pillar; by means of a “not very complicated system of gears” the 
machine is set for “the degree of speed desired.” Cox cites one of 
his own observations; it concerns a man whom melancholia had 
thrown into a kind of stupor: “His complexion was dark and 
leaden, his eyes yellow, his looks constantly fixed upon the 
ground, his limbs motionless, his tongue dry and paralyzed, and

his pulse slow.” This sufferer was placed upon the rotatory 
machine, which was set at an increasingly rapid movement.The 
effect surpassed expectation; the sufferer became excessively 
disturbed: melancholic rigidity gave way to manic agitation.But 
this first effect passed, and the invalid relapsed into his initial 
state.
