The rhythm was then changed; the machine was made to 
turn very rapidly, but it was stopped at regular intervals, and in a 
very abrupt manner.The melancholia was driven out, without 
the rotation having had time to release the manic agitation.This 
“centrifugation” of melancholia is very characteristic of the new 
use of the old therapeutic themes.Movement no longer aimed at 
restoring the invalid to the truth of the exterior world, but only 
at producing a series of internal effects, purely mechanical and 
purely psychological.It was no longer the presence of the truth 
that determined the cure, but a functional norm.
