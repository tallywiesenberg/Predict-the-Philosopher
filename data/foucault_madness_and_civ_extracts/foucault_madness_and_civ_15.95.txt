In this 
reinterpretation of the old method, the organism was no longer 
related to anything but itself and its own nature, while in the 
initial version, what was to be restored was its relation with the 
world, its essential link with being and with truth: if we add that 
the rotatory machine was soon used as a threat and a 
punishment, we see the impoverishment of the meanings which 
had richly sustained the therapeutic methods throughout the 
entire classical period.Medicine was now content to regulate and 
to punish, with means which had once served to exorcise sin, to 
dissipate error in the restoration of madness to the world’s 
obvious truth.In 1771, Bienville wrote apropos of Nymphomania that there 
were times when it could be cured “merely by treating the 
imagination; but there were none or almost none when physical 
remedies alone could effect a radical cure.” And a little later,

the symbols begins to break down, and the techniques lose their 
total significance.They are no longer credited with more than a 
local efficacity—on the body or on the soul.
