The cure again 
changes direction; it is no longer determined by the meaningful 
unity of the disease, organized around its major qualities; but, 
segment by segment, must address itself to the various elements 
that compose the disease; the cure will consist of a series of 
partial destructions, in which psychological attack and physical 
intervention are juxtaposed, complement each other, but never 
interpenetrate.In fact, what to us seems already the outline of a psychological 
cure was no such thing to the classical physicians who applied it.Since the Renaissance, music had regained all those therapeutic 
virtues antiquity had attributed to it.Its effects were especially 
remarkable upon madness.Johann Schenck cured a man “fallen 
into a profound melancholia” by having him attend “concerts of 
musical instruments that particularly pleased him”; Wilhelm 
Albrecht also cured a delirious patient, after having tried all other 
remedies in vain, by prescribing the performance, during one of 
his attacks, of “a little song which awakened the sufferer, pleased 
him, excited him to laugh, and dispelled the paroxysm forever.” 
Even cases of frenzy were cited as having been cured by music.
