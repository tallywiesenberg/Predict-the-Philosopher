in the literary experience of madness. 

In Shakespeare or Cervantes, madness still occupies an 
extreme place, in that it is beyond appeal. Nothing ever restores 
it either to truth or to reason. It leads only to laceration and 
thence to death. Madness, in its vain words, is not vanity; the 
void that fills it is a “disease beyond my practice,” as the doctor 
says about Lady Macbeth; it is already the plenitude of death; a 
madness that has no need of a physician, but only of divine 
mercy. The sweet joy Ophelia finally regains reconciles her with 
no happiness; her mad song is as close to the essential as the “cry 
of women” that announces through the corridors of Macbeth’s 
castle that “the Queen is dead.” Certainly Don Quixote’s death 
occurs in a peaceful landscape, which at the last moment has 
rejoined reason and truth. Suddenly the Knight’s madness has 
grown conscious of itself, and in his own eyes trickles out in 
nonsense. But is this sudden wisdom of his folly anything but “a 
new madness that had just come into his head”? The 
equivocation is endlessly reversible and cannot be resolved, 
ultimately, except by death itself. Madness dissipated can be only 
the same thing as the imminence of the end; “and even one of 
the signs by which they realized that the sick man was dying, was 
that he had returned so easily from madness to reason.” But 
death itself does not bring peace; madness will still triumph—a 
truth mockingly eternal, beyond the end of a life which yet had 
been delivered from madness by this very end. Ironically, Don 
Quixote’s insane life pursues and immortalizes him only by his 
insanity; madness is still the imperishable life of death: “Here lies 
the famous hidalgo who carried valor to such lengths that it was 
said death could not triumph over life by his demise.”

But very soon, madness leaves these ultimate regions where 
Cervantes and Shakespeare had situated it; and in the literature 
of the early seventeenth century it occupies, by preference, a 
median place; it thus constitutes the knot more than the 
denouement, the peripity rather than the final release. Displaced 
in the economy of narrative and dramatic structures, it authorizes 
the manifestation of truth and the return of reason. 

Thus madness is no longer considered in its tragic reality, in 
the absolute laceration that gives it access to the other world; but 
only in the irony of its illusions. It is not a real punishment, but 
only the image of punishment, thus a pretense; it can be linked 
only to the appearance of a crime or to the illusion of a death.
