Now, such observations were never meant to suggest 
psychological interpretations.If music cured, it was by acting 
upon the entire human being, by penetrating the body as 
directly, as efficaciously as it did the soul: did not Diemerbroek 
know of people stricken with the plague who had been cured by 
music?Doubtless most people no longer believed, as

Giambattista della Porta still did, that music, in the material 
reality of its sounds, afforded the body the secret virtues hidden 
in the very substance of the instruments; no longer believed, as 
he did, that lymphatics were cured by “a lively air played on a 
holly flute,” or that melancholics were soothed by “a soft air 
played on a hellebore flute,” or that it was necessary to use “a 
flute made of larkspur or iris stems to cure impotent and frigid 
men.” But if music no longer transmitted the virtues sealed in 
substances, it was efficacious upon the body because of the 
qualities it imposed upon it.It even constituted the most 
rigorous of all the mechanisms of quality, since at its origin it 
was nothing but movement, whereas once it had reached the ear 
it immediately became qualitative effect.Music’s therapeutic 
value occurred because this transformation was undone in the 
body, quality there re-decomposed into movements, the pleasure 
of sensation became what it had always been: regular vibrations 
and equilibrium of tensions.
