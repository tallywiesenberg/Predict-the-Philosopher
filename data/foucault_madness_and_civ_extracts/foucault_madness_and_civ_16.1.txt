Man, as unity of soul and body, 
followed the cycle of harmony in a reverse direction, 
redescending from the harmonious to the harmonic.In him, 
music was decomposed, but health restored.But there was 
another avenue, still more direct and more efficacious: by taking 
it, man no longer played the negative role of anti-instrument; he 
reacted as if he himself were the instrument: “If one were to 
consider the human body as merely an assemblage of more or 
less taut fibers, ignoring their sensibility, their life, their 
movement, one would easily conceive that music must produce 
the same effect on the fibers as it does on the strings of similar 
instruments;”!1 an effect of resonance which has no need to 
follow the long and complex paths of auditory sensation.The 
nervous system vibrates with the music that fills the air; the 
fibers are like so many “deaf dancers” whose movement keeps 
time to a music they do not hear.
