It was considered 
the natural complement of the constraints imposed upon 
maniacs and lunatics; a sort of discipline was even imagined 
which would immediately accompany and compensate every 
attack of anger in a maniac by a reaction of fear: “It is by force 
that the furies of a maniac are overcome; it is by opposing fear to 
anger that anger may be mastered.If the terror of punishment 
and public shame are associated in the mind during attacks of 
anger, one will not appear without the other; the poison and the 
antidote are inseparable.”12 But fear is efficacious not only at the 
level of the effects of the disease; it is the disease itself that fear 
attacks and suppresses.It has, in fact, the property of petrifying 
the operations of the nervous system, somehow congealing its 
too mobile fibers, controlling all their disordered movements; 
“fear being a passion that diminishes the excitation of the brain, 
it can consequently calm its excesses, and especially the irascible 
excitation of maniacs.”!3 

If the fear-anger antithesis is efficacious against manic 
irritation, it can be used inversely against the unmotivated fears 
of melancholics, hypochondriacs, and all those who have a 
lymphatic temperament.Tissot, reviving the traditional idea that 
anger is a discharge of bile, considers that it is useful for 
dissolving the phlegms amassed in the stomach and in the blood.191 


By subjecting the nervous fibers to a stronger tension, anger gives 
them more vigor, thus restoring their lost elasticity and 
permitting fear to disappear.
