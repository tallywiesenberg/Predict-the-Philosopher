The cure by passion is based on a 
constant metaphor of qualities and movements; it always implies 
that they are immediately transferable in their own modality 
from the body to the soul, and vice versa.It must be used, says 
Scheidenmantel in the treatise he devotes to this form of cure, 
“when the cure necessitates in the body changes identical to 
those which this passion produces/’ And it is in this sense that it 
can be the universal substitute for all other physical therapeutics; 
it is only another way to produce the same sequence of effects.Between a cure by the passions and a cure by the prescriptions of 
the pharmacopoeia, there is no difference in nature; but only a 
diversity in the mode of access to those mechanisms which are 
common to the body and to the soul.“The passions must be 
utilized, if the sufferer cannot be led by reason to do what is 
necessary for the restoration of his health.” 

It is thus not possible to use as a valid or at least meaningful 
distinction for the classical period the difference—immediately 
apparent to us—between physical medications and psychological 
or moral medications.The difference only begins to exist in all 
its profundity the day when fear is no longer used as a method 
for arresting movement, but as a punishment; when joy does not 
signify organic expansion, but reward; when anger is nothing 
more than a response to concerted humiliation; in short, when 
the nineteenth century, by inventing its famous “moral 
methods,” has brought madness and its cure into the domain of 
guilt.
