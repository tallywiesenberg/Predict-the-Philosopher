“Do not 
employ consolations, they are useless; have no recourse to 
reasoning, it does not persuade; do not be sad with melancholics, 
your sadness sustains theirs; do not assume an air of gaiety with 
them, they are only hurt by it.What is required is great sang¬ 
froid, and when necessary, severity.Let your reason be their rule 
of conduct.A single string still vibrates in them, that of pain; 
have courage enough to pluck it.”14 

The heterogeneity of the physical and the moral in medical 
thought is not a result of Descartes’s definition of substances; a 
century and a half of post-Cartesian medicine did not succeed in 
assimilating that separation on the level of problems and 
methods, nor in understanding the distinction of substances as 
an opposition of organic to psychological.
