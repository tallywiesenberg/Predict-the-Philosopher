Cartesian or anti- 
Cartesian, classical medicine never introduced Descartesâ€™s 
metaphysical dualism into anthropology.And when the 
separation did occur, it was not by a renewed loyalty to the 
Meditations , but by a new privilege accorded to transgression.Only the use of punishment distinguished, in treating the mad, 
the medications of the body from those of the soul.A purely 
psychological medicine was made possible only when madness 
was alienated in guilt.Of this, however, a whole aspect of medical practice during 
the classical period might stand as a long denial.
