The 
psychological element, in its purity, seems to have its place 
among the techniques.How else explain the importance attached 
to exhortation, to persuasion, to reasoning, to that whole 
dialogue in which the classical physician engages with his 
patient, independently of the cure by bodily remedies?How

explain that Sauvages can write, in agreement with all his 
contemporaries: “One must be a philosopher to be able to cure 
the diseases of the soul.For as the origin of these diseases is 
nothing more than a violent desire for a thing which the sufferer 
envisages as a good, it is part of the physician’s duty to prove to 
him by solid reasons that what he desires so ardently is an 
apparent good but a real evil, in order to make him renounce his 
error.” 

In fact this approach to madness is neither more nor less 
psychological than any of those we have already discussed.Language, the formulations of truth or morality, are in direct 
contact with the body; and it is Bienville again, in his treatise on 
Nymphomania , who shows how the adoption or the rejection of 
an ethical principle can directly modify the course of organic 
processes.
