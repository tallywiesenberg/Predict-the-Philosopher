However, there is a difference in nature between those 
techniques which consist in modifying the qualities common to 
body and soul, and those which consist in treating madness by 
discourse.In the first case, the technique is one of metaphors, at 
the level of a disease that is a deterioration of nature; in the 
second, the technique is one of language, at the level of a 
madness perceived as reason s debate with itself.The technique, 
in this last form, functions in a domain where madness is 
“treated”—in all the senses of the word—in terms of truth and 
error.In short, there always existed, throughout the classical 
period, a juxtaposition of two technical universes in the 
therapeutics of madness.One, which is based on an implicit 
mechanics of qualities, and which addresses madness as 
essentially passion —that is, a certain compound (movement- 
quality) belonging to both body and soul; the other, which is 
based on the discursive movement of reason reasoning with 
itself, and which addresses madness as error, as double inanity of 
language and image, as delirium.
