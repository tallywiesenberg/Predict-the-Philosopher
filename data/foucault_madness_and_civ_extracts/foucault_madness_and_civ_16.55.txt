Madness is deprived of its dramatic seriousness; it is punishment 
or despair only in the dimension of error. Its dramatic function 
exists only insofar as we are concerned with a false drama; a 
chimerical form in which only supposed faults, illusory murders, 
ephemeral disappearances are involved.
