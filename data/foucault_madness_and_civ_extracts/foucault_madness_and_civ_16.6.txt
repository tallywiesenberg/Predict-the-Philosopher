Awakening.Since delirium is the dream of waking persons, 
those who are delirious must be torn from this quasi-sleep, 
recalled from their waking dream and its images to an authentic 
awakening, where the dream disappears before the images of 
perception.Descartes sought this absolute awakening, which 
dismisses one by one all the forms of illusion, at the beginning of 
his Meditations , and found it, paradoxically, in the very awareness 
of the dream, in the consciousness of deluded consciousness.But 
in madmen, it is medicine which must effect the awakening, 
transforming the solitude of Cartesian courage into an 
authoritarian intervention, by the man awake and certain of his 
wakefulness, into the illusion of the man who sleeps waking: a 
short cut that dogmatically reduces Descartesâ€™s long road.What 
Descartes discovers at the end of his resolution and in the 
doubling of a consciousness that never separates from itself and 
does not split, medicine imposes from outside, and in the 
dissociation of doctor and patient.
