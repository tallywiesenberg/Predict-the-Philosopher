The physician, in relation to 
the madman, reproduces the moment of the Cogito in relation 
to the time of the dream, of illusion, and of madness.A 
completely exterior Cogito, alien to cogitation itself, and which 
can be imposed upon it only in the form of an invasion.This structure of invasion by wakefulness is one of the most 
constant forms among the therapeutics of madness.It often 
assumes the simplest aspects, simultaneously those most highly 
charged with images and those most credited with immediate 
powers.It is asserted that a gun discharged near her cured a 
young girl of convulsions contracted as the result of severe grief.
