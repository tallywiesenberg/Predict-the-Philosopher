Without going so far as this iconographic representation of the 
methods of awakening, sudden and strong emotions achieve the

same result.It is in this spirit that Boerhaave performed his 
famous cure of convulsives at Haarlem.In the city hospital, an 
epidemic of convulsions had broken out.Antispasmodics, 
administered in strong doses, did no good.Boerhaave ordered 
“that stoves filled with burning coals be brought, and that iron 
hooks of a certain form be heated in them; thereupon, he said in 
a loud voice that since all the means hitherto employed in 
attempting to cure the convulsions had been useless, he knew of 
only one other remedy, which was to burn to the bone, with red- 
hot irons, a certain spot on the arm of any person, male or 
female, who suffered an attack of a convulsive illness.”15 

Slower, but also more certain of the truth it confronts, is the 
awakening that proceeds from wisdom itself and from its 
insistent, imperative progress through the landscapes of madness.
