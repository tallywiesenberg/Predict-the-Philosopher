From this wisdom, in its various forms, Willis sought the cure of 
the various madnesses.For imbeciles, a pedagogical wisdom; an 
“attentive and devoted master must educate them completely”; 
they must be taught, little by little and very slowly, what children 
are taught in school.For melancholics, a wisdom that takes as its 
model the most rigorous and most evident forms of truth: what 
is imaginary in their delirium will disappear in the light of an 
incontestable truth; this is why “mathematical and chemical” 
studies are strongly recommended.For the others, the wisdom of 
a well-ordered life will reduce their delirium; there is no need to 
impose upon them any other truth than that of their everyday 
life; remaining in their homes, “they must continue to manage 
their affairs, direct their families, order and cultivate their estates, 
their gardens, their orchards, their fields.” It is, on the contrary, 
the exactitude of a social order, imposed from without and, if 
necessary, by force, that can gradually restore the minds of 
maniacs to the light of truth: “For this, the insane person, placed 
in a special house, will be treated, either by the doctor or by 
trained assistants, in such a way that he may be always

maintained in his duty, in his appearance and habits, by 
warnings, by remonstrances, and by punishments immediately 

inflicted.” 16 

Little by little during the classical period, this authoritarian 
awakening of madness would lose its original meaning and limit 
itself to being no more than recollection of moral law, return to 
the good, fidelity to the law.What Willis still intended as a 
reintroduction to truth would no longer be entirely understood 
by Sauvages, who speaks of lucidity in the recognition of the 
good: “Thus, one can recall to reason those whom false principles 
of moral philosophy have caused to lose their own, as long as 
they are willing to examine with us what is truly good, and what 
things are to be preferred to others.” Already it is no longer as 
awakener that the physician is to function, but as moralist.
