Against madness, Tissot considers that “a pure conscience, 
without reproach, is an excellent preservative.” And soon comes 
Pinel, for whom the awakening to truth no longer has a meaning 
in the cure, but only obedience and blind submission: “A 
fundamental principle for the cure of mania in a great number of 
cases is to resort first of all to an energetic repression, and to 
proceed subsequently to methods of benevolence.” 

2.Theatrical Representation.In appearance at least, this is a 
technique rigorously opposed to that of awakening.There, 
delirium, in all its immediate vivacity, was confronted by the 
patient work of reason.Either in the form of a slow pedagogy, or 
the form of an authoritarian invasion, reason was imposed, as if 
by the weight of its own being.
