Illusion can cure the illusoryâ€”while reason alone can 
free from the unreasonable.What then is this dark power of the 
imaginary?Insofar as it is of the essence of the image to be taken for 
reality, it is reciprocally characteristic of reality that it can mime 
the image, pretend to the same substance, the same significance.Without a break, without a jolt, perception can continue the 
dream, fill in its gaps, confirm what is precarious about it, and 
lead it to its fulfillment.If illusion can appear as true as 
perception, perception in its turn can become the visible, 
unchallengeable truth of illusion.
