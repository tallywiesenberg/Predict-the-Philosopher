Such is the first step of the cure 
by “theatrical representation”: to integrate the unreality of the 
image into perceived truth, without the latter seeming to 
contradict or even contest the former.Thus Zacatus Lusitanus 
describes the cure of a melancholic who believed himself damned 
while still on earth because of the enormity of the sins he had 
committed.In the impossibility of convincing him by reasonable 
arguments that he could be saved, his physicians accepted his 
delirium and caused an “angel” dressed in white, with a sword in 
its hand, to appear to him, and after a severe exhortation this 
delusive vision announced that his sins had been remitted.From this very example, we see the next step: representation 
within the image is not enough; it is also necessary to continue the 
delirious discourse.For in the patient’s insane words there is a 
voice that speaks; it obeys its own grammar, it articulates a 
meaning.
