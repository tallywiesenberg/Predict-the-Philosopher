“starting over,” and the first step toward what will turn out to be 
the reconciliation with reason and truth. It marks the point 
toward which converge, apparently, the tragic destinies of the 
characters, and from which, in reality, emerge the lines leading 
to happiness regained. In madness equilibrium is established, but 
it masks that equilibrium beneath the cloud of illusion, beneath 
feigned disorder; the rigor of the architecture is concealed 
beneath the cunning arrangement of these disordered violences. 
The sudden bursts of life, the random gestures and words, the 
wind of madness that suddenly breaks lines, shatters attitudes, 
rumples draperies—while the strings are merely being pulled 
tighter—this is the very type of baroque trompe-Foeil. Madness is 
the great trompe-Foeil in the tragicomic structures of preclassical

literature. 

This was understood by Georges de Scudery, who made his 
Comedie des comediens a theater of theater, situating his play, from 
the start, in the interacting illusions of madness. One group of 
actors takes the part of spectators, another that of actors. The 
former must pretend to take the decor for reality, the play for 
life, while in reality these actors are performing in a real decor; 
on the other hand, the latter must pretend to play the part of 
actors, while in fact, quite simply, they are actors acting. A 
double impersonation in which each element is doubled, thus 
forming that renewed exchange of the real and the illusory which 
is itself the dramatic meaning of madness. “I do not know,” 
Mondory says in the prologue to Scudery’s play, “what 
extravagance has today come over my companions, but it is so 
great that I am forced to believe that some spell has robbed them 
of their reason, and the worst of it is that they are trying to make 
me lose mine, and you yours as well. They wish to persuade me 
that I am not on a stage, that this is the city of Lyons, that over 
there is an inn, and there an innyard where actors who are not 
ourselves, yet who are, are performing a Pastoral.” In this 
extravaganza, the theater develops its truth, which is illusion. 
Which is, in the strict sense, madness. 

The classical experience of madness is born. The great threat 
that dawned on the horizon of the fifteenth century subsides, the 
disturbing powers that inhabit Bosch’s painting have lost their 
violence. Forms remain, now transparent and docile, forming a 
cortege, the inevitable procession of reason. Madness has ceased 
to be—at the limits of the world, of man and death—an 
eschatological figure; the darkness has dispersed on which the
