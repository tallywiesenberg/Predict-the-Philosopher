not seem like the transition from one register to another, like a 
translation into a new language, with an altered meaning.The 
same language must continue to make itself understood, merely 
bringing a new deductive element to the rigor of its discourse.Yet this element is not indifferent; the problem is not to pursue 
the delirium, but by continuing it to bring it to an end.It must 
be led to a state of paroxysm and crisis in which, without any 
addition of a foreign element, it is confronted by itself and forced 
to argue against the demands of its own truth.The real and 
perceptual discourse that prolongs the delirious language of the 
images must therefore, without escaping the latterâ€™s laws, 
without departing from its sovereignty, exercise a positive 
function in relation to it; it tightens that language around its 
essential element; if it represents it at the risk of confirming it, it 
is in order to dramatize it.
