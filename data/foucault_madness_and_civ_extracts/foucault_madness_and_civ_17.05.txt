The case is cited of a sufferer who 
thought that he was dead, and was really dying from not eating; 
“a group of people who had made themselves pale and were 
dressed like the dead, entered his room, set up a table, brought 
food, and began to eat and drink before the bed.The starving 
‘dead man’ looked at them; they were astonished that he stayed 
in bed; they persuaded him that dead people eat at least as much 
as living ones.He readily accommodated himself to this idea.”18 
It is within a continuous discourse that the elements of delirium, 
coming into contradiction, bring on the crisis.A crisis which is, 
in a very ambiguous manner, both medical and theatrical; a 
whole tradition of Western medicine dating from Hippocrates 
here intersects, suddenly and for only a few years, with one of the 
major forms of theatrical experience.Before us appears the great 
theme of a crisis that confronts the madman with his own 
meaning, reason with unreason, man’s lucid ruse with the 
blindness of the lunatic—a crisis which marks the point at which 
illusion, turned back upon itself, will open to the dazzlement of 
truth.
