But sometimes, there is even no need of this “distancing.” It is 
within the quasi-perception of the delirium that there is 
established, by means of a ruse, a perceptual element, silent at 
first, but whose gradual affirmation will come to contest the

of void in its place; the physician, entering into the delirium, 
agreed at the sufferer’s request to fill up this space, and placed 
upon his head a great ball of lead.Soon the discomfort that 
resulted from the painful weight convinced the invalid that he 
had a head.Ultimately the ruse and its function of comic 
reduction can be assured, with the complicity of the physician 
but without any other direct intervention on his part, by the 
spontaneous reaction of the sufferer’s organism.
