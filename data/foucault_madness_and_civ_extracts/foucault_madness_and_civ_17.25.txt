3.The Return to the Immediate.Since madness is illusion, the 
cure of madness, if it is true that such a cure can be effected by 
theater, can also and still more directly be effected by the

suppression of theater.To entrust madness and its empty world 
directly to the plenitude of a nature which does not deceive 
because its immediacy does not acknowledge non-being, is to 
deliver madness both to its own truth (since madness, as a 
disease, is after all only a natural being), and to its closest 
contradiction (since delirium, as appearance without content, is 
the very contrary of the often secret and invisible wealth of 
nature).This contradiction thus appears as the reason of 
unreason, in a double sense: it withholds unreasonâ€™s causes, and 
at the same time conceals the principle of its suppression.
