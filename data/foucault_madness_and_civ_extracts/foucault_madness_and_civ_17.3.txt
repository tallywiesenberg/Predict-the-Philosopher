It must 
be noted, however, that these themes are not contemporary with 
the classical period for its entire duration.Although they are 
organized around the same experience of unreason, they follow 
after the themes of theatrical representation; and their 
appearance marks the moment when the debate on being and 
illusion begins to yield to a problematics of nature.Games of 
theatrical illusion lose their meaning, and the artificial 
techniques of iconographic representation are replaced by the 
simple and confident act of a natural reduction.And this in an 
ambiguous direction, since it is as much a question of reduction 
by nature as of a reduction to nature.The return to the immediate is the therapeutics par excellence , 
because it is the rigorous refusal of therapeutics: it cures insofar 
as it is a disregard of all cures.
