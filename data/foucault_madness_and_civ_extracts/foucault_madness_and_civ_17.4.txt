I gave up most books; I turned my eyes to the 
works of nature, which addressed all my senses in a language that 
neither time nor nations can corrupt.My history and my 
newspapers were the plants of the field and forest; it was not my 
thoughts that struggled to them, as in the system of men, but 
their thoughts that came to me in a thousand agreeable 

shapes.”20 

Despite the formulations of it which certain disciples of 
Rousseau managed to propose, this return to the immediate was 
neither absolute nor simple.For madness, even if it is provoked 
or sustained by what is most artificial in society, appears, in its 
violent forms, as the savage expression of the most primitive 
human desires.Madness in the classical period, as we have seen, 
is rooted in the threats of bestiality—a bestiality completely 
dominated by predatory and murderous instincts.To entrust 
madness to nature would be, by an uncontrolled reversal, to 
abandon it to that fury of anti-nature.
