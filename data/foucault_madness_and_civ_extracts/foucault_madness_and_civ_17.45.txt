The cure of madness thus 
supposes a return to what is immediate, not in relation to desire, 
but in relation to the imagination—a return that dismisses from 
man’s life and pleasures everything that is artificial, unreal, 
imaginary.The therapeutics, by the reflective plunge into the 
immediate, secretly supposes the mediation of a wisdom which 
distinguishes, in nature, between what derives from violence and

what derives from truth.This is the whole difference between 
the Savage and the Laborer.“Savages ... lead the life of a 
carnivorous animal rather than that of a reasonable being”; the 
life of the Laborer, on the other hand, “is in fact happier than 
that of the man of the world.” On the savage’s side, immediate 
desire, without discipline, without constraint, without real 
morality; on the laborer’s side, pleasure without mediation, in 
other words, without vain stimulus, without provocation or 
imaginary achievement.What, in nature and its immediate 
virtues, cures madness is pleasure—but a pleasure that on one 
hand makes desire vain without even having to repress it, since it 
offers a plenitude of satisfaction in advance, and on the other 
makes imagination absurd, since it spontaneously contributes the 
happy presence of reality.
