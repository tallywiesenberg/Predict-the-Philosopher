“Pleasures enter into the eternal order 
of things; they exist invariably; certain conditions are necessary to 
form them ...; these conditions are not arbitrary; nature has 
formed them; imagination cannot create, and the man most 
devoted to pleasures can increase them only by renouncing all 
those which do not bear this stamp of nature.”21 The immediate 
world of the laborer is thus a world suffused with wisdom and 
measure, which cures madness insofar as it renders desire useless, 
along with the movements of passion desire gives rise to, and 
also insofar as it reduces along with the imaginary all the 
possibilities of delirium.What Tissot understands by “pleasure” 
is this immediate curative agent, liberated from both passion and 
language: that is, from the two great forms of human experience 
that give birth to unreason.And perhaps nature, as the concrete form of the immediate, 
has an even more fundamental power in the suppression of 
madness.For it has the power of freeing man from his freedom.
