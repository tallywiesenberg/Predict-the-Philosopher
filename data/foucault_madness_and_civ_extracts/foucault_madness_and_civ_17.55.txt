(those which force him “to calculate and draw up the balance 
sheet of his imaginary pleasures which bear that name but are 
none”) and from the uncontrollable movement of the passions.But by that very fact, he is gently and as it were internally bound 
by a system of natural obligations.The pressures of the healthiest 
needs, the rhythm of the days and the seasons, the calm necessity 
to feed and shelter oneself, constrain the disorder of madmen to 
a regular observance.The excessively remote inventions of the 
imagination are dismissed, along with the excessively urgent 
disguises of desire.In the gentleness of a pleasure that does not 
constrain, man is linked to the wisdom of nature, and this 
fidelity in the form of freedom dissipates the unreason which 
juxtaposes in its paradox the extreme determinism of passion and 
the extreme fantasy of the image.
