Thus one begins to dream, in 
these mingled landscapes of ethics and medicine, of a liberation 
from madness: a liberation that must not be understood in its 
origin as the discovery, by philanthropy, of the humanity of 
madmen, but as a desire to open madness to the gentle 
constraints of nature.The old village of Gheel which, from the end of the Middle 
Ages, still bore witness to the now forgotten relation between the 
confinement of madmen and the exclusion of lepers, also 
received in the last years of the eighteenth century a sudden 
reinterpretation.What had once marked, here, the entire violent, 
pathetic separation of the world of madmen from the world of 
men, now conveyed the idyllic values of a rediscovered unity of 
unreason and nature.This village had once signified that 
madmen were confined, and that therefore the man of reason 
was protected from them; now it manifested that the madman 
was liberated, and that, in this liberty which put him on a level 
with the laws of nature, he was reconciled with the man of 
reason.At Gheel, according to Jouy s description of it, “four- 
fifths of the inhabitants are mad, but mad in the full sense of the 
word, and they enjoy without restraint the same freedom as the

other citizens.... Healthful food, pure air, all the devices of 
liberty: such is the regimen prescribed for them, and to which 
the greatest number, by the end of a year, owe their cure.” 
Without anything in the institutions having as yet really 
changed, the meaning of exclusion and of confinement begins to 
alter: it slowly assumes positive values, and the neutral, empty, 
nocturnal space in which unreason was formerly restored to its 
nothingness begins to be peopled by a nature to which madness, 
liberated, is obliged to submit.
