and most efficacious way to restore man to reason.”22 Beneath 
the conventional images, the rigor of a meaning is easily 
perceived.The return to the immediate is effective against 
unreason only insofar as the immediate is controlled—and 
divided against itself; an immediate in which violence is isolated 
from truth, savagery separated from liberty, in which nature can 
no longer recognize itself in the fantastic figures of anti-nature.In short, an immediate in which nature is mediatized by 
morality.In a space so arranged, madness will never again be able 
to speak the language of unreason, with all that in it transcends 
the natural phenomena of disease.It will be entirely enclosed in a 
pathology.
