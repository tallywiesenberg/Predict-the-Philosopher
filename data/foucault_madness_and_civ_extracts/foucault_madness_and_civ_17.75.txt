A transformation which later periods have received as 
a positive acquisition, the accession, if not of a truth, at least of 
what would make the recognition of truth possible; but which in 
the eyes of history must appear as what it was: that is, the 
reduction of the classical experience of unreason to a strictly 
moral perception of madness, which would secretly serve as a 
nucleus for all the concepts that the nineteenth century would 
subsequently vindicate as scientific, positive, and experimental.This metamorphosis, which occurred in the second half of the 
eighteenth century, was initiated in the techniques of cure.But it 
very quickly appeared more generally, winning over the minds of 
reformers, guiding the great reorganization of the experience of 
madness in the last years of the century.Very soon Pinel could 
write: “How necessary it is, in order to forestall hypochondria, 
melancholia, or mania, to follow the immutable laws of 
morality!” 

In the classical period, it is futile to try to distinguish physical 
therapeutics from psychological medications, for the simple 
reason that psychology did not exist.When the consumption of 
bitters was prescribed, for example, it was not a question of 
physical treatment, since it was the soul as well as the body that 
was to be scoured; when the simple life of a laborer was

prescribed for a melancholic, when the comedy of his delirium 
was acted out before him, this was not a psychological 
intervention, since the movement of the spirits in the nerves, the 
density of the humors were principally involved.
