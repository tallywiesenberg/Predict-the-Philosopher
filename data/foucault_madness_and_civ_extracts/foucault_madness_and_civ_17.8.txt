But in the first 
case, we are dealing with an art of the transformation of qualities , a 
technique in which the essence of madness is taken as nature, 
and as disease; in the second, we are dealing with an art of 
discourse, and of the restitution of truth , in which madness is 
significant as unreason.When, in the years that followed, this great experience of 
unreason, whose unity is characteristic of the classical period, was 
dissociated, when madness, entirely confined within a moral 
intuition, was nothing more than disease, then the distinction we 
have just established assumed another meaning; what had 
belonged to disease pertained to the organic, and what had 
belonged to unreason, to the transcendence of its discourse, was 
relegated to the psychological.And it is precisely here that 
psychology was bornâ€”not as the truth of madness, but as a sign 
that madness was now detached from its truth which was 
unreason and that it was henceforth nothing but a phenomenon 
adrift, insignificant upon the undefined surface of nature.An 
enigma without any truth except that which could reduce it.This is why we must do justice to Freud.
