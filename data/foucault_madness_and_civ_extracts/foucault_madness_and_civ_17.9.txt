THE GREAT FEAR 


“ONE afternoon, I was there, looking a great deal, speaking 
rarely, listening as little as I could, when I was accosted by one of 
the most bizarre persons in this country, where God has not let 
them lack.He was a mixture of loftiness, baseness, good sense, 
and unreason.” 

In doubt’s confrontation with its major dangers, Descartes 
realized that he could not be mad—though he was to 
acknowledge for a long time to come that all the powers of 
unreason kept vigil around his thought; but as a philosopher, 
resolutely undertaking to doubt, he could not be “one of these 
insane ones.” Rameau’s Nephew, though, knew quite well—and 
among his fleeting certainties, this was the most obstinate—that 
he was mad.“Before beginning, he heaved a profound sigh and 
raised his hands to his forehead; then he regained his calm 
demeanor and said to me: you know I am ignorant, mad, 
impertinent, and lazy.”l 

The eighteenth century could not exactly understand the 
meaning expressed in Le Neveu de Rameau.Yet something had 
happened, just when the text was written, which promised a 
decisive change.A curious thing: the unreason that had been 
relegated to the distance of confinement reappeared, fraught 
with new dangers and as if endowed with a new power of 
interrogation.
