When, utterly devoted to these 
vast operations that demand all the application of genius, I was

Rameau’s Nephew; they do not have his dimensions; it is only in 
the search for the picturesque that they can pass for his epigones.And yet they are a little more than a social profile, a caricatural

touches the unreason of the eighteenth century.Their chatter, 
their anxiety, that vague delirium and that ultimate anguish they 
experience commonly enough—and in real existences which can 
still be traced.
