As with the libertine, the debauchee, or the 
ruffian of the end of the seventeenth century, it is difficult to say 
whether they are mad, sick, or criminal.Mercier himself does 
not quite know what status to give them: “Thus there are in Paris 
some very good people, economists and anti-economists, who

have warm hearts, eager for the public good; but unfortunately 
they have cracked heads', that is, they are shortsighted, they do not 
know what century they are in, nor what men they are dealing 
with; more unbearable than idiots, because with pennies and 
false lights they start from an impossible principle and reason 
falsely therefrom.” They really existed, these schemers with 
“cracked heads,” adding a muffled accompaniment of unreason 
to the reason of the philosophers, and around those plans for 
reform, those constitutions, those projects; the rationality of the 
Enlightenment found in them a sort of darkened mirror, an 
inoffensive caricature.But is it not essential that in a movement 
of amused indulgence, a personage of unreason is allowed back 
into daylight, at the very moment he was believed to be most 
profoundly hidden in the space of confinement?As if classical 
reason once again admitted a proximity, a relation, a quasi¬ 
resemblance between itself and the images of unreason.As if, at 
the moment of its triumph, reason revived and permitted to drift 
on the margins of order a character whose mask it had fashioned 
in derision—a sort of double in which it both recognized and 
revoked itself.
