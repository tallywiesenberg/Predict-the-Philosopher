Yet fear and anxiety were not far off: in the reaction of 
confinement, they reappeared, doubled.People were once afraid, 
people were still afraid, of being confined; at the end of the 
eighteenth century, Sade was still haunted by fear of what he 
called “the black men” who lay in wait to put him away.But now 
the estate of confinement acquired its own powers; it became in 
its turn the birthplace of evil, and could henceforth spread that 
evil by itself, instituting another reign of terror.Suddenly, in a few years in the middle of the eighteenth 
century, a fear arose—a fear formulated in medical terms but 
animated, basically, by a moral myth.People were in dread of a 
mysterious disease that spread, it was said, from the houses of 
confinement and would soon threaten the cities.
