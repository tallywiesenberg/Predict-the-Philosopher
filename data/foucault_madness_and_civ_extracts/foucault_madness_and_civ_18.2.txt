The name of Bicetre is a word 
no one can pronounce without an inexpressible feeling of 
repugnance, of horror and contempt....It has become the 
receptacle for all the most monstrous and vile things to be found 
in society.”4 

The evil which men had attempted to exclude by confinement 
reappeared, to the horror of the public, in a fantastic guise.There 
appeared, ramifying in every direction, the themes of an evil, 
both physical and moral, that enveloped in this very ambiguity 
the mingled powers of corrosion and horror.There prevailed, 
then, a sort of undifferentiated image of “rottenness” that had to 
do with the corruption of morals as well as with the 
decomposition of the flesh, and upon which were based both the 
repugnance and the pity felt for the confined.First the evil began 
to ferment in the closed spaces of confinement.
