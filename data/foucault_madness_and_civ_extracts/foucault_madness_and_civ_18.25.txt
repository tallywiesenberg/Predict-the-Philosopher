particles, sharp as needles, penetrated bodies and hearts as easily 
as if they were passive and friable alkaline particles.The mixture 
boiled immediately, releasing harmful vapors and corrosive 
liquids: “These wards are a dreadful place where all crimes 
together ferment and spread around them, as by fermentation, a 
contagious atmosphere which those who live there breathe and 

which seems to become attached to them.” These burning 
vapors then rise, spread through the air, and finally fall upon the 
neighborhood, impregnating bodies and contaminating souls.Thus the idea of a contagion of evil-as-rottenness is articulated 
in images.The palpable agent of this epidemic is air, that air 
which is called “tainted,” the term obscurely suggesting that it is 
not in conformity with the purity of its nature, and that it acts as 
the communicating element of the taint.It is sufficient to 
remember the value, both moral and medical, ascribed at about 
the same period to country air (bodily health, spiritual vigor), to 
realize the whole complex of contrary meanings conveyed by the 
corrupted air of hospitals, prisons, houses of confinement.
