By 
this atmosphere laden with maleficent vapors, entire cities were 
threatened, whose inhabitants would be slowly impregnated with 
rottenness and taint.And these are not only reflections halfway between morality 
and medicine.We must doubtless take into account an entire 
literary development, a whole emotional, perhaps political 
exploitation of vague fears.But in certain cities there were 
movements of panic as real, as easy to date, as the great crises of 
horror that wracked the Middle Ages from time to time.In 1780 
an epidemic spread through Paris: its origin was attributed to the 
infection of the Hopital General; there was even talk of burning 
the buildings of Bicetre.
