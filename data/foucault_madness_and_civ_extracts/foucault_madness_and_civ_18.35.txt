The police lieutenant, faced with the 
frenzy of the population, sent a commission of inquiry which 
included, together with several staff doctors, the Dean of the 
Faculte and the physician of the Hopital General.According to

their findings, Bicetre was subject to a “putrid fever” which was 
linked to the bad quality of the air.As for the original source of 
the disease, the report denied that it lay in the internees and the 
infection they might spread; it must be attributed quite simply to 
the bad weather that made the disease endemic in the capital; the 
symptoms that were to be observed at the Hopital General were 
“in accordance with the nature of the season and exactly the same 
as the illnesses observed in Paris at the same period.” The 
population had to be reassured and Bicetre cleared of its guilt: 
“The rumors that have begun to spread concerning a contagious 
illness at Bicetre that is capable of infecting the capital are 
without foundation.” Evidently the report did not check the 
rumors completely, since some time later the physician of the 
Hopital General issued another in which he made the same 
statement; he was forced to acknowledge the poor sanitary 
conditions of Bicetre, but “matters have not, for all that, reached 
the cruel extremity of converting the refuge of these unfortunates 
into another source of inevitable evils much more lamentable 
than those which require a remedy as prompt as it is efficacious.” 

The circle was closed: all those forms of unreason which had 
replaced leprosy in the geography of evil, and which had been 
banished into the remotest social distance, now became a visible 
leprosy and offered their running sores to the promiscuity of 
men.Unreason was once more present; but marked now by an 
imaginary stigma of disease, which added its powers of terror.Thus it is in the realm of the fantastic and not within the rigor 
of medical thought that unreason joins illness and draws closer to 
it.
