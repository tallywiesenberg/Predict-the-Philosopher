Long before the problem of discovering to what degree the 
unreasonable is pathological was formulated, there had formed, 
in the space of confinement and by an alchemy peculiar to it, a 
melange combining the dread of unreason and the old specters of 
disease.From a great distance, the old confusions about leprosy 
functioned once again; and it is the vigor of these fantastic 
themes which was the first agent of synthesis between the world

of unreason and the medical universe.They first communicated 
through the hallucinations of fear, combining the infernal 
mixtures of “corruption” and “taint.” It is important, perhaps 
decisive for the place madness was to occupy in modern culture, 
that homo medicus was not called into the world of confinement 
as an arbiter , to divide what was crime from what was madness, 
what was evil from what was illness, but rather as a guardian, to 
protect others from the vague danger that exuded through the 
walls of confinement.It is easy to suppose that a free and 
generous sympathy awakened interest in the fate of the confined, 
and that a more diligent and informed medical attention could 
recognize disease where previously the authorities had 
indiscriminately punished transgressions.As it happened, the 
atmosphere was not one of such benevolent neutrality.
