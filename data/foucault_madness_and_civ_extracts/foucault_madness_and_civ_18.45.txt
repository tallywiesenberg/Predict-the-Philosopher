If a 
doctor was summoned, if he was asked to observe, it was because 
people were afraid—afraid of the strange chemistry that seethed 
behind the walls of confinement, afraid of the powers forming 
there that threatened to propagate.The doctor came, once the 
conversion of images was effected, the disease having already 
assumed the ambiguous aspects of fermentation, of corruption, 
of tainted exhalations, of decomposed flesh.What is traditionally 
called “progress” toward madness’s attaining a medical status was 
in fact made possible only by a strange regression.In the 
inextricable mixture of moral and physical contagions,6 and by 
virtue of that symbolism of Impurity so familiar to the 
eighteenth century, very early images rose again to the surface of 
human memory.And it was as a result of this reactivation of 
images, more than by an improvement of knowledge, that 
unreason was eventually confronted by medical thought.
