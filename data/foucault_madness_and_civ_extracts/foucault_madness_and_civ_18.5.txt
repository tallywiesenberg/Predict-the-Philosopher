THE GREAT 
CONFINEMENT 


Compelle intrare. 

BY a strange act of force, the classical age was to reduce to 
silence the madness whose voices the Renaissance had just 
liberated, but whose violence it had already tamed. 

It is common knowledge that the seventeenth century created 
enormous houses of confinement; it is less commonly known 
that more than one out of every hundred inhabitants of the city 
of Paris found themselves confined there, within several months. 
It is common knowledge that absolute power made use of lettres 
de cachet and arbitrary measures of imprisonment; what is less 
familiar is the judicial conscience that could inspire such 
practices. Since Pinel, Tuke, Wagnitz, we know that madmen 
were subjected to the regime of this confinement for a century 
and a half, and that they would one day be discovered in the 
wards of the Hopital General, in the cells of prisons; they would 
be found mingled with the population of the workhouses or 
Zuchthausern. But it has rarely been made clear what their status 
was there, what the meaning was of this proximity which seemed 
to assign the same homeland to the poor, to the unemployed, to 
prisoners, and to the insane. It is within the walls of confinement 
that Pinel and nineteenth-century psychiatry would come upon 
madmen; it is there—let us remember—that they would leave 
them, not without boasting of having “delivered” them. From 
the middle of the seventeenth century, madness was linked with
