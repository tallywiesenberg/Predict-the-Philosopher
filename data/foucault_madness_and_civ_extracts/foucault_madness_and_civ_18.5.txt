Paradoxically, in the return to that fantastic life which mingles 
with the contemporary images of illness, positivism would gain a

The question, for the moment, was not to suppress the houses 
of confinement, but to neutralize them as potential causes of a 
new evil.The problem was to organize them while purifying 
them.The great reform movement that developed in the second 
half of the eighteenth century originated in the effort to reduce 
contamination by destroying impurities and vapors, abating 
fermentations, preventing evil and disease from tainting the air 
and spreading their contagion in the atmosphere of the cities.The hospital, the house of correction, all the places of 
confinement, were to be more completely isolated, surrounded 
by a purer air: this period produced a whole literature concerning 
the airing of hospitals, which tentatively approaches the medical 
problem of contagion, but aims more specifically at themes of 
moral communication.
