In 1776 a decree of the Council of State 
appointed a commission to determine “the degree of 
amelioration of which the various hospitals in France are in 
need.” Viel was instructed to rebuild the wards of La Salpetriere.The ideal was an asylum which, while preserving its essential 
functions, would be so organized that the evil could vegetate 
there without ever spreading; an asylum where unreason would 
be entirely contained and offered as a spectacle, without 
threatening the spectators; where it would have all the powers of 
example and none of the risks of contagion.In short, an asylum 
restored to its truth as a cage.It is this “sterilized” confinement, 
if we may employ an anachronistic term, that was still, in 1789, 
the dream of the Abbe Desmonceaux, in a little work dedicated 
to National Benevolence ; he planned to create a pedagogical 
instrument—a spectacle conclusively proving the drawbacks of 
immorality: “these guarded asylums ... are retreats as useful as 
they are necessary....The sight of these shadowy places and the 
guilty creatures they contain is well calculated to preserve from 
the same acts of just reprobation the deviations of a too 
licentious youth; it is thus prudent of mothers and fathers to 
familiarize their children at an early age with these horrible and

detestable places, where shame and turpitude fetter crime, where 
man, corrupted in his essence, often loses forever the rights he 
had acquired in society.” 

Such are the dreams by which morality, in complicity with 
medicine, tried to defend itself against the dangers contained but 
insufficiently restricted by confinement.
