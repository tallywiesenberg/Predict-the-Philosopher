These same dangers, at 
the same time, fascinated men's imaginations and their desires.Morality dreams of exorcising them, but there is something in 
man which makes him dream of experiencing them, or at least of 
approaching them and releasing their hallucinations.The horror 
that now surrounded the fortresses of confinement also exercised 
an irresistible attraction.Such nights were peopled with 
inaccessible pleasures; such corrupt and ravaged faces became 
masks of voluptuousness; against these dark landscapes appeared 
forms—pains and delights—which echoed Hieronymus Bosch 
and his delirious gardens.The secrets that escaped from the 
chateau in the One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom have been 
murmured ever since: “There, the most infamous excesses are 
committed upon the very person of the prisoner; we hear of 
certain vices practiced frequently, notoriously, and even publicly 
in the common room of the prison, vices which the propriety of 
modern times does not permit us to name.
