What the classical period had confined was not only an 
abstract unreason which mingled madmen and libertines, 
invalids, and criminals, but also an enormous reservoir of the 
fantastic, a dormant world of monsters supposedly engulfed in 
the darkness of Hieronymus Bosch which had once spewed them 
forth.One might say that the fortresses of confinement added to 
their social role of segregation and purification a quite opposite 
cultural function.Even as they separated reason from unreason 
on societyâ€™s surface, they preserved in depth the images where 
they mingled and exchanged properties.The fortresses of 
confinement functioned as a great, long silent memory; they 
maintained in the shadows an iconographic power that men 
might have thought was exorcised; created by the new classical 
order, they preserved, against it and against time, forbidden 
figures that could thus be transmitted intact from the sixteenth 
to the nineteenth century.In this abolished time, the Brocken 
joined Dulle Griet in the same imaginary landscape, and 
Noirceuil, the great legend of the Marechal de Rais.
