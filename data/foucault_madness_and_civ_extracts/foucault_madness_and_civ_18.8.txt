Sadism appears at the very 
moment that unreason, confined for over a century and reduced 
to silence, reappears, no longer as an image of the world, no 
longer as a figura , but as language and desire.And it is no 
accident that sadism, as an individual phenomenon bearing the 
name of a man, was born of confinement and, within 
confinement, that Sade’s entire oeuvre is dominated by the 
images of the Fortress, the Cell, the Cellar, the Convent, the 
inaccessible Island which thus form, as it were, the natural 
habitat of unreason.It is no accident, either, that all the fantastic 
literature of madness and horror, which is contemporary with 
Sade’s oeuvre , takes place, preferentially, in the strongholds of 
confinement.And this whole sudden conversion of Western 
memory at the end of the eighteenth century, with its possibility 
of rediscovering—deformed and endowed with a new meaning— 
figures familiar at the end of the Middle Ages: was this 
conversion not authorized by the survival and the reawakening of 
the fantastic in the very places where unreason had been reduced

awareness of unreason had not separated from one another.
