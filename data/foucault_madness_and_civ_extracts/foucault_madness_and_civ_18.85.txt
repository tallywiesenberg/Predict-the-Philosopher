The 
experience of unreason that had guided all the practices of 
confinement so enveloped the awareness of madness that it very 
nearly permitted it to disappear, sweeping it along a road of 
regression where it was close to losing its most specific elements.But in the anxiety of the second half of the eighteenth century, 
the fear of madness grew at the same time as the dread of 
unreason: and thereby the two forms of obsession, leaning upon 
each other, continued to reinforce each other.And at the very 
moment we note the liberation of the iconographic powers that 
accompany unreason, we hear on all sides complaints about the 
ravages of madness.Already we are familiar with the concern 
generated by “nervous diseases,” and the awareness that man 
becomes more delicate in proportion as he perfects himself.As 
the century advanced, the concern became more pressing, the 
warnings more solemn.
