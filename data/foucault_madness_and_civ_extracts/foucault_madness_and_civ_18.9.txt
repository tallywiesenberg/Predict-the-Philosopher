Already Raulin had observed that “since 
the birth of medicine ... these illnesses have multiplied, have 
become more dangerous, more complicated, more problematical 
and difficult to cure.” By Tissof s time, this general impression 
became a firm belief, a sort of medical dogma: nervous diseases 
“were formerly much less frequent than they are nowadays; and 
this for two reasons: one, that men were in general more robust, 
and less frequently ill; there were fewer diseases of any kind; the 
other, that the causes which produce nervous diseases in especial 
have multiplied in a greater proportion, in recent times, than the 
other general causes of illness, some of which even seem to have 
diminished....I do not hesitate to say that if they were once the 
rarest, they are today the most frequent.’”’ And soon men 
regained that awareness, which had been so intense in the 
sixteenth century, of the precariousness of a reason that can at 
any moment be compromised, and definitively, by madness.222 


Matthey, a Geneva physician very close to Rousseau’s influence, 
formulates the prospect for all men of reason: “Do not glory in 
your state, if you are wise and civilized men; an instant suffices to 
disturb and annihilate that supposed wisdom of which you are so 
proud; an unexpected event, a sharp and sudden emotion of the 
soul will abruptly change the most reasonable and intelligent 
man into a raving idiot.” The threat of madness resumes its place 
among the emergencies of the century.This awareness, however, has a very special style.The 
obsession with unreason is a very affective one, involved in the 
movement of iconographic resurrections.
