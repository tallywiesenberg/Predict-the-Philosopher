The fear of madness is 
much freer with regard to this heritage; and while the return of 
unreason has the aspect of a massive repetition, connecting with 
itself outside of time, the awareness of madness is on the 
contrary accompanied by a certain analysis of modernity, which 
situates it from the start in a temporal, historical, and social 
context.In the disparity between the awareness of unreason and 
the awareness of madness, we have, at the end of the eighteenth 
century, the point of departure for a decisive movement: that by 
which the experience of unreason will continue, with Holderlin, 
Nerval, and Nietzsche, to proceed ever deeper toward the roots 
of time—unreason thus becoming, par excellence , the world’s 
contratempo —and the knowledge of madness seeking on the 
contrary to situate it ever more precisely within the development 
of nature and history.It is after this period that the time of 
unreason and the time of madness receive two opposing vectors: 
one being unconditioned return and absolute submersion; the 
other, on the contrary, developing according to the chronicle of a 
history.9
