For a long time, certain forms of 
melancholia were considered specifically English; this was a fact 
in medicine and a constant in literature.Montesquieu contrasted 
Roman suicide, which was a form of moral and political

behavior, the desired effect of a concerted education, with 
English suicide, which had to be considered as an illness since 
“the English kill themselves without any apparent reason for 
doing so; they kill themselves in the very lap of happiness.” It is 
here that the milieu plays its role, for if happiness in the 
eighteenth century is part of the order of nature and reason, 
unhappiness, or at least whatever deters from happiness without 
reason, must be part of another order.This order was sought first 
in the excesses of the climate, in nature’s deviation from its 
equilibrium and its happy mean (temperate climates are caused 
by nature; intemperate climates by the milieu).But this was not 
sufficient to explain la maladie anglaise ; already Cheyne had 
declared that wealth, refined food, the abundance all the 
inhabitants enjoyed, the life of pleasure and ease the richest 
society led, were at the origin of such nervous disorders.Increasingly, a political and economic explanation was sought, in 
which wealth, progress, institutions appear as the determining 
element of madness.
