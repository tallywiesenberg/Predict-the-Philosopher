In 1781 a German 
author described as happy those distant eras when priests were 
endowed with absolute powers: then idleness did not exist, every 
moment was marked by “ceremonies, religious practices, 
pilgrimages, visits to the poor and the sick, calendar festivals.”!1 
Time was thus assigned to an organized happiness, which left no 
leisure for empty passions, for disgust with life, for boredom.If a 
man felt guilty, he was subjected to real, often material 
punishment which occupied his mind and gave him an assurance 
that the transgression was redressed.And when the confessor 
encountered those “hypochondriacal penitents who came too 
often to confession,” he assigned them as penance either a severe 
hardship that “diluted their too thick blood,” or long pilgrimages: 
“The change of air, the length of the road, absence from home, 
distance from the things which upset them, their associations 
with other pilgrims, the slow and energetic movement of 
walking, had more effect upon them than the comfortable 
journeys ... that in our day take the place of pilgrimages.” 
Finally, the sacred nature of the priest gave each of his 
injunctions an absolute value, and no one dreamed of trying to 
avoid it; “usually the whims of sick people deny all this to the 
physician.” For Moehsen, religion is the mediation between man 
and transgression, between man and punishment: in the form of 
an authoritarian synthesis, it suppresses the transgression by 
imposing the punishment; if, on the contrary, religion loosens its 
hold but maintains the ideal forms of remorse of conscience, of 
spiritual mortification, it leads directly to madness; only the 
consistency of the religious milieu can permit man to escape 
alienation in the excessive delirium of transgressions.By 
accomplishing its rites and its requirements, man avoids both the 
useless idleness of his passions before the transgression, and the 
vain repetition of his remorse once the transgression is

committed; religion organizes all human life around fulfillment 
of the moment.
