If the progress of knowledge dissipates error, it also has 
the effect of propagating a taste and even a mania for study; the 
life of the library, abstract speculations, the perpetual agitation of 
the mind without the exercise of the body, can have the most 
disastrous effects.Tissot explains that in the human body it is 
those parts subject to frequent work which are first strengthened 
and hardened; among laborers, the muscles and fibers of the 
arms harden, giving them their physical strength and the good 
health they enjoy until an advanced age; “among men of letters, 
the brain hardens; often they become incapable of connecting 
their ideas,” and so are doomed to dementia.The more abstract 
or complex knowledge becomes, the greater the risk of madness.A body of knowledge still close to what is most immediate in the 
senses, requiring, according to Pressavin, only a little work on 
the part of the inner sense and organs of the brain, provokes only 
a sort of physiological happiness: “The sciences whose objects are 
easily perceived by our senses, which offer the soul agreeable 
relations because of the harmony of their consonance ... perform 
throughout the entire bodily machine a light activity which is 
beneficial to all the functions.” On the contrary, a knowledge too 
poor in these sensuous relations, too free with regard to the 
immediate, provokes a tension of the brain alone which 
disequilibrates the whole body; sciences “of things whose 
relationships are difficult to grasp because they are not readily

available to our senses, or because their too complicated relations 
oblige us to expend great application in their study, present the 
soul with an exercise that greatly fatigues the inner sense by a too 
continuous tension upon that organ.” Knowledge thus forms 
around feeling a milieu of abstract relationships where man risks 
losing the physical happiness in which his relation to the world is 
usually established.Knowledge multiplies, no doubt, but its cost 
increases too.
