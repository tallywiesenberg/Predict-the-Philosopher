Is it certain that there are more wise men today?One thing, at least, is certain: “there are more people who have 
the infirmities of wisdom.” The milieu of knowledge grows faster 
than knowledge itself.But it is not only knowledge that detaches man from feeling; it 
is sensibility itself: a sensibility that is no longer controlled by the 
movements of nature, but by all the habits, all the demands of 
social life.Modern man—but woman more than man—turns day 
into night and night into day: “The moment at which our 
women rise in Paris is far removed from that which nature has 
indicated; the best hours of the day have slipped away; the purest 
air has disappeared; no one has benefited from it.The vapors, 
the harmful exhalations, attracted by the sun’s heat, are already 
rising in the atmosphere; this is the hour that beauty chooses to 
rise.’ ”12 This disorder of the senses continues in the theater, 
where illusions are cultivated, where vain passions and the most 
fatal movements of the soul are aroused by artifice; women 
especially enjoy these spectacles “that inflame and arouse them”; 
their souls “are so strongly shaken that this produces a 
commotion in their nerves, fleeting, in truth, but whose 
consequences are usually serious; the momentary loss of their 
senses, the tears they shed at the performances of our modern 
tragedies are the least accidents that can result from them.”13 
Novels form a still more artificial milieu, and are more dangerous 
to a disordered sensibility; the verisimilitude modern authors 
attempt to produce, and all the art they employ to imitate truth,

only give more prestige to the violent and dangerous sentiments 
they seek to awaken in their female readers: “In the earliest 
epochs of French gallantry and manners, the less perfected minds 
of women were content with facts and events as marvelous as 
they were unbelievable; now they demand believable facts yet 
sentiments so marvelous that their own minds are disturbed and 
confounded by them; they then seek, in all that surrounds them, 
to realize the marvels by which they are enchanted; but 
everything seems to them without sentiment and without life, 
because they are trying to find what does not exist in nature.” 14 
The novel constitutes the milieu of perversion, par excellence, of 
all sensibility; it detaches the soul from all that is immediate and 
natural in feeling and leads it into an imaginary world of 
sentiments violent in proportion to their unreality, and less 
controlled by the gentle laws of nature; “The existence of so 
many authors has produced a host of readers, and continued 
reading generates every nervous complaint; perhaps of all the 
causes that have harmed women’s health, the principal one has 
been the infinite multiplication of novels in the last hundred 
years ... a girl who at ten reads instead of running will, at twenty, 
be a woman with the vapors and not a good nurse.
