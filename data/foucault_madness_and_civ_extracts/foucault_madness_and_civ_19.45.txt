Slowly, and still in a very scattered fashion, the eighteenth 
century constituted, around its awareness of madness and of its 
threatening spread, a whole new order of concepts.In the 
landscape of unreason where the sixteenth century had located it, 
madness concealed a meaning and an origin that were obscurely 
moral; its secrecy related it to sin, and the animality imminently 
perceived in it did not make it, paradoxically, more innocent.In 
the second half of the eighteenth century, madness was no longer 
recognized in what brings man closer to an immemorial fall or an 
indefinitely present animality; it was, on the contrary, situated in 
those distances man takes in regard to himself, to his world, to 
all that is offered by the immediacy of nature; madness became

possible in that milieu where mans relations with his feelings, 
with time, with others, are altered; madness was possible because 
of everything which, in mans life and development, is a break 
with the immediate.Madness was no longer of the order of 
nature or of the Fall, but of a new order, in which men began to 
have a presentiment of history, and where there formed, in an 
obscure originating relationship, the “alienation” of the 
physicians and the “alienation” of the philosophers—two 
configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth, but 
between which the nineteenth century, after Hegel, soon lost all 
trace of resemblance.231

THE NEW DIVISION 


EVERY psychiatrist, every historian yielded, at the beginning of 
the nineteenth century, to the same impulse of indignation; 
everywhere we find the same outrage, the same virtuous censure: 
“No one blushed to put the insane in prison/’ And Esquirol, 
listing the fortress of Ha in Bordeaux, the houses of correction in 
Toulouse and Rennes, the “Bicetres” still existing in Poitiers, in 
Caen, in Amiens, the “Chateau” of Angers, continues: 
“Moreover, there are few prisons where the raving mad are not to 
be found; these unfortunates are chained in dungeons beside 
criminals.
