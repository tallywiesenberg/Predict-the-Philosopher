Twenty-five years before the exclamations of a Pinel, we 
must invoke Malesherbes “visiting the State prisons with the 
intention of breaking down their gates.Prisoners whom he 
found to be insane ... were sent to houses where the society, the 
exercise, and the care he had scrupulously prescribed would be 
sure, he said, to cure them.” Still earlier in the century, and in a 
lower voice, there had been all those directors, those bursars, 
those overseers who from generation to generation always asked 
and sometimes achieved the same thing: the separation of 
madmen from convicts; there had been the Prior of La Charite 
in Senlis who begged the police to remove several prisoners and 
confine them instead in any of several fortresses; there had been 
that overseer of the House of Correction in Brunswick who 
asked—and this was only in 1713—that the madmen not be 
allowed to mingle with the internees assigned to the workshops.Had not what the nineteenth century formulated so 
ostentatiously, with all the resources of its pathos, already been 
whispered and indefatigably repeated by the eighteenth?Did 
Esquirol and Reil and the Tukes do anything more than shout at 
the top of their lungs what had been, for years, commonplaces of 
asylum practice?The slow emigration of the mad which we have 
mentioned, from 1720 to the Revolution, was probably no more 
than the most visible effect of that practice.
