And yet, let us listen to what was being said in this half¬ 
silence.When the Prior of Senlis asked that madmen be 
separated from certain convicts, what were his arguments?“He is 
deserving of mercy, as well as two or three others who would be 
better off in some citadel, because of the company of six others 
who are mad, and who torment them night and day.” And the 
meaning of this sentence would be so clearly understood by the 
police that the internees in question would be set free.And the 
demands of the Brunswick overseer have the same meaning: the

workshop is disturbed by the cries and the confusion of the 
insane; their frenzy is a perpetual danger, and it would be better 
to send them back to the cells, or to keep them in chains.And 
already, we can anticipate that from one century to the next, the 
same protests did not have, at bottom, the same value.
