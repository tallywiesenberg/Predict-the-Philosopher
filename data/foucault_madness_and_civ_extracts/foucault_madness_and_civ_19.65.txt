Early in 
the nineteenth century, there was indignation that the mad were 
not treated any better than those condemned by common law or 
than State prisoners; throughout the eighteenth century, 
emphasis was placed on the fact that the prisoners deserved a 
better fate than one that lumped them with the insane.For 
Esquirol, the scandal is due to the fact that the mad are only 
mad; for the Prior of Senlis, to the fact that the convicts are, after 
all, only convicts.A difference which is perhaps not of such significance, and 
which ought to have been easily perceived.And yet, it is 
necessary to emphasize it in order to understand how the 
consciousness of madness was transformed in the course of the 
eighteenth century.It did not evolve in the context of a 
humanitarian movement that gradually related it more closely to 
the madman s human reality, to his most affecting and most 
intimate aspect; nor did it evolve under the pressure of a 
scientific need that made it more attentive, more faithful to what 
madness might have to say for itself.
