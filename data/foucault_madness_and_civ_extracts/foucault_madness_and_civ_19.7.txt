If it slowly changed, it was 
within that simultaneously real and artificial space of 
confinement.Certain imperceptible shifts in its structures, or at 
times certain violent crises, gradually formed the awareness of 
madness contemporaneous with the Revolution.No medical 
advance, no humanitarian approach was responsible for the fact 
that the mad were gradually isolated, that the monotony of 
insanity was divided into rudimentary types.It was the depths of 
confinement itself that generated the phenomenon; it is from 
confinement that we must seek an account of this new awareness 
of madness.A political more than a philanthropic awareness.
