For if the

eighteenth century perceived that there were among the confined 
—among the libertines, the debauched, the prodigal sons— 
certain men whose confusion and disorder were of another 
nature, and whose anxiety was irreducible, this perception was 
the result of the confined themselves.They were the first to 
protest, and with the most violence.Ministers, police officers, 
magistrates were assailed with the same endless and tirelessly 
repeated complaints: one man writes to Maurepas, indignant at 
being “forced to mingle with madmen, some of whom are so 
violent that at every moment I risk suffering dangerous abuse 
from them”; another—the Abbe de Montcrif—makes the same 
complaint to Lieutenant Berryer: “This is the ninth month that I 
have been confined here in this dreadful place with fifteen or 
twenty raving madmen, pell-mell with epileptics.” The farther 
we advance into the century, the stronger grow these protests 
against confinement: increasingly, madness becomes the specter 
of the internees, the very image of their humiliation, of their 
reason vanquished and reduced to silence.The day soon comes 
when Mirabeau recognizes in the shameful promiscuity of 
madness both a subtle instrument of brutality against those to be 
punished and the very image of despotism, bestiality triumphant.The madman is not the first and the most innocent victim of 
confinement, but the most obscure and the most visible, the 
most insistent of the symbols of the confining power.
