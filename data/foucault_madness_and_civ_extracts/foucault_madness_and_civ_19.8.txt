Tyranny 
secretly persists among the confined in this lurid presence of 
unreason.The struggle against the established powers, against 
the family, against the Church, continues at the very heart of 
confinement, in the saturnalia of reason.And madness so well 
represents these punishing powers that it effectively plays the 
part of an additional punishment, a further torment which 
maintains order in the uniform chastisement of the houses of 
correction.La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt bears witness to this in 
his report to the Committee on Mendicity: “One of the 
punishments inflicted upon the epileptics and upon the other

patients of the wards, even upon the deserving poor, is to place 
them among the mad.” The scandal lies only in the fact that the 
madmen are the brutal truth of confinement, the passive 
instrument of all that is worst about it.Is this not symbolized by 
the fact—also a commonplace of all the literature of confinement 
in the eighteenth century—that a sojourn in a house of 
correction necessarily leads to madness?
