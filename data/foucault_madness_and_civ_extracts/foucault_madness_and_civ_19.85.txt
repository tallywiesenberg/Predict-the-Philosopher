Having to live in this 
delirious world, amid the triumph of unreason, how may one 
avoid joining, by the fatality of the site and the event, the very 
men who are its living symbol?“I observe that the majority of the 
insane confined in the houses of correction and the State prisons 
have become so, the latter through the excess of ill-treatment, 
the former through the horror of the solitude in which they 
continually encounter the harassments of an imagination 
sharpened by pain.”l 

The presence of madmen among the prisoners is not the 
scandalous limit of confinement, but its truth; not abuse, but 
essence.The polemic instituted by the eighteenth century against 
confinement certainly dealt with the enforced mingling of the 
mad and the sane; but it did not deal with the basic relation 
acknowledged between madness and confinement.Whatever 
attitude is adopted, that, at least, is not in question.Mirabeau, 
the Friend of Man, is as severe about confinement as about the 
confined themselves; in his eyes, no one confined in “the 
celebrated State prisons” is innocent; but his place is not in these 
costly institutions, where he drags out a useless life; why confine 
“daughters of joy who, transported to provincial manufactories, 
could become daughters of labor”?
