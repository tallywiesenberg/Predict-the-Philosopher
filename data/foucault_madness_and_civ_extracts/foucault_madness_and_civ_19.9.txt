Or “rascals who are waiting 
only for freedom in order to get themselves hanged?Why are 
these people, attached to walking fetters, not employed at those 
tasks which might prove harmful to voluntary workers?They 
would serve as an example ...” Once this entire population was 
removed, who would remain in the houses of confinement?237 


Those who could not be placed anywhere else, and who belong 
there by right: “Some prisoners of State whose crimes must not 
be revealed,” to whom may be added “old men who, having 
consumed in debauchery and dissipation all the fruit of their 
life’s labor, and having cherished the ambitious prospect of dying 
in a hospital, come there in peace”; finally, the mad, who must 
wallow somewhere: “These last can vegetate anywhere.”2 
Mirabeau the younger conducts his demonstration in the 
opposite direction: “I formally defy anyone in the world to prove 
that State prisoners, rascals, libertines, madmen, ruined old men 
constitute I do not say the majority, but the third, the fourth, the 
tenth part of the inhabitants of fortresses, houses of correction, 
and State prisons.” For him the scandal is thus not that the mad 
are mingled with the criminal, but that they do not constitute, 
together, the essential part of the confined population; who then 
can complain of being forced to mix with criminals?
