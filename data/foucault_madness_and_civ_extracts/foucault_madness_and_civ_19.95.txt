Not those 
who have lost their reason forever, but those who in their youth 
spent their time in wildness: “I might ask ... why rascals and 
libertines are mingled together....I could ask why young men 
with dangerous dispositions are left with men who will rapidly 
lead them to the last degree of corruption....Finally, if this 
confusion of libertines and villains exists, as is all too true, why 
do we, by this odious, infamous, atrocious combination, make 
ourselves guilty of the most abominable of all crimes, that of 
leading men into crime?” As for madmen, what other fate could 
be desired for them?Neither reasonable enough not to be 
confined, nor wise enough not to be treated as wicked, “it is all 
too true that those who have lost the use of reason must be 

hidden from society.”^ 

We see how the political critique of confinement functioned 
in the eighteenth century.Not in the direction of a liberation of 
the mad; nor can we say that it permitted a more philanthropic 
or a greater medical attention to the insane.
