Up to the second half of the fifteenth century, or even a little 
beyond, the theme of death reigns alone.The end of man, the 
end of time bear the face of pestilence and war.What overhangs 
human existence is this conclusion and this order from which 
nothing escapes.The presence that threatens even within this 
world is a fleshless one.Then in the last years of the century this 
enormous uneasiness turns on itself; the mockery of madness 
replaces death and its solemnity.
