From the discovery of that

necessity which inevitably reduces man to nothing, we have 
shifted to the scornful contemplation of that nothing which is 
existence itself Fear in the face of the absolute limit of death 
turns inward in a continuous irony; man disarms it in advance, 
making it an object of derision by giving it an everyday, tamed 
form, by constantly renewing it in the spectacle of life, by 
scattering it throughout the vices, the difficulties, and the 
absurdities of all men.Deathâ€™s annihilation is no longer anything 
because it was already everything, because life itself was only 
futility, vain words, a squabble of cap and bells.The head that 
will become a skull is already empty.Madness is the deja-la of 
death.4 But it is also its vanquished presence, evaded in those 
everyday signs which, announcing that death reigns already, 
indicate that its prey will be a sorry prize indeed.
