What death 
unmasks was never more than a mask; to discover the grin of the 
skeleton, one need only lift off something that was neither 
beauty nor truth, but only a plaster and tinsel face.From the vain 
mask to the corpse, the same smile persists.But when the 
madman laughs, he already laughs with the laugh of death; the 
lunatic, anticipating the macabre, has disarmed it.The cries of 
Dulle Griet triumph, in the high Renaissance, over that Triumph 
of Death sung at the end of the Middle Ages on the walls of the 
Campo Santo.The substitution of the theme of madness for that of death 
does not mark a break, but rather a torsion within the same 
anxiety.
