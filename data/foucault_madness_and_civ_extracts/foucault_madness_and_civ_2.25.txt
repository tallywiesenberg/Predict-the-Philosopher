The elements are now reversed.It is no longer the end of time 
and of the world which will show retrospectively that men were 
mad not to have been prepared for them; it is the tide of 
madness, its secret invasion, that shows that the world is near its 
final catastrophe; it is man s insanity that invokes and makes 
necessary the world’s end.In its various forms—plastic or literary—this experience of 
madness seems extremely coherent.Painting and text constantly 
refer to one another—commentary here and illustration there.We find the same theme of the Narrentanz over and over in 
popular festivals, in theatrical performances, in engravings and 
woodcuts, and the entire last part of the Praise of Folly is 
constructed on the model of a long dance of madmen in which 
each profession and each estate parades in turn to form the great 
round of unreason.
