One book bears witness to meaning s proliferation at 
the end of the Gothic world, the Speculum humanae Salvationist 
which, beyond all the correspondences established by the 
patristic tradition, elaborates, between the Old and the New 
Testament, a symbolism not on the order of Prophecy, but 
deriving from an equivalence of imagery.The Passion of Christ 
is not prefigured only by the sacrifice of Abraham; it is 
surrounded by all the glories of torture and its innumerable 
dreams; Tubal the blacksmith and Isaiahâ€™s wheel take their places 
around the Cross, forming beyond all the lessons of the sacrifice 
the fantastic tableau of savagery, of tormented bodies, and of 
suffering.Thus the image is burdened with supplementary 
meanings, and forced to express them.And dreams, madness, 
the unreasonable can also slip into this excess of meaning.The 
symbolic figures easily become nightmare silhouettes.
