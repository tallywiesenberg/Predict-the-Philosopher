Witness 
that old image of wisdom so often translated, in German 
engravings, by a long-necked bird whose thoughts, rising slowly 
from heart to head, have time to be weighed and reflected on; a 
symbol whose values are blunted by being overemphasized: the 
long path of reflection becomes in the image the alembic of a 
subtle learning, an instrument which distills quintessences.The 
neck of the Gutemensch is endlessly elongated, the better to 
illustrate, beyond wisdom, all the real mediations of knowledge; 
and the symbolic man becomes a fantastic bird whose 
disproportionate neck folds a thousand times upon itselfâ€”an 
insane being, halfway between animal and thing, closer to the 
charms of an image than to the rigor of a meaning.This 
symbolic wisdom is a prisoner of the madness of dreams.30 



A fundamental conversion of the world of images: the 
constraint of a multiplied meaning liberates that world from the 
control of form.So many diverse meanings are established 
beneath the surface of the image that it presents only an 
enigmatic face.
