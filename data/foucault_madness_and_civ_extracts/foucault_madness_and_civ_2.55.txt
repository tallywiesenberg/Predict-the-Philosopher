And its power is no longer to teach but to 
fascinate.Characteristic is the evolution of the famous gryllos 
already familiar to the Middle Ages in the English psalters, and 
at Chartres and Bourges.It taught, then, how the soul of 
desiring man had become a prisoner of the beast; these grotesque 
faces set in the bellies of monsters belonged to the world of the 
great Platonic metaphor and denounced the spirit’s corruption in 
the folly of sin.But in the fifteenth century the gryllos, image of 
human madness, becomes one of the preferred figures in the 
countless Temptations.What assails the hermit’s tranquillity is 
not objects of desire, but these hermetic, demented forms which 
have risen from a dream, and remain silent and furtive on the 
surface of a world.
