In the Lisbon Temptation , facing Saint 
Anthony sits one of these figures born of madness, of its 
solitude, of its penitence, of its privations; a wan smile lights this 
bodiless face, the pure presence of anxiety in the form of an agile 
grimace.Now it is exactly this nightmare silhouette that is at 
once the subject and object of the temptation; it is this figure 
which fascinates the gaze of the ascetic—both are prisoners of a 
kind of mirror interrogation, which remains unanswered in a 
silence inhabited only by the monstrous swarm that surrounds 
them.The gryllos no longer recalls man, by its satiric form, to 
his spiritual vocation forgotten in the folly of desire.It is 
madness become Temptation; all it embodies of the impossible, 
the fantastic, the inhuman, all that suggests the unnatural, the 
writhing of an insane presence on the earth’s surface-all this is 
precisely what gives the gryllos its strange power.The freedom, 
however frightening, of his dreams, the hallucinations of his 
madness, have more power of attraction for fifteenth-century 
man than the desirable reality of the flesh.
