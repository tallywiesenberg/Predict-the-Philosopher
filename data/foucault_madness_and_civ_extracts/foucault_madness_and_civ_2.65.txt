What then is this fascination which now operates through the 
images of madness?First, man finds in these fantastic figures one of the secrets 
and one of the vocations of his nature.In the thought of the 
Middle Ages, the legions of animals, named once and for all by 
Adam, symbolically bear the values of humanity.But at the 
beginning of the Renaissance, the relations with animality are 
reversed; the beast is set free; it escapes the world of legend and 
moral illustration to acquire a fantastic nature of its own.And by 
an astonishing reversal, it is now the animal that will stalk man, 
capture him, and reveal him to his own truth.
