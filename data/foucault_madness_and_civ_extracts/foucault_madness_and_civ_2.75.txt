While the man of reason and wisdom perceives only fragmentary 
and all the more unnerving images of it, the Fool bears it intact 
as an unbroken sphere: that crystal ball which for all others is 
empty is in his eyes filled with the density of an invisible 
knowledge.Brueghel mocks the sick man who tries to penetrate 
this crystal sphere, but it is this iridescent bubble of knowledge— 
an absurd but infinitely precious lantern—that sways at the end 
of the stick Dulle Griet bears on her shoulder.And it is this 
sphere which figures on the reverse of the Garden of Delights.Another symbol of knowledge, the tree (the forbidden tree, the 
tree of promised immortality and of sin), once planted in the 
heart of the earthly paradise, has been uprooted and now forms 
the mast of the Ship of Fools, as seen in the engraving that 
illustrates Josse Bade’s Stultiferae naviculae ; it is this tree, without 
a doubt, that sways over Bosch’s Ship of Fools.What does it presage, this wisdom of fools?
