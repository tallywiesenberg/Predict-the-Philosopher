This is the great witches’ Sabbath of nature: mountains melt and 
become plains, the earth vomits up the dead and bones tumble 
out of tombs; the stars fall, the earth catches fire, all life withers 
and comes to death.The end has no value as passage and 
promise; it is the advent of a night in which the world’s old 
reason is engulfed.It is enough to look at Diirer’s Horsemen of 
the Apocalypse, sent by God Himself: these are no angels of 
triumph and reconciliation; these are no heralds of serene justice, 
but the disheveled warriors of a mad vengeance.The world sinks 
into universal Fury.Victory is neither God’s nor the Devil’s: it 
belongs to Madness.
