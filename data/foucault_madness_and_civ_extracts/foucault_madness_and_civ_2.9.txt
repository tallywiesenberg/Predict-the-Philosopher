On all sides, madness fascinates man.The fantastic images it 
generates are not fleeting appearances that quickly disappear 
from the surface of things.By a strange paradox, what is born 
from the strangest delirium was already hidden, like a secret, like 
an inaccessible truth, in the bowels of the earth.When man 
deploys the arbitrary nature of his madness, he confronts the 
dark necessity of the world; the animal that haunts his 
nightmares and his nights of privation is his own nature, which 
will lay bare hell’s pitiless truth; the vain images of blind idiocy— 
such are the world’s Magna Sciential and already, in this disorder, 
in this mad universe, is prefigured what will be the cruelty of the 
finale.In such images—and this is doubtless what gives them 
their weight, what imposes such great coherence on their fantasy 
—the Renaissance has expressed what it apprehended of the 
threats and secrets of the world.
