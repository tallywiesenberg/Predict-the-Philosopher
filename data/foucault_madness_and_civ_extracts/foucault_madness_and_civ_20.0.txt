This structure proper to the monarchical and bourgeois order 
of France, contemporary with its organization in absolutist 
forms, soon extended its network over the whole of France. An 
edict of the King, dated June 16, 1676, prescribed the 
establishment of an “hopital general in each city of his kingdom.” 
Occasionally the measure had been anticipated by the local 
authorities; the bourgeoisie of Fyons had already organized in 
1612 a charity establishment that functioned in an analogous 
manner. The Archbishop of Tours was proud to declare on July 
10, 1676, that his “archepiscopal city has happily foreseen the 
pious intentions of the King and erected an hopital general called 
Fa Charite even before the one in Paris, whose order has served 
as a model for all those subsequently established, within or 
outside the kingdom.” The Charite of Tours, in fact, had been 
founded in 1656, and the King had endowed it with an income 
of four thousand livres. Over the entire face of France, hopitaux 
generaux were opened; on the eve of the Revolution, they were to 
be found in thirty-two provincial cities. 

Even if it had been deliberately excluded from the 
organization of the hopitaux generaux —by complicity, doubtless, 
between royal power and bourgeoisie—the Church nonetheless 
did not remain a stranger to the movement. It reformed its own 
hospital institutions, redistributed the wealth of its foundations,

even created congregations whose purposes were rather 
analogous to those of the Hopital General. Vincent de Paul 
reorganized Saint-Lazare, the most important of the former lazar 
houses of Paris; on January 7, 1632, he signed a contract in the 
name of the Congregationists of the Mission with the “Priory” of 
Saint-Lazare, which was now to receive “persons detained by 
order of His Majesty.” The Order of Good Sons opened 
hospitals of this nature in the north of France. The Brothers of 
Saint John of God, called into France in 1602, founded first the 
Charite of Paris in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, then 
Charenton, into which they moved on May 10, 1645. Not far 
from Paris, they also operated the Charite of Senlis, which 
opened on October 27, 1670. Some years before, the Duchess of 
Bouillon had donated them the buildings and benefices of La 
Maladrerie, founded in the fourteenth century by Thibaut de 
Champagne, at Chateau-Thierry. They administered also the 
Charites of Saint-Yon, Pontorson, Cadillac, and Romans. In 
1699, the Lazarists founded in Marseilles the establishment that 
was to become the Hopital Saint-Pierre. Then, in the eighteenth 
century, came Armentieres (1712), Mareville (1714), the Good
