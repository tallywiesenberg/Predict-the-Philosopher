For a long time, it was inconceivable to have a 
state in which there were no paupers, so deeply did need appear 
to be inscribed in man s fate and in the structure of society: 
property, labor, and poverty are terms which remain linked in the 
thought of philosophers until the nineteenth century.Necessary because it could not be suppressed, this role of 
poverty was necessary too because it made wealth possible.Because they labor and consume little, those who are in need 
permit a nation to enrich itself, to set a high value on its fields, 
its colonies, and its mines, to manufacture products which will be 
sold the world over; in short, a people would be poor which had 
no paupers.Indigence becomes an indispensable element in the 
State.In it is concealed the secret but also the real life of a 
society.
