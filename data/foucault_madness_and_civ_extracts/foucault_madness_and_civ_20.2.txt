The poor constitute the basis and the glory of nations.And their poverty, which cannot be suppressed, must be exalted 
and revered: â€œMy purpose is merely to attract a share of that 
vigilant attention [that of the government] to the suffering 
portion of the People ...; the succor it is owed derives essentially 
from the honor and the prosperity of an Empire, of which the 
Poor are everywhere the firmest support, for a sovereign cannot 
preserve and extend his realm without favoring the population, 
the cultivation of the Land, the Arts, and commerce; and the 
Poor are the necessary agents of these great powers which 

establish the true strength of a People.Here is an entire moral 
rehabilitation of the Pauper, which designates, at a deeper level, 
a social and economic reintegration of his role and character.In 
the mercantilist economy, the Pauper, being neither producer 
nor consumer, had no place: idle, vagabond, unemployed, he 
belonged only to confinement, a measure by which he was exiled 
and as it were abstracted from society.With the nascent industry 
which needs manpower, he once again plays a part in the body of 
the nation.Thus, economic thought elaborates on new foundations the
