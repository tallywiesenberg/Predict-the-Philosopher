not a passive element subject to the fluctuations of wealth, but a 
force which directly contributed to the economic situation, to the 
production of wealth, since it is man’s labor which creates—or at 
least transmits, shifts, and multiplies—wealth.The “Poor Man” 
was a vague notion in which were combined that wealth which is 
Man and the state of Need which is acknowledged as essential to 
humanity.Indeed, between Poverty and Population, there is a 
rigorously inverse relation.Physiocrats and economists are in agreement on this.Population is in itself one of the elements of wealth; it forms, 
indeed, its certain and inexhaustible source.
