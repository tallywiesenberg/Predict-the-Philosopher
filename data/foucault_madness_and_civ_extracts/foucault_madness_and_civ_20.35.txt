For Francis 
Quesnay and his disciples, man is the essential mediation 
between the land and wealth: “A man is worth as much as the land , 
according to an old proverb.If a man is valueless, so is the land.With men, one doubles the land one possesses; one clears it, one 
acquires it.God alone could from the earth make a man, whereas 
all over the world it has been possible to have land by means of 
men, or at least the product of the land, which comes down to 
the same thing.It follows that the first good is the possession of 
men, and the second, of the land.”7

For the economists, the population is a good quite as essential, 
if not more so, since in their view wealth is created not only in 
agricultural labor, but in every industrial transformation, and 
even in commercial circulation.
