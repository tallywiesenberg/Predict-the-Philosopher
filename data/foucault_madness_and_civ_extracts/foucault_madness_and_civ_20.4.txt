Wealth is linked to a labor 
actually effected by man: “The State having real wealth only in 
the annual products of its lands and in the industry of its 
inhabitants, its wealth will be at a maximum when the product of 
each acre of land and of the industry of each individual is raised 
to its maximum.”8 Paradoxically, a population will be precious in 
proportion to its numbers, since it will afford industry a cheap 
labor force, which, by lowering the cost price, will permit a 
development of production and of commerce.In this infinitely 
open labor market, the “fundamental price”—what corresponds 
for Turgot to the worker’s subsistence—and the price 
determined by supply and demand ultimately coincide.A nation 
will therefore be favored in commercial competition to the 
degree that it has at its disposal the greatest potential wealth of a 
numerous population.Confinement was a gross error, and an economic mistake: 
poverty was to be suppressed by removing and maintaining by 
charity a poor population.Actually, it was poverty that was being 
artificially masked; and a part of the population was being really 
suppressed, wealth being always constant.
