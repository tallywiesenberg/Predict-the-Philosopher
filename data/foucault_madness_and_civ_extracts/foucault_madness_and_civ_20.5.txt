“Is it to force their subjects to remain at home by 
refusing to receive and incorporate them among us, or is it to 
attract them to us by good wages, allowing them to enjoy the 
advantages of the other citizens?” 

Confinement is open to criticism because of the repercussions 
it can have on the labor market; but still more, because it 
constitutes, and with it the entire enterprise of traditional 
charity, a dangerous financing.Like the Middle Ages, the 
classical period had always sought to provide aid to the poor by 
the system of foundations.This meant that a share of land 
capital or income was thereby immobilized.And for good, since, 
in the just concern to avoid the commercialization of the charity 
enterprises, all juridical measures were taken so that these goods 
would never return to circulation.But with the passage of time, 
their utility diminished; the economic situation changed, poverty 
altered its aspect: “Society does not always have the same needs; 
nature and the distribution of property, the division between the 
different orders of the people, the opinions, the customs, the 
general occupations of the nation or of its different portions, the 
climate itself, the diseases and other accidents of human life 
undergo a continual variation; new needs are born; others cease 
to make themselves felt.”9 The definitive character of the 
foundation was in contradiction to the variable and indefinite 
rate of the accidental needs which it was supposed to satisfy.
