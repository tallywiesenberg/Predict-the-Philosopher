The measures taken immediately before or after the 
beginning of the Revolution reflect this indecision.In his circular on the lettres de cachet , Breteuil asked the 
administrators to indicate the nature of the detention orders in 
the various houses of confinement, and what reasons justified

them.After a year or two of detention at the most, those men 
were to be set free “who, having done nothing that could expose 
them to the severity of the punishments pronounced by the laws, 
had abandoned themselves to the excesses of libertinage, 
debauchery, and dissipation.” On the other hand, those prisoners 
were to be kept in the houses of confinement “whose minds are 
deranged and whose imbecility makes them incapable of 
conducting themselves in a world where their rages would make 
them dangerous.With respect to these, all that is necessary is to 
ascertain whether their condition is still the same, and 
unfortunately it becomes indispensable to continue their 
detention as long as it is acknowledged that their freedom is 
harmful to society, or a useless benefit to themselves.” This was 
the first stage: to reduce as much as possible the practice of 
confinement with regard to moral transgressions, family 
conflicts, the most benign aspects of libertinage, yet to leave it 
untouched in its principle, and with one of its major meanings 
intact: the internment of the mad.This is the moment when 
madness actually takes possession of confinement, while 
confinement itself is divested of its other forms of utility.
