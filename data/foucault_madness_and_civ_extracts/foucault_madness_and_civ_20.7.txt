The second stage was that of the great investigations 
prescribed by the National Assembly and by the Constituent 
Assembly, immediately following the Declaration of the Rights 
of Man: “No man may be arrested or detained except in the cases 
determined by law and according to the forms therein prescribed....The law must permit only the penalties strictly and evidently 
necessary, and no one may be punished under a law established 
and promulgated subsequent to the crime.” The era of 
confinement was over.There remained only an imprisonment 
shared for the moment by condemned or presumed criminals 
and the mad.The Committee on Mendicity of the Constitutent 
Assembly designated five persons to visit the houses of 
confinement in Paris.
