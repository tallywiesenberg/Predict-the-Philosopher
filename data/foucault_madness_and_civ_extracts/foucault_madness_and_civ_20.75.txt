The Duke de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt 
presented the report (December 1789); he declared that the

presence of madmen gave the houses of correction a degrading 
aspect and was likely to reduce the inmates to a status unworthy 
of humanity; the melange tolerated there proved a great frivolity 
on the part of the authorities and the magistrates: ‘‘This 
carelessness is far from the enlightened and scrupulous pity for 
misfortune whereby it receives all possible alleviation and 
consolation in seeking to succor poverty, can one ever 
consent to appear to degrade humanity?” 

If the mad defile those with whom they have been 
imprudently confined, a special internment must be reserved for 
them; a confinement that is not medical, but that ought to be the 
most efficacious and the easiest form of aid: “Of all the 
misfortunes that afflict humanity, the condition of madness is 
still one of those that with most reason call for pity and respect; 
it is for this condition that our attentions must with most reason 
be prodigal; when there is no hope of a cure, how many means 
still remain that can afford these unfortunates at least a tolerable 
existence.” In this text, the status of madness appears in all its 
ambiguity: it is necessary both to protect the confined population 
from its dangers, and to grant it the benefits of a special aid.The third stage was the great series of decrees issued between 
the twelfth and the sixteenth of March 1790.In them, the 
Declaration of the Rights of Man received a concrete 
application: “In the space of six weeks, beginning with the 
present decree, all persons detained in fortresses, religious 
houses, houses of correction, police houses, or other prisons 
whatsoever, by lettres de cachet or by order of the agents of the 
executive power, so long as they are not convicted, or under 
arrest, or not charged with major crimes, or confined by reason 
of madness, will be set at liberty.” Confinement is thus 
definitively reserved for certain categories of convicted criminals 
and for madmen.But for the latter, a special arrangement is in 
order: “Persons detained for reasons of dementia will be, for the 
space of three months, starting from the day of publication of the 


247 



present decree, at the suit of our procurators, interrogated by the 
magistrates in the usual manner, and by virtue of their 
disposition visited by physicians who, under the supervision of 
the directors of the district, will pronounce upon the true 
circumstances of the patients in order that, after the sentence 
that will have certified as to their condition, they may be released 
or cared for in hospitals indicated for that purpose.” It appears 
that the choice is henceforth made.On March 29, 1790, Bailly, 
Duport-Dutertre, and a police administrator went to La 
Salpetriere to determine in what manner this decree could be 
carried out; they then made a similar visit to Bicetre.
