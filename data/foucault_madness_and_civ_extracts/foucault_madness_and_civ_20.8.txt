The 
difficulties were numerous; to begin with, there existed no 
hospitals intended or at least reserved for the mad.In the face of these material difficulties, to which were added 
certain theoretical uncertainties, a long phase of hesitation was to 
begin.From all sides, the Assembly was asked to provide a text 
which would grant protection from madmen even before the 
promised creation of the hospitals.And by a regression, which 
was to be of great importance for the future, madmen were 
brought under the sway of immediate and unchecked measures 
adopted not even against dangerous criminals, but against 
marauding beasts.The Law of August 16-24, 1790, “entrusts to 
the vigilance and authority of the municipal bodies ... the care of 
obviating and remedying the disagreeable events that may be 
occasioned by madmen set at liberty, and by the wandering of 
vicious and dangerous animals.” The law of July 22, 1791, 
reinforces this arrangement, making families responsible for the 
supervision of the insane, and permitting the municipal 
authorities to take all measures that might prove useful: “The 
relatives of the insane must care for them, prevent them from 
straying, and see that they do not commit offenses or disorders.
