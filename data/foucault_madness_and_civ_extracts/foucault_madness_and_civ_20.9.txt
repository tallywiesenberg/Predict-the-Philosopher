Salpetriere: in 1792, two hundred madwomen were taken there

the Chateau of Angers, or at Bellevaux.The disorder in such 
places was indescribable, and continued for a long time—until 
the Empire.Antoine Nodier gives some details about Bellevaux: 
“Every day, the uproar warns the neighborhood that those
