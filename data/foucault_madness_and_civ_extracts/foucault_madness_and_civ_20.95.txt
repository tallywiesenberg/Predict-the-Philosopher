The guards 
rush upon them.Constituted as they are today, the prison guards 
are the laughingstock of the combatants.The municipal 
administrators are implored to intervene in order to re-establish 
peace and quiet; their authority is flouted; they are shamed and 
insulted; this is no longer a house of justice and detention.” 

The disorders are as great, greater perhaps, at Bicetre; political 
prisoners are kept there; hunted suspects are hidden there; 
poverty and famine keep many people hungry.The 
administration never ceases to protest; it asks that criminals be 
kept separate; and—it is important to note—some people still 
suggest that, in their place of detention, madmen be confined as 
well.On the ninth Brumaire, Year III, the bursar of Bicetre 
writes to “Citizens Grandpre and Osmond, members of the 
Committee on Administration and Tribunals”: “I submit that at 
a moment when humanity is decidedly the order of the day, 
there is no one who does not experience an impulse of horror 
upon seeing crime and indigence united in the same asylum.” 
Was it necessary to recall the September massacres, the continual 
escapes, and, for so many innocent eyes, the sight of strangled 
prisoners, of swinging chains?
