greater success. They date from the second half of the 
seventeenth century. An act of 1670 defined their status, 
appointed officers of justice to oversee the collection of taxes and 
the administration of sums that would permit their functioning, 
and entrusted the supreme control of their administration to a 
justice of the peace. In 1697 several parishes of Bristol united to

form the first workhouse in England, and to designate the 
corporation that would administer it. Another was established at 
Worcester in 1703, a third the same year at Dublin; then at 
Plymouth, Norwich, Hull, and Exeter. By the end of the 
eighteenth century, there were 126 of them. The Gilbert Act of 
1792 gives the parishes facilities to create new ones; at the same 
time, the control and authority of the justice of the peace is 
reinforced; to keep the workhouses from becoming hospitals, it is 
recommended that all contagious invalids be turned away. 

In several years, an entire network had spread across Europe. 
John Howard, at the end of the eighteenth century, undertook to 
investigate it; in England, Holland, Germany, France, Italy, 
Spain, he made pilgrimages to all the chief centers of 
confinement—“hospitals, prisons, jails”—and his philanthropy 
was outraged by the fact that the same walls could contain those 
condemned by common law, young men who disturbed their 
families’ peace or who squandered their goods, people without 
profession, and the insane. Proof that even at this period, a 
certain meaning had been lost: that which had so hastily, so 
spontaneously summoned into being all over Europe the 
category of classical order we call confinement. In a hundred and 
fifty years, confinement had become the abusive amalgam of 
heterogeneous elements. Yet at its origin, there must have 
existed a unity which justified its urgency; between these diverse 
forms and the classical period that called them into being, there 
must have been a principle of cohesion we cannot evade under 
the scandal of pre-Revolutionary sensibility. What, then, was the 
reality represented by this entire population which almost 
overnight found itself shut up, excluded more severely than the 
lepers? We must not forget that a few years after its foundation, 
the Hopital General of Paris alone contained six thousand 
persons, or around one per cent of the population. There must 
have formed, silently and doubtless over the course of many 
years, a social sensibility, common to European culture, that
