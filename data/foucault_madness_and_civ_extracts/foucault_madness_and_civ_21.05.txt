“The worthy Society of Friends ... sought to assure those of 
its members who might have the misfortune to lose their reason 
without a sufficient fortune to resort to expensive establishments 
all the resources of medicine and all the comforts of life 
compatible with their state; a voluntary subscription furnished 
the funds, and for the last two years, an establishment that seems 
to unite many advantages with all possible economy has been 
founded near the city of York.If the soul momentarily quails at 
the sight of that dread disease which seems created to humiliate 
human reason, it subsequently experiences gentler emotions 
when it considers all that an ingenious benevolence has been able 
to invent for its care and cure.“This house is situated a mile from York, in the midst of a 
fertile and smiling countryside; it is not at all the idea of a prison 
that it suggests, but rather that of a large farm; it is surrounded 
by a great, walled garden.No bars, no grilles on the windows.”1 

As for the liberation of the insane at Bicetre, the story is 
famous: the decision to remove the chains from the prisoners in 
the dungeons; Couthon visiting the hospital to find out whether 
any suspects were being hidden; Pinel courageously going to 
meet him, while everyone trembled at the sight of the “invalid 
carried in men’s arms.” The confrontation of the wise, firm 
philanthropist and the paralytic monster.“Pinel immediately led 
him to the section for the deranged, where the sight of the cells 
made a painful impression on him.
