”5 In the dialectic of insanity where reason hides 


255 


without abolishing itself, religion constitutes the concrete form 
of what cannot go mad; it bears what is invincible in reason, it 
bears what subsists beneath madness as quasi-nature and around 
it as the constant solicitation of a milieu “where, during lucid 
intervals, or the state of convalescence, the patient might enjoy 
the society of those who were of similar habits and opinions.” 
Religion safeguards the old secret of reason in the presence of 
madness, thus making closer, more immediate, the constraint 
that was already rampant in classical confinement.There, the 
religious and moral milieu was imposed from without, in such a 
way that madness was controlled, not cured.At the Retreat, 
religion was part of the movement which indicated in spite of 
everything the presence of reason in madness, and which led 
from insanity to health.Religious segregation has a very precise 
meaning: it does not attempt to preserve the sufferers from the 
profane presence of non-Quakers, but to place the insane 
individual within a moral element where he will be in debate 
with himself and his surroundings: to constitute for him a milieu 
where, far from being protected, he will be kept in a perpetual 
anxiety, ceaselessly threatened by Law and Transgression.“The principle of fear, which is rarely decreased by insanity, is 
considered as of great importance in the management of the 

patients.” 3 Fear appears as an essential presence in the asylum.
