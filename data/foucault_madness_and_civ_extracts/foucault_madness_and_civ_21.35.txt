Now madness would never—could 
never—cause fear again; it would be afraid , without recourse or 
return, thus entirely in the hands of the pedagogy of good sense, 
of truth, and of morality.Samuel Tuke tells how he received at the Retreat a maniac, 
young and prodigiously strong, whose seizures caused panic in 
those around him and even among his guards.When he entered 
the Retreat he was loaded with chains; he wore handcuffs; his 
clothes were attached by ropes.He had no sooner arrived than all 
his shackles were removed, and he was permitted to dine with 
the keepers; his agitation immediately ceased; “his attention 
appeared to be arrested by his new situation.” He was taken to 
his room; the keeper explained that the entire house was 
organized in terms of the greatest liberty and the greatest 
comfort for all, and that he would not be subject to any 
constraint so long as he did nothing against the rules of the 
house or the general principles of human morality.For his part, 
the keeper declared he had no desire to use the means of 
coercion at his disposal.
