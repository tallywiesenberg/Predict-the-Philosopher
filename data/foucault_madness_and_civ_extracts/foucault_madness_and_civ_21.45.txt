out and glorifying a region of simple responsibility where any 
manifestation of madness will be linked to punishment.The 
obscure guilt that once linked transgression and unreason is thus 
shifted; the madman, as a human being originally endowed with 
reason, is no longer guilty of being mad; but the madman, as a 
madman, and in the interior of that disease of which he is no 
longer guilty, must feel morally responsible for everything within 
him that may disturb morality and society, and must hold no one 
but himself responsible for the punishment he receives.The 
assignation of guilt is no longer the mode of relation that obtains 
between the madman and the sane man in their generality; it 
becomes both the concrete form of coexistence of each madman 
with his keeper, and the form of awareness that the madman 
must have of his own madness.We must therefore re-evaluate the meanings assigned to 
Tuke’s work: liberation of the insane, abolition of constraint, 
constitution of a human milieu—these are only justifications.
