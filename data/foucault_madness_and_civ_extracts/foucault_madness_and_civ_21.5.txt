The real operations were different.In fact Tuke created an 
asylum where he substituted for the free terror of madness the 
stifling anguish of responsibility; fear no longer reigned on the 
other side of the prison gates, it now raged under the seals of 
conscience.Tuke now transferred the age-old terrors in which 
the insane had been trapped to the very heart of madness.The 
asylum no longer punished the madman’s guilt, it is true; but it 
did more, it organized that guilt; it organized it for the madman 
as a consciousness of himself, and as a non-reciprocal relation to 
the keeper; it organized it for the man of reason as an awareness 
of the Other, a therapeutic intervention in the madman’s 
existence.In other words, by this guilt the madman became an 
object of punishment always vulnerable to himself and to the 
Other; and, from the acknowledgment of his status as object, 
from the awareness of his guilt, the madman was to return to his 
awareness of himself as a free and responsible subject, and 
consequently to reason.
