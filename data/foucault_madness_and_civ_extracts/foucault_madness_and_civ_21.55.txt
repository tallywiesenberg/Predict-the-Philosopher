himself for the Other, the madman thus returned to his liberty, 
was to be found as much in Work as in Observation.Let us not forget that we are in a Quaker world where God 
blesses men in the signs of their prosperity.Work comes first in 
“moral treatment” as practiced at the Retreat.In itself, work 
possesses a constraining power superior to all forms of physical 
coercion, in that the regularity of the hours, the requirements of 
attention, the obligation to produce a result detach the sufferer 
from a liberty of mind that would be fatal and engage him in a 
system of responsibilities: “Regular employment is perhaps the 
most generally efficacious; and those kinds of employment are 
doubtless to be preferred, both on a moral and physical account, 
which are accompanied by considerable bodily action; that are 
most agreeable to the patient and which are most opposite to the 
illusions of his disease.”7 Through work, man returns to the 
order of God’s commandments; he submits his liberty to laws 
that are those of both morality and reality.Hence mental work is 
not to be rejected; yet with absolute rigor, all exercises of the 
imagination must be excluded as being in complicity with the 
passions, the desires, or all delirious illusions.
