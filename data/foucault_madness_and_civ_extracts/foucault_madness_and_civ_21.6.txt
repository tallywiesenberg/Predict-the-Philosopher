On the contrary, 
the study of what is eternal in nature and most in accord with the 
wisdom and goodness of Providence has the greatest efficacity in 
reducing the madman’s immoderate liberties and bringing him to 
discover the forms of his responsibility.“The various branches of 
the mathematics and natural science furnish the most useful class 
of subjects on which to employ the minds of the insane.” In the 
asylum, work is deprived of any productive value; it is imposed 
only as a moral rule; a limitation of liberty, a submission to order, 
an engagement of responsibility, with the single aim of 
disalienating the mind lost in the excess of a liberty which 
physical constraint limits only in appearance.Even more efficacious than work, than the observation of 
others, is what Tuke calls “the need for esteem”: “This principle

in the human mind, which doubtless influences in a great degree, 
though often secretly, our general manners; and which operates 
with peculiar force on our introduction into a new circle of 
acquaintance.” In classical confinement, the madman was also 
vulnerable to observation, but such observation did not, basically, 
involve him; it involved only his monstrous surface, his visible 
animality; and it included at least one form of reciprocity, since 
the sane man could read in the madman, as in a mirror, the 
imminent movement of his downfall.The observation Tuke now 
instituted as one of the great elements of asylum existence was 
both deeper and less reciprocal.It pursued in the madman the 
least perceptible signs of his madness, in the place where 
madness becomes secretly distinct from reason, begins to detach 
itself from it; and the madman cannot return this observation in 
any form, since he is merely observed; he is a kind of new arrival, 
a latecomer in the world of reason.
