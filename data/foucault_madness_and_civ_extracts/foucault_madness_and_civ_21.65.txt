Tuke organized an entire 
ceremonial around these observations.There were social 
occasions in the English manner, where everyone was obliged to 
imitate all the formal requirements of social existence; nothing 
else circulated except the observation that would spy out any 
incongruity, any disorder, any awkwardness where madness 
might betray itself.The directors and staff of the Retreat thus 
regularly invited several patients to “tea-parties”; the guests 
“dress in their best clothes, and vie with each other in politeness 
and propriety.The best fare is provided, and the visitors are 
treated with all the attention of strangers.The evening generally 
passes with the greatest harmony and enjoyment.
