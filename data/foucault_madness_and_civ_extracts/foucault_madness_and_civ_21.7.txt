It rarely 
happens that any unpleasant circumstance occurs; the patients 
control, to a wonderful degree, their different propensities; and 
the scene is at once curious and affectingly gratifying.” Curiously, 
this rite is not one of intimacy, of dialogue, of mutual 
acquaintance; it is the organization around the madman of a 
world where everything would be like and near him, but in 
which he himself would remain a stranger, the Stranger par

excellence who is judged not only by appearances but by all that 
they may betray and reveal in spite of themselves.Incessantly cast 
in this empty role of unknown visitor, and challenged in 
everything that can be known about him, drawn to the surface of 
himself by a social personality silently imposed by observation, by 
form and mask, the madman is obliged to objectify himself in 
the eyes of reason as the perfect stranger, that is, as the man 
whose strangeness does not reveal itself.The city of reason 
welcomes him only with this qualification and at the price of this 
surrender to anonymity.We see that at the Retreat the partial suppression of physical 
constraint was part of a system whose essential element was the 
constitution of a “self-restraint” in which the patient’s freedom, 
engaged by work and the observation of others, was ceaselessly 
threatened by the recognition of guilt.Instead of submitting to a 
simple negative operation that loosened bonds and delivered 
one’s deepest nature from madness, it must be recognized that 
one was in the grip of a positive operation that confined madness 
in a system of rewards and punishments, and included it in the 
movement of moral consciousness.
