A passage from a world of 
Censure to a universe of Judgment.But thereby a psychology of 
madness becomes possible, for under observation madness is 
constantly required, at the surface of itself, to deny its 
dissimulation.It is judged only by its acts; it is not accused of 
intentions, nor are its secrets to be fathomed.Madness is 
responsible only for that part of itself which is visible.All the rest 
is reduced to silence.
