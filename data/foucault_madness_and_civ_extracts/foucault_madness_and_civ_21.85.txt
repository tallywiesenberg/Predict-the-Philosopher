Surveillance and Judgment: already the outline appears of a 
new personage who will be essential in the nineteenth-century 
asylum.Tuke himself suggests this personage, when he tells the 
story of a maniac subject to seizures of irrepressible violence.One day while he was walking in the garden of the asylum with 
the keeper, this patient suddenly entered a phase of excitation, 
moved several steps away, picked up a large stone, and made the 
gesture of throwing it at his companion.The keeper stopped, 
looked the patient in the eyes; then advanced several steps 
toward him and “in a resolute tone of voice ... commanded him 
to lay down the stone”; as he approached, the patient lowered his 
hand, then dropped his weapon; “he then submitted to be quietly 
led to his apartment.” Something had been born, which was no 
longer repression, but authority.Until the end of the eighteenth 
century, the world of madmen was peopled only by the abstract, 
faceless power which kept them confined; within these limits, it 
was empty, empty of all that was not madness itself; the guards 
were often recruited among the inmates themselves.
