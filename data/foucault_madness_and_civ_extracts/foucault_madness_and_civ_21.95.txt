Now the combat was always decided 
beforehand, unreason's defeat inscribed in advance in the 
concrete situation where madman and man of reason meet.The 
absence of constraint in the nineteenth-century asylum is not 
unreason liberated, but madness long since mastered.For this new reason which reigns in the asylum, madness does 
not represent the absolute form of contradiction, but instead a 
minority status, an aspect of itself that does not have the right to 
autonomy, and can live only grafted onto the world of reason.Madness is childhood.Everything at the Retreat is organized so 
that the insane are transformed into minors.
