Great emphasis was placed on the 
concept of the “family” which organized the community of the 
insane and their keepers at the Retreat.Apparently this “family”

placed the patient in a milieu both normal and natural; in reality 
it alienated him still more: the juridical minority assigned to the 
madman was intended to protect him as a subject of law; this 
ancient structure, by becoming a form of coexistence, delivered 
him entirely, as a psychological subject, to the authority and 
prestige of the man of reason, who assumed for him the concrete 
figure of an adult, in other words, both domination and 
destination.In the great reorganization of relations between madness and 
reason, the family, at the end of the eighteenth century, played a 
decisive part—simultaneously imaginary landscape and real social 
structure; it is from the family that Tuke starts out, and toward it 
that he progresses.Lending it the prestige of primitive values not 
yet compromised in the social, Tuke makes the family play a role 
of disalienation; it was, in his myth, the antithesis of that 
“milieu” which the eighteenth century saw as the origin of all 
madness.But he introduced it as well, in a very real way, into the 
world of the asylum, where it appears both as truth and as norm 
for all relations that may obtain between the madman and the 
man of reason.
