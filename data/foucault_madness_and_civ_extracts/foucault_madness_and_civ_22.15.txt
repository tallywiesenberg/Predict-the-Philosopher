Thus in the modern world, what had been 
the great, irreparable confrontation of reason and unreason 
became the secret thrust of instincts against the solidity of the 
family institution and against its most archaic symbols.There is an astonishing convergence of the movement of 
fundamental institutions and this evolution of madness in the 
world of confinement.The liberal economy, as we have seen, 
tended to entrust the care of the poor and the sick to the family 
rather than to the State: the family thus became the site of social 
responsibility.But if the patient can be entrusted to the family, 
he is nonetheless mad, which is too strange and inhuman.Tuke, 
precisely, reconstitutes around madness a simulated family, 
which is an institutional parody but a real psychological 
situation.
