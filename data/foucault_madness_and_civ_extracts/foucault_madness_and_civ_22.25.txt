The asylum, always oriented to anachronistic 
structures and symbols, would be, par excellence , inadapted and 
out of time.And exactly where animality manifested a presence 
without history, an eternal return, would slowly reappear the 
immemorial scars of old hatreds, old family profanations, the 
forgotten signs of incest and punishment.Pinel advocates no religious segregation.Or rather, a 
segregation that functions in the opposite direction from that 
practiced by Tuke.The benefits of the renovated asylum were 
offered to all, or almost all, except the fanatics “who believe 
themselves inspired and seek to make converts.” Bicetre and La 
Salpetriere, according to Pinefs intention, form a complementary 
figure to the Retreat.
