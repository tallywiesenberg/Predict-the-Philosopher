followed by the most fortunate effects, and by a cure that lasted 
three years.” Restored to the extreme simplicity of this moral 
content, religion could not help conniving with philosophy and 
with medicine, with all the forms of wisdom and science that can 
restore the reason in a disturbed mind.There are even instances 
of religion serving as a preliminary treatment, preparing for what 
will be done in the asylum: take the case of the young girl “of an 
ardent temperament, though very docile and pious” who was 
torn between “the inclinations of her heart and the severe 
principles of her conduct”; her confessor, after having vainly 
counseled her to attach herself to God, proposed examples of a 
firm and measured holiness, and “offered her the best remedy 
against high passions: patience and time.” Taken to La 
Salpetriere, she was treated, on Pinefs orders, “according to the 
same moral principles,” and her illness proved “of very short 
duration.” Thus the asylum assimilates not the social theme of a 
religion in which men feel themselves brothers in the same 
communion and the same community, but the moral power of 
consolation, of confidence, and a docile fidelity to nature.It must 
resume the moral enterprise of religion, exclusive of its fantastic 
text, exclusively on the level of virtue, labor, and social life.The asylum is a religious domain without religion, a domain 
of pure morality, of ethical uniformity.Everything that might 
retain the signs of the old differences was eliminated.
