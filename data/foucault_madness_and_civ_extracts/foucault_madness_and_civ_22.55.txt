It denounces everything that opposes 
the essential virtues of society: celibacy—“the number of girls 
fallen into idiocy is seven times greater than the number of 
married women for the Year XI and the Year XIII; for dementia, 
the proportion is two to four times greater; we can thus deduce 
that marriage constitutes for women a kind of preservative 
against the two sorts of insanity which are most inveterate and 
most often incurable”; debauchery, misconduct, and “extreme 
perversity of habits”—“vicious habits such as drunkenness, 
limitless promiscuity, an apathetic lack of concern can gradually 
degrade the reason and end in outright insanity”; laziness—“it is 
the most constant and unanimous result of experience that in all 
public asylums, as in prisons and hospitals, the surest and 
perhaps the sole guarantee of the maintenance of health and 
good habits and order is the law of rigorously executed 
mechanical work.” The asylum sets itself the task of the 
homogeneous rule of morality, its rigorous extension to all those 
who tend to escape from it.But it thereby generates an indifference; if the law does not 
reign universally, it is because there are men who do not 
recognize it, a class of society that lives in disorder, in negligence, 
and almost in illegality: “If on the one hand we see families 
prosper for a long series of years in the bosom of harmony and 
order and concord, how many others, especially in the lower

classes, afflict the eye with a repulsive spectacle of debauchery, of 
dissensions, and shameful distress!That, according to my daily 
notes, is the most fertile source of the insanity we treat in the 

hospitals.’T1 

In one and the same movement, the asylum becomes, in 
Pinel’s hands, an instrument of moral uniformity and of social 
denunciation.The problem is to impose, in a universal form, a 
morality that will prevail from within upon those who are 
strangers to it and in whom insanity is already present before it 
has made itself manifest.In the first case, the asylum must act as 
an awakening and a reminder, invoking a forgotten nature; in the 
second, it must act by means of a social shift in order to snatch 
the individual from his condition.
