The operation as practiced at 
the Retreat was still simple: religious segregation for purposes of 
moral purification.The operation as practiced by Pinel was 
relatively complex: to effect moral syntheses, assuring an ethical 
continuity between the world of madness and the world of 
reason, but by practicing a social segregation that would 
guarantee bourgeois morality a universality of fact and permit it 
to be imposed as a law upon all forms of insanity.In the classical period, indigence, laziness, vice, and madness 
mingled in an equal guilt within unreason; madmen were caught 
in the great confinement of poverty and unemployment, but all 
had been promoted, in the proximity of transgression, to the 
essence of a Fall.Now madness belonged to social failure, which 
appeared without distinction as its cause, model, and limit.Half 
a century later, mental disease would become degeneracy.
