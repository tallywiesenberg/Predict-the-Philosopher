The dungeon, 
the chains, the continual spectacle, the sarcasms were, to the 
sufferer in his delirium, the very element of his liberty.Acknowledged in that very fact and fascinated from without by 
so much complicity, he could not be dislodged from his 
immediate truth.But the chains that fell, the indifference and 
silence of all those around him confined him in the limited use of 
an empty liberty; he was delivered in silence to a truth which was 
not acknowledged and which he would demonstrate in vain,

since he was no longer a spectacle, and from which he could 
derive no exaltation, since he was not even humiliated.It was the 
man himself, not his projection in a delirium, who was now 
humiliated: for physical constraint yielded to a liberty that 
constantly touched the limits of solitude; the dialogue of 
delirium and insult gave way to a monologue in a language which 
exhausted itself in the silence of others; the entire show of 
presumption and outrage was replaced by indifference.Henceforth, more genuinely confined than he could have been in 
a dungeon and chains, a prisoner of nothing but himself, the 
sufferer was caught in a relation to himself that was of the order 
of transgression, and in a non-relation to others that was of the 
order of shame.
