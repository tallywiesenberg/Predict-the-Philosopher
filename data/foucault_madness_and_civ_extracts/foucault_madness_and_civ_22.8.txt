The others are made innocent, they are no 
longer persecutors; the guilt is shifted inside, showing the 
madman that he was fascinated by nothing but his own 
presumption; the enemy faces disappear; he no longer feels their 
presence as observation, but as a denial of attention, as 
observation deflected; the others are now nothing but a limit that 
ceaselessly recedes as he advances.Delivered from his chains, he 
is now chained, by silence, to transgression and to shame.He 
feels himself punished, and he sees the sign of his innocence in 
that fact; free from all physical punishment, he must prove 
himself guilty.His torment was his glory; his deliverance must 
humiliate him.Compared to the incessant dialogue of reason and madness 
during the Renaissance, classical internment had been a 
silencing.
