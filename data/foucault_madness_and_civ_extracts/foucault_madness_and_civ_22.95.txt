With Pinel, on the contrary, observation operated only within 
the space defined by madness, without surface or exterior limits.Madness would see itself, would be seen by itself—pure spectacle 
and absolute subject.“Three insane persons, each of whom believed himself to be a 
king, and each of whom took the title Louis XVI, quarreled one 
day over the prerogatives of royalty, and defended them 
somewhat too energetically.The keeper approached one of them, 
and drawing him aside, asked: ‘Why do you argue with these 
men who are evidently mad?Doesn’t everyone know that you 
should be recognized as Louis XVI?’ Flattered by this homage, 
the madman immediately withdrew, glancing at the others with 
a disdainful hauteur.
