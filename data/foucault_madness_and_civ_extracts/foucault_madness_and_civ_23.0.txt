scarcity of coin—the coincidence of these phenomena probably 
being due to a crisis in the Spanish economy. Even England, of 
all the countries of Western Europe the least dependent on the 
system, had to solve the same problems. Despite all the measures 
taken to avoid unemployment and the reduction of wages, 
poverty continued to spread in the nation. In 1622 appeared a 
pamphlet, Grievous Groan for the Poor , attributed to Thomas 
Dekker, which, emphasizing the danger, condemns the general 
negligence: “Though the number of the poor do daily increase,

all things yet worketh for the worst in their behalf;... many of 
these parishes turneth forth their poor, yea, and their lusty 
labourers that will not work ... to beg, filch, and steal for their 
maintenance, so that the country is pitifully pestered with them.” 
It was feared that they would overrun the country, and since they 
could not, as on the Continent, cross the border into another 
nation, it was proposed that they be “banished and conveyed to 
the New-found Land, the East and West Indies.” In 1630, the 
King established a commission to assure the rigorous observance 
of the Poor Laws. That same year, it published a series of “orders 
and directions”; it recommended prosecuting beggars and 
vagabonds, as well as “all those who live in idleness and will not 
work for reasonable wages or who spend what they have in 
taverns.” They must be punished according to law and placed in 
houses of correction; as for those with wives and children, 
investigation must be made as to whether they were married and 
their children baptized, “for these people live like savages 
without being married, nor buried, nor baptized; and it is this 
licentious liberty which causes so many to rejoice in 
vagabondage.” Despite the recovery that began in England in the 
middle of the century, the problem was still unsolved in 
Cromwelfs time, for the Lord Mayor complains of “this vermin 
that troops about the city, disturbing public order, assaulting 
carriages, demanding alms with loud cries at the doors of 
churches and private houses.” 

For a long time, the house of correction or the premises of the 
Hopital General would serve to contain the unemployed, the 
idle, and vagabonds. Each time a crisis occurred and the number 
of the poor sharply increased, the houses of confinement 
regained, at least for a time, their initial economic significance. 
In the middle of the eighteenth century, there was another great 
crisis: 12,000 begging workers at Rouen and as many at Tours; at 
Lyons the manufactories closed. The Count d’Argenson, “who 
commands the department of Paris and the marshalseas,” gave
