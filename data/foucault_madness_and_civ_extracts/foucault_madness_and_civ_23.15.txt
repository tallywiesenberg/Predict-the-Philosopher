Here the movement 
is of an entirely different nature; it is not a question of 
dissipating error by the impressive spectacle of a truth, even a 
pretended truth; but of treating madness in its arrogance rather 
than in its aberration.The classical mind condemned in madness 
a certain blindness to the truth; from Pinel on, madness would 
be regarded rather as an impulse from the depths which exceeds 
the juridical limits of the individual, ignores the moral limits 
fixed for him, and tends to an apotheosis of the self.For the 
nineteenth century, the initial model of madness would be to 
believe oneself to be God, while for the preceding centuries it 
had been to deny God.Thus madness, in the spectacle of itself as 
unreason humiliated, was able to find its salvation when, 
imprisoned in the absolute subjectivity of its delirium, it 
surprised the absurd and objective image of that delirium in the 
identical madman.Truth insinuated itself, as if by surprise (and 
not by violence, in the eighteenth-century mode), in this play of 
reciprocal observations where it never saw anything but itself.
