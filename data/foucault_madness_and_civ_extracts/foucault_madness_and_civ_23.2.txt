But the asylum, in this community of madmen, placed the 
mirrors in such a way that the madman, when ail was said and 
done, inevitably surprised himself, despite himself, as a madman.Freed from the chains that made it a purely observed object, 
madness lost, paradoxically, the essence of its liberty, which was 
solitary exaltation; it became responsible for what it knew of its 
truth; it imprisoned itself in an infinitely self-referring 
observation; it was finally chained to the humiliation of being its 
own object.Awareness was now linked to the shame of being 
identical to that other, of being compromised in him, and of 
already despising oneself before being able to recognize or to 
know oneself.3.Perpetual Judgment.
