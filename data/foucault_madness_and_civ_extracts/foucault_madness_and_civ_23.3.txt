One of the 
inmates at Bicetre suffered from a religious delirium animated by 
a fear of hell; he believed that the only way he could escape 
eternal damnation was by rigorous abstinence.It was necessary to 
compensate this fear of a remote justice by the presence of a 
more immediate and still more redoubtable one: “Could the 
irresistible curse of his sinister ideas be counterbalanced other 
than by the impression of a strong and deep fear?” One evening, 
the director came to the patient’s door “with matter likely to 
produce fear—an angry eye, a thundering tone of voice, a group 
of the staff armed with strong chains that they shook noisily.They set some soup beside the madman and gave him precise 
orders to eat it during the night, or else suffer the most cruel 
treatment.They retired, and left the madman in the most 
distressed state of indecision between the punishment with 
which he was threatened and the frightening prospect of the 
torments in the life to come.After an inner combat of several 
hours, the former idea prevailed, and he decided to take some 
nourishment.
