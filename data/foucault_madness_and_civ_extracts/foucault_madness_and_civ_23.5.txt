Now it is judged, 
and not only upon entering the asylum, in order to be 
recognized, classified, and made innocent forever; it is caught, on 
the contrary, in a perpetual judgment, which never ceases to 
pursue it and to apply sanctions, to proclaim its transgressions, to 
require honorable amends, to exclude, finally, those whose 
transgressions risk compromising the social order.Madness 
escaped from the arbitrary only in order to enter a kind of 
endless trial for which the asylum furnished simultaneously 
police, magistrates, and torturers; a trial whereby any 
transgression in life, by a virtue proper to life in the asylum, 
becomes a social crime, observed, condemned, and punished; a 
trial which has no outcome but in a perpetual recommencement 
in the internalized form of remorse.The madmen “delivered” by 
Pinel and, after him, the madmen of modern confinement are 
under arraignment; if they have the privilege of no longer being 
associated or identified with convicts, they are condemned, at 
every moment, to be subject to an accusation whose text is never 
given, for it is their entire life in the asylum which constitutes it.279 



The asylum of the age of positivism, which it is Pinel’s glory to 
have founded, is not a free realm of observation, diagnosis, and 
therapeutics; it is a juridical space where one is accused, judged, 
and condemned, and from which one is never released except by 
the version of this trial in psychological depth—that is, by 
remorse.Madness will be punished in the asylum, even if it is 
innocent outside of it.
