For a long time to come, and until our 
own day at least, it is imprisoned in a moral world.To silence, to recognition in the mirror, to perpetual 
judgment, we must add a fourth structure peculiar to the world 
of the asylum as it was constituted at the end of the eighteenth 
century: this is the apotheosis of the medical personage.Of them 
all, it is doubtless the most important, since it would authorize 
not only new contacts between doctor and patient, but a new 
relation between insanity and medical thought, and ultimately 
command the whole modern experience of madness.Hitherto, 
we find in the asylums only the same structures of confinement, 
but displaced and deformed.With the new status of the medical 
personage, the deepest meaning of confinement is abolished: 
mental disease, with the meanings we now give it, is made 
possible.
