imperfectly connected with the progress of recovery, that he 
could not avoid suspecting them, to be rather concomitants than 
causes.” He then realized that there was little to be done using 
the medical methods known up to that time.The concern for 
humanity prevailed within him, and he decided to use no 
medicament that would be too disagreeable to the patient.But it 
must not be thought that the doctor s role had little importance 
at the Retreat: by the visits he paid regularly to the patients, by 
the authority he exercised in the house over all the staff, “the 
physician ... sometimes possesses more influence over the 
patients’ minds, than the other attendants.” 

It is thought that Tuke and Pinel opened the asylum to 
medical knowledge.They did not introduce science, but a 
personality, whose powers borrowed from science only their 
disguise, or at most their justification.These powers, by their 
nature, were of a moral and social order; they took root in the 
madman’s minority status, in the insanity of his person, not of 
his mind.
