If the medical personage could isolate madness, it was 
not because he knew it, but because he mastered it; and what for 
positivism would be an image of objectivity was only the other 
side of this domination.â€œIt is a very important object to win the 
confidence of these sufferers, and to arouse in them feelings of 
respect and obedience, which can only be the fruit of superior 
discernment, distinguished education, and dignity of tone and 
manner.Stupidity, ignorance, and the lack of principles, 
sustained by a tyrannical harshness, may incite fear, but always 
inspire distrust.The keeper of madmen who has obtained 
domination over them directs and rules their conduct as he 
pleases; he must be endowed with a firm character, and on 
occasion display an imposing strength.He must threaten little 
but carry out his threats, and if he is disobeyed, punishment must 
immediately ensue.
