”19 The physician could exercise his absolute 
authority in the world of the asylum only insofar as, from the

beginning, he was Father and Judge, Family and Law—his 
medical practice being for a long time no more than a 
complement to the old rites of Order, Authority, and 
Punishment.And Pinel was well aware that the doctor cures 
when, exclusive of modern therapeutics, he brings into play these 
immemorial figures.Pinel cites the case of a girl of seventeen who had been raised 
by her parents with “extreme indulgence”; she had fallen into a 
“giddy, mad delirium without any cause that could be 
determined”; at the hospital she was treated with great 
gentleness, but she always showed a certain “haughtiness” which 
could not be tolerated at the asylum; she spoke “of her parents 
with nothing but bitterness.” It was decided to subject her to a 
regime of strict authority; “the keeper, in order to tame this 
inflexible character, seized the moment of the bath and expressed 
himself forcibly concerning certain unnatural persons who dared 
oppose their parents and disdain their authority.He warned the 
girl she would henceforth be treated with all the severity she 
deserved, for she herself was opposed to her cure and 
dissimulated with insurmountable obstinacy the basic cause of 
her illness.” Through this new rigor and these threats, the sick 
girl felt “profoundly moved ... she ended by acknowledging her 
wrongs and making a frank confession that she had suffered a 
loss of reason as the result of a forbidden romantic attachment, 
naming the person who had been its object.” After this first 
confession, the cure became easy: “a most favorable alteration 
occurred ... she was henceforth soothed and could not 
sufficiently express her gratitude toward the keeper who had 
brought an end to her continual agitation, and had restored 
tranquillity and calm to her heart.” There is not a moment of the 
story that could not be transcribed in psychoanalytical terms.To 
such a degree was it true that the medical personage, according 
to Pinel, had to act not as the result of an objective definition of 
the disease or a specific classifying diagnosis, but by relying upon

that prestige which envelops the secrets of the Family, of 
Authority, of Punishment, and of Love; it is by bringing such 
powers into play, by wearing the mask of Father and of Judge, 
that the physician, by one of those abrupt short cuts that leave 
aside mere medical competence, became the almost magic 
perpetrator of the cure, and assumed the aspect of a 
Thaumaturge; it was enough that he observed and spoke, to 
cause secret faults to appear, insane presumptions to vanish, and 
madness at last to yield to reason.
