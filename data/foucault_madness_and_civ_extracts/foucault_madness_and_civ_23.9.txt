His presence and his words 
were gifted with that power of disalienation, which at one blow 
revealed the transgression and restored the order of morality.It is a curious paradox to see medical practice enter the 
uncertain domain of the quasi-miraculous at the very moment 
when the knowledge of mental illness tries to assume a positive 
meaning.On the one hand, madness puts itself at a distance in 
an objective field where the threats of unreason disappear; but at 
this same moment, the madman tends to form with the doctor, 
in an unbroken unity, a “couple” whose complicity dates back to 
very old links.Life in the asylum as Tuke and Pinel constituted it 
permitted the birth of that delicate structure which would 
become the essential nucleus of madness—a structure that 
formed a kind of microcosm in which were symbolized the 
massive structures of bourgeois society and its values: Family- 
Child relations, centered on the theme of paternal authority; 
Transgression-Punishment relations, centered on the theme of 
immediate justice; Madness-Disorder relations, centered on the 
theme of social and moral order.It is from these that the 
physician derives his power to cure; and it is to the degree that 
the patient finds himself, by so many old links, already alienated 
in the doctor, within the doctor-patient couple, that the doctor 
has the almost miraculous power to cure him.
