As positivism imposes itself upon medicine and psychiatry, 
this practice becomes more and more obscure, the psychiatrist’s 
power more and more miraculous, and the doctor-patient couple 
sinks deeper into a strange world.In the patient’s eyes, the 
doctor becomes a thaumaturge; the authority he has borrowed 
from order, morality, and the family now seems to derive from 
himself; it is because he is a doctor that he is believed to possess 
these powers, and while Pinel, with Tuke, strongly asserted that 
his moral action was not necessarily linked to any scientific 
competence, it was thought, and by the patient first of all, that it

was in the esotericism of his knowledge, in some almost 
daemonic secret of knowledge, that the doctor had found the 
power to unravel insanity; and increasingly the patient would 
accept this self-surrender to a doctor both divine and satanic, 
beyond human measure in any case; increasingly he would 
alienate himself in the physician, accepting entirely and in 
advance all his prestige, submitting from the very first to a will 
he experienced as magic, and to a science he regarded as 
prescience and divination, thus becoming the ideal and perfect 
correlative of those powers he projected upon the doctor, pure 
object without any resistance except his own inertia, quite ready 
to become precisely that hysteric in whom Charcot exalted the 
doctor’s marvelous powers.If we wanted to analyze the profound 
structures of objectivity in the knowledge and practice of 
nineteenth-century psychiatry from Pinel to Freud, 20 we should 
have to show in fact that such objectivity was from the start a 
reification of a magical nature, which could only be accomplished 
with the complicity of the patient himself, and beginning from a 
transparent and clear moral practice, gradually forgotten as 
positivism imposed its myths of scientific objectivity; a practice 
forgotten in its origins and its meaning, but always used and 
always present.What we call psychiatric practice is a certain 
moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth 
century, preserved in the rites of asylum life, and overlaid by the 
myths of positivism.But if the doctor soon became a thaumaturge for the patient, 
he could not be one in his own positivist doctor’s eyes.
