a full economic recession. The act of 1610 recommended only 
joining certain mills and weaving and carding shops to all houses 
of correction in order to occupy the pensioners. But what had 
been a moral requirement became an economic tactic when 
commerce and industry recovered after 1651, the economic 
situation having been re-established by the Navigation Act and 
the lowering of the discount rate. All able-bodied manpower was 
to be used to the best advantage, that is, as cheaply as possible. 
When John Carey established his workhouse project in Bristol, 
he ranked the need for work first: “The poor of both 
sexes ... may be employed in beating hemp, dressing and 
spinning flax, or in carding wool and cotton.” At Worcester, they 
manufactured clothes and stuffs; a workshop for children was 
established. All of which did not always proceed without 
difficulties. It was suggested that the workhouses might enter the 
local industries and markets, on the principle perhaps that such 
cheap production would have a regulatory effect on the sale 
price. But the manufactories protested. Daniel Defoe noticed 
that by the effect of the too easy competition of the workhouses, 
poverty was created in one area on the pretext of suppressing it in 
another; “it is giving to one what you take away from another; 
putting a vagabond in an honest man’s employment, and putting 
diligence on the tenters to find out some other work to maintain 
his family.” Faced with this danger of competition, the 
authorities let the work gradually disappear. The pensioners 
could no longer earn even enough to pay for their upkeep; at 
times it was necessary to put them in prison so that they might at 
least have free bread. As for the bridewells, as Howard attested, 
there were few “in which any work is done, or can be done. The 
prisoners have neither tools, nor materials of any kind: but spend 
their time in sloth, profaneness and debauchery.”

intended above all to suppress beggary, rather than to provide an 
occupation for the internees. It seems, however, that Colbert, 
like his English contemporaries, regarded assistance through 
work as both a remedy to unemployment and a stimulus to the 
development of manufactories. In any case, in the provinces the 
directors were to see that the houses of charity had a certain 
economic significance. “All the poor who are capable of working 
must, upon work days, do what is necessary to avoid idleness, 
which is the mother of all evils, as well as to accustom them to 
honest toil and also to earning some part of their sustenance.”
