At the end of the nineteenth 
century, and in the thought of Babinski’s contemporaries, we 
find that prodigious postulate, which no medicine had yet dared 
formulate: that madness, after all, was only madness.Thus while the victim of mental illness is entirely alienated in 
the real person of his doctor, the doctor dissipates the reality of 
the mental illness in the critical concept of madness.So that 
there remains, beyond the empty forms of positivist thought, 
only a single concrete reality: the doctor-patient couple in which 
all alienations are summarized, linked, and loosened.And it is to 
this degree that all nineteenth-century psychiatry really 
converges on Freud, the first man to accept in all its seriousness 
the reality of the physician-patient couple, the first to consent 
not to look away nor to investigate elsewhere, the first not to 
attempt to hide it in a psychiatric theory that more or less 
harmonized with the rest of medical knowledge; the first to 
follow its consequences with absolute rigor.Freud demystified all 
the other asylum structures: he abolished silence and observation, 
he eliminated madness’s recognition of itself in the mirror of its 
own spectacle, he silenced the instances of condemnation.
