on the other hand he exploited the structure that enveloped the 
medical personage; he amplified its thaumaturgical virtues, 
preparing for its omnipotence a quasi-divine status.He focussed 
upon this single presence—concealed behind the patient and 
above him, in an absence that is also a total presence—all the 
powers that had been distributed in the collective existence of the 
asylum; he transformed this into an absolute Observation, a pure 
and circumspect Silence, a Judge who punishes and rewards in a 
judgment that does not even condescend to language; he made it 
the Mirror in which madness, in an almost motionless 
movement, clings to and casts off itself.To the doctor, Freud transferred all the structures Pinel and 
Tuke had set up within confinement.He did deliver the patient 
from the existence of the asylum within which his “liberators” 
had alienated him; but he did not deliver him from what was 
essential in this existence; he regrouped its powers, extended 
them to the maximum by uniting them in the doctor s hands; he 
created the psychoanalytical situation where, by an inspired 
short-circuit, alienation becomes disalienating because, in the 
doctor, it becomes a subject.The doctor, as an alienating figure, remains the key to 
psychoanalysis.
