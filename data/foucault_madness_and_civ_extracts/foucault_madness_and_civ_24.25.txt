The man in the tricorne is not mad because he 
has stuck an old hat upon his nakedness; but within this 
madman in a hat rises—by the inarticulate power of his muscular 
body, of his savage and marvelously unconstricted youth—a 
human presence already liberated and somehow free since the 
beginning of time, by his birthright.The Madhouse is less 
concerned with madness and those strange faces one finds 
elsewhere in the Caprichos , moreover, than with the vast 
monotony of these new bodies, shown in all their vigor, and 
whose gestures, if they invoke their dreams, celebrate especially 
their dark freedom: its language is close to the world of Pinel.The Goya of the Disparates and the Quinta del Sordo 
addresses himself to another madness.Not that of madmen cast 
into prison, but that of man cast into darkness.Does Goya not 
link us, by memory, with the old world of enchantments, of 
fantastic rides, of witches perched on the branches of dead trees?
