The branch on which these witches jabber—out of what 
tree does it grow?Does it fly?Toward what sabbath, and what 
clearing?Nothing in all this deals with a world, neither this one 
nor any other.It is indeed a question of that Sleep of Reason 
which Goya, in 1797, had already made the first image of the 
“universal idiom”; it is a question of a night which is doubtless 
that of classical unreason, that triple night into which Orestes 
sank.
