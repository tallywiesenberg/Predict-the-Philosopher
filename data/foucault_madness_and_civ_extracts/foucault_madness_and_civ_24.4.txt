But in that night, man communicates with what is deepest 
in himself, and with what is most solitary.The desert of Boschâ€™s 
Saint Anthony was infinitely populous; and even if it was a 
product of her imagination, the landscape that Dulle Griet 
moved through was marked by a whole human language.Goya s 
Monk, with that hot beast against his back, its paws on his 
shoulders and its mouth panting at his ear, remains alone: no 
secret is revealed.All that is present is the most internal, and at 
the same time the most savagely free, of forces: the power which 
hacks apart the bodies in the Gran Disparate, which breaks free 
and assaults our eyes in the Raging Madness.Beyond that point, 
the faces themselves decompose; this is no longer the madness of 
the Caprichos , which tied on masks truer than the truth of faces; 
this is a madness beneath the mask, a madness that eats away 
faces, corrodes features; there are no longer eyes or mouths, but 
glances shot from nowhere and staring at nothing (as in the 
Witches Sabbath ); or screams from black holes (as in the 
Pilgrimage of Saint Isidore).
