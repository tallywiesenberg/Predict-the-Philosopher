the experience of its contemporaries, does it not transmit—to 
those able to receive it, to Nietzsche and to Artaud—those barely 
audible voices of classical unreason, in which it was always a 
question of nothingness and night, but amplifying them now to 
shrieks and frenzy?But giving them for the first time an 
expression, a droit de cite , and a hold on Western culture which 
makes possible all contestations, as well as total contestation?
