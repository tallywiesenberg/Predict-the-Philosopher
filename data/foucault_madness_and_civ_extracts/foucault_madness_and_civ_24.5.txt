But 
restoring their primitive savagery?Sade’s calm, patient language also gathers up the final words 
of unreason and also gives them, for the future, a remoter 
meaning.Between Goyas broken drawings and that 
uninterrupted stream of words continuing from the first volume 
of Justine to the tenth of Juliette , there is doubtless nothing in 
common except a certain movement that retraces the course of 
contemporary lyricism, drying up its sources, rediscovering the 
secret of unreason s nothingness.Within the chateau where Sade’s hero confines himself, 
within the convents, the forests, the dungeons where he endlessly 
pursues the agony of his victims, it seems at first glance that 
nature can act with utter freedom.There man rediscovers a truth 
he had forgotten, though it was manifest: what desire can be 
contrary to nature, since it was given to man by nature itself?
