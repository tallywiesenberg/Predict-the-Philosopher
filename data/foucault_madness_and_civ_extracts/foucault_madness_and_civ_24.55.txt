madness of desire, insane murders, the most unreasonable 
passions—all are wisdom and reason, since they are a part of the 
order of nature.Everything that morality and religion, 
everything that a clumsy society has stifled in man, revives in the 
castle of murders.There man is finally attuned to his own 
nature; or rather, by an ethic peculiar to this strange 
confinement, man must scrupulously maintain, without 
deviation, his fidelity to nature: a strict task, a total enterprise: 
“You will know nothing unless you have known everything; if 
you are timid enough to stop with Nature, she will escape you 
forever.”!Conversely, if man has wounded or changed nature, it 
is man’s task to repair the damage through the mathematics of a 
sovereign vengeance: “Nature caused us all to be born equal; if 
fate is pleased to disturb this plan of the general law, it is our 
responsibility to correct its caprice, and to repair by our attention 
the usurpations of the stronger.”^ The slowness of revenge, like 
the insolence of desire, belongs to nature.
