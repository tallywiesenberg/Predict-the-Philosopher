There is nothing that 
the madness of men invents which is not either nature made 
manifest or nature restored.But this is only the first phase of Sade’s thought: the ironic 
justification, both rational and lyrical, the gigantic pastiche, of 
Rousseau.Beyond this demonstration-by-absurdity of the 
inanity of contemporary philosophy, beyond all its verbiage 
about man and nature, the real decisions are still to be made: 
decisions that are also breaks, in which the links between man 
and his natural being disappear.3 The famous Society of the 
Friends of Crime, the project of a Swedish Constitution, once 
we remove their stinging references to the Social Contract and to 
the proposed constitutions for Poland or Corsica, establish 
nothing but the sovereign rigor of subjectivity in the rejection of 
all natural liberty and all natural equality: uncontrolled disposal 
of one member by the other, the unconditional exercise of

violence, the limitless application of the right of death—this 
entire society, whose only link is the very rejection of a link, 
appears to be a dismissal of nature—the only cohesion asked of 
individuals is intended to protect, not a natural existence, but the 
free exercise of sovereignty over and against nature.4 The 
relation established by Rousseau is precisely reversed; sovereignty 
no longer transposes the natural existence; the latter is only an 
object for the sovereign, which permits him to measure his total 
liberty.
