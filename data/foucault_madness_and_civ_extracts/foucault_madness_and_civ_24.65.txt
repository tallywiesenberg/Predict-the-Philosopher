Followed to its logical conclusion, desire leads only in 
appearance to the rediscovery of nature.Actually, for Sade there 
is no return to the natal terrain, no hope that the first rejection of 
social order may surreptitiously become the re-established order 
of happiness, through a dialectic of nature renouncing and thus 
confirming itself.The solitary madness of desire that still for 
Hegel, as for the eighteenth-century philosophers, plunges man 
into a natural world that is immediately resumed in a social 
world, for Sade merely casts man into a void that dominates 
nature in a total absence of proportion and community, into the 
endlessly repeated nonexistence of gratification.The night of 
madness is thus limitless; what might have been supposed to be 
man’s violent nature was only the infinity of non-nature.Here is the source of Sade’s great monotony: as he advances, 
the settings dissolve; the surprises, the incidents, the pathetic or 
dramatic links of the scenes vanish.
