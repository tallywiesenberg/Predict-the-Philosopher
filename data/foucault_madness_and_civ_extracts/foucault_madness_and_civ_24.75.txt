And at this point, when crime can do nothing 
more than drive her from the domain of its sovereignty (Juliette 
expels her from the Chateau de Noirceuil), Nature in her turn, so 
long dominated, scorned, profaned,5 submits entirely to that 
which contradicted her: Nature in turn enters madness, and 
there, in an instant, but for an instant only, restores her 
omnipotence.The storm that is unleashed, the lightning that 
strikes and consumes Justine, is Nature become criminal 
subjectivity.This death that seems to escape from the insane 
domain of Juliette belongs to Nature more profoundly than any 
other; the night of storm, of thunder and lightning, is a sufficient 
sign that Nature is lacerating herself, that she has reached the 
extreme point of her dissension, and that she is revealing in this 
golden flash a sovereignty which is both herself and something 
quite outside herself: the sovereignty of a mad heart that has 
attained, in its solitude, the limits of the world that wounds it, 
that turns it against itself and abolishes it at the moment when to 
have mastered it so well gives it the right to identify itself with 
that world.That lightning-flash which Nature drew from herself 
in order to strike Justine was identical with the long existence of 
Juliette, who would also disappear in solitude, leaving no trace or 
corpse or anything upon which Nature could claim her due.The 
nothingness of unreason, in which the language of Nature had 
died forever, has become a violence of Nature and against 
Nature, to the point of the savage abolition of itself.6 

For Sade as for Goya, unreason continues to watch by night; 
but in this vigil it joins with fresh powers.
