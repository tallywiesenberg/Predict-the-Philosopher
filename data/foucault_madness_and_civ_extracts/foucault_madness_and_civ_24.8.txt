The non-being it once 
was now becomes the power to annihilate.Through Sade and 
Goya, the Western world received the possibility of transcending 
its reason in violence, and of recovering tragic experience beyond 
the promises of dialectic.296 


After Sade and Goya, and since them, unreason has belonged 
to whatever is decisive, for the modern world, in any work of art: 
that is, whatever any work of art contains that is both murderous 
and constraining.The madness of Tasso, the melancholia of Swift, the delirium 
of Rousseau belong to their works, just as these works belong to 
their authors.Here in the texts, there in the lives of the men, the 
same violence spoke, or the same bitterness; visions certainly 
were exchanged; language and delirium interlaced.
