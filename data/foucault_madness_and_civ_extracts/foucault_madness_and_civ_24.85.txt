But further, 
the work of art and madness, in classical experience, were more 
profoundly united at another level: paradoxically, at the point 
where they limited one another.For there existed a region where 
madness challenged the work of art, reduced it ironically, made 
of its iconographic landscape a pathological world of 
hallucinations; that language which was delirium was not a work 
of art.And conversely, delirium was robbed of its meager truth 
as madness if it was called a work of art.But by admitting this 
very fact, there was no reduction of one by the other, but rather 
(remembering Montaigne) a discovery of the central incertitude 
where the work of art is born, at the moment when it stops being 
born and is truly a work of art.In this opposition, to which 
Tasso and Swift bore witness after Lucretius—and which it was 
vain to attempt to separate into lucid intervals and crises—was 
disclosed a distance where the very truth of a work of art raised a 
problem: was it madness, or a work of art?
