The frequency in the 
modern world of works of art that explode out of madness no 
doubt proves nothing about the reason of that world, about the 
meaning of such works, or even about the relations formed and 
broken between the real world and the artists who produced such 
works.And yet this frequency must be taken seriously, as if it 
were the insistence of a question: from the time of Holderlin and 
Nerval, the number of writers, painters, and musicians who have 
“succumbed” to madness has increased; but let us make no 
mistake here; between madness and the work of art, there has 
been no accommodation, no more constant exchange, no 
communication of languages; their opposition is much more 
dangerous than formerly; and their competition now allows no 
quarter; theirs is a game of life and death.Artaud’s madness does 
not slip through the fissures of the work of art; his madness is 
precisely the absence of the work of art , the reiterated presence of 
that absence, its central void experienced and measured in all its 
endless dimensions.Nietzsche’s last cry, proclaiming himself 
both Christ and Dionysos, is not on the border of reason and 
unreason, in the perspective of the work of art, their common 
dream, finally realized and immediately vanishing, of a 
reconciliation of the “shepherds of Arcady and the fishermen of 
Tiberias”; it is the very annihilation of the work of art, the point 
where it becomes impossible and where it must fall silent; the 
hammer has just fallen from the philosopher’s hands.And Van 
Gogh, who did not want to ask “permission from doctors to 
paint pictures,” knew quite well that his work and his madness 
were incompatible.
