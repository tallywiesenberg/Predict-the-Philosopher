it could only be artificial, the market price of such products being 
disproportionate to the cost of manufacture, calculated according 
to the expenses occasioned by confinement itself. 

Measured by their functional value alone, the creation of the 
houses of confinement can be regarded as a failure. Their 
disappearance throughout Europe, at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century, as receiving centers for the indigent and 
prisons of poverty, was to sanction their ultimate failure: a 
transitory and ineffectual remedy, a social precaution clumsily 
formulated by a nascent industrialization. And yet, in this very 
failure, the classical period conducted an irreducible experiment. 
What appears to us today as a clumsy dialectic of production and 
prices then possessed its real meaning as a certain ethical

consciousness of labor, in which the difficulties of the economic 
mechanisms lost their urgency in favor of an affirmation of value. 

In this first phase of the industrial world, labor did not seem 
linked to the problems it was to provoke; it was regarded, on the 
contrary, as a general solution, an infallible panacea, a remedy to 
all forms of poverty. Labor and poverty were located in a simple 
opposition, in inverse proportion to each other. As for that 
power, its special characteristic, of abolishing poverty, labor— 
according to the classical interpretation—possessed it not so 
much by its productive capacity as by a certain force of moral 
enchantment. Labor’s effectiveness was acknowledged because it 
was based on an ethical transcendence. Since the Fall, man had 
accepted labor as a penance and for its power to work 
redemption. It was not a law of nature which forced man to 
work, but the effect of a curse. The earth was innocent of that 
sterility in which it would slumber if man remained idle: “The 
land had not sinned, and if it is accursed, it is by the labor of the 
fallen man who cultivates it; from it no fruit is won, particularly 
the most necessary fruit, save by force and continual labor.”6 

The obligation to work was not linked to any confidence in 
nature; and it was not even through an obscure loyalty that the 
land would reward man’s labor. The theme was constant among 
Catholic thinkers, as among the Protestants, that labor does not 
bear its own fruits. Produce and wealth were not found at the 
term of a dialectic of labor and nature. Here is Calvin’s 
admonition: “Nor do we believe, according as men will be 
vigilant and skillful, according as they will have done their duty 
well, that they can make their land fertile; it is the benediction of 
God which governs all things.” And this danger of a labor which
