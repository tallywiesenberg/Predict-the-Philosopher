Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms 
the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the 
truth of the work of art; it draws the exterior edge, the line of 
dissolution, the contour against the void.Artaud’s oeuvre 
experiences its own absence in madness, but that experience, the 
fresh courage of that ordeal, all those words hurled against a

fundamental absence of language, all that space of physical 
suffering and terror which surrounds or rather coincides with the 
void—that is the work of art itself: the sheer cliff over the abyss 
of the work’s absence.Madness is no longer the space of 
indecision through which it was possible to glimpse the original 
truth of the work of art, but the decision beyond which this truth 
ceases irrevocably, and hangs forever over history.It is of little 
importance on exactly which day in the autumn of 1888 
Nietzsche went mad for good, and after which his texts no 
longer afford philosophy but psychiatry: all of them, including 
the postcard to Strindberg, belong to Nietzsche, and all are 
related to The Birth of Tragedy.But we must not think of this 
continuity in terms of a system, of a thematics, or even of an 
existence: Nietzsche’s madness—that is, the dissolution of his 
thought—is that by which his thought opens out onto the 
modern world.
