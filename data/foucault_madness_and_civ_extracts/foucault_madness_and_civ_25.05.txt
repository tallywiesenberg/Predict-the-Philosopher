What made it impossible makes it immediate for 
us; what took it from Nietzsche offers it to us.This does not 
mean that madness is the only language common to the work of 
art and the modern world (dangers of the pathos of malediction, 
inverse and symmetrical danger of psychoanalyses); but it means 
that, through madness, a work that seems to drown in the world, 
to reveal there its non-sense, and to transfigure itself with the 
features of pathology alone, actually engages within itself the 
worldâ€™s time, masters it, and leads it; by the madness which 
interrupts it, a work of art opens a void, a moment of silence, a 
question without answer, provokes a breach without 
reconciliation where the world is forced to question itself.What 
is necessarily a profanation in the work of art returns to that 
point, and, in the time of that work swamped in madness, the 
world is made aware of its guilt.Henceforth, and through the 
mediation of madness, it is the world that becomes culpable (for 
the first time in the Western world) in relation to the work of 
art; it is now arraigned by the work of art, obliged to order itself 
by its language, compelled by it to a task of recognition, of

reparation, to the task of restoring reason from that unreason and 
to that unreason.The madness in which the work of art is 
engulfed is the space of our enterprise, it is the endless path to 
fulfillment, it is our mixed vocation of apostle and exegete.
