This 
is why it makes little difference when the first voice of madness 
insinuated itself into Nietzsche’s pride, into Van Gogh’s 
humility.There is no madness except as the final instant of the 
work of art—the work endlessly drives madness to its limits; 
where thereis a work of art , there is no madness ; and yet madness is 
contemporary with the work of art, since it inaugurates the time 
of its truth.The moment when, together, the work of art and 
madness are born and fulfilled is the beginning of the time when 
the world finds itself arraigned by that work of art and 
responsible before it for what it is.Ruse and new triumph of madness: the world that thought to 
measure and justify madness through psychology must justify 
itself before madness, since in its struggles and agonies it 
measures itself by the excess of works like those of Nietzsche, of 
Van Gogh, of Artaud.And nothing in itself, especially not what 
it can know of madness, assures the world that it is justified by 
such works of madness.
