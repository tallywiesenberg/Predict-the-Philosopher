From a spiritual point of view, poverty at the end of the 
sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century was 
experienced as an apocalyptic threat.“One of the most 
evident signs that the coming of the Son of God and the end 
of time are at hand is the extreme of both spiritual and 
temporal poverty to which the world is reduced.These are 
evil days ... afflictions have multiplied because of the 
multitude of transgressions, pain being the inseparable 
shadow of evil.” (Jean-Pierre Camus, De la mendicite legitime 
des pauvres [Douai, 1634], pp.3-4.)5.
