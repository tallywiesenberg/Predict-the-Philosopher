or profit. 

It was in a certain experience of labor that the indissociably 
economic and moral demand for confinement was formulated. 
Between labor and idleness in the classical world ran a line of 
demarcation that replaced the exclusion of leprosy. The asylum 
was substituted for the lazar house, in the geography of haunted 
places as in the landscape of the moral universe. The old rites of 
excommunication were revived, but in the world of production 
and commerce. It was in these places of doomed and despised 
idleness, in this space invented by a society which had derived an 
ethical transcendence from the law of work, that madness would 
appear and soon expand until it had annexed them. A day was to 
come when it could possess these sterile reaches of idleness by a 
sort of very old and very dim right of inheritance. The 
nineteenth century would consent, would even insist that to the 
mad and to them alone be transferred these lands on which, a 
hundred and fifty years before, men had sought to pen the poor, 
the vagabond, the unemployed. 

It is not immaterial that madmen were included in the 
proscription of idleness. From its origin, they would have their 
place beside the poor, deserving or not, and the idle, voluntary or 
not. Like them, they would be subject to the rules of forced 
labor. More than once, in fact, they figured in their singular 
fashion within this uniform constraint. In the workshops in 
which they were interned, they distinguished themselves by their 
inability to work and to follow the rhythms of collective life. The 
necessity, discovered in the eighteenth century, to provide a 
special regime for the insane, and the great crisis of confinement 
that shortly preceded the Revolution, are linked to the experience 
of madness available in the universal necessity of labor. Men did 
not wait until the seventeenth century to “shut up” the mad, but

it was in this period that they began to “confine” or “intern” 
them, along with an entire population with whom their kinship 
was recognized. Until the Renaissance, the sensibility to madness 
was linked to the presence of imaginary transcendences. In the 
classical age, for the first time, madness was perceived through a 
condemnation of idleness and in a social immanence guaranteed 
by the community of labor. This community acquired an ethical 
power of segregation, which permitted it to eject, as into another 
world, all forms of social uselessness. It was in this other world , 
encircled by the sacred powers of labor, that madness would 
assume the status we now attribute to it. If there is, in classical
