keep them from the slavery of sin, from being eternally damned, 
and to give them means to rejoice in a perfect contentment in 
this world and in the next; they will do all they can to worship, in 
this world, Divine Providence.... Experience convinces us only 
too unhappily that the source of the misrule triumphant today 
among the young lies entirely in the lack of instruction and of 
obedience in spiritual matters, since they much prefer to follow 
their evil inclinations than the holy inspiration of God and the 
charitable advice of their parents.”11 Therefore the pensioners 
must be delivered from a world which, for their weakness, is only 
an invitation to sin, must be recalled to a solitude where they will 
have as companions only their “guardian angels” incarnate in the 
daily presence of their warders: these latter, in fact, “render them 
the same good offices that their guardian angels perform for 
them invisibly: namely, instruct them, console them, and procure 
their salvation.” In the houses of La Charite, the greatest 
attention was paid to this ordering of life and conscience, which 
throughout the eighteenth century would more and more clearly 
appear as the raison d'etre of confinement. In 1765, new 
regulations were established for the Charite of Chateau-Thierry; 
it was made quite clear that “the Prior will visit all the prisoners 
at least once a week, one after the other, and separately, to 
console them, to exhort them to better conduct, and to assure 
himself that they are treated as they should be; the subordinate 
officer will do this every day.” 

All these prisons of moral order might have borne the motto 
which Howard could still read on the one in Mainz: “If wild 
beasts can be broken to the yoke, it must not be despaired of 
correcting the man who has strayed.” For the Catholic Church, 
as in the Protestant countries, confinement represents, in the 
form of an authoritarian model, the myth of social happiness: a 
police whose order will be entirely transparent to the principles 
of religion, and a religion whose requirements will be satisfied,

without restrictions, by the regulations of the police and the 
constraints with which it can be armed. There is, in these 
institutions, an attempt of a kind to demonstrate that order may 
be adequate to virtue. In this sense, “confinement” conceals both 
a metaphysics of government and a politics of religion; it is 
situated, as an effort of tyrannical synthesis, in the vast space 
separating the garden of God and the cities which men, driven 
from paradise, have built with their own hands. The house of 
confinement in the classical age constitutes the densest symbol of
