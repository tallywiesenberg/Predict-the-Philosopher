It is a question of time turned back, not of 
repetition in the strict sense.Psychoanalysis, which has tried 
to confront madness and unreason again, has found itself 
faced with this problem of time; fixation, death-wish, 
collective unconscious, archetype define more or less happily 
this heterogeneity of two temporal structures: that which is 
proper to the experience of Unreason and to the knowledge 
it envelops; that which is proper to the knowledge of 
madness, and to the science it authorizes.10.Johann Christoph Spurzheim, Observations sur la folie (Paris,
