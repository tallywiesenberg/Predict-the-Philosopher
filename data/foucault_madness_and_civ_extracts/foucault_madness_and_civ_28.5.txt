that “police” which conceived of itself as the civil equivalent of 
religion for the edification of a perfect city. 

Confinement was an institutional creation peculiar to the 
seventeenth century. It acquired from the first an importance 
that left it no rapport with imprisonment as practiced in the 
Middle Ages. As an economic measure and a social precaution, it 
had the value of inventiveness. But in the history of unreason, it 
marked a decisive event: the moment when madness was 
perceived on the social horizon of poverty, of incapacity for 
work, of inability to integrate with the group; the moment when 
madness began to rank among the problems of the city. The new 
meanings assigned to poverty, the importance given to the 
obligation to work, and all the ethical values that are linked to 
labor, ultimately determined the experience of madness and 
inflected its course. 

A sensibility was born which had drawn a line and laid a 
cornerstone, and which chose—only to banish. The concrete 
space of classical society reserved a neutral region, a blank page 
where the real life of the city was suspended; here, order no 
longer freely confronted disorder, reason no longer tried to make 
its own way among all that might evade or seek to deny it. Here 
reason reigned in the pure state, in a triumph arranged for it in 
advance over a frenzied unreason. Madness was thus torn from 
that imaginary freedom which still allowed it to flourish on the

Renaissance horizon. Not so long ago, it had floundered about in 
broad daylight: in King Lear , in Don Quixote. But in less than a 
half-century, it had been sequestered and, in the fortress of 
confinement, bound to Reason, to the rules of morality and to 
their monotonous nights.
