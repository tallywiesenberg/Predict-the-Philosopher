THE INSANE 


FROM the creation of the Hopital General, from the opening, 
in Germany and in England, of the first houses of correction, 
and until the end of the eighteenth century, the age of reason 
confined. It confined the debauched, spendthrift fathers, 
prodigal sons, blasphemers, men who “seek to undo themselves,” 
libertines. And through these parallels, these strange 
complicities, the age sketched the profile of its own experience of 
unreason. 

But in each of these cities, we find an entire population of 
madness as well. One-tenth of all the arrests made in Paris for 
the Hopital General concern “the insane,” “demented” men, 
individuals of “wandering mind,” and “persons who have become 
completely mad.” Between these and the others, no sign of a 
differentiation. Judging from the registries, the same sensibility 
appears to collect them, the same gestures to set them apart. We 
leave it to medical archaeology to determine whether or not a 
man was sick, criminal, or insane who was admitted to the 
hospital for “derangement of morals,” or because he had 
“mistreated his wife” and tried several times to kill himself. 

Yet it must not be forgotten that the “insane” had as such a 
particular place in the world of confinement. Their status was 
not merely that of prisoners. In the general sensibility to 
unreason, there appeared to be a special modulation which 
concerned madness proper, and was addressed to those called, 
without exact semantic distinction, insane, alienated, deranged, 
demented, extravagant. 

This particular form of sensibility traces the features proper to 
madness in the world of unreason. It is primarily concerned with 
scandal. In its most general form, confinement is explained, or at 
least justified, by the desire to avoid scandal. It even signifies

thereby an important change in the consciousness of evil. The 
Renaissance had freely allowed the forms of unreason to come 
out into the light of day; public outrage gave evil the powers of 
example and redemption. Gilles de Rais, accused, in the fifteenth 
century, of having been and of being “a heretic, an apostate, a 
sorcerer, a sodomite, an invoker of evil spirits, a soothsayer, a 
slayer of innocents, an idolater, working evil by deviation from 
the faith,” ended by himself admitting to crimes “sufficient to
