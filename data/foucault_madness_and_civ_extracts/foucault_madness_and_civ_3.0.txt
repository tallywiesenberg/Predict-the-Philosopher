Whereas according to Hugues de Saint-Victor the 
genealogical tree of the Vices, that of the Old Adam, had pride 
as its root, Folly now leads the joyous throng of all human 
weaknesses.Uncontested coryphaeus, she guides them, sweeps 
them on, and names them: â€œRecognize them here, in the group 
of my companions.... She whose brows are drawn is Philautia 
(Self-Love).She whom you see laugh with her eyes and applaud 
with her hands is Colacia (Flattery).She who seems half asleep is 
Lethe (Forgetfulness).She who leans upon her elbows and folds 
her hands is Misoponia (Sloth).
