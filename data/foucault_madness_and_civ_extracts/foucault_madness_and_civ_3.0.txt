action that divides madness, and not the science elaborated once this 
division is made and calm restored. What is originative is the caesura 
that establishes the distance between reason and non-reason; reasons 
subjugation of non-reason, wresting from it its truth as madness, 
crime, or disease, derives explicitly from this point. Hence we must 
speak of that initial dispute without assuming a victory, or the right 
to a victory; we must speak of those actions re-examined in history, 
leaving in abeyance all that may figure as a conclusion, as a refuge in 
truth; we shall have to speak of this act of scission, of this distance set,

of this void instituted between reason and what is not reason, without 
ever relying upon thefulfillment of what it claims to be. 

Then, and then only, can we determine the realm in which the 
man of madness and the man of reason,, moving apart, are not yet 
disjunct; and in an incipient and very crude language, antedating 
that of science, begin the dialogue of their breach, testifying in a 
fugitive way that they still speak to each other. Here madness and 
non-madness, reason and non-reason are inextricably involved: 
inseparable at the moment when they do not yet exist, and existing for 
each other , in relation to each other , in the exchange which separates 
them. 

In the serene world of mental illness, modern man no longer 
communicates with the madman: on one hand, the man of reason 
delegates the physician to madness, thereby authorizing a relation only 
through the abstract universality of disease; on the other , the man oj 
madness communicates with society only by the intermediary of an 
equally abstract reason which is order, physical and moral constraint, 
the anonymous pressure of the group, the requirements of conformity. 
As for a common language, there is no such thing; or rather, there is no 
such thing any longer; the constitution of madness as a mental illness, 
at the end of the eighteenth century, affords the evidence of a broken 
dialogue, posits the separation as already effected, and thrusts into 
oblivion all those stammered, imperfect words withoutfixed syntax in 
which the exchange between madness and reason was made. The 
language of psychiatry, which is a monologue of reason about 
madness, has been established only on the basis of such a silence. 

I have not tried to write the history of that language, but rather the 
archaeology of that silence. 

The Greeks had a relation to something that they called '$€>'•<;■. This 
relation was not merely one of condemnation; the existence oj 
Thrasymachus or of Callicles suffices to prove it, even if their language
