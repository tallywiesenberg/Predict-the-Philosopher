The first canto of Brant’s poem is devoted 
to books and scholars; and in the engraving which illustrates this 
passage in the Latin edition of 1497, we see enthroned upon his 
bristling cathedra of books the Magister who wears behind his 
doctoral cap a fool’s cap sewn with bells.Erasmus, in his dance 
of fools, reserves a large place for scholars: after the 
Grammarians, the Poets, Rhetoricians, and Writers, come the 
Jurists; after them, the “Philosophers respectable in beard and 
mantle”; finally the numberless troop of the Theologians.But if 
knowledge is so important in madness, it is not because the latter 
can control the secrets of knowledge; on the contrary, madness is 
the punishment of a disorderly and useless science.If madness is 
the truth of knowledge, it is because knowledge is absurd, and 
instead of addressing itself to the great book of experience, loses 
its way in the dust of books and in idle debate; learning becomes 
madness through the very excess of false learning.0 vos doctores, qui grandia normina fertis 
Respicite antiquos patris, jurisqueperitos.
