Whatever obscure cosmic manifestation 
there was in madness as seen by Bosch is wiped out in Erasmus; 
madness no longer lies in wait for mankind at the four corners of 
the earth; it insinuates itself within man, or rather it is a subtle 
rapport that man maintains with himself.The mythological 
personification of madness in Erasmus is only a literary device.In fact, only “follies” exist—human forms of madness: “I count as 
many images as there are men”; one need only glance at states, 
even the wisest and best governed: “So many forms of madness 
abound there, and each day sees so many new ones born, that a 
thousand Democrituses would not suffice to mock them.” There 
is no madness but that which is in every man, since it is man 
who constitutes madness in the attachment he bears for himself 
and by the illusions he entertains.Philautia is the first figure 
Folly leads out in her dance, but that is because they are linked 
by a privileged relation: self-attachment is the first sign of 
madness, but it is because man is attached to himself that he 
accepts error as truth, lies as reality, violence and ugliness as 
beauty and justice.“This man, uglier than a monkey, imagines 
himself handsome as Nereus; that one thinks he is Euclid 
because he has traced three lines with a compass; that other one 
thinks he can sing like Hermogenes, whereas he is the ass before 
the lyre, and his voice sounds as false as that of the rooster 
pecking his hen.” In this delusive attachment to himself, man 
generates his madness like a mirage.
