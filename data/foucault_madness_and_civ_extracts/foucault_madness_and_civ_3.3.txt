The symbol of madness will 
henceforth be that mirror which, without reflecting anything 
real, will secretly offer the man who observes himself in it the

dream of his own presumption.Madness deals not so much with 
truth and the world, as with man and whatever truth about 
himself he is able to perceive.It thus gives access to a completely moral universe.Evil is not 
punishment or the end of time, but only fault and flaw.A 
hundred and sixteen cantos of Brantâ€™s poem are devoted to 
portraits of the insane passengers on the Ship: there are misers, 
slanderers, drunkards; there are those who indulge in disorder 
and debauchery; those who interpret the Scriptures falsely; those 
who practice adultery.
