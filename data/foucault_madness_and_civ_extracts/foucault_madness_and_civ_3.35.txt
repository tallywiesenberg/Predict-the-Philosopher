Locher, Brant’s translator, notes in his 
Latin preface the purpose and meaning of the work; it is 
concerned to teach “what evil there may be, what good; what 
vices; whither virtue, whither error may lead”; and this while 
castigating, according to the wickedness each man is guilty of, 
“the unholy, the proud, the greedy, the extravagant, the 
debauched, the voluptuous, the quick-tempered, the gluttonous, 
the voracious, the envious, the poisoners, the faith-breakers” ... 
in short, all that man has been able to invent in the way of 
irregularities in his conduct.In the domain of literary and philosophic expression, the 
experience of madness in the fifteenth century generally takes the 
form of moral satire.Nothing suggests those great threats of 
invasion that haunted the imagination of the painters.On the 
contrary, great pains are taken to ward it off; one does not speak 
of such things.Erasmus turns our gaze from that insanity “which 
the Furies let slip from hell, each time they release their 
serpents”; it is not these insane forms that he has chosen to 
praise, but the “sweet illusion” that frees the soul from “its 
painful cares and returns it to the various forms of sensuality.” 
This calm world is easily mastered; it readily yields its naive 
mysteries to the eyes of the wise man, and the latter, by laughter, 
always keeps his distance.
