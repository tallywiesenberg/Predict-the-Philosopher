Whereas Bosch, Brueghel, and Diirer 
were terribly earth-bound spectators, implicated in that madness 
they saw surging around them, Erasmus observes it from far

enough away to be out of danger; he observes it from the heights 
of his Olympus, and if he sings its praises, it is because he can 
laugh at it with the inextinguishable laughter of the Gods.For 
the madness of men is a divine spectacle: “In fact, could one 
make observations from the Moon, as did Menippus, 
considering the numberless agitations of the Earth, one would 
think one saw a swarm of flies or gnats fighting among 
themselves, struggling and laying traps, stealing from one 
another, playing, gamboling, falling, and dying, and one would 
not believe the troubles, the tragedies that were produced by such 
a minute animalcule destined to perish so shortly.” Madness is 
no longer the familiar foreignness of the world; it is merely a 
commonplace spectacle for the foreign spectator; no longer a 
figure of the cosmos , but a characteristic of the aevum.But a new enterprise was being undertaken that would abolish 
the tragic experience of madness in a critical consciousness.Let 
us ignore this phenomenon for the moment and consider 
indiscriminately those figures to be found in Don Quixote as well 
as in Scudery’s novels, in King Lear as well as in the theater of 
Jean de Rotrou or Tristan fHermite.Let us begin with the most important, and the most durable— 
since the eighteenth century will still recognize its only just 
erased forms: madness by romantic identification.
