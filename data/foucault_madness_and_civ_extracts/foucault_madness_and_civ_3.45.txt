Its features have 
been fixed once and for all by Cervantes.But the theme is 
tirelessly repeated: direct adaptations (the Don Quichotte of 
Guerin de Bouscal was performed in 1639; two years later, he

of delirium.“We owe the invention of the arts to deranged 
imaginations; the Caprice of Painters, Poets, and Musicians is 
only a name moderated in civility to express their Madness .”8 
Madness, in which the values of another age, another art, 
another morality are called into question, but which also reflects 
—blurred and disturbed, strangely compromised by one another 
in a common chimera—all the forms, even the most remote, of 
the human imagination.
