Immediately following this first form: the madness of vain 
presumption.But it is not with a literary model that the madman 
identifies; it is with himself, and by means of a delusive 
attachment that enables him to grant himself all the qualities, all 
the virtues or powers he lacks.He inherits the old Philautia of 
Erasmus.Poor, he is rich; ugly, he admires himself; with chains 
still on his feet, he takes himself for God.Such a one was 
Osuma’s master of arts who believed he was Neptune.9 Such is 
the ridiculous fate of the seven characters of Desmarets de Saint- 
Sorlin’s Les Visionnaires,of Chateaufort in Cyrano de Bergerac’s 
Le Pedant joue , of M. de Richesource in Sir Politik.
