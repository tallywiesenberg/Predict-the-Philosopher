But it has still other powers: the 
punishment it inflicts multiplies by nature insofar as, by 
punishing itself, it unveils the truth.The justification of this 
madness is that it is truthful.Truthful since the sufferer already 
experiences, in the vain whirlwind of his hallucinations, what will 
for all eternity be the pain of his punishment: Eraste, in 
Corneille’s Melite , sees himself already pursued by the 
Eumenides and condemned by Minos.Truthful, too, because the 
crime hidden from all eyes dawns like day in the night of this 
strange punishment; madness, in its wild, untamable words, 
proclaims its own meaning; in its chimeras, it utters its secret 
truth; its cries speak for its conscience.Thus Lady Macbeth’s 
delirium reveals to those who “have known what they should 
not” words long uttered only to “dead pillows.” 

Then the last type of madness: that of desperate passion.
