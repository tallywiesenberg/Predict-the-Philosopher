Love 
disappointed in its excess, and especially love deceived by the 
fatality of death, has no other recourse but madness.As long as 
there was an object, mad love was more love than madness; left 
to itself, it pursues itself in the void of delirium.Punishment of a 
passion too abjectly abandoned to its violence?No doubt; but 
this punishment is also a relief; it spreads, over the irreparable 
absence, the mercy of imaginary presences; it recovers, in the 
paradox of innocent joy or in the heroism of senseless pursuits, 
the vanished form.If it leads to death, it is a death in which the 
lovers will never be separated again.
