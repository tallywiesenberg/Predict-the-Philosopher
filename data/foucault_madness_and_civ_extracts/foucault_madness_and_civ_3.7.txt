This is Opheliaâ€™s last song, 
this is the delirium of Ariste in La Folie du sage.But above all, 
this is the bitter and sweet madness of King Lear.In Shakespeare, madness is allied to death and murder; in 
Cervantes, images are controlled by the presumption and the 
complacencies of the imaginary.These are supreme models 
whose imitators deflect and disarm them.Doubtless, both testify 
more to a tragic experience of madness appearing in the fifteenth 
century, than to a critical and moral experience of Unreason 
developing in their own epoch.
