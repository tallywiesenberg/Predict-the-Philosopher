Madness, in its vain words, is not vanity; the 
void that fills it is a “disease beyond my practice,” as the doctor 
says about Lady Macbeth; it is already the plenitude of death; a 
madness that has no need of a physician, but only of divine 
mercy.The sweet joy Ophelia finally regains reconciles her with 
no happiness; her mad song is as close to the essential as the “cry 
of women” that announces through the corridors of Macbeth’s 
castle that “the Queen is dead.” Certainly Don Quixote’s death 
occurs in a peaceful landscape, which at the last moment has 
rejoined reason and truth.Suddenly the Knight’s madness has 
grown conscious of itself, and in his own eyes trickles out in 
nonsense.But is this sudden wisdom of his folly anything but “a 
new madness that had just come into his head”?The 
equivocation is endlessly reversible and cannot be resolved, 
ultimately, except by death itself.
