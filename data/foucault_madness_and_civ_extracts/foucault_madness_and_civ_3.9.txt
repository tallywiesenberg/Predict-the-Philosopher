Though Ariste, in Tristan l’Hermite’s La Folk du sage , goes mad 
at the news of his daughter s death, the fact is that she is not 
really dead; when Eraste, in Melite , sees himself pursued by the 
Eumenides and dragged before Minos, it is for a double crime 
which he might have committed, which he might have wanted to 
commit, but which in fact has not occasioned any real death.Madness is deprived of its dramatic seriousness; it is punishment 
or despair only in the dimension of error.Its dramatic function 
exists only insofar as we are concerned with a false drama; a 
chimerical form in which only supposed faults, illusory murders, 
ephemeral disappearances are involved.Yet this absence of seriousness does not keep madness from 
being essential—even more essential than it had been, for if it 
brings illusion to its climax, it is from this point that illusion is 
undone.In the madness in which his error has enveloped him, 
the character involuntarily begins to unravel the web.
