when the danger of scandal is past and the honor of families or 
of the Church can no longer be sullied. The Abbe Bargede had 
been confined for a long time; never, despite his requests, had his 
release been authorized; but now old age and infirmity had made 
scandal impossible. “And besides, his paralysis persists,” writes 
d’Argenson; “he can neither write nor sign his name; I think that 
there would be justice and charity in setting him free.” All those 
forms of evil that border on unreason must be thrust into secrecy. 
Classicism felt a shame in the presence of the inhuman that the 
Renaissance had never experienced. 

Yet there is one exception in this consignment to secrecy: that 
which is made for madmen.3 It was doubtless a very old custom 
of the Middle Ages to display the insane. In certain of the 
Narrturmer in Germany, barred windows had been installed 
which permitted those outside to observe the madmen chained 
within. They thus constituted a spectacle at the city gates. The

strange fact is that this custom did not disappear once the doors 
of the asylums closed, but that on the contrary it then developed, 
assuming in Paris and London almost an institutional character. 
As late as 1815, if a report presented in the House of Commons 
is to be believed, the hospital of Bethlehem exhibited lunatics for 
a penny, every Sunday. Now the annual revenue from these 
exhibitions amounted to almost four hundred pounds; which 
suggests the astonishingly high number of 96,000 visits a year.4 
In France, the excursion to Bicetre and the display of the insane 
remained until the Revolution one of the Sunday distractions for 
the Left Bank bourgeoisie. Mirabeau reports in his Observations 
dun voyageur anglais that the madmen at Bicetre were shown 
“like curious animals, to the first simpleton willing to pay a coin.” 
One went to see the keeper display the madmen the way the 
trainer at the Fair of Saint-Germain put the monkeys through 
their tricks.5 Certain attendants were well known for their ability 
to make the mad perform dances and acrobatics, with a few flicks 
of the whip. The only extenuation to be found at the end of the 
eighteenth century was that the mad were allowed to exhibit the 
mad, as if it were the responsibility of madness to testify to its 
own nature. “Let us not slander human nature. The English 
traveler is right to regard the office of exhibiting madmen as 
beyond the most hardened humanity. We have already said so. 
But all dilemmas afford a remedy. It is the madmen themselves 
who are entrusted in their lucid intervals with displaying their 
companions, who, in their turn, return the favor. Thus the 
keepers of these unfortunate creatures enjoy the profits that the 
spectacle affords, without indulging in a heartlessness to which,
