madness was present everywhere and mingled with every 
experience by its images or its dangers. During the classical 
period, madness was shown, but on the other side of bars; if 
present, it was at a distance, under the eyes of a reason that no 
longer felt any relation to it and that would not compromise 
itself by too close a resemblance. Madness had become a thing to 
look at: no longer a monster inside oneself, but an animal with 
strange mechanisms, a bestiality from which man had long since 
been suppressed. “I can easily conceive of a man without hands, 
feet, head (for it is only experience which teaches us that the 
head is more necessary than the feet). But I cannot conceive of 
man without thought; that would be a stone or a brute.”8 

In his Report on the Care of the Insane Desportes describes the 
cells of Bicetre as they were at the end of the eighteenth century: 
“The unfortunate whose entire furniture consisted of this straw 
pallet, lying with his head, feet, and body pressed against the 
wall, could not enjoy sleep without being soaked by the water 
that trickled from that mass of stone.” As for the cells of La 
Salpetriere, what made “the place more miserable and often more 
fatal, was that in winter, when the waters of the Seine rose, those 
cells situated at the level of the sewers became not only more 
unhealthy, but worse still, a refuge for a swarm of huge rats, 
which during the night attacked the unfortunates confined there 
and bit them wherever they could reach them; madwomen have 
been found with feet, hands, and faces torn by bites which are 
often dangerous and from which several have died.” But these 
were the dungeons and cells long reserved for the most 
dangerous and most violent of the insane. If they were calmer, 
and if no one had anything to fear from them, they were 
crammed into wards of varying size. One of Samuel Tuke’s most 
active disciples, Godfrey Higgins, had obtained the right, which 
cost him twenty pounds, to visit the asylum of York as a 
volunteer inspector. In the course of a visit, he discovered a door

that had been carefully concealed and found behind it a room, 
not eight feet on a side, which thirteen women occupied during 
the night; by day, they lived in a room scarcely larger. 

On the other hand, when the insane were particularly 
dangerous, they were constrained by a system which was 
doubtless not of a punitive nature, but simply intended to fix 
within narrow limits the physical locus of a raging frenzy. 
Sufferers were generally chained to the walls and to the beds. At 
Bethlehem, violent madwomen were chained by the ankles to the 
wall of a long gallery; their only garment was a homespun dress.
