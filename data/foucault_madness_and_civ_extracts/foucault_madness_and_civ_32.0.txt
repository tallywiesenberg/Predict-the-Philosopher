When Fran^ois-Emmanuel Fodere arrived at the hospital of 
Strasbourg in 1814, he found a kind of human stable, 
constructed with great care and skill: “for troublesome madmen 
and those who dirtied themselves, a kind of cage, or wooden 
closet, which could at the most contain one man of middle 
height, had been devised at the ends of the great wards.” These 
cages had gratings for floors, and did not rest on the ground but 
were raised about fifteen centimeters. Over these gratings was 
thrown a little straw “upon which the madman lay, naked or 
nearly so, took his meals, and deposited his excrement.” 

This, to be sure, is a whole security system against the violence 
of the insane and the explosion of their fury. Such outbursts are 
regarded chiefly as a social danger. But what is most important is 
that it is conceived in terms of an animal freedom. The negative 
fact that “the madman is not treated like a human being” has a

very positive content: this inhuman indifference actually has an 
obsessional value: it is rooted in the old fears which since 
antiquity, and especially since the Middle Ages, have given the 
animal world its familiar strangeness, its menacing marvels, its 
entire weight of dumb anxiety. Yet this animal fear which 
accompanies, with all its imaginary landscape, the perception of 
madness, no longer has the same meaning it had two or three 
centuries earlier: animal metamorphosis is no longer the visible 
sign of infernal powers, nor the result of a diabolic alchemy of 
unreason. The animal in man no longer has any value as the sign 
of a Beyond; it has become his madness, without relation to 
anything but itself: his madness in the state of nature. The 
animality that rages in madness dispossesses man of what is 
specifically human in him; not in order to deliver him over to 
other powers, but simply to establish him at the zero degree of 
his own nature. For classicism, madness in its ultimate form is 
man in immediate relation to his animality, without other 
reference, without any recourse. 

The day would come when from an evolutionary perspective 
this presence of animality in madness would be considered as the 
sign—indeed, as the very essence—of disease. In the classical 
period, on the contrary, it manifested the very fact that the 
madman was not a sick man. Animality, in fact, protected the 
lunatic from whatever might be fragile, precarious, or sickly in 
man. The animal solidity of madness, and that density it borrows 
from the blind world of beasts, inured the madman to hunger, 
heat, cold, pain. It was common knowledge until the end of the
