dialectic whose movement explains all these “inhuman” practices 
of confinement, the free animality of madness was tamed only by 
such discipline whose meaning was not to raise the bestial to the 
human, but to restore man to what was purely animal within 
him. Madness discloses a secret of animality which is its own 
truth, and in which, in some way, it is reabsorbed. Toward the 
middle of the eighteenth century, a farmer in the north of 
Scotland had his hour of fame. He was said to possess the art of 
curing insanity. Pinel notes in passing that this Gregory had the 
physique of a Hercules: “His method consisted in forcing the 
insane to perform the most difficult tasks of farming, in using 
them as beasts of burden, as servants, in reducing them to an 
ultimate obedience with a barrage of blows at the least act of 
revolt.” In the reduction to animality, madness finds both its 
truth and its cure; when the madman has become a beast, this 
presence of the animal in man, a presence which constituted the 
scandal of madness, is eliminated: not that the animal is silenced, 
but man himself is abolished. In the human being who has 
become a beast of burden, the absence of reason follows wisdom 
and its order: madness is then cured, since it is alienated in 
something which is no less than its truth. 

A moment would come when, from this animality of madness, 
would be deduced the idea of a mechanistic psychology, and the 
notion that the forms of madness can be referred to the great 
structures of animal life. But in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, the animality that lends its face to madness in no way 
stipulates a determinist nature for its phenomena. On the 
contrary, it locates madness in an area of unforeseeable freedom 
where frenzy is unchained; if determinism can have any effect on 
it, it is in the form of constraint, punishment, or discipline. 
Through animality, madness does not join the great laws of 
nature and of life, but rather the thousand forms of a bestiary. 
But unlike the one popular in the Middle Ages, which 
illustrated, in so many symbolic visages, the metamorphoses of

evil, this was an abstract bestiary; here evil no longer assumed its 
fantastic body; here we apprehend only its most extreme form, 
the truth of the beast which is a truth without content. Evil is 
freed from all that its wealth of iconographic fauna could do, to 
preserve only a general power of intimidation: the secret danger
