In any case, it was this animality of madness which 
confinement glorified, at the same time that it sought to avoid 
the scandal inherent in the immorality of the unreasonable. Which 
reveals the distance established in the classical age between 
madness and the other forms of unreason, even if it is true that 
from a certain point of view they had been identified or 
assimilated. If a whole range of unreason was reduced to silence, 
but madness left free to speak the language of its scandal, what 
lesson could it teach which unreason as a whole was not capable 
of transmitting? What meaning had the frenzies and all the fury 
of the insane, which could not be found in the—probably more 
sensible—remarks of the other internees? In what respect then 
was madness more particularly significant? 

Beginning with the seventeenth century, unreason in the most 
general sense no longer had much instructive value. That 
perilous reversibility of reason which was still so close for the 
Renaissance was to be forgotten, and its scandals were to 
disappear. The great theme of the madness of the Cross, which 
belonged so intimately to the Christian experience of the 
Renaissance, began to disappear in the seventeenth century,

despite Jansenism and Pascal. Or rather, it subsisted, but 
changed and somehow inverted its meaning. It was no longer a 
matter of requiring human reason to abandon its pride and its 
certainties in order to lose itself in the great unreason of sacrifice. 
When classical Christianity speaks of the madness of the Cross, 
it is merely to humiliate false reason and add luster to the eternal 
light of truth; the madness of God-in-man’s-image is simply a 
wisdom not recognized by the men of unreason who live in this 
world: “Jesus crucified ... was the scandal of the world and 
appeared as nothing but ignorance and madness to the eyes of 
his time.” But the fact that the world has become Christian, and 
that the order of God is revealed through the meanderings of 
history and the madness of men, now suffices to show that 
“Christ has become the highest point of our wisdom.”9 The 
scandal of Christian faith and Christian abasement, whose 
strength and value as revelation Pascal still preserved, would soon 
have no more meaning for Christian thought except perhaps to 
reveal in these scandalized consciences so many blind souls: “Do 
not permit your Cross, which has subdued the universe for you, 
to be still the madness and scandal of proud minds.” Christian 
unreason was relegated by Christians themselves into the 
margins of a reason that had become identical with the wisdom 
of God incarnate. After Port-Royal, men would have to wait two
