long road of the Passion, which was also the road of the passions, 
of wisdom forgotten, and of madness. And because it was one of 
the forms of the Passion—the ultimate form, in a sense, before 
death—madness would now become, for those who suffered it, 
an object of respect and compassion. 

To respect madness is not to interpret it as the involuntary and 
inevitable accident of disease, but to recognize this lower limit of 
human truth, a limit not accidental but essential. As death is the 
limit of human life in the realm of time, madness is its limit in 
the realm of animality, and just as death had been sanctified by 
the death of Christ, madness, in its most bestial nature, had also 
been sanctified. On March 29, 1654, Saint Vincent de Paul 
announced to Jean Barreau, himself a congreganist, that his 
brother had just been confined at Saint-Lazare as a lunatic: “We 
must honor Our Lord in the state wherein He was when they 
sought to bind Him, saying quoniam in frenesim versus est , in 
order to sanctify that state in those whom His Divine Providence 
has placed there.”! 1 Madness is the lowest point of humanity to 
which God submitted in His incarnation, thereby showing that 
there was nothing inhuman in man that could not be redeemed 
and saved; the ultimate point of the Fall was glorified by the 
divine presence: and it is this lesson which, for the seventeenth 
century, all madness still taught. 

We see why the scandal of madness could be exalted, while 
that of the other forms of unreason was concealed with so much 
care. The scandal of unreason produced only the contagious 
example of transgression and immorality; the scandal of madness 
showed men how close to animality their Fall could bring them; 
and at the same time how far divine mercy could extend when it 
consented to save man. For Renaissance Christianity, the entire 
instructive value of unreason and of its scandals lay in the 
madness of the Incarnation of God in man. For classicism, the 
Incarnation is no longer madness; but what is madness is this

incarnation of man in the beast, which is, as the ultimate point of 
his Fall, the most manifest sign of his guilt; and, as the ultimate 
object of divine mercy, the symbol of universal forgiveness and 
innocence regained. Henceforth, all the lessons of madness and 
the power of its instruction must be sought in this obscure 
region, at the lower confines of humanity, where man is hinged
