to nature, where he is both ultimate downfall and absolute 
innocence. Does not the Church’s solicitude for the insane 
during the classical period, as it is symbolized in Saint Vincent 
de Paul and his Congregation, or in the Brothers of Charity, all 
those religious orders hovering over madness and showing it to 
the world—does this not indicate that the Church found in 
madness a difficult but an essential lesson: the guilty innocence 
of the animal in man? This is the lesson to be read and 
understood in its spectacles, in which it exalted in the madman 
the fury of the human beast. Paradoxically, this Christian 
consciousness of animality prepared the moment when madness 
would be treated as a fact of nature; it would then be quickly 
forgotten what this “nature” meant for classical thought: not the 
always accessible domain of an objective analysis, but that region 
in which there appears, for man, the always possible scandal of a 
madness that is both his ultimate truth and the form of his 
abolition. 

All these phenomena, these strange practices woven around 
madness, these usages which glorify and at the same time 
discipline it, reduce it to animality while making it teach the 
lesson of the Redemption, put madness in a strange position 
with regard to unreason as a whole. In the houses of 
confinement, madness cohabits with all the forms of unreason 
which envelop it and define its most general truth; and yet 
madness is isolated, treated in a special manner, manifested in its 
singularity as if, though belonging to unreason, it nonetheless 
traversed that domain by a movement peculiar to itself,

ceaselessly referring from itself to its most paradoxical extreme. 

We have now got in the habit of perceiving in madness a fall 
into a determinism where all forms of liberty are gradually 
suppressed; madness shows us nothing more than the natural 
constants of a determinism, with the sequences of its causes, and 
the discursive movement of its forms; for madness threatens 
modern man only with that return to the bleak world of beasts 
and things, to their fettered freedom. It is not on this horizon of 
nature that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries recognized 
madness, but against a background of Unreason', madness did not 
disclose a mechanism, but revealed a liberty raging in the 
monstrous forms of animality. We no longer understand 
unreason today, except in its epithetic form: the Unreasonable , a 
sign attached to conduct or speech, and betraying to the layman’s 
eyes the presence of madness and all its pathological train; for us
