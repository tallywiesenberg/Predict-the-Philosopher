the unreasonable is only one of madness’s modes of appearance. 
On the contrary, unreason, for classicism, had a nominal value; it 
constituted a kind of substantial function. It was in relation to 
unreason and to it alone that madness could be understood. 
Unreason was its support; or let us say that unreason defined the 
locus of madness’s possibility. For classical man, madness was 
not the natural condition, the human and psychological root of 
unreason; it was only unreason’s empirical form; and the 
madman, tracing the course of human degradation to the 
frenzied nadir of animality, disclosed that underlying realm of 
unreason which threatens man and envelops—at a tremendous 
distance—all the forms of his natural existence. It was not a 
question of tending toward a determinism, but of being 
swallowed up by a darkness. More effectively than any other kind 
of rationalism, better in any case than our positivism, classical 
rationalism could watch out for and guard against the 
subterranean danger of unreason, that threatening space of an 
absolute freedom.

PASSIONAND 

DELIRIUM 


THE savage danger of madness is related to the danger of the 
passions and to their fatal concatenation. 

Sauvages had sketched the fundamental role of passion, citing 
it as a more constant, more persistent, and somehow more 
deserved cause of madness: “The distraction of our mind is the 
result of our blind surrender to our desires, our incapacity to 
control or to moderate our passions. Whence these amorous 
frenzies, these antipathies, these depraved tastes, this melancholy 
which is caused by grief, these transports wrought in us by 
denial, these excesses in eating, in drinking, these indispositions, 
these corporeal vices which cause madness, the worst of all 
maladies.”! But as yet, what was involved was only passion’s 
moral precedence, its responsibility, in a vague way; the real
