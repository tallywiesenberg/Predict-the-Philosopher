trace of the object in the brain and its image in the soul, thus 
forming in the body a kind of geometric figure of passion which 
is merely its expressive transposition; but which also constitutes 
passion’s essential causal basis, for when all the spirits are 
grouped around this object of passion, or at least around its 
image, the mind in its turn can tao longer ignore it and will 
consequently be subject to passion.

One more step, and the entire system becomes a unity in 
which body and soul communicate immediately in the symbolic 
values of common qualities. This is what happens in the 
medicine of solids and fluids, which dominates eighteenth- 
century practice. Tension and release, hardness and softness, 
rigidity and relaxation, congestion and dryness—these qualitative 
states characterize the soul as much as the body, and ultimately 
refer to a kind of indistinct and composite passional situation, 
one which imposes itself on the concatenation of ideas, on the 
course of feelings, on the state of fibers, on the circulation of 
fluids. The theme of causality here appears as too discursive, the 
elements it groups too disjunct for its schemas to be applicable. 
Are the “active passions, such as anger, joy, lust,” causes or 
consequences “of the excessive strength, the excessive tension, 
and the excessive elasticity of the nervous fibers, and of the 
excessive activity of the nervous fluid”? Conversely, cannot the 
“inert passions, such as fear, depression, ennui, lack of appetite, 
the coldness that accompanies homesickness, bizarre appetites, 
stupidity, lack of memory” be as readily followed as they are 
preceded by “weakness of the brain marrow and of the nervous 
fibers distributed in the organs, by impoverishment and inertia of 

the fluids”?^ Indeed, we must no longer try to situate passion in 
a causal succession, or halfway between the corporeal and the 
spiritual; passion indicates, at a new, deeper level, that the soul 
and the body are in a perpetual metaphorical relation in which 
qualities have no need to be communicated because they are 
already common to both; and in which phenomena of expression 
are not causes, quite simply because soul and body are always 
each other s immediate expression. Passion is no longer exactly at 
the geometrical center of the body-and-soul complex; it is, a 
little short of that, at the point where their opposition is not yet 
given, in that region where both their unity and their distinction 
are established.
