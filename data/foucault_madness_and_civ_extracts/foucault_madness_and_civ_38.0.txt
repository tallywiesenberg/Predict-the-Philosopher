compromised, perverted, distorted—thereby manifesting such 
unity as evident and established, but also as fragile and already 
doomed to destruction. 

There comes a moment in the course of passion when laws are 
suspended as though of their own accord, when movement either 
abruptly stops, without collision or absorption of any kind of 
active force, or is propagated, the action ceasing only at the 
climax of the paroxysm. Whytt admits that an intense emotion 
can provoke madness exactly as impact can provoke movement, 
for the sole reason that emotion is both impact in the soul and 
agitation of the nervous fiber: “It is thus that sad narratives or 
those capable of moving the heart, a horrible and unexpected 
sight, great grief, rage, terror, and the other passions which make 
a great impression frequently occasion the most sudden and 
violent nervous symptoms.” But—it is here that madness, strictly 
speaking, begins—it happens that this movement immediately 
cancels itself out by its own excess and abruptly provokes an 
immobility which may reach the point of death itself. As if in the 
mechanics of madness, repose were not necessarily a quiescent 
thing but could also be a movement in violent opposition to 
itself, a movement which under the effect of its own violence 
abruptly achieves contradiction and the impossibility of 
continuance. “It is not unheard of that the passions, being very 
violent, generate a kind of tetanus or catalepsy such that the 
person then resembles a statue more than a living being. Further, 
fear, affliction, joy, and shame carried to their excess have more

than once been followed by sudden death. 

Conversely, it happens that movement, passing from soul to 
body and from body to soul, propagates itself indefinitely in a 
locus of anxiety certainly closer to that space where Malebranche 
placed souls than to that in which Descartes situated bodies. 
Imperceptible movements, often provoked by a slight external 
impact, accumulate, are amplified, and end by exploding in 
violent convulsions. Giovanni Maria Lancisi had already 
explained that the noble Romans were often subject to the vapors 
—hysterical attacks, hypochondriacal fits—because in their court 
life “their minds, continually agitated between fear and hope, 
never knew a moment’s repose.” According to many physicians, 
city life, the life of the court, of the salons, led to madness by this 
multiplicity of excitations constantly accumulated, prolonged, 
and echoed without ever being attenuated. But there is in this 
image, in its more intense forms, and in the events constituting
