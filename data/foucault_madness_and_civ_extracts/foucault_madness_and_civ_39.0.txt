rigor and in its totality; but it is fissured, it turns out, along lines 
which do not abolish it, but divide it into arbitrary sectors. For 
when melancholia fixes upon an aberrant idea, it is not only the 
soul which is involved; it is the soul with the brain, the soul with 
the nerves, their origin and their fibers: a whole segment of the 
unity of soul and body is thus detached from the aggregate and 
especially from the organs by which reality is perceived. The

same thing occurs in convulsions and agitation: the soul is not 
excluded from the body, but is swept along so rapidly by it that it 
cannot retain all its conceptions; it is separated from its 
memories, its intentions, its firmest ideas, and thus isolated from 
itself and from all that remains stable in the body, it surrenders 
itself to the most mobile fibers; nothing in its behavior is 
henceforth adapted to reality, to truth, or to prudence; though 
the fibers in their vibration may imitate what is happening in the 
perceptions, the sufferer cannot tell the difference: “The rapid 
and chaotic pulsations of the arteries, or whatever other 
derangement occurs, imprints this same movement on the fibers 
(as in perception); they will represent as present objects which 
are not so, as true those which are chimerical.”? 

In madness, the totality of soul and body is parceled out: not 
according to the elements which constitute that totality 
metaphysically; but according to figures, images which envelop 
segments of the body and ideas of the soul in a kind of absurd 
unity. Fragments which isolate man from himself, but above all 
from reality; fragments which, by detaching themselves, have 
formed the unreal unity of a hallucination, and by very virtue of 
this autonomy impose it upon truth. “Madness is no more than 

the derangement of the imagination.”^ In other words, 
beginning with passion, madness is still only an intense 
movement in the rational unity of soul and body; this is the level 
of unreason ; but this intense movement quickly escapes the 
reason of the mechanism and becomes, in its violences, its 
stupors, its senseless propagations, an irrational movement; and 
it is then that, escaping truth and its constraints, the Unreal 
appears. 

And thereby we find the suggestion of the third cycle we must 
now trace: that of chimeras, of hallucinations, and of error—the 
cycle of non-being.
