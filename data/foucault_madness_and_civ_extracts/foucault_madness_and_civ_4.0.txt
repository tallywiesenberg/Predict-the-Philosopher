of madness to our own experience> which confines insanity within 
mental illness. In the Middle Ages and until the Renaissance, mans 
dispute with madness was a dramatic debate in which he confronted 
the secret powers of the world; the experience of madness was clouded 
by images of the Fall and the Will of God\ of the Beast and the 
Metamorphosis , and of all the marvelous secrets of Knowledge. In our 
era; the experience of madness remains silent in the composure of a 
knowledge which, knowing too much about madness> forgets it. But 
from one of these experiences to the other , the shift has been made by a 
world without images, without positive character , in a kind of silent 
transparency which reveals—as mute institution , act without 
commentary , immediate knowledge—a great motionless structure; this 
structure is one of neither drama nor knowledge; it is the point where 
history is immobilized in the tragic category which both establishes 
and impugns it.
