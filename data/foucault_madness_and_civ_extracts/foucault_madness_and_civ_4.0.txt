It is this 
function of madness, both ambiguous and central, that the 
author of UOspital des fous employs when he portrays a pair of 
lovers who, to escape their pursuers, pretend to be mad and hide 
among madmen; in a fit of simulated dementia, the girl, who is 
dressed as a boy, pretends to believe she is a girl—which she 
really is—thus uttering, by the reciprocal neutralization of these 
two pretenses, the truth which in the end will triumph.Madness is the purest, most total form of qui pro quo\ it takes 
the false for the true, death for life, man for woman, the beloved 
for the Erinnys and the victim for Minos.But it is also the most 
rigorously necessary form of the qui pro quo in the dramatic 
economy, for it needs no external element to reach a true 
resolution.It has merely to carry its illusion to the point of truth.Thus it is, at the very heart of the structure, in its mechanical 
center, both a feigned conclusion, pregnant with a secret 
“starting over,” and the first step toward what will turn out to be 
the reconciliation with reason and truth.
