One group of 
actors takes the part of spectators, another that of actors.The 
former must pretend to take the decor for reality, the play for 
life, while in reality these actors are performing in a real decor; 
on the other hand, the latter must pretend to play the part of 
actors, while in fact, quite simply, they are actors acting.A 
double impersonation in which each element is doubled, thus 
forming that renewed exchange of the real and the illusory which 
is itself the dramatic meaning of madness.“I do not know,” 
Mondory says in the prologue to Scudery’s play, “what 
extravagance has today come over my companions, but it is so 
great that I am forced to believe that some spell has robbed them 
of their reason, and the worst of it is that they are trying to make 
me lose mine, and you yours as well.They wish to persuade me 
that I am not on a stage, that this is the city of Lyons, that over 
there is an inn, and there an innyard where actors who are not 
ourselves, yet who are, are performing a Pastoral.” In this 
extravaganza, the theater develops its truth, which is illusion.
