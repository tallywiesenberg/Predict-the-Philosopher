Which is, in the strict sense, madness.The classical experience of madness is born.The great threat 
that dawned on the horizon of the fifteenth century subsides, the 
disturbing powers that inhabit Bosch’s painting have lost their 
violence.Forms remain, now transparent and docile, forming a 
cortege, the inevitable procession of reason.Madness has ceased 
to be—at the limits of the world, of man and death—an 
eschatological figure; the darkness has dispersed on which the 
eyes of madness were fixed and out of which the forms of the 
impossible were born.
