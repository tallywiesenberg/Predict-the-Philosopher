Oblivion falls upon the world navigated by 
the free slaves of the Ship of Fools.Madness will no longer 
proceed from a point within the world to a point beyond, on its 


45 



strange voyage; it will never again be that fugitive and absolute 
limit.Behold it moored now, made fast among things and men.Retained and maintained.No longer a ship but a hospital.
