Consider this unhappy wretch; 

Poor mad fool, what will he do 
With so many rags and tatters?...I have seen such wild lunatics 
Shouting insults in the streets ...Madness traces a very familiar silhouette in the social 
landscape.A new and lively pleasure is taken in the old 
confraternities of madmen, in their festivals, their gatherings, 
their speeches.Men argue passionately for or against Nicolas 
Joubert, better known by the name of Angoulevent, who declares 
himself Prince of Fools, a title disputed by Valenti le Comte and 
Jacques Resneau: there follow pamphlets, a trial, arguments; his 
lawyer declares and certifies him to be “an empty head, a gutted 
gourd, lacking in common sense; a cane, a broken brain, that has 
neither spring nor whole wheel in his head.” Bluet d’ Arberes, 
who calls himself Comte de Permission, is a protege of the 
Crequis, the Lesdiguieres, the Bouillons, the Nemours; in 1602 
he publishes—or someone publishes for him—his works, in 
which he warns the reader that “he does not know how to read 
or write, and has never learned,” but that he is animated “by the 
inspiration of God and the Angels.” Pierre Dupuis, whom 
Regnier mentions in his sixth satire, is, according to 
Brascambille, “an archfool in a long robe”; he himself in his 
“Remontrance sur le reveil de Maitre Guillaume” states that he 
has “a mind elevated as far as the antechamber of the third 
degree of the moon.” And many other characters present in 
Regnier s fourteenth satire.
