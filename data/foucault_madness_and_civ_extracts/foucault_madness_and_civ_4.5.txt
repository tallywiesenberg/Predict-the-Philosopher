A date can serve as a landmark: 1656, the decree that founded, 
in Paris, the Hopital General.At first glance, this is merely a

reform—little more than an administrative reorganization.Several already existing establishments are grouped under a 
single administration: the Salpetriere, rebuilt under the 
preceding reign to house an arsenal; Bicetre, which Louis XIII 
had wanted to give to the Commandery of Saint Louis as a rest 
home for military invalids; “the House and the Hospital of La 
Pitie, the larger as well as the smaller, those of Le Refuge, 
situated in the Faubourg Saint-Victor, the House and Hospital 
of Scipion, the House of La Savonnerie, with all the lands, 
places, gardens, houses, and buildings thereto appertaining.” 1 All 
were now assigned to the poor of Paris “of both sexes, of all ages 
and from all localities, of whatever breeding and birth, in 
whatever state they may be, able-bodied or invalid, sick or 
convalescent, curable or incurable.” These establishments had to 
accept, lodge, and feed those who presented themselves or those 
sent by royal or judicial authority; it was also necessary to assure 
the subsistence, the appearance, and the general order of those 
who could not find room, but who might or who deserved to be 
there.This responsibility was entrusted to directors appointed 
for life, who exercised their powers, not only in the buildings of 
the Hopital but throughout the city of Paris, over all those who 
came under their jurisdiction: “They have all power of authority, 
of direction, of administration, of commerce, of police, of 
jurisdiction, of correction and punishment over all the poor of 
Paris, both within and without the Hopital General.” The 
directors also appointed a doctor at a salary of one thousand 
livres a year; he was to reside at La Pitie, but had to visit each of 
the houses of the Hopital twice a week.From the very start, one thing is clear: the Hopital General is 
not a medical establishment.
