the Hopital General is a strange power that the King establishes 
between the police and the courts, at the limits of the law: a third 
order of repression.The insane whom Pinel would find at 
Bicetre and at La Salpetriere belonged to this world.In its functioning, or in its purpose, the Hopital General had 
nothing to do with any medical concept.It was an instance of 
order, of the monarchical and bourgeois order being organized in 
France during this period.
