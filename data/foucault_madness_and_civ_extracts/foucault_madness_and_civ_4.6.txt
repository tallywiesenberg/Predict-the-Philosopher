It was directly linked with the royal 
power which placed it under the authority of the civil 
government alone; the Grand Almonry of the Realm, which 
previously formed an ecclesiastical and spiritual mediation in the 
politics of assistance, was abruptly elided.The King decreed: 
“We choose to be guardian and protector of the said Hopital 
General as being of our royal founding and especially as it does 
not depend in any manner whatsoever upon our Grand Almonry, 
nor upon any of our high officers, but is to be totally exempt 
from the direction, visitation, and jurisdiction of the officers of 
the General Reform and others of the Grand Almonry, and from 
all others to whom we forbid all knowledge and jurisdiction in 
any fashion or manner whatsoever.” The origin of the project 
had been parliamentary, and the first two administrative heads 
appointed were the first President of the Parlement and the 
Procurator General.But they were soon supplemented by the

Archbishop of Paris, the President of the Court of Assistance, 
the President of the Court of Exchequer, the Chief of Police, 
and the Provost of Merchants.Henceforth the “Grand Bureau” 
had no more than a deliberative role.The actual administration 
and the real responsibilities were entrusted to agents recruited by 
co-optation.
