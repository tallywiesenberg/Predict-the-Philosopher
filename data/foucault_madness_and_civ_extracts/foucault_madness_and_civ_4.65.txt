These were the true governors, the delegates of 
royal power and bourgeois fortune to the world of poverty.The 
Revolution was able to give them this testimony: “Chosen from 
the best families of the bourgeoisie,... they brought to their 
administration disinterested views and pure intentions.”3 

This structure proper to the monarchical and bourgeois order 
of France, contemporary with its organization in absolutist 
forms, soon extended its network over the whole of France.An 
edict of the King, dated June 16, 1676, prescribed the 
establishment of an “hopital general in each city of his kingdom.” 
Occasionally the measure had been anticipated by the local 
authorities; the bourgeoisie of Fyons had already organized in 
1612 a charity establishment that functioned in an analogous 
manner.The Archbishop of Tours was proud to declare on July 
10, 1676, that his “archepiscopal city has happily foreseen the 
pious intentions of the King and erected an hopital general called 
Fa Charite even before the one in Paris, whose order has served 
as a model for all those subsequently established, within or 
outside the kingdom.” The Charite of Tours, in fact, had been 
founded in 1656, and the King had endowed it with an income 
of four thousand livres.Over the entire face of France, hopitaux 
generaux were opened; on the eve of the Revolution, they were to 
be found in thirty-two provincial cities.
