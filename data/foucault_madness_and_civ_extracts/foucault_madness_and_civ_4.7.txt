even created congregations whose purposes were rather 
analogous to those of the Hopital General.Vincent de Paul 
reorganized Saint-Lazare, the most important of the former lazar 
houses of Paris; on January 7, 1632, he signed a contract in the 
name of the Congregationists of the Mission with the “Priory” of 
Saint-Lazare, which was now to receive “persons detained by 
order of His Majesty.” The Order of Good Sons opened 
hospitals of this nature in the north of France.The Brothers of 
Saint John of God, called into France in 1602, founded first the 
Charite of Paris in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, then 
Charenton, into which they moved on May 10, 1645.Not far 
from Paris, they also operated the Charite of Senlis, which 
opened on October 27, 1670.
