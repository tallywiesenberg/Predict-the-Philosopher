They continued to 
multiply in the eighteenth century; Leipzig first in 1701, then 
Halle and Cassel in 1717 and 1720, later Brieg and Osnabriick 
(1756), and finally Torgau in 1771.In England the origins of confinement are more remote.An 
act of 1575 covering both “the punishment of vagabonds and the 
relief of the poor” prescribed the construction of houses oj 
correction , to number at least one per county.Their upkeep was 
to be assured by a tax, but the public was encouraged to make 
voluntary donations.It appears, however, that in this form the 
measure was scarcely ever applied, since, some years later, it was 
decided to authorize private enterprise: it was no longer 
necessary to obtain an official permit to open a hospital or a 
house of correction; anyone who pleased might do so.
