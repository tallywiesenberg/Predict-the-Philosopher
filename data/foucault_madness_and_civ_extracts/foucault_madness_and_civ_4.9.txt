At the 
beginning of the seventeenth century, a general reorganization: a 
fine of five pounds was imposed on any justice of the peace who 
had not established one in the area of his jurisdiction; the houses 
were to install trades, workshops, and factories (milling, 
spinning, weaving) to aid in their upkeep and assure their 
inmates of work; a judge was to decide who was qualified to be 
sent there.The development of these “bridewells” was not too 
considerable; often they were gradually absorbed by the prisons 
to which they were attached; the practice never spread as far as 
Scotland.On the other hand, the workhouses were destined to 
greater success.They date from the second half of the 
seventeenth century.An act of 1670 defined their status, 
appointed officers of justice to oversee the collection of taxes and 
the administration of sums that would permit their functioning, 
and entrusted the supreme control of their administration to a 
justice of the peace.
