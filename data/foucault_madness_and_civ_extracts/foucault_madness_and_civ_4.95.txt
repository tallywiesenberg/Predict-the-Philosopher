In 1697 several parishes of Bristol united to 


55 



form the first workhouse in England, and to designate the 
corporation that would administer it.Another was established at 
Worcester in 1703, a third the same year at Dublin; then at 
Plymouth, Norwich, Hull, and Exeter.By the end of the 
eighteenth century, there were 126 of them.The Gilbert Act of 
1792 gives the parishes facilities to create new ones; at the same 
time, the control and authority of the justice of the peace is 
reinforced; to keep the workhouses from becoming hospitals, it is 
recommended that all contagious invalids be turned away.In several years, an entire network had spread across Europe.
