made of glass, he thereby concludes that he is fragile, that he is 
in danger of breaking, that he must touch no object which might 
be too resistant, that he must in fact remain motionless, and so 
on. Such reasonings are those of a madman; but again we must 
note that in themselves they are neither absurd nor illogical. On 
the contrary, they apply correctly the most rigorous figures of 
logic. And Paul Zacchias has no difficulty finding them, in all 
their rigor, among the insane. Syllogism, in a man letting himself 
starve to death: “The dead do not eat; I am dead; hence I do not 
eat.” Induction extended to infinity, in a man suffering from 
persecution delusions: “A, B, and C are my enemies; all of them 
are men; therefore all men are my enemies.” Enthymeme, in 
another sufferer: “Most of those who have lived in this house are 
dead, hence I, who have lived in this house, am dead.” The 
marvelous logic of the mad which seems to mock that of the 
logicians because it resembles it so exactly, or rather because it is 
exactly the same, and because at the secret heart of madness, at 
the core of so many errors, so many absurdities, so many words 
and gestures without consequence, we discover, finally, the 
hidden perfection of a language. “From these things,” Zacchias 
concludes, “you truly see how best to discuss the intellect.” The 
ultimate language of madness is that of reason, but the language 
of reason enveloped in the prestige of the image, limited to the 
locus of appearance which the image defines. It forms, outside 
the totality of images and the universality of discourse, an 
abusive, singular organization whose insistent quality constitutes

madness. Madness, then, is not altogether in the image, which of 
itself is neither true nor false, neither reasonable nor mad; nor is 
it, further, in the reasoning which is mere form, revealing 
nothing but the indubitable figures of logic. And yet madness is 
in one and in the other: in a special version or figure of their 
relationship. 

Let us consider an example borrowed from Diemerbroek. A 
man was suffering from a profound melancholia. As with all 
melancholics, his mind was attached to a fixed idea, and this idea 
was for him the occasion of a constantly renewed sadness. He 
accused himself of having killed his son, and in the excess of his 
remorse, declared that God, for his punishment, had assigned a 
demon to tempt him, like the demon which had tempted the 
Lord. This demon he saw, spoke to, heard, and answered. He 
did not understand why those around him refused to 
acknowledge such a presence. Such then is madness: this 
remorse, this belief, this hallucination, these speeches; in short,
