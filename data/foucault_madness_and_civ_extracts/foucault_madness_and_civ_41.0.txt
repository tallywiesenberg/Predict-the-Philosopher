still-ductile substance of the brain. But in its turn, this organic 
figure is merely the other side of a preoccupation which has 
obsessed the patient’s mind; it represents what might be called 
the sedimentation in the body of an infinitely repeated discourse 
apropos of the punishment God must reserve for sinners guilty of 
homicide. The body and the traces it conceals, the soul and the 
images it perceives, are here no more than stages in the syntax of 
delirious language.

And lest we be criticized for elaborating this entire analysis 
around a single observation from a single author (a privileged 
observation, since it concerns melancholic delirium), we shall 
also seek confirmation of the fundamental role of delirious 
discourse in the classical conception of madness in another 
author, of another period, and apropos of a very different disease. 
This is a case of “nymphomania” observed by Bienville. The 
imagination of a young girl, “Julie,” had been inflamed by 
precocious reading and aroused by the remarks of a servant girl 
“initiated into the secrets of Venus,... a virtuous handmaiden in 
the mother’s eyes” but “a dear and voluptuous stewardess of the 
daughter’s pleasures.” Yet Julie combats these—to her—new 
desires with all the impressions she has received in the course of 
her education; to the seductive language of novels, she opposes 
the lessons of religion and virtue; and despite the vivacity of her 
imagination, she does not succumb to disease so long as she 
possesses “the strength to reason thus with herself: it is neither 
lawful nor virtuous to obey so shameful a passion.’Td But the 
wicked remarks, the dangerous readings increase; at every 
moment, they render more intense the agitation of the 
weakening fibers; then the fundamental language by which she 
had hitherto resisted gradually gives way: “Nature alone had 
spoken hitherto; but soon illusion, chimera, and extravagance 
played their part; at length she acquired the unhappy strength to 
approve in herself this horrible maxim: nothing is so beautiful 
nor so sweet as to obey the desires of love.” This fundamental 
discourse opens the gates of madness: the imagination is freed, 
the appetites continually increase, the fibers reach the final 
degree of irritation. Delirium, in its lapidary form of a moral 
principle, leads straight to the convulsions which can endanger 
life itself. 

At the end of this last cycle which had begun with the liberty 
of the hallucination and which closes now with the rigor of
