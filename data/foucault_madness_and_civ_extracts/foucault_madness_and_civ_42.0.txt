general definition we can give of classical madness is indeed 
delirium'. “This word is derived from lira, a furrow; so that deliro 
actually means to move out of the furrow, away from the proper 
path of reason.”! Hence it is not surprising to find the 
eighteenth-century nosographers often classifying vertigo as a 
madness, and more rarely hysterical convulsions; this is because it 
is often impossible to find in hysterical convulsions the unity of a 
language, while vertigo affords the delirious affirmation that the 
world is really “turning around.” Such delirium is a necessary and 
sufficient reason for a disease to be called madness. 

4. Language is the first and last structure of madness , its 
constituent form; on language are based all the cycles in which 
madness articulates its nature. That the essence of madness can 
be ultimately defined in the simple structure of a discourse does 
not reduce it to a purely psychological nature, but gives it a hold 
over the totality of soul and body; such discourse is both the 
silent language by which the mind speaks to itself in the truth 
proper to it, and the visible articulation in the movements of the 
body. Parallelisms, complements, all the forms of immediate 
communication which we have seen manifested, in madness are 
suspended between soul and body in this single language and in 
its powers. The movement of passion which persists until it 
breaks and turns against itself, the sudden appearance of the 
image, and the agitations of the body which were its visible 
concomitants—all this, even as we were trying to reconstruct it, 
was already secretly animated by this language. If the 
determinism of passion is transcended and released in the

hallucination of the image, if the image, in return, has swept 
away the whole world of beliefs and desires, it is because the 
delirious language was already present—a discourse which 
liberated passion from all its limits, and adhered with all the 
constraining weight of its affirmation to the image which was 
liberating itself 

It is in this delirium, which is of both body and soul, of both 
language and image, of both grammar and physiology, that all 
the cycles of madness conclude and begin. It is this delirium 
whose rigorous meaning organized them from the start. It is 
madness itself, and also, beyond each of its phenomena, its silent 
transcendence, which constitute the truth of madness. 

A last question remains: In the name of what can this 
fundamental language be regarded as a delirium? Granting that it 
is the truth of madness , what makes it true madness and the
