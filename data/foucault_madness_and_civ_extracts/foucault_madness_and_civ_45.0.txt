according to a visible logic. All that madness can say of itself is 
merely reason, though it is itself the negation of reason. In short, 
a rational hold over madness is always possible and necessary , to the 
very degree that madness is non-reason. 

There is only one word which summarizes this experience, 
Unreason', all that, for reason, is closest and most remote, 
emptiest and most complete; all that presents itself to reason in 
familiar structures—authorizing a knowledge, and then a science, 
which seeks to be positive—and all that is constantly in retreat 
from reason, in the inaccessible domain of nothingness. 

And if, now, we try to assign a value, in and of itself, outside 
its relations with the dream and with error, to classical unreason, 
we must understand it not as reason diseased, or as reason lost or 
alienated, but quite simply as reason dazzled. 

Dazzlement is night in broad daylight, the darkness that rules

at the very heart of what is excessive in light’s radiance. Dazzled 
reason opens its eyes upon the sun and sees nothing, that is, does 
not see\ in dazzlement, the recession of objects toward the depths 
of night has as an immediate correlative the suppression of vision 
itself; at the moment when it sees objects disappear into the 
secret night of light, sight sees itself in the moment of its 
disappearance. 

To say that madness is dazzlement is to say that the madman 
sees the daylight, the same daylight as the man of reason (both 
live in the same brightness); but seeing this same daylight, and 
nothing but this daylight and nothing in it, he sees it as void, as 
night, as nothing; for him the shadows are the way to perceive 
daylight. Which means that, seeing the night and the 
nothingness of the night, he does not see at all. And believing he 
sees, he admits as realities the hallucinations of his imagination 
and all the multitudinous population of night. That is why 
delirium and dazzlement are in a relation which constitutes the 
essence of madness, exactly as truth and light, in their 
fundamental relation, constitute classical reason. 

In this sense, the Cartesian formula of doubt is certainly the 
great exorcism of madness. Descartes closes his eyes and plugs up 
his ears the better to see the true brightness of essential daylight; 
thus he is secured against the dazzlement of the madman who, 
opening his eyes, sees only night, and not seeing at all, believes
