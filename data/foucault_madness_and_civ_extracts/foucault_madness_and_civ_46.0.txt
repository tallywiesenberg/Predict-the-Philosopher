essential not to transgress it. On one side, tragedy. The rule of 
the theatrical day has a positive content; it forces tragic duration 
to be poised upon the singular but universal alternation of day

and night; the whole of the tragedy must be accomplished in this 
unity of time, for tragedy is ultimately nothing but the 
confrontation of two realms, linked to each other by time itself, 
in the irreconcilable. Every day, in Racine’s theater, is overhung 
by a night, which it brings, so to speak, to light: the night of 
Troy and its massacres, the night of Nero’s desires, Titus’s 
Roman night, Athalie’s night. These are the great stretches of 
night, realms of darkness which haunt the day without yielding 
an hour, and disappear only in the new night of death. And these 
fantastic nights, in their turn, are haunted by a light which forms 
a kind of infernal reflection of the day: the burning of Troy, the 
torches of the Praetorians, the pale light of the dream. In 
classical tragedy, day and night are arranged like a pair of 
mirrors, endlessly reflect each other, and afford that simple 
couple a sudden profundity which envelops in a single movement 
all of man’s life and his death. In the same fashion, in De la 
Tour’s Madeleine au miroir , light and shadow confront each other 
divide and at the same time unite a face and its reflection, a skull 
and its image, a vigil and a silence; and in the Image Saint-Alexis , 
the page holding the torch reveals under the shadow of the vault 
the man who was his master—a grave and luminous boy 
encounters all of human misery; a child brings death to light. 

On the other side, facing tragedy and its hieratic language, is 
the confused murmur of madness. Here, too, the great law of the 
division has been violated; shadow and light mingle in the fury of 
madness, as in the tragic disorder. But in another mode. In 
night, the tragic character found a somber truth of day; the night 
of Troy remained Andromache’s truth, as Athalie’s night 
presaged the truth of the already advancing day; night, 
paradoxically, revealed ; it was the profoundest day of being. The 
madman, conversely, finds in daylight only the inconsistency of 
the night’s figures; he lets the light be darkened by all the 
illusions of the dream; his day is only the most superficial night oj 
appearance. It is to this degree that tragic man, more than any
