one hand madness is immediately perceived as difference: 
whence the forms of spontaneous and collective judgment 
sought, not from physicians, but from men of good sense, to 
determine the confinement of a madman; and on the other hand, 
confinement cannot have any other goal than a correction (that 
is, the suppression of the difference, or the fulfillment of this 
nothingness in death); whence those options for death so often 
to be found in the registers of confinement, written by the 
attendants, and which are not the sign of confinement’s savagery, 
its inhumanity or perversion, but the strict expression of its 
meaning: an operation to annihilate nothingness.20

Confinement sketches, on the surface of phenomena and in a 
hasty moral synthesis, the secret and distinct structure of 
madness. 

Then did confinement establish its practices in this profound 
intuition? Was it because madness under the effect of 
confinement had really vanished from the classical horizon that it 
was ultimately stigmatized as non-being? Questions whose 
answers refer to each other in a perfect circularity. It is futile, no 
doubt, to lose oneself in the endless cycle of these forms of 
interrogation. Better to let classical culture formulate, in its 
general structure, the experience it had of madness, an experience 
which crops up with the same meanings, in the identical order of 
its inner logic, in both the order of speculation and the order of 
institutions, in both discourse and decree, in both word and 
watchword—wherever, in fact, a signifying element can assume 
for us the value of a language.
