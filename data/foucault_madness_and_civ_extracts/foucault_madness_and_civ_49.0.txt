centuries, but rather to show the specific faces by which madness 
was recognized in classical thought. Faces still haunted by 
mythical figures, but which have often been essential in the 
organization of our practical knowledge.

I. Mania and Melancholia 


The notion of melancholia was fixed, in the sixteenth century, 
between a certain definition by symptoms and an explanatory 
principle concealed in the very term that designated it. Among 
the symptoms, we find all the delirious ideas an individual can 
form about himself: “Some think themselves to be beasts, whose 
voice and actions they imitate. Some think that they are vessels 
of glass, and for this reason recoil from passers-by, lest they 
break; others fear death, which they yet cause most often to 
themselves. Still others imagine that they are guilty of some 
crime, so that they tremble with terror when they see another 
coming toward them, thinking he seeks to take them prisoner 

and sentence them to death.” Delirious themes that remain 
isolated and do not compromise reason’s totality. Thomas 
Sydenham would even observe that melancholics “are people 
who, apart from their complaint, are prudent and sensible, and 
who have an extraordinary penetration and sagacity. Thus 
Aristotle rightly observed that melancholics have more 
intelligence than other men.” 

Now this clear and coherent syndrome was designated by a 
word that implied an entire causal system, that of melancholia: “I 
beg you to regard closely the thoughts of melancholies, their 
words, visions, actions, and you will discover how all their senses 
are depraved by a melancholic humor spread through their 
brain.”2 Partial delirium and the action of black bile were 
juxtaposed in the notion of melancholia, unrelated for the 
moment beyond a disjunct confrontation of a group of signs by a 
signifying name. Yet in the eighteenth century a unity would be 
found, or rather an exchange would be made—the nature of that 
cold, black humor having become the major coloration of 
delirium, its positive value in contrast to mania, dementia, and
