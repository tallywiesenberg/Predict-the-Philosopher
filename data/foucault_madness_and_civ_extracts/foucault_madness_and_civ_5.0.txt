John Howard, at the end of the eighteenth century, undertook to 
investigate it; in England, Holland, Germany, France, Italy, 
Spain, he made pilgrimages to all the chief centers of 
confinement—“hospitals, prisons, jails”—and his philanthropy 
was outraged by the fact that the same walls could contain those 
condemned by common law, young men who disturbed their 
families’ peace or who squandered their goods, people without 
profession, and the insane.Proof that even at this period, a 
certain meaning had been lost: that which had so hastily, so 
spontaneously summoned into being all over Europe the 
category of classical order we call confinement.In a hundred and 
fifty years, confinement had become the abusive amalgam of 
heterogeneous elements.Yet at its origin, there must have 
existed a unity which justified its urgency; between these diverse 
forms and the classical period that called them into being, there 
must have been a principle of cohesion we cannot evade under 
the scandal of pre-Revolutionary sensibility.What, then, was the 
reality represented by this entire population which almost 
overnight found itself shut up, excluded more severely than the 
lepers?
