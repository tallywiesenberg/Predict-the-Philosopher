The act which, by tracing the locus of 
confinement, conferred upon it its power of segregation and 
provided a new homeland for madness, though it may be 
coherent and concerted, is not simple.It organizes into a 
complex unity a new sensibility to poverty and to the duties of 
assistance, new forms of reaction to the economic problems of 
unemployment and idleness, a new ethic of work, and also the 
dream of a city where moral obligation was joined to civil law, 
within the authoritarian forms of constraint.Obscurely, these 
themes are present during the construction of the cities of 
confinement and their organization.They give a meaning to this 
ritual, and explain in part the mode in which madness was 
perceived, and experienced, by the classical age.Confinement, that massive phenomenon, the signs of which 
are found all across eighteenth-century Europe, is a “police” 
matter.
