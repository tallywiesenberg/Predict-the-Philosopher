From the beginning, the institution set 
itself the task of preventing “mendicancy and idleness as the 
source of all disorders.” In fact, this was the last of the great 
measures that had been taken since the Renaissance to put an 
end to unemployment or at least to begging.4 In 1532, the 
Parlement of Paris decided to arrest beggars and force them to 
work in the sewers of the city, chained in pairs.The situation 
soon reached critical proportions: on March 23, 1534, the order 
was given “to poor scholars and indigents” to leave the city, while 
it was forbidden “henceforth to sing hymns before images in the 
streets.” The wars of religion multiplied this suspect crowd, 
which included peasants driven from their farms, disbanded 
soldiers or deserters, unemployed workers, impoverished 
students, and the sick.When Henri IV began the siege of Paris, 
the city, which had less than 100,000 inhabitants, contained 
more than 30,000 beggars.An economic revival began early in 
the seventeenth century; it was decided to reabsorb by force the 
unemployed who had not regained a place in society; a decree of 
the Parlement dated 1606 ordered the beggars of Paris to be 
whipped in the public square, branded on the shoulder, shorn, 
and then driven from the city; to keep them from returning, an 
ordinance of 1607 established companies of archers at all the city 
gates to forbid entry to indigents.When the effects of the 
economic renaissance disappeared with the Thirty Years’ War, 
the problems of mendicancy and idleness reappeared; until the

middle of the century, the regular increase of taxes hindered 
manufactures and augmented unemployment.
