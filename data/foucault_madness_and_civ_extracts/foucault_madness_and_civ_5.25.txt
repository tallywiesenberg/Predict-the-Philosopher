This was the 
period of uprisings in Paris (1621), in Lyons (1652), in Rouen 
(1639).At the same time, the world of labor was disorganized by 
the appearance of new economic structures; as the large 
manufactories developed, the guilds lost their powers and their 
rights, the “General Regulations” prohibited all assemblies of 
workers, all leagues, all “associations.” In many-professions, 
however, the guilds were reconstituted.They were prosecuted, 
but it seems that the Parlements showed a certain apathy; the 
Parlement of Normandy disclaimed all competence to judge the 
rioters of Rouen.This is doubtless why the Church intervened 
and accused the workers’ secret gatherings of sorcery.A decree of 
the Sorbonne, in 1655, proclaimed “guilty of sacrilege and mortal 
sin” all those who were found in such bad company.
