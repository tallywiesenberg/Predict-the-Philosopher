In this silent conflict that opposed the severity of the Church 
to the indulgence of the Parlements, the creation of the Hopital 
was certainly, at least in the beginning, a victory for the 
Parlement.It was, in any case, a new solution.For the first time, 
purely negative measures of exclusion were replaced by a measure 
of confinement; the unemployed person was no longer driven 
away or punished; he was taken in charge, at the expense of the 
nation but at the cost of his individual liberty.Between him and 
society, an implicit system of obligation was established: he had 
the right to be fed, but he must accept the physical and moral 
constraint of confinement.It is this entire, rather undifferentiated mass at which the edict 
of 1657 is aimed: a population without resources, without social 
moorings, a class rejected or rendered mobile by new economic 
developments.
