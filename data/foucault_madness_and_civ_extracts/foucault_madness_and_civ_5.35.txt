Less than two weeks after it was signed, the edict 
was read and proclaimed in the streets.Paragraph 9: “We 
expressly prohibit and forbid all persons of either sex, of any 
locality and of any age, of whatever breeding and birth, and in 
whatever condition they may be, able-bodied or invalid, sick or

convalescent, curable or incurable, to beg in the city and suburbs 
of Paris, neither in the churches, nor at the doors of such, nor at 
the doors of houses nor in the streets, nor anywhere else in 
public, nor in secret, by day or night ... under pain of being 
whipped for the first offense, and for the second condemned to 
the galleys if men and boys, banished if women and girls.” The 
year after—Sunday, May 13, 1657—a high mass in honor of the 
Holy Ghost was sung at the Church of Saint-Louis de la Pitie, 
and on the morning of Monday the fourteenth, the militia, 
which was to become, in the mythology of popular terror, “the 
archers of the Hopital,” began to hunt down beggars and herd 
them into the different buildings of the Hopital.Four years later, 
La Salpetriere housed 1,460 women and small children; at La 
Pitie there were 98 boys, 897 girls between seven and seventeen, 
and 95 women; at Bicetre, 1,615 adult men; at La Savonnerie, 
305 boys between eight and thirteen; finally, Scipion lodged 530 
pregnant women, nursing women, and very young children.Initially, married people, even in need, were not admitted; the 
administration was instructed to feed them at home; but soon, 
thanks to a grant from Mazarin, it was possible to lodge them at 
La Salpetriere.In all, between five and six thousand persons.
