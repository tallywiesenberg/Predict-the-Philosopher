Throughout Europe, confinement had the same meaning, at 
least if we consider its origin.It constituted one of the answers 
the seventeenth century gave to an economic crisis that affected 
the entire Western world: reduction of wages, unemployment, 
scarcity of coin—the coincidence of these phenomena probably 
being due to a crisis in the Spanish economy.Even England, of 
all the countries of Western Europe the least dependent on the 
system, had to solve the same problems.Despite all the measures 
taken to avoid unemployment and the reduction of wages, 
poverty continued to spread in the nation.In 1622 appeared a 
pamphlet, Grievous Groan for the Poor , attributed to Thomas 
Dekker, which, emphasizing the danger, condemns the general 
negligence: “Though the number of the poor do daily increase,

all things yet worketh for the worst in their behalf;... many of 
these parishes turneth forth their poor, yea, and their lusty 
labourers that will not work ... to beg, filch, and steal for their 
maintenance, so that the country is pitifully pestered with them.” 
It was feared that they would overrun the country, and since they 
could not, as on the Continent, cross the border into another 
nation, it was proposed that they be “banished and conveyed to 
the New-found Land, the East and West Indies.” In 1630, the 
King established a commission to assure the rigorous observance 
of the Poor Laws.
