That same year, it published a series of “orders 
and directions”; it recommended prosecuting beggars and 
vagabonds, as well as “all those who live in idleness and will not 
work for reasonable wages or who spend what they have in 
taverns.” They must be punished according to law and placed in 
houses of correction; as for those with wives and children, 
investigation must be made as to whether they were married and 
their children baptized, “for these people live like savages 
without being married, nor buried, nor baptized; and it is this 
licentious liberty which causes so many to rejoice in 
vagabondage.” Despite the recovery that began in England in the 
middle of the century, the problem was still unsolved in 
Cromwelfs time, for the Lord Mayor complains of “this vermin 
that troops about the city, disturbing public order, assaulting 
carriages, demanding alms with loud cries at the doors of 
churches and private houses.” 

For a long time, the house of correction or the premises of the 
Hopital General would serve to contain the unemployed, the 
idle, and vagabonds.Each time a crisis occurred and the number 
of the poor sharply increased, the houses of confinement 
regained, at least for a time, their initial economic significance.In the middle of the eighteenth century, there was another great 
crisis: 12,000 begging workers at Rouen and as many at Tours; at 
Lyons the manufactories closed.The Count d’Argenson, “who 
commands the department of Paris and the marshalseas,” gave 


61 



orders “to arrest all the beggars of the kingdom; the marshalseas 
will perform this task in the countryside, while the same thing is 
done in Paris, whither they are sure not to return, being 
entrapped on all sides.” 

But outside of the periods of crisis, confinement acquired 
another meaning.Its repressive function was combined with a 
new use.
