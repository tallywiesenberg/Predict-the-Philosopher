It was no longer merely a question of confining those 
out of work, but of giving work to those who had been confined 
and thus making them contribute to the prosperity of all.The 
alternation is clear: cheap manpower in the periods of full 
employment and high salaries; and in periods of unemployment, 
reabsorption of the idle and social protection against agitation 
and uprisings.Let us not forget that the first houses of 
confinement appear in England in the most industrialized parts 
of the country: Worcester, Norwich, Bristol; that the first hopital 
general was opened in Lyons, forty years before that of Paris; that 
Hamburg was the first German city to have its Zuchthaus , in 
1620.Its regulations, published in 1622, were quite precise.The 
internees must all work.
