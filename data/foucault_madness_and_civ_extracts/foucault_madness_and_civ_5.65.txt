The first houses of correction were opened in England during 
a full economic recession.The act of 1610 recommended only 
joining certain mills and weaving and carding shops to all houses 
of correction in order to occupy the pensioners.But what had 
been a moral requirement became an economic tactic when 
commerce and industry recovered after 1651, the economic 
situation having been re-established by the Navigation Act and 
the lowering of the discount rate.All able-bodied manpower was 
to be used to the best advantage, that is, as cheaply as possible.When John Carey established his workhouse project in Bristol, 
he ranked the need for work first: “The poor of both 
sexes ... may be employed in beating hemp, dressing and 
spinning flax, or in carding wool and cotton.” At Worcester, they 
manufactured clothes and stuffs; a workshop for children was 
established.
