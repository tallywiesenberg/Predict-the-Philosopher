All of which did not always proceed without 
difficulties.It was suggested that the workhouses might enter the 
local industries and markets, on the principle perhaps that such 
cheap production would have a regulatory effect on the sale 
price.But the manufactories protested.Daniel Defoe noticed 
that by the effect of the too easy competition of the workhouses, 
poverty was created in one area on the pretext of suppressing it in 
another; “it is giving to one what you take away from another; 
putting a vagabond in an honest man’s employment, and putting 
diligence on the tenters to find out some other work to maintain 
his family.” Faced with this danger of competition, the 
authorities let the work gradually disappear.The pensioners 
could no longer earn even enough to pay for their upkeep; at 
times it was necessary to put them in prison so that they might at 
least have free bread.
