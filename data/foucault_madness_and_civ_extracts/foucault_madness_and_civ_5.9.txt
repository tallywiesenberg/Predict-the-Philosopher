What is the 
means of remedying it?Work.‚Äù 

The classical age used confinement in an equivocal manner, 
making it play a double role: to reabsorb unemployment, or at 
least eliminate its most visible social effects, and to control costs 
when they seemed likely to become too high; to act alternately 
on the manpower market and on the cost of production.As it 
turned out, it does not seem that the houses of confinement were 
able to play effectively the double role that was expected of them.If they absorbed the unemployed, it was mostly to mask their 
poverty, and to avoid the social or political disadvantages of 
agitation; but at the very moment the unemployed were herded 
into forced-labor shops, unemployment increased in neighboring 
regions or in similar areas.As for the effect on production costs, 
it could only be artificial, the market price of such products being 
disproportionate to the cost of manufacture, calculated according 
to the expenses occasioned by confinement itself.
