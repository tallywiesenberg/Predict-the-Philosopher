that analyzes the strength to be found imprisoned in each. Thus 
cold and dryness can enter into conflict with the temperament, 
and this opposition will generate symptoms of melancholia 
violent in proportion to the struggle: the strength that prevails 
and sweeps away all that resists it. Thus women, whose nature is 
little inclined to melancholy, fall a prey to it all the more 
seriously: “They are cruelly used and violently disturbed by it, for 
melancholia being more opposed to their temperament, it 
removes them further from their natural constitution. ”4 

3. But it is sometimes within the quality itself that the conflict 
is generated. A quality may alter in the course of its development 
and become the opposite of what it was. Thus when “the entrails 
are heated, when all simmers within the body ... and all the 
juices are consumed,” then this conflagration can turn to cold 
melancholia—producing “almost the same thing caused by the 
flow of wax in a torch turned upside down.... This cooling of the 
body is the ordinary effect which follows immoderate heat once 
it has thrown off and exhausted its vigor. ”5 There is a kind of 
dialectic of qualities which, free from any constraint of substance, 
from any predetermination, makes its way through reversals and 
contradictions. 

4. Finally, qualities may be altered by accidents, circumstances, 
the conditions of life; so that a being who is dry and cold can 
become warm and humid, if his way of life inclines him to it; as 
in the case of women: they “remain in idleness, their bodies tend 
to perspire less [than those of men], and heat, spirits, and 
humors remain within.”6

Thus freed from a confining substantial basis, qualities would 
be able to play an organizing and integrating role in the notion 
of melancholia. On the one hand, they would trace, among the 
symptoms and manifestations, a certain profile of sadness, of 
blackness, of slowness, of immobility. On the other, they would 
suggest a causal basis which would no longer be the physiology 
of a humor, but the pathology of an idea, of a fear, of a terror. 
The morbid entity was not defined from observed signs nor from 
supposed causes; but somewhere between, and beyond both, it 
was perceived as a certain qualitative coherence, which had its 
own laws of transmission, of development, and of 
transformation. It is the secret logic of this quality that controls 
the development of the idea of melancholia, not medical theory. 
This is evident as early as Thomas Willis’s texts. 

At first glance, the coherence of their analyses is vouched for
