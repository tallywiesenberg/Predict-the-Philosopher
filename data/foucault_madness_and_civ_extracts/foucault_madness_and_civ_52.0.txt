stupor, would be readily classified as melancholia.8 And as early 
as James’s Dictionary , an apoplectic melancholia is discussed, in 
which the sufferers “refuse to rise from their beds...; once on 
their feet, they will not walk unless they are forced by their 
friends or attendants; they in no way avoid others, but they seem 
to pay no attention to what is said to them; they make no 
answer.” If, in this case, immobility and silence prevail and 
determine the diagnosis of melancholia, there are cases in which 
one observes only bitterness, languor, and a preference for 
isolation; their very agitation must not deceive the observer nor 
authorize a hasty diagnosis of mania; these patients are definitely 
suffering from melancholia, for “they avoid company, prefer 
solitary places, and wander without knowing where they are 
going; they have a yellowish color, a dry tongue as in a person 
suffering from great thirst, and their eyes are dry, hollow, never 
moistened with tears; their entire body is dry and burning hot, 
their face dark, and expressing only horror and sadness.”9 

The analyses of mania and their evolution during the classical 
period obey the same principles of coherence. 

Willis opposes mania to melancholia. The mind of the 
melancholic is entirely occupied by reflection, so that his 
imagination remains at leisure and in repose; the maniac’s 
imagination, on the contrary, is occupied by a perpetual flux of 
impetuous thoughts. While the melancholic’s mind is fixed on a 
single object, imposing unreasonable proportions upon it, but 
upon it alone, mania deforms all concepts and ideas; either they 
lose their congruence, or their representative value is falsified; in 
any case, the totality of thought is disturbed in its essential 
relation to truth. Melancholia, finally, is always accompanied by 
sadness and fear; on the contrary, in the maniac we find audacity

and fury. Whether it is a question of mania or melancholia, the 
cause of the disease is always in the movement of the animal 
spirits. But this movement is quite particular in mania: it is 
continuous, violent, always capable of piercing new pores in the 
cerebral matter, and it creates, as the material basis of incoherent 
thoughts, explosive gestures, continuous words which betray 
mania. Is not such pernicious mobility that of an infernal water, 
sulfurous liquid, those aquae stygiae , ex nitro , vitriolo , antimonio , 
arsenico , et similibus exstillatae : its particles are in perpetual 
movement; they are capable of provoking new pores and new 
channels in any substance; and they have strength enough to 
spread themselves far, exactly as the maniacal spirits are capable 
of spreading agitation through all the parts of the body. An
