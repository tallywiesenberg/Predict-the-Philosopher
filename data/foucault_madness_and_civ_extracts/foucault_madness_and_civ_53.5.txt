surprised that ice water produces such a prompt and perfect cure

of coldness, “the vessels contracted more violently and freed 
themselves of the liquors that crammed them; the irritation of 
the solid parts caused by the extreme heat of the liquors they 
contained ceased, and when the nerves relaxed, the course of the 
spirits that had proceeded irregularly from one side to the other 
was re-established in its natural state.” 

The world of melancholia was humid, heavy, and cold; that of 
mania was parched, dry, compounded of violence and fragility; a 
world which heat—unfelt but everywhere manifested—made 
arid, friable, and always ready to relax under the effect of a moist 
coolness. In the development of all these qualitative 
simplifications, mania attained both its full scope and its unity. It 
has doubtless remained what it was at the beginning of the 
seventeenth century, “fury without fever,” but beyond these two 
characteristics, which were still only descriptive , there developed a 
perceptual theme which was the real organizer of the clinical 
picture. Once the explanatory myths disappeared, and humors, 
spirits, solids, fluids no longer had any currency, there would 
remain only the schema of coherent qualities which would no 
longer even be named, and what this dynamics of heat and 
movement slowly formed into a constellation characteristic of 
mania would now be observed as a natural complex, as an 
immediate truth of psychological observation. What had been 
perceived as heat, imagined as agitation of spirits, conceived as 
fibrous tension, would henceforth be recognized in the 
neutralized transparency of psychological notions: exaggerated 
vivacity of internal impressions, rapidity in the association of 
ideas, inattention to the external world. De la Rive’s description 
already has this limpidity: “External objects do not produce upon 
the mind of a sufferer the same impression as upon the mind of a 
healthy man; these impressions are weak, and the sufferer rarely 
heeds them; his mind is almost entirely absorbed by the action of 
the ideas produced by the deranged state of his brain. These 
ideas have such a degree of vivacity that the sufferer believes they
