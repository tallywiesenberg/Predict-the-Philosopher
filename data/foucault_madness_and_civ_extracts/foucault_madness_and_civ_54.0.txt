represent real objects, and judges accordingly.” But we must not 
forget that this psychological structure of mania, as it appeared 
and was stabilized at the end of the eighteenth century, is only 
the superficial sketch of an entire profound organization, which 
itself would capsize and which had developed according to the 
half-perceptual, half-iconographic laws of a qualitative world. 

No doubt this entire universe of heat and cold, of humidity 
and dryness, reminded medical thought, about to accede to 
positivism, of the circumstances of its own origin. But this 
blazon of images was not simply reminiscence; it was also an 
undertaking. In order to form the practical experience of mania 
or melancholia, this gravitation, against a background of images, 
of qualities attracted to each other by a whole system of sensuous 
and affective affinities was essential. If mania, if melancholia 
henceforth assumed the aspects our science knows them by, it is 
not because in the course of centuries we have learned to “open 
our eyes” to real symptoms; it is not because we have purified our 
perception to the point of transparency; it is because in the 
experience of madness, these concepts were organized around 
certain qualitative themes that lent them their unity, gave them 
their significant coherence, made them finally perceptible. We 
have passed from a simple notional description (fury without 
fever, delirious idee fixe) to a qualitative realm, apparently less 
organized, simpler, less precisely limited, but which alone was 
able to constitute recognizable, palpable units really present in the 
total experience of madness. The field of observation of these 
diseases was partitioned into landscapes that obscurely gave them 
their style and their structure. On the one hand, a sodden, almost 
diluvian world, where man remained deaf, blind, and numb to all 
that was not his one terror: a world simplified in the extreme, 
and immoderately enlarged in a single one of its details. On the 
other, a parched and desertic world, a panic world where all was 
flight, disorder, instantaneous gesture. It was the rigor of these 
themes in their cosmic form—not the approximations of an

observing caution—which organized the experience (already 
almost our own experience) of mania and melancholia. 

It is Willis, with his spirit of observation, the purity of his 
medical perception, whom we honor as the “discoverer” of the 
mania-melancholia alternation. Certainly Willis’s methods are of 
great interest, chiefly in this particular: the transition from one 
affection to the other is seen not as a phenomenon of observation 
for which it was then a matter of discovering the explanation, but
