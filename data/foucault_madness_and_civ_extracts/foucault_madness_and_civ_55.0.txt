acknowledged that the succession of mania and melancholia is a 
phenomenon either of metamorphosis or of remote causality. For 
Joseph Lieutaud, a melancholia that lasts a long time and whose 
delirium is exacerbated loses its traditional symptoms and 
assumes a strange resemblance to mania: “the last stage of 
melancholia has many affinities with mania.” But the status of 
this analogy is not elaborated. For Dufour, the link is even 
looser: it is a remote causal connection, melancholia being able to 
provoke mania, as well as “worms in the frontal sinuses, or 
dilated or varicose vessels.” Without the support of an image, no 
observation succeeded in transforming the evidence of succession 
into a symptomatic structure that was both precise and essential. 

Of course the image of flame and smoke disappeared in 
Willis’s successors; but it was still by images that the work of 
organization was accomplished—images increasingly functional, 
more firmly fixed in the great physiological themes of circulation

and heating, increasingly remote from the cosmic figures Willis 
had borrowed them from. For Boerhaave and his commentator 
Gerard van Swieten, mania formed quite naturally the highest 
degree of melancholia—not only following a frequent 
metamorphosis, but as the result of a necessary dynamic 
sequence: the cerebral liquid, which stagnates in the melancholic, 
becomes agitated after a certain time, for the black bile that fills 
the viscera becomes by its very immobility “bitterer and more 
malignant”; there then form in it more acid and subtler elements 
which, carried to the brain by the blood, provoke the maniac’s 
great agitation. Mania is thus distinguished from melancholia 
only by a difference of degree: it is its natural consequence, it 
results from the same causes, and is ordinarily treated by the 
same remedies. For Friedrich Hoffmann, the unity of mania and 
melancholia is a natural effect of the laws of movement and 
shock; but what is pure mechanics on the level of principles 
becomes dialectics in the development of life and of disease. 
Melancholia, in effect, is characterized by immobility; in other 
words, the thickened blood congests the brain where it 
accumulates; where it ought to circulate, it tends to stop, 
immobilized by its heaviness. But if this heaviness retards 
movement, it also makes the shock more violent at the moment 
it occurs; the brain, the vessels by which it is traversed, its very 
substance, more violently jarred, tend to resist more, therefore to 
harden, and by this hardening the thickened blood is sent back 
more energetically; its movement increases and it is soon caught 
up in that agitation which is mania. We have thus passed quite
