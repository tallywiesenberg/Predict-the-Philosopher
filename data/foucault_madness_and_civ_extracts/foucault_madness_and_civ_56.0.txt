of this is that, just as in a perception, qualitative transitions could 
occur without affecting the integrity of the figure. Thus William 
Cullen would discover in mania, as in melancholia, “a principal 
object of delirium”—and, inversely, would attribute melancholia 
to “a drier and firmer tissue of the brain s medullary substance.” 

The essential thing is that the enterprise did not proceed from 
observation to the construction of explanatory images; that on 
the contrary, the images assured the initial role of synthesis, that 
their organizing force made possible a structure of perception, in 
which at last the symptoms could attain their significant value 
and be organized as the visible presence of the truth.

II. Hysteria and Hypochondria 


Two problems arise where these are concerned. 

1. To what degree is it legitimate to treat them as mental 
diseases, or at least as forms of madness? 

2. Are we entitled to treat them together, as if they constituted 
a virtual couple, similar to that formed quite early by mania and 
melancholia? 

A glance at the classifications is enough to convince us; 
hypochondria does not always appear beside dementia and 
mania; hysteria is very rarely found there. Felix Plater mentioned 
neither one among the lesions of the senses; and at the end of 
the classical period, Cullen still catalogued them in another 
category than that of the vesanias: hypochondria among the 
“adynamias, or diseases which consist of a weakness or a loss of 
movement in the vital or animal functions”; hysteria among “the 
spasmodic affections of the natural functions.” 

Moreover, in nosographic charts one rarely finds these two 
diseases grouped in a logical proximity, or even combined in the 
form of an opposition. Sauvages classifies hypochondria among 
the hallucinations—“hallucinations that concern only the 
health”—hysteria among the forms of convulsion. Linnaeus 
employs the same distinctions. Are they not both faithful to the 
teaching of Willis, who had studied hysteria in his book De
