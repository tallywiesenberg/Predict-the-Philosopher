damnati it must bear the faults of numerous other affections; if a 
disease of unknown nature and hidden origin appears in a 
woman in such a manner that its cause escapes us, and that the 
therapeutic course is uncertain, we immediately blame the bad 
influence of the uterus, which, for the most part, is not 
responsible; and when we are dealing with an inhabitual 
symptom, we declare that there is a trace of hysteria hidden 
beneath it all, and what has so often been the subterfuge of so 
much ignorance we take as the object of our treatment and our 
remedies.” With all due regard to the traditional commentators 
on this text, which is inevitably cited in any study on hysteria, it 
does not mean that Willis suspected the absence of an organic 
basis in symptoms of hysterical affection. He merely says, and in 
an explicit way, that the idea of hysteria is a catchall for the 
fantasies, not of the person who is or believes himself ill, but of 
the ignorant doctor who pretends to know why. Nor does the 
fact that hysteria is classified by Willis among diseases of the 
head indicate that he considered it a disorder of the mind; but 
only that he attributed its origin to a change in the nature, the 
origin, and the initial course of the animal spirits. 

However, at the end of the eighteenth century, hypochondria 
and hysteria figured, almost without dispute, on the escutcheon 
of mental disease. In 1755 Alberti published at Halle his 
dissertation De morbis imaginariis hypochondriacorum\ and 
Lieutaud, while defining hypochondria by its spasms, recognized 
that “the mind is affected as much as and perhaps more than the 
body; hence the term hypochondriac has become almost an 
offensive name avoided by physicians who would please.” As for 
hysteria, Joseph Raulin no longer ascribes to it any organic 
reality, at least in his basic definition, establishing it from the 
start in a pathology of the imagination: “This disease in which 
women invent, exaggerate, and repeat all the various absurdities 
of which a disordered imagination is capable, has sometimes 
become epidemic and contagious.”

There were thus two essential lines of development, during the 
classical period, for hysteria and hypochondria. One united them 
to form a common concept which was that of a “disease of the
