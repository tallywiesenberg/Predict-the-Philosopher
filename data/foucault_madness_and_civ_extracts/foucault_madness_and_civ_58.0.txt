the hypochondriac regions is completely dry: hypochondriacal 
melancholia is a “hot, dry” illness, caused by “humors of the like 
quality.” But some perceived no heat in either hysteria or 
hypochondria: the quality peculiar to these maladies was on the 
contrary languor, inertia, and a cold humidity like that of the 
stagnant humors: “I think that these affections [hypochondriacal 
and hysterical], when they last for some time, come from the 
fibers of the brain and the nerves when they are slack and 
therefore feeble, without action or elasticity; as a consequence of 
which the nervous fluid is impoverished and without force. ”12 
There is probably no text that bears better witness to the 
qualitative instability of hysteria than George Cheyne’s book The 
English Malady', according to Cheyne, the disease maintains its 
unity only in an abstract manner; its symptoms are dispersed into 
different qualitative regions and attributed to mechanisms that 
belong to each of these regions in its own right. All symptoms of 
spasm, cramp, and convulsion derive from a pathology of heat 
symbolized by “harmful, bitter, or acrimonious vapors.” On the 
contrary, all psychological or organic signs of weakness 
—“depression, syncopes, inactivity of the mind, lethargic torpor, 
melancholia, and sadness”—manifest a condition of fibers which

have become too humid or too weak, doubtless under the effect 
of cold, viscous, thick humors that obstruct the glands and the 
vessels, serous and sanguine alike. As for paralyses, they signify 
both a chilling and an immobilization of the fibers, “an 
interruption of vibrations,” frozen so to speak in the general 
inertia of solids. 

It was as difficult for the phenomena of hysteria and 
hypochondria to find a place within the compass of qualities as it 
was easy for mania and melancholia to be established there. 

The medicine of movement was just as indecisive in dealing 
with them, its analyses just as unstable. It was quite clear, at least 
to any perception that did not reject its own images, that mania 
was related to an excessive mobility; melancholia, on the 
contrary, to a diminution of movement. For hysteria and for 
hypochondria as well, the choice was a difficult one. Georg Ernst 
Stahl opts instead for an increasing heaviness of the blood, which 
becomes so abundant and so thick that it is no longer capable of 
circulating regularly through the portal vein; it has a tendency to 
stagnate, to collect there, and the crisis is a result “of the effort it 
makes to effect an issue either by the higher or the lower parts.” 
For Boerhaave, on the contrary, and for Van Swieten, hysterical 
movement is due to an excessive mobility of all the fluids, which
