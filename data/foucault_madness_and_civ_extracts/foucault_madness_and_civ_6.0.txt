Labor and poverty were located in a simple 
opposition, in inverse proportion to each other.As for that 
power, its special characteristic, of abolishing poverty, labor— 
according to the classical interpretation—possessed it not so 
much by its productive capacity as by a certain force of moral 
enchantment.Labor’s effectiveness was acknowledged because it 
was based on an ethical transcendence.Since the Fall, man had 
accepted labor as a penance and for its power to work 
redemption.It was not a law of nature which forced man to 
work, but the effect of a curse.
