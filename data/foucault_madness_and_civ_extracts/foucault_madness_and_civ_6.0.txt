attached to the figure of the leper as well as the meaning of his 
exclusion, the social importance of that insistent and fearful 
figure which was not driven off without first being inscribed 
within a sacred circle. 

If the leper was removed from the world, and from the 
community of the Church visible, his existence was yet a 
constant manifestation of God, since it was a sign both of His 
anger and of His grace: “My friend,” says the ritual of the 
Church of Vienne, “it pleaseth Our Lord that thou shouldst be 
infected with this malady, and thou hast great grace at the hands 
of Our Lord that he desireth to punish thee for thy iniquities in 
this world.” And at the very moment when the priest and his 
assistants drag him out of the church with backward step, the 
leper is assured that he still bears witness for God: “And 
howsoever thou mayest be apart from the Church and the 
company of the Sound, yet art thou not apart from the grace of 
God.” Brueghefs lepers attend at a distance, but forever, that 
climb to Calvary on which the entire people accompanies Christ. 
Hieratic witnesses of evil, they accomplish their salvation in and 
by their very exclusion: in a strange reversibility that is the 
opposite of good works and prayer, they are saved by the hand 
that is not stretched out. The sinner who abandons the leper at 
his door opens his way to heaven. “For which have patience in 
thy malady; for Our Lord hateth thee not because of it, keepeth 
thee not from his company; but if thou hast patience thou wilt be 
saved, as was the leper who died before the gate of the rich man 
and was carried straight to paradise.” Abandonment is his 
salvation; his exclusion offers him another form of communion. 

Leprosy disappeared, the leper vanished, or almost, from 
memory; these structures remained. Often, in these same places, 
the formulas of exclusion would be repeated, strangely similar 
two or three centuries later. Poor vagabonds, criminals, and

“deranged minds” would take the part played by the leper, and 
we shall see what salvation was expected from this exclusion, for 
them and for those who excluded them as well. With an 
altogether new meaning and in a very different culture, the forms 
would remain—essentially that major form of a rigorous division 
which is social exclusion but spiritual reintegration. 

Something new appears in the imaginary landscape of the 
Renaissance; soon it will occupy a privileged place there: the 
Ship of Fools, a strange “drunken boat” that glides along the
