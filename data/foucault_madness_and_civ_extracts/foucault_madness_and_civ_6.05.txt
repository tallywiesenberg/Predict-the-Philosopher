The earth was innocent of that 
sterility in which it would slumber if man remained idle: “The 
land had not sinned, and if it is accursed, it is by the labor of the 
fallen man who cultivates it; from it no fruit is won, particularly 
the most necessary fruit, save by force and continual labor.”6 

The obligation to work was not linked to any confidence in 
nature; and it was not even through an obscure loyalty that the 
land would reward man’s labor.The theme was constant among 
Catholic thinkers, as among the Protestants, that labor does not 
bear its own fruits.Produce and wealth were not found at the 
term of a dialectic of labor and nature.Here is Calvin’s 
admonition: “Nor do we believe, according as men will be 
vigilant and skillful, according as they will have done their duty 
well, that they can make their land fertile; it is the benediction of 
God which governs all things.” And this danger of a labor which 
would remain sterile if God did not intervene in His infinite 
mercy is acknowledged in turn by Bossuet: “At each moment, 
the hope of the harvest and the unique fruit of all our labors may 
escape us; we are at the mercy of the inconstant heavens that

bring down rain upon the tender ears.” This precarious labor to 
which nature is never obliged to respond—save by the special 
will of God—is nonetheless obligatory in all strictness: not on 
the level of natural syntheses, but on the level of moral syntheses.The poor man who, without consenting to “torment” the land, 
waits until God comes to his aid, since He has promised to feed 
the birds of the sky, would be disobeying the great law of 
Scripture: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” Does not 
reluctance to work mean “trying beyond measure the power of 
God,” as Calvin says?
