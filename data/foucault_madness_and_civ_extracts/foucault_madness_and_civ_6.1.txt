It is seeking to constrain the miracle, 7 
whereas the miracle is granted daily to man as the gratuitous 
reward of his labor.If it is true that labor is not inscribed among 
the laws of nature, it is enveloped in the order of the fallen 
world.This is why idleness is rebellionâ€”the worst form of all, in 
a sense: it waits for nature to be generous as in the innocence of 
Eden, and seeks to constrain a Goodness to which man cannot 
lay claim since Adam.Pride was the sin of man before the Fall; 
but the sin of idleness is the supreme pride of man once he has 
fallen, the absurd pride of poverty.In our world, where the land 
is no longer fertile except in thistles and weeds, idleness is the 
fault par excellence.
