In the Middle Ages, the great sin, radix 
malorum omnium, was pride, Superbia.According to Johan 
Huizinga, there was a time, at the dawn of the Renaissance, 
when the supreme sin assumed the aspect of Avarice, Dante’s 
cicca cupidigia.All the seventeenth-century texts, on the contrary, 
announced the infernal triumph of Sloth: it was sloth which led 
the round of the vices and swept them on.Let us not forget that 
according to the edict of its creation, the Hopital General must 
prevent “mendicancy and idleness as sources of all disorder.” 
Louis Bourdaloue echoes these condemnations of sloth, the 
wretched pride of fallen man: “What, then, is the disorder of an 
idle life?It is, replies Saint Ambrose, in its true meaning a 
second rebellion of the creature against God.” Labor in the

houses of confinement thus assumed its ethical meaning: since 
sloth had become the absolute form of rebellion, the idle would 
be forced to work, in the endless leisure of a labor without utility 
or profit.
