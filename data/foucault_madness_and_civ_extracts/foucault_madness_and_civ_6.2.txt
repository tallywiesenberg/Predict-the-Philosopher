It was in a certain experience of labor that the indissociably 
economic and moral demand for confinement was formulated.Between labor and idleness in the classical world ran a line of 
demarcation that replaced the exclusion of leprosy.The asylum 
was substituted for the lazar house, in the geography of haunted 
places as in the landscape of the moral universe.The old rites of 
excommunication were revived, but in the world of production 
and commerce.It was in these places of doomed and despised 
idleness, in this space invented by a society which had derived an 
ethical transcendence from the law of work, that madness would 
appear and soon expand until it had annexed them.
