A day was to 
come when it could possess these sterile reaches of idleness by a 
sort of very old and very dim right of inheritance.The 
nineteenth century would consent, would even insist that to the 
mad and to them alone be transferred these lands on which, a 
hundred and fifty years before, men had sought to pen the poor, 
the vagabond, the unemployed.It is not immaterial that madmen were included in the 
proscription of idleness.From its origin, they would have their 
place beside the poor, deserving or not, and the idle, voluntary or 
not.Like them, they would be subject to the rules of forced 
labor.
