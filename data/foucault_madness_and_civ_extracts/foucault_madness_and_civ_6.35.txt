In the 
classical age, for the first time, madness was perceived through a 
condemnation of idleness and in a social immanence guaranteed 
by the community of labor.This community acquired an ethical 
power of segregation, which permitted it to eject, as into another 
world, all forms of social uselessness.It was in this other world , 
encircled by the sacred powers of labor, that madness would 
assume the status we now attribute to it.If there is, in classical 
madness, something which refers elsewhere, and to other things , 
it is no longer because the madman comes from the world of the 
irrational and bears its stigmata; rather, it is because he crosses 
the frontiers of bourgeois order of his own accord, and alienates 
himself outside the sacred limits of its ethic.In fact, the relation between the practice of confinement and 
the insistence on work is not defined by economic conditions; far 
from it.
