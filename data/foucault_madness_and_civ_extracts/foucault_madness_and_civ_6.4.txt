A moral perception sustains and animates it.When the 
Board of Trade published its report on the poor in which it 
proposed the means “to render them useful to the public,” it was 
made quite clear that the origin of poverty was neither scarcity of 
commodities nor unemployment, but “the weakening of 
discipline and the relaxation of morals.” The edict of 1657, too, 
was full of moral denunciations and strange threats.“The 
libertinage of beggars has risen to excess because of an 
unfortunate tolerance of crimes of all sorts, which attract the 
curse of God upon the State when they remain unpunished.” 
This “libertinage” is not the kind that can be defined in relation 
to the great law of work, but a moral libertinage: “Experience 
having taught those persons who are employed in charitable 
occupations that many among them of either sex live together 
without marriage, that many of their children are unbaptized, 
and that almost all of them live in ignorance of religion,

disdaining the sacraments, and continually practicing all sorts of 
vice.” Hence the Hopital does not have the appearance of a mere 
refuge for those whom age, infirmity, or sickness keep from 
working; it will have not only the aspect of a forced labor camp, 
but also that of a moral institution responsible for punishing, for 
correcting a certain moral “abeyance” which does not merit the 
tribunal of men, but cannot be corrected by the severity of 
penance alone.The Hopital General has an ethical status.It is 
this moral charge which invests its directors, and they are 
granted every judicial apparatus and means of repression: “They 
have power of authority, of direction, of administration, of 
commerce, of police, of jurisdiction, of correction and 
punishment”; and to accomplish this task “stakes, irons, prisons, 
and dungeons”8 are put at their disposal.
