And it is in this context that the obligation to work assumes 
its meaning as both ethical exercise and moral guarantee.It will 
serve as askesis , as punishment, as symptom of a certain 
disposition of the heart.The prisoner who could and who would 
work would be released, not so much because he was again useful 
to society, but because he had again subscribed to the great 
ethical pact of human existence.In April 1684, a decree created 
within the Hopital a section for boys and girls under twenty-five; 
it specified that work must occupy the greater part of the day, 
and must be accompanied by “the reading of pious books.” But 
the ruling defines the purely repressive nature of this work, 
beyond any concern for production: “They will be made to work 
as long and as hard as their strengths and situations will permit.” 
It is then, but only then, that they can be taught an occupation 
“fitting their sex and inclination,” insofar as the measure of their 
zeal in the first activities makes it possible to “judge that they 
desire to reform.” Finally, every fault “will be punished by 
reduction of gruel, by increase of work, by imprisonment and 
other punishments customary in the said hospitals, as the

directors shall see fit.” It is enough to read the “general 
regulations for daily life in the House of Saint-Louis de la 
Salpetriere” to understand that the very requirement of labor was 
instituted as an exercise in moral reform and constraint, which 
reveals, if not the ultimate meaning, at least the essential 
justification of confinement.An important phenomenon, this invention of a site of 
constraint, where morality castigates by means of administrative 
enforcement.
