For the first time, institutions of morality are 
established in which an astonishing synthesis of moral obligation 
and civil law is effected.The law of nations will no longer 
countenance the disorder of hearts.To be sure, this is not the 
first time in European culture that moral error, even in its most 
private form, has assumed the aspect of a transgression against 
the written or unwritten laws of the community.But in this great 
confinement of the classical age, the essential thing—and the 
new event—is that men were confined in cities of pure morality, 
where the law that should reign in all hearts was to be applied 
without compromise, without concession, in the rigorous forms 
of physical constraint.Morality permitted itself to be 
administered like trade or economy.
