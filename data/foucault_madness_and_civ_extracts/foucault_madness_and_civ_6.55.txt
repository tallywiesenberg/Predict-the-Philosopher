Thus we see inscribed in the institutions of absolute monarchy 
—in the very ones that long remained the symbol of its arbitrary 
power—the great bourgeois, and soon republican, idea that 
virtue, too, is an affair of state, that decrees can be published to 
make it flourish, that an authority can be established to make 
sure it is respected.The walls of confinement actually enclose the 
negative of that moral city of which the bourgeois conscience 
began to dream in the seventeenth century; a moral city for those 
who sought, from the start, to avoid it, a city where right reigns 
only by virtue of a force without appeal—a sort of sovereignty of 
good, in which intimidation alone prevails and the only 
recompense of virtue (to this degree its own reward) is to escape 
punishment.In the shadows of the bourgeois city is born this

strange republic of the good which is imposed by force on all 
those suspected of belonging to evil.This is the underside of the 
bourgeoisie’s great dream and great preoccupation in the classical 
age: the laws of the State and the laws of the heart at last 
identical.“Let our politicians leave off their calculations ... let 
them learn once and for all that everything can be had for 
money, except morals and citizens.”9 

Is this not the dream that seems to have haunted the founders 
of the house of confinement in Hamburg?
