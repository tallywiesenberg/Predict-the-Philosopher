One of the directors is 
to see that “all in the house are properly instructed as to religious 
and moral duties....The schoolmaster must instruct the children 
in religion, and encourage them, at proper times, to learn and 
repeat portions of Scripture.He must also teach them reading, 
writing and accounts, and a decent behaviour to those that visit 
the house.He must take care that they attend divine service, and 

are orderly at it.” In England, the workhouse regulations 
devote much space to the surveillance of morals and to religious 
education.Thus for the house in Plymouth, a schoolmaster is to 
be appointed who will fulfill the triple requirement of being 
“pious, sober, and discreet.” Every morning and evening, at the 
prescribed hour, it will be his task to preside at prayers; every 
Saturday afternoon and on holidays, he will address the inmates, 
exhorting and instructing them in “the fundamental parts of the 
Protestant religion, according to the doctrine of the Church of 
England.” Hamburg or Plymouth, Zuchthausern and workhouses 
—throughout Protestant Europe, fortresses of moral order were 
constructed, in which were taught religion and whatever was 
necessary to the peace of the State.
