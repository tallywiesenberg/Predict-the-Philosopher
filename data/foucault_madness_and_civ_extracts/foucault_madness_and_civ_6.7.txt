In this sense, “confinement” conceals both 
a metaphysics of government and a politics of religion; it is 
situated, as an effort of tyrannical synthesis, in the vast space 
separating the garden of God and the cities which men, driven 
from paradise, have built with their own hands.The house of 
confinement in the classical age constitutes the densest symbol of 
that “police” which conceived of itself as the civil equivalent of 
religion for the edification of a perfect city.Confinement was an institutional creation peculiar to the 
seventeenth century.It acquired from the first an importance 
that left it no rapport with imprisonment as practiced in the 
Middle Ages.As an economic measure and a social precaution, it 
had the value of inventiveness.
