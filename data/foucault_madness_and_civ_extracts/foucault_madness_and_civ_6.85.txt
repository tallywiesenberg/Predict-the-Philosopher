And through these parallels, these strange 
complicities, the age sketched the profile of its own experience of 
unreason.But in each of these cities, we find an entire population of 
madness as well.One-tenth of all the arrests made in Paris for 
the Hopital General concern “the insane,” “demented” men, 
individuals of “wandering mind,” and “persons who have become 
completely mad.” Between these and the others, no sign of a 
differentiation.Judging from the registries, the same sensibility 
appears to collect them, the same gestures to set them apart.We 
leave it to medical archaeology to determine whether or not a 
man was sick, criminal, or insane who was admitted to the 
hospital for “derangement of morals,” or because he had 
“mistreated his wife” and tried several times to kill himself.
