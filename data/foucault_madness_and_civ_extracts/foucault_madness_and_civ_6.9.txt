Yet it must not be forgotten that the “insane” had as such a 
particular place in the world of confinement.Their status was 
not merely that of prisoners.In the general sensibility to

without exact semantic distinction, insane, alienated, deranged, 
demented, extravagant.This particular form of sensibility traces the features proper to 
madness in the world of unreason.It is primarily concerned with 
scandal.
