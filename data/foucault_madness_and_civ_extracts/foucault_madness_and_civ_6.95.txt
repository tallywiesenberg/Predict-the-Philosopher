thereby an important change in the consciousness of evil.The 
Renaissance had freely allowed the forms of unreason to come 
out into the light of day; public outrage gave evil the powers of 
example and redemption.Gilles de Rais, accused, in the fifteenth 
century, of having been and of being “a heretic, an apostate, a 
sorcerer, a sodomite, an invoker of evil spirits, a soothsayer, a 
slayer of innocents, an idolater, working evil by deviation from 
the faith,” ended by himself admitting to crimes “sufficient to 
cause the deaths of ten thousand persons” in extrajudiciary 
confession; he repeated his avowal in Latin before the tribunal; 
then he asked, of his own accord, that “the said confession 
should be published in the vulgar tongue and exhibited to each 
and every one of those present, the majority of whom knew no 
Latin, the publication and confession to his shame of the said 
offenses by him committed, in order the more easily to obtain 
the remission of sins, and the mercy of God for the pardon of 
the sins by him committed.” At the trial, the same confession 
was required before those assembled: he “was told by the 
Presiding Judge that he should state his case fully, and the shame 
that he would gain thereby would serve to lessen the punishment 
he would suffer hereafter.” Until the seventeenth century, evil in 
all its most violent and most inhuman forms could not be dealt 
with and punished unless it was brought into the open.The light 
in which confession was made and punishment executed could 
alone balance the darkness from which evil issued.
