experienced by hypochondriacs and hysterics have their seat in 
the nervous parts, and especially in the membranes of the 
stomach and the intestines, from which they are communicated 
by the intercostal nerve to the head, to the chest, to the kidneys, 
to the liver, and to all the principal organs of the body.” 

The role Hoffmann assigns to the intestines, the stomach, and 
the intercostal nerve is indicative of the manner in which the 
problem was presented in the classical period. It was not so much 
a question of escaping the old localization in the uterus, but of 
discovering the principle and the pathways of a diverse, 
polymorphous disease dispersed throughout the entire body. A 
disease was to be accounted for that could attack the head as well 
as the legs, express itself in a paralysis or in frenzied movements, 
that could bring on catalepsy or insomnia: in short, a disease that 
traversed corporeal space so rapidly and so ingeniously that it was 
virtually present throughout the entire body. 

It is futile to insist on the change of medical horizons that 
occurred from Marinello to Hoffmann. Nothing subsists of that 
famous mobility ascribed to the uterus, which had constantly 
figured in the Hippocratic tradition. Nothing, except perhaps a 
certain theme which appeared more clearly now that it was no 
longer confined to a single medical theory, but persisted 
unchanged through the succession of speculative concepts and 
explanatory schemas. This was the theme of a dynamic upheaval 
of corporeal space, of a tide of the lower powers, which, too long 
constrained and, as it were, congested, began to seethe and 
ultimately spread their disorder—with or without the brain’s

mediation—through the entire body. This theme remained 
almost stationary until the beginning of the eighteenth century, 
despite the complete reorganization of physiological concepts. 
And strangely enough, it was during the eighteenth century, 
when no theoretical or experimental innovation in pathology had 
occurred, that the theme was suddenly modified, changed 
direction—that a dynamics of corporeal space was replaced by a 
morality of sensibility. It was then, and only then, that the ideas 
of hysteria and hypochondria were to veer, and definitively enter 
the world of madness. 

We must try now to reconstitute the evolution of the theme, 
in each of its three stages: 

1. a dynamics of organic and moral penetration;
