causes so violent a palpitation of the heart that the sick person 
does not doubt that his attendants must be able to hear the 
sound his heart makes as it beats against his ribs.” Finally, if it 
attacks “the exterior part of the head, between the cranium and 
the pericranium, and there remains fixed in a single spot, it 
causes an extreme pain that is accompanied by violent fits of 
vomiting.” 14 Each part of the body determines in its own right 
and by its own nature the form of the symptom produced. 
Hysteria thus appears as the most real and the most deceptive of 
diseases; real because it is based upon a movement of the animal 
spirits; illusory as well, because it generates symptoms that seem 
provoked by a disorder inherent in the organs, whereas they are 
only the formation, at the level of these organs, of a central or

rather general disorder; it is the derangement of internal mobility 
that assumes the appearance, on the body’s surface, of a local 
symptom. Actually suffering from the disordered and excessive 
movement of spirits, the organ imitates its own illness; starting 
from a defect in the movement within internal space, it imitates 
a disorder that strictly belongs to itself; in this manner, hysteria 
“imitates almost all the maladies to which human flesh is subject, 
for in whatever part of the body it lodges, it immediately 
produces the symptoms that are proper to that part, and if the 
physician does not have great wisdom and experience, he will 
easily be deceived and will attribute to an illness essential and 
proper to such and such a part, symptoms that are entirely the 
result of hysterical affection”: 15 stratagems of a disease that, 
traversing corporeal space in the homogenous form of 
movement, manifests itself in specific aspects; but the type, here, 
is not essence; it is a ruse of the body. 

The more easily penetrable the internal space becomes, the 
more frequent is hysteria and the more various its aspects; but if 
the body is firm and resistant, if internal space is dense, 
organized, and solidly heterogeneous in its different regions, the 
symptoms of hysteria are rare and its effects will remain simple. 
Is this not exactly what separates female hysteria from the male 
variety, or, if you will, hysteria from hypochondria? Neither 
symptoms, in fact, nor even causes form the principle of 
separation between the diseases, but only the spatial solidarity of 
the body, and so to speak the density of the interior landscape: 
“Beyond what we may call the exterior man, who is composed of 
parts which are visible to the senses, there is an interior man 
formed of a system of animal spirits, a man who can be seen only 
with the eyes of the mind. This latter man, closely joined and so 
to speak united with the corporeal constitution, is more or less
