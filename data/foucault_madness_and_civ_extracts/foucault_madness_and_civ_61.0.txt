causes so violent a palpitation of the heart that the sick person 
does not doubt that his attendants must be able to hear the 
sound his heart makes as it beats against his ribs.” Finally, if it 
attacks “the exterior part of the head, between the cranium and 
the pericranium, and there remains fixed in a single spot, it 
causes an extreme pain that is accompanied by violent fits of 
vomiting.” 14 Each part of the body determines in its own right 
and by its own nature the form of the symptom produced. 
Hysteria thus appears as the most real and the most deceptive of 
diseases; real because it is based upon a movement of the animal 
spirits; illusory as well, because it generates symptoms that seem 
provoked by a disorder inherent in the organs, whereas they are 
only the formation, at the level of these organs, of a central or 


158 


rather general disorder; it is the derangement of internal mobility 
that assumes the appearance, on the body’s surface, of a local 
symptom. Actually suffering from the disordered and excessive 
movement of spirits, the organ imitates its own illness; starting 
from a defect in the movement within internal space, it imitates 
a disorder that strictly belongs to itself; in this manner, hysteria 
“imitates almost all the maladies to which human flesh is subject, 
for in whatever part of the body it lodges, it immediately 
produces the symptoms that are proper to that part, and if the 
physician does not have great wisdom and experience, he will 
easily be deceived and will attribute to an illness essential and 
proper to such and such a part, symptoms that are entirely the 
result of hysterical affection”: 15 stratagems of a disease that, 
traversing corporeal space in the homogenous form of 
movement, manifests itself in specific aspects; but the type, here, 
is not essence; it is a ruse of the body. 

The more easily penetrable the internal space becomes, the 
more frequent is hysteria and the more various its aspects; but if 
the body is firm and resistant, if internal space is dense, 
organized, and solidly heterogeneous in its different regions, the 
symptoms of hysteria are rare and its effects will remain simple. 
Is this not exactly what separates female hysteria from the male 
variety, or, if you will, hysteria from hypochondria? Neither 
symptoms, in fact, nor even causes form the principle of 
separation between the diseases, but only the spatial solidarity of 
the body, and so to speak the density of the interior landscape: 
“Beyond what we may call the exterior man, who is composed of 
parts which are visible to the senses, there is an interior man 
formed of a system of animal spirits, a man who can be seen only 
with the eyes of the mind. This latter man, closely joined and so 
to speak united with the corporeal constitution, is more or less 
deranged from his state to the degree that the principles which 
form the machine have a natural firmness. That is why this 


159 


disease attacks women more than men, because they have a more 
delicate, less firm constitution, because they lead a softer life, and 
because they are accustomed to the luxuries and commodities of 
life and not to suffering.” And already, in the lines of this text, 
this spatial density yields one of its meanings: it is also a moral 
density; the resistance of the organs to the disordered penetration 
of the spirits is perhaps one and the same thing as that strength 
of soul which keeps the thoughts and the desires in order. This 
internal space which has become permeable and porous is 
perhaps only the laxity of the heart. Which explains why so few 
women are hysterical when they are accustomed to a hard and 
laborious life, yet strongly incline to become so when they lead a 
soft, idle, luxurious, and lax existence; or if some sorrow manages 
to conquer their resolution: “When women consult me about 
some complaint whose nature I cannot determine, I ask if the 
malady from which they are suffering attacks them only when 
they have some sorrow ...: if they admit as much, I am fully 
assured that their complaint is an hysterical affection.”!6 

Thus we have a new formulation of the old moral intuition 
that from the time of Hippocrates and Plato had made the 
womb a living and perpetually mobile animal, and distributed the 
spatial ordering of its movements; this intuition perceived in 
hysteria the incoercible agitation of desires in those who had 
neither the possibility of satisfying them nor the strength to 
master them; the image of the female organ rising to the breast 
and to the head gave a mythical expression to an upheaval in the 
great Platonic tripartition and in the hierarchy that was intended 
to assure its immobility. For Sydenham, for the disciples of 
Descartes, the moral intuition is identical; but the spatial 
landscape in which it is expressed has changed; Plato’s vertical 
and hieratic order is replaced by a volume which is traversed by 
incessant motion whose disorder is no longer a revolution of the 
depths to the heights but a lawless whirlwind in a chaotic space.

This “interior body” which Sydenham tried to penetrate with 
“the eyes of the mind” was not the objective body available to the 
dull gaze of a neutralized observation; it was the site where a 
certain manner of imagining the body and of deciphering its
