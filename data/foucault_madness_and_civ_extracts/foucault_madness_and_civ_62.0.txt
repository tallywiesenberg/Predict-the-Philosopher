internal movements combined with a certain manner of investing 
it with moral values. The development is completed, the work 
done on the level of this ethical perception. In this perception the 
ever pliant images of medical theory are inflected and altered; in 
it, too, the great moral themes are formulated and gradually alter 
their initial aspect. 

This penetrable body must, however, be a continuous body. 
The dispersion of the disease through the organs is only the 
reverse of a movement of propagation which permits it to pass 
from one to another and to affect them all in succession. If the 
body of the hypochondriac or the hysteric is a porous body, 
separated from itself, distended by the invasion of disease, this 
invasion can be effected only by means of a certain spatial 
continuity. The body in which the disease circulates must have 
other properties than the body in which the sufferer s dispersed 
symptoms appear. 

The problem haunted eighteenth-century medicine, and was 
to make hypochondria and hysteria diseases of the “nervous 
type”; that is, idiopathic diseases of the general agency of all the 
sympathies. 

The nervous fiber is endowed with remarkable properties, 
which permit it to integrate the most heterogeneous elements. Is 
it not astonishing that, responsible for transmitting the most 
diverse impressions, the nerves should be of the same nature 
everywhere, and in every organ? “The nerve whose expansion at 
the back of the eye makes it possible to receive the impression of 
so subtle a matter as light; the nerve which, in the organ of 
hearing, becomes sensitive to the vibrations of sonorous bodies, 
differs no whit in nature from those which serve the grosser

sensations such as touch, taste, and odor.” This identity of 
nature, in different functions, assures the possibility of 
communication between the most distant organs, and those most 
dissimilar physiologically: “This homogeneity in the nerves of 
the animal, combined with the numerous communications that 
all maintain with each other ... establishes among the organs a 
harmony that often makes one or several parts participate in the 
affections of those which are injured.”! - But what is still more 
admirable, a nervous fiber can transmit simultaneously the 
stimulus of a voluntary movement and the impression left on the 
organ by the senses. Simon-Andre Tissot conceived this double 
function of one and the same fiber as the combination of an
