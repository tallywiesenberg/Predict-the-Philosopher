undulatory movement for voluntary stimulus (“this is the 
movement of a fluid enclosed in a malleable container, in a 
bladder, for example, that when I press it would eject liquid 
through a tube”) and a corpuscular movement for sensation (“this 
is the movement of a succession of ivory balls”). Thus sensation 
and movement can be produced at the same time in the same 
nerve: any tension and any relaxation in the fiber will alter both 
movements and sensations, as we can observe in all nervous 
diseases. 

And yet, despite all these unifying virtues of the nervous 
system, is it certain that we can explain, by the real network of its 
fibers, the cohesion of such diverse disorders as those which 
characterize hysteria or hypochondria? How conceive the liaison 
among the signs that from one part of the body to the other 
betray the presence of a nervous affection? How explain, and by 
tracing what line of connection, that in certain “delicate and 
highly sensitive” women a heady perfume or the too vivid 
description of a tragic event or even the sight of a combat 
produces such an impression that they “fall into syncopes or 
suffer convulsions”? One seeks in vain: no precise liaison of the 
nerves; no path proceeding from the original cause; but only a

remote, indirect action which is rather on the order of a 
physiological solidarity. This is because the different parts of the 
body possess a “very determined faculty, which is either general 
and extends throughout the entire system of animal economy, or 
particular and influences certain parts principally.” This very 
distinct property of both “the faculty of feeling and that of 
moving” which permits the organs to communicate with each 
other and to suffer together, to react to a stimulus, however 
distant—is sympathy. As a matter of fact, Whytt succeeded 
neither in isolating sympathy in the ensemble of the nervous 
system, nor in defining it in relation to sensibility and to 
movement Sympathy exists in the organs only insofar as it is 
received there through the intermediary of the nerves; it is the 
more marked in proportion to their mobility, and at the same 
time it is one of the forms of sensibility: “All sympathy, all 
consensus presupposes sentiment and consequently can exist only 
by the mediation of the nerves, which are the only instruments 
by which sensation operates.”!^ But the nervous system is no 
longer invoked here to explain the exact transmission of a 
movement or a sensation, but to justify, in its totality and its 
mass, the body’s sensibility with regard to its own phenomena, 
and its own echo across the volumes of its organic space.
