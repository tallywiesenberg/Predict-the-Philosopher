Is this sympathy, basically, a property hidden in each organ— 
that “sentiment” which Cheyne spoke of—or a real propagation 
through an intermediary element? And is the pathological 
proximity which characterizes these nervous diseases an 
exasperation of this sentiment, or a greater mobility of this 
interstitial body? 

It is a curious but doubtless characteristic phenomenon of 
medical thought in the eighteenth century, in the period when 
physiologists tried to define most precisely the functions and the 
role of the nervous system (sensibility and irritability; sensation 
and movement), that physicians used these ideas indiscriminately 
in the undifferentiated unity of pathological perception, 
articulating them according to a schema entirely different from 
that proposed by physiology. 

Sensibility and movement are not distinguished. Tissot 
explains that the child has more sensibility than anyone else 
because in him everything is lighter and more mobile; irritability, 
in the sense in which Haller understood a property of the 
nervous fiber, is identified with irritation, understood as the 
pathological state of an organ aroused by a prolonged stimulus. It 
would thus be acknowledged that nervous diseases were states of 
irritation combined with an excessive mobility of the fibers. 

“On occasion one sees persons for whom the smallest moving 
cause occasions much more movement than it produces in 
healthy persons; they cannot sustain the slightest alien 
impression. The faintest sound, the weakest light affords them 
extraordinary symptoms.”20 By this deliberately preserved 
ambiguity in the notion of irritation, medicine at the end of the 
eighteenth century could in effect show the continuity between 
disposition (irritability) and the pathological event (irritation); 
but it could also maintain both the theme of a disorder proper to 
an organ which suffers, but in a fashion all its own, a general 
attack (it is the sensibility particular to the organ which assures

this nonetheless discontinuous communication), and the idea of 
a propagation in the organism of a single disorder that can attack 
it in each of its parts (it is the mobility of the fiber which is 
responsible for this continuity, despite the diverse forms it
