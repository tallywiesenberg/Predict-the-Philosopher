by the concern to equilibrate liquids and solids. For if water has

powers of impregnation, which place it first among the 
humectants, it has, insofar as it can receive supplementary 
qualities like cold and heat, the virtues of constriction, of cooling 
or of heating, and it can even have those effects of consolidation 
attributed to substances like iron. In fact, the interplay of 
qualities is very labile, in the fluid substance of water; just as it 
penetrates easily into the web of all the tissues, it may be easily 
impregnated by all the qualitative influences to which it is 
subjected. Paradoxically, its universal use in the eighteenth 
century was not the result of a general recognition of its effect 
and mode of action, but of the ease with which the most 
contradictory forms and modalities could be attributed to its 
action. It is the locus of all possible therapeutic themes, forming 
an inexhaustible reservoir of operative metaphors. In this fluid 
element occurs the universal exchange of qualities. 

Of course, cold water cools. Otherwise would it be used in 
frenzy and mania—diseases of heat, in which the spirits boil, 
solids stretch, liquids seethe to the point of evaporation, leaving 
the brains of these sufferers “dry and fragile,” as anatomy can 
daily testify? Reasonably enough, Barthelemy-Camille Boissieu 
cites cold water among the essential means of cooling cures; as a 
bath, it comes first among the “antiphlogistics” which tear from 
the body the excessive igneous particles found there; as a drink, it 
is a “procrastinative dilution” which diminishes the resistance of 
fluids to the actions of solids, and thus indirectly lowers the 
general heat of the body. 

But it can just as well be said that cold water heats and hot 
water cools. It is precisely this thesis which Darut defends. Cold 
baths attack the blood that is at the periphery of the body and 
“drive it more vigorously toward the heart.” But the heart being 
the seat of natural heat, there the blood is heated, especially 
because “the heart, which struggles alone against the other parts, 
makes new efforts to drive out the blood and to overcome the 
resistance of the capillaries. Whence a great intensity of
