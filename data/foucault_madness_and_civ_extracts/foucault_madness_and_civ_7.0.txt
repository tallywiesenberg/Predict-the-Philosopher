In order to 
pass through all the stages of its fulfillment, evil must necessarily 
incur public avowal and manifestation before reaching the 
conclusion which suppresses it.Confinement, on the contrary, betrays a form of conscience to 
which the inhuman can suggest only shame.There are aspects of 
evil that have such a power of contagion, such a force of scandal 
that any publicity multiplies them infinitely.Only oblivion can 
suppress them.In a case of poisoning, Pontchartrain orders not a 
public trial but the secrecy of an asylum: “As the facts of the case

concerned a good part of Paris, the King did not believe that so 
many people should be brought to trial, many of whom had 
committed crimes unawares, and others only by the ease of doing 
so; His Majesty so determined the more readily insofar as he is 
persuaded that there are certain crimes which must absolutely be 
thrust into oblivion.”!
