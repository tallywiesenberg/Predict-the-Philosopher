built for them, were admitted to hospitals and cared for as such; 
at the Hotel-Dieu in Paris, their cots were set up in the 
dormitories. Moreover, in the majority of the cities of Europe 
there existed throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance a 
place of detention reserved for the insane; there was for example 
the Chatelet of Melun or the famous Tour aux Fous in Caen; 
there were the numberless Narrturmer of Germany, like the gates 
of Liibeck or the Jungpfer of Hamburg. Madmen were thus not 
invariably expelled. One might then speculate that among them 
only foreigners were driven away, each city agreeing to care for 
those madmen among its own citizens. Do we not in fact find 
among the account books of certain medieval cities subsidies for 
madmen or donations made for the care of the insane? However, 
the problem is not so simple, for there existed gathering places 
where the madmen, more numerous than elsewhere, were not 
autochthonous. First come the shrines: Saint-Mathurin de 
Larchant, Saint-Hildevert de Gournay, Besan^on, Gheel;

pilgrimages to these places were organized, often supported, by 
cities or hospitals. It is possible that these ships of fools, which 
haunted the imagination of the entire early Renaissance, were 
pilgrimage boats, highly symbolic cargoes of madmen in search 
of their reason: some went down the Rhineland rivers toward 
Belgium and Gheel; others sailed up the Rhine toward the Jura 
and Besan^on. 

But other cities, like Nuremberg, were certainly not shrines 
and yet contained great numbers of madmen-many more, in any 
case, than could have been furnished by the city itself. These 
madmen were housed and provided for in the city budget, and 
yet they were not given treatment; they were simply thrown into 
prison. We may suppose that in certain important cities—centers 
of travel and markets—madmen had been brought in 
considerable numbers by merchants and mariners and “lost” 
there, thus ridding their native cities of their presence. It may 
have happened that these places of “counterpilgrimage” have 
become confused with the places where, on the contrary, the 
insane were taken as pilgrims. Interest in cure and in exclusion 
coincide: madmen were confined in the holy locus of a miracle. 
It is possible that the village of Gheel developed in this manner 
—a shrine that became a ward, a holy land where madness hoped 
for deliverance, but where man enacted, according to old themes, 
a sort of ritual division. 

What matters is that the vagabond madmen, the act of driving
