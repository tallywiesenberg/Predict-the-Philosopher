Beyond the dangers of example, the honor 
of families and that of religion sufficed to recommend a subject 
for a house of confinement.Apropos of a priest who was to be 
sent to Saint-Lazare: “Hence a priest such as this cannot be 
hidden away with too much care for the honor of religion and 
that of the priesthood.”3 Even late in the eighteenth century, 
Malesherbes would defend confinement as a right of families 
seeking to escape dishonor.“That which is called a base action is 
placed in the rank of those which public order does not permit us 
to tolerate....It seems that the honor of a family requires the 
disappearance from society of the individual who by vile and 
abject habits shames his relatives.” Inversely, liberation is in order 
when the danger of scandal is past and the honor of families or 
of the Church can no longer be sullied.
