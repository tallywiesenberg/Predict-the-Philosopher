The Abbe Bargede had 
been confined for a long time; never, despite his requests, had his 
release been authorized; but now old age and infirmity had made 
scandal impossible.“And besides, his paralysis persists,” writes 
d’Argenson; “he can neither write nor sign his name; I think that 
there would be justice and charity in setting him free.” All those 
forms of evil that border on unreason must be thrust into secrecy.Classicism felt a shame in the presence of the inhuman that the 
Renaissance had never experienced.Yet there is one exception in this consignment to secrecy: that 
which is made for madmen.3 It was doubtless a very old custom 
of the Middle Ages to display the insane.In certain of the 
Narrturmer in Germany, barred windows had been installed 
which permitted those outside to observe the madmen chained 
within.
