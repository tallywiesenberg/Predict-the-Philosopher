They thus constituted a spectacle at the city gates.The

strange fact is that this custom did not disappear once the doors 
of the asylums closed, but that on the contrary it then developed, 
assuming in Paris and London almost an institutional character.As late as 1815, if a report presented in the House of Commons 
is to be believed, the hospital of Bethlehem exhibited lunatics for 
a penny, every Sunday.Now the annual revenue from these 
exhibitions amounted to almost four hundred pounds; which 
suggests the astonishingly high number of 96,000 visits a year.4 
In France, the excursion to Bicetre and the display of the insane 
remained until the Revolution one of the Sunday distractions for 
the Left Bank bourgeoisie.Mirabeau reports in his Observations 
dun voyageur anglais that the madmen at Bicetre were shown 
“like curious animals, to the first simpleton willing to pay a coin.” 
One went to see the keeper display the madmen the way the 
trainer at the Fair of Saint-Germain put the monkeys through 
their tricks.5 Certain attendants were well known for their ability 
to make the mad perform dances and acrobatics, with a few flicks 
of the whip.
