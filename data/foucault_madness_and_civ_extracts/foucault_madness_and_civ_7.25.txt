It is the madmen themselves 
who are entrusted in their lucid intervals with displaying their 
companions, who, in their turn, return the favor.Thus the 
keepers of these unfortunate creatures enjoy the profits that the 
spectacle affords, without indulging in a heartlessness to which, 

no doubt, they could never descend.’’^ Here is madness elevated 
to spectacle above the silence of the asylums, and becoming a 
public scandal for the general delight.Unreason was hidden in 
the silence of the houses of confinement, but madness continued 
to be present on the stage of the world—with more commotion

than ever.It would soon reach, under the Empire, a point that 
had never been attained in the Middle Ages and the 
Renaissance; the strange Brotherhood of the Blue Ship had once 
given performances in which madness was mimed; now it was 
madness itself, madness in flesh and blood, which put on the 
show.Early in the nineteenth century, Coulmier, the director of 
Charenton, had organized those famous performances in which 
madmen sometimes played the roles of actors, sometimes those 
of watched spectators.
