“The insane who attended these 
theatricals were the object of the attention and curiosity of a 
frivolous, irresponsible, and often vicious public.The bizarre 
attitudes of these unfortunates and their condition provoked the 
mocking laughter and the insulting pity of the spectators.”7 
Madness became pure spectacle, in a world over which Sade 
extended his sovereignty and which was offered as a diversion to 
the good conscience of a reason sure of itself.Until the 
beginning of the nineteenth century, and to the indignation of 
Royer-Collard, madmen remained monsters—that is, 
etymologically, beings or things to be shown.Confinement hid away unreason, and betrayed the shame it 
aroused; but it explicitly drew attention to madness, pointed to 
it.If, in the case of unreason, the chief intention was to avoid 
scandal, in the case of madness that intention was to organize it.
