In the course of a visit, he discovered a door

that had been carefully concealed and found behind it a room, 
not eight feet on a side, which thirteen women occupied during 
the night; by day, they lived in a room scarcely larger.On the other hand, when the insane were particularly 
dangerous, they were constrained by a system which was 
doubtless not of a punitive nature, but simply intended to fix 
within narrow limits the physical locus of a raging frenzy.Sufferers were generally chained to the walls and to the beds.At 
Bethlehem, violent madwomen were chained by the ankles to the 
wall of a long gallery; their only garment was a homespun dress.At another hospital, in Bethnal Green, a woman subject to 
violent seizures was placed in a pigsty, feet and fists bound; when 
the crisis had passed she was tied to her bed, covered only by a 
blanket; when she was allowed to take a few steps, an iron bar 
was placed between her legs, attached by rings to her ankles and 
by a short chain to handcuffs.
