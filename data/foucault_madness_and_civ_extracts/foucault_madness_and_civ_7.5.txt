Samuel Tuke, in his Report on the 
Condition of the Indigent Insane , gives the details of a complicated 
system devised at Bethlehem to control a reputedly dangerous 
madman: he was attached by a long chain that ran over the wall 
and thus permitted the attendant to lead him about, to keep him 
on a leash, so to speak, from outside; around his neck had been 
placed an iron ring, which was attached by a short chain to 
another ring; this latter slid the length of a vertical iron bar 
fastened to the floor and ceiling of the cell.When reforms began 
to be instituted at Bethlehem, a man was found who had lived in 
this cell, attached in this fashion, for twelve years.When practices reach this degree of violent intensity, it 
becomes clear that they are no longer inspired by the desire to 
punish nor by the duty to correct.The notion of a “resipiscence” 
is entirely foreign to this regime.But there was a certain image 
of animality that haunted the hospitals of the period.
