Tiny openings pierced next to the doors were fitted 
with iron bars and shutters.Quite close to this opening hung a 
chain fastened to the wall and bearing at its end a cast-iron 
receptacle, somewhat resembling a wooden shoe, in which food 
was placed and passed through the bars of these openings.” 
When Fran^ois-Emmanuel Fodere arrived at the hospital of 
Strasbourg in 1814, he found a kind of human stable, 
constructed with great care and skill: “for troublesome madmen 
and those who dirtied themselves, a kind of cage, or wooden 
closet, which could at the most contain one man of middle 
height, had been devised at the ends of the great wards.” These 
cages had gratings for floors, and did not rest on the ground but 
were raised about fifteen centimeters.Over these gratings was 
thrown a little straw “upon which the madman lay, naked or 
nearly so, took his meals, and deposited his excrement.” 

This, to be sure, is a whole security system against the violence 
of the insane and the explosion of their fury.Such outbursts are 
regarded chiefly as a social danger.But what is most important is 
that it is conceived in terms of an animal freedom.
