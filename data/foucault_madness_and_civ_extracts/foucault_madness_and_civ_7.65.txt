The negative 
fact that “the madman is not treated like a human being” has a

very positive content: this inhuman indifference actually has an 
obsessional value: it is rooted in the old fears which since 
antiquity, and especially since the Middle Ages, have given the 
animal world its familiar strangeness, its menacing marvels, its 
entire weight of dumb anxiety.Yet this animal fear which 
accompanies, with all its imaginary landscape, the perception of 
madness, no longer has the same meaning it had two or three 
centuries earlier: animal metamorphosis is no longer the visible 
sign of infernal powers, nor the result of a diabolic alchemy of 
unreason.The animal in man no longer has any value as the sign 
of a Beyond; it has become his madness, without relation to 
anything but itself: his madness in the state of nature.The 
animality that rages in madness dispossesses man of what is 
specifically human in him; not in order to deliver him over to 
other powers, but simply to establish him at the zero degree of 
his own nature.For classicism, madness in its ultimate form is 
man in immediate relation to his animality, without other 
reference, without any recourse.
