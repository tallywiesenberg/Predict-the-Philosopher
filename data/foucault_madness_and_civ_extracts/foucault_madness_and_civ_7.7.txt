The day would come when from an evolutionary perspective 
this presence of animality in madness would be considered as the 
sign—indeed, as the very essence—of disease.In the classical 
period, on the contrary, it manifested the very fact that the 
madman was not a sick man.Animality, in fact, protected the 
lunatic from whatever might be fragile, precarious, or sickly in 
man.The animal solidity of madness, and that density it borrows 
from the blind world of beasts, inured the madman to hunger, 
heat, cold, pain.It was common knowledge until the end of the 
eighteenth century that the insane could support the miseries of 
existence indefinitely.
