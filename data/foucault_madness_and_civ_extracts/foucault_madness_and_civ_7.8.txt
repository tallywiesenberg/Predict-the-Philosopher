In the month of Nivose of the Year III, on 
certain days when the thermometer indicated 10, 11, and as 
many as 16 degrees below freezing, a madman in the hospital of 
Bicetre could not endure his wool blanket, and remained sitting 
on the icy floor of his cell.In the morning, one no sooner opened 
his door than he ran in his shirt into the inner court, taking ice 
and snow by the fistful, applying it to his breast and letting it 
melt with a sort of delectation.‚Äù Madness, insofar as it partook of 
animal ferocity, preserved man from the dangers of disease; it 
afforded him an invulnerability, similar to that which nature, in 
its foresight, had provided for animals.Curiously, the 
disturbance of his reason restored the madman to the immediate 
kindness of nature by a return to animality.This is why, at this extreme point, madness was less than ever 
linked to medicine; nor could it be linked to the domain of 
correction.Unchained animality could be mastered only by 
discipline and brutalizing.
