The theme of the animal-madman was 
effectively realized in the eighteenth century, in occasional 
attempts to impose a certain pedagogy on the insane.Pinel cites 
the case of a “very famous monastic establishment, in one of the 
southern regions of France,” where a violent madman would be 
given “a precise order to change”; if he refused to go to bed or to

punished on the next day with ten strokes of the bullwhip.” If, 
on the contrary, he was submissive and docile, he was allowed “to

Scotland had his hour of fame.He was said to possess the art of 
curing insanity.
