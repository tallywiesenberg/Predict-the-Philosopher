Pinel notes in passing that this Gregory had the 
physique of a Hercules: “His method consisted in forcing the 
insane to perform the most difficult tasks of farming, in using 
them as beasts of burden, as servants, in reducing them to an 
ultimate obedience with a barrage of blows at the least act of 
revolt.” In the reduction to animality, madness finds both its 
truth and its cure; when the madman has become a beast, this 
presence of the animal in man, a presence which constituted the 
scandal of madness, is eliminated: not that the animal is silenced, 
but man himself is abolished.In the human being who has 
become a beast of burden, the absence of reason follows wisdom 
and its order: madness is then cured, since it is alienated in 
something which is no less than its truth.A moment would come when, from this animality of madness, 
would be deduced the idea of a mechanistic psychology, and the 
notion that the forms of madness can be referred to the great 
structures of animal life.But in the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries, the animality that lends its face to madness in no way 
stipulates a determinist nature for its phenomena.On the 
contrary, it locates madness in an area of unforeseeable freedom 
where frenzy is unchained; if determinism can have any effect on 
it, it is in the form of constraint, punishment, or discipline.
