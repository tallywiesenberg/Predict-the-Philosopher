power of the heart and the vessels.” 

But in other qualitative intuitions, the relationship is reversed; 
here it is heat that dries up water s humectant properties, while 
cold ceaselessly preserves and renews them. Against diseases of 
the nerves due to “a shriveling of the nervous system” and “the 
dryness of the membranes,” Pomme does not recommend hot 
baths—which abet the heat that reigns in the body—but tepid or 
cold baths that can permeate the tissues of the organism and 
restore their suppleness. Is this not the method spontaneously 
practiced in America? And are not its effects, its very mechanism 
visible to the naked eye in the development of the cure, since at 
the most acute point of the crisis, the sufferers float in the water 
of the bath—to such an extent has internal heat rarified the air 
and the liquids of their bodies; yet if they remain a long time in 
the bath water, “three, four, or even six hours a day,” then 
relaxation takes place, the water gradually impregnates the 
membranes and the fibers, the body becomes heavy and sinks 
naturally to the bottom. 

At the end of the eighteenth century, the powers of water 
wane in the very excess of its qualitative versatility: cold, it can 
heat; hot, it can cool; instead of humidifying, it is even capable of 
solidifying, of petrifying by cold, or of sustaining a fire with its 
own heat. In it, all the values of beneficence and maleficence

indiscriminately combine. It is endowed with all possible 
complicities. In medical thought, it forms a therapeutic theme 
which can be used and manipulated unconditionally, and whose 
effect can be understood in the most diverse physiologies and 
pathologies. It has so many values, so many different modes of 
action, that it can confirm anything, cancel anything. No doubt 
it was this very polyvalence, with all the disputes it generated, 
that finally neutralized water. By Pinefs day, water was still used, 
but it had again become entirely limpid, its qualitative overtones 
had been eliminated, and its mode of action could no longer be 
anything but mechanical. 

Showers, hitherto less used than baths and drinks, now 
become the favored technique. And paradoxically, water regains, 
beyond all the physiological variations of the preceding epoch, its 
simple function of purification. The only quality attributed to it 
is violence, an irresistible flow washing away all the impurities 
that form madness; by its own curative power, it reduces the 
individual to his simplest possible expression, to his merest and 
purest form of existence, thus affording him a second birth; it is a
