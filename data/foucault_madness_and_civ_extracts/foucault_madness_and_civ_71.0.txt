jolting it causes the lungs and especially the viscera of the lower 
stomach, rids the blood of the excremental humors that reside 
there, gives resilience to the fibers, re-establishes the functions of 
the organs, reanimates natural heat, evacuates degenerate juices 
by perspiration or other means, or else re-establishes them in 
their previous state, dissipates obstructions, opens all passages,

and finally, through the continual movement it causes the blood, 
renews it, so to speak, and accords it an extraordinary vigor.”8 
The rolling of the sea, the most regular, the most natural 
movement in the world, and the one most in accord with cosmic 
order—that same movement which De Lancre once considered 
so dangerous for the human heart, offering as it did so many 
hazardous temptations, improbable and always unfulfilled 
dreams, constitutive of the image, in fact, of infinite evil—was 
considered by the eighteenth century as a powerful regulator of 
organic mobility. In it, the very rhythm of nature spoke. 
Gilchrist wrote an entire treatise “on the use of sea voyages in 
Medicine”; Whytt found the remedy difficult to apply to those 
subject to melancholia; it is “difficult to convince such patients to 
undertake a long sea voyage; but a case must be cited of 
hypochondriacal vapors that immediately disappeared in a young 
man who was constrained to travel in a ship for four or five 
weeks.” 

Travel has the additional interest of acting directly upon the 
flow of ideas, or at least by a more direct means, since it passes 
only through the sensations. The variety of the landscape 
dissipates the melancholic’s obstinacy: a remedy in use since 
antiquity, but which the eighteenth century prescribed with a 
new insistence, and whose forms it varied, from real travel to the 
imaginary voyages of literature and the theater. Antoine le 
Camus prescribes “in order to relax the brain” in all cases of 
vaporous affections: “walks, journeys, rides, exercise in the fresh 
air, dancing, spectacles, diverting reading, occupations that can 
cause the obsessive idea to be forgotten.” The country, by the 
gentleness and variety of its landscapes, wins melancholics from 
their single obsession “by taking them away from the places that 
might revive the memory of their sufferings.” 

But inversely, the agitation of mania can be corrected by the 
good effects of a regular movement. This is no longer a restoring
