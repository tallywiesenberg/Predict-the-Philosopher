around these two fundamental themes: the subject must be 
restored to his initial purity, and must be wrested from his pure 
subjectivity in order to be initiated into the world; the non-being 
that alienates him from himself must be annihilated, and he 
must be restored to the plenitude of the exterior world, to the 
solid truth of being. 

The techniques were to subsist longer than their meaning. 
When, outside the experience of unreason, madness had received 
a purely psychological and moral status, when the relations of 
error and fault by which classicism defined madness were 
crammed into the single notion of guilt, the techniques still 
remained, but with a much more restricted significance; all that 
was sought was a mechanical effect, or a moral punishment. It 
was in this manner that the methods of regulating movement 
degenerated into the famous “rotatory machine” whose 
mechanism and efficacity were demonstrated by Mason Cox at 
the beginning of the nineteenth century: 10 a perpendicular pillar 
is attached to both floor and ceiling; the sufferer is attached to a 
chair or a bed hung from a horizontal arm moving around the 
pillar; by means of a “not very complicated system of gears” the 
machine is set for “the degree of speed desired.” Cox cites one of 
his own observations; it concerns a man whom melancholia had 
thrown into a kind of stupor: “His complexion was dark and 
leaden, his eyes yellow, his looks constantly fixed upon the 
ground, his limbs motionless, his tongue dry and paralyzed, and

his pulse slow.” This sufferer was placed upon the rotatory 
machine, which was set at an increasingly rapid movement. The 
effect surpassed expectation; the sufferer became excessively 
disturbed: melancholic rigidity gave way to manic agitation. But 
this first effect passed, and the invalid relapsed into his initial 
state. The rhythm was then changed; the machine was made to 
turn very rapidly, but it was stopped at regular intervals, and in a 
very abrupt manner. The melancholia was driven out, without 
the rotation having had time to release the manic agitation. This 
“centrifugation” of melancholia is very characteristic of the new 
use of the old therapeutic themes. Movement no longer aimed at 
restoring the invalid to the truth of the exterior world, but only 
at producing a series of internal effects, purely mechanical and 
purely psychological. It was no longer the presence of the truth 
that determined the cure, but a functional norm. In this 
reinterpretation of the old method, the organism was no longer 
related to anything but itself and its own nature, while in the 
initial version, what was to be restored was its relation with the 
world, its essential link with being and with truth: if we add that
