can be the universal substitute for all other physical therapeutics; 
it is only another way to produce the same sequence of effects. 
Between a cure by the passions and a cure by the prescriptions of 
the pharmacopoeia, there is no difference in nature; but only a 
diversity in the mode of access to those mechanisms which are 
common to the body and to the soul. “The passions must be 
utilized, if the sufferer cannot be led by reason to do what is 
necessary for the restoration of his health.” 

It is thus not possible to use as a valid or at least meaningful 
distinction for the classical period the difference—immediately 
apparent to us—between physical medications and psychological 
or moral medications. The difference only begins to exist in all 
its profundity the day when fear is no longer used as a method 
for arresting movement, but as a punishment; when joy does not 
signify organic expansion, but reward; when anger is nothing 
more than a response to concerted humiliation; in short, when 
the nineteenth century, by inventing its famous “moral 
methods,” has brought madness and its cure into the domain of 
guilt. The distinction between the physical and the moral 
becomes a practical concept in the medicine of the mind only 
when the problematics of madness shifts to an interrogation of 
the subject responsible. The purely moral space, which is then 
defined, gives the exact measurements of that psychological 
inwardness where modern man seeks both his depth and his 
truth. Physical therapeutics tends to become, in the first half of

the nineteenth century, a cure devised by an innocent 
determinism, and moral treatment a cure wrought by a culpable 
freedom. Psychology, as a means of curing, is henceforth 
organized around punishment. Before seeking to relieve, it 
inflicts suffering within the rigor of a moral necessity. “Do not 
employ consolations, they are useless; have no recourse to 
reasoning, it does not persuade; do not be sad with melancholics, 
your sadness sustains theirs; do not assume an air of gaiety with 
them, they are only hurt by it. What is required is great sang¬ 
froid, and when necessary, severity. Let your reason be their rule 
of conduct. A single string still vibrates in them, that of pain; 
have courage enough to pluck it. ”14 

The heterogeneity of the physical and the moral in medical 
thought is not a result of Descartes’s definition of substances; a 
century and a half of post-Cartesian medicine did not succeed in 
assimilating that separation on the level of problems and 
methods, nor in understanding the distinction of substances as
