essentially passion —that is, a certain compound (movement- 
quality) belonging to both body and soul; the other, which is 
based on the discursive movement of reason reasoning with 
itself, and which addresses madness as error, as double inanity of 
language and image, as delirium. The structural cycle of passion 
and of delirium which constitutes the classical experience of 
madness reappears here in the world of techniques—but in a

syncopated form. Its unity is expressed only distantly. What is 
immediately visible, in capital letters, is the duality, almost the 
opposition, in the medicine of madness, of the methods of 
suppressing the disease, and of the forms of treating unreason. 
These latter can be reduced to three essential configurations. 

1. Awakening. Since delirium is the dream of waking persons, 
those who are delirious must be torn from this quasi-sleep, 
recalled from their waking dream and its images to an authentic 
awakening, where the dream disappears before the images of 
perception. Descartes sought this absolute awakening, which 
dismisses one by one all the forms of illusion, at the beginning of 
his Meditations , and found it, paradoxically, in the very awareness 
of the dream, in the consciousness of deluded consciousness. But 
in madmen, it is medicine which must effect the awakening, 
transforming the solitude of Cartesian courage into an 
authoritarian intervention, by the man awake and certain of his 
wakefulness, into the illusion of the man who sleeps waking: a 
short cut that dogmatically reduces Descartes’s long road. What 
Descartes discovers at the end of his resolution and in the 
doubling of a consciousness that never separates from itself and 
does not split, medicine imposes from outside, and in the 
dissociation of doctor and patient. The physician, in relation to 
the madman, reproduces the moment of the Cogito in relation 
to the time of the dream, of illusion, and of madness. A 
completely exterior Cogito, alien to cogitation itself, and which 
can be imposed upon it only in the form of an invasion. 

This structure of invasion by wakefulness is one of the most 
constant forms among the therapeutics of madness. It often 
assumes the simplest aspects, simultaneously those most highly 
charged with images and those most credited with immediate 
powers. It is asserted that a gun discharged near her cured a 
young girl of convulsions contracted as the result of severe grief. 
Without going so far as this iconographic representation of the 
methods of awakening, sudden and strong emotions achieve the
