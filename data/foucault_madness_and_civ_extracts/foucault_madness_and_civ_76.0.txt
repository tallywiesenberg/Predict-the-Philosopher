awakening of madness would lose its original meaning and limit 
itself to being no more than recollection of moral law, return to 
the good, fidelity to the law. What Willis still intended as a 
reintroduction to truth would no longer be entirely understood 
by Sauvages, who speaks of lucidity in the recognition of the 
good: “Thus, one can recall to reason those whom false principles 
of moral philosophy have caused to lose their own, as long as 
they are willing to examine with us what is truly good, and what 
things are to be preferred to others.” Already it is no longer as 
awakener that the physician is to function, but as moralist. 
Against madness, Tissot considers that “a pure conscience, 
without reproach, is an excellent preservative.” And soon comes 
Pinel, for whom the awakening to truth no longer has a meaning 
in the cure, but only obedience and blind submission: “A 
fundamental principle for the cure of mania in a great number of 
cases is to resort first of all to an energetic repression, and to 
proceed subsequently to methods of benevolence.” 

2. Theatrical Representation. In appearance at least, this is a 
technique rigorously opposed to that of awakening. There, 
delirium, in all its immediate vivacity, was confronted by the 
patient work of reason. Either in the form of a slow pedagogy, or 
the form of an authoritarian invasion, reason was imposed, as if 
by the weight of its own being. The non-being of madness, the 
inanity of error, was forced to yield, finally, to this pressure of the 
truth. Here, the therapeutic operation functions entirely in the 
space of the imagination; we are dealing with a complicity of the 
unreal with itself; the imagination must play its own game, 
voluntarily propose new images, espouse delirium for delirium’s 
sake, and without opposition or confrontation, without even a

visible dialectic, must, paradoxically, cure. Health must lay siege 
to madness and conquer it in the very nothingness in which the 
disease is imprisoned. When the imagination “is sick, it can be 
cured only by the effect of a healthy and active imagination.... It 
is all one whether the invalid’s imagination is cured by fear, by a 
strong and painful impression upon the senses, or by an 
illusion.”! Illusion can cure the illusory—while reason alone can 
free from the unreasonable. What then is this dark power of the 
imaginary? 

Insofar as it is of the essence of the image to be taken for 
reality, it is reciprocally characteristic of reality that it can mime 
the image, pretend to the same substance, the same significance. 
Without a break, without a jolt, perception can continue the 
dream, fill in its gaps, confirm what is precarious about it, and
