whole tradition of Western medicine dating from Hippocrates 
here intersects, suddenly and for only a few years, with one of the 
major forms of theatrical experience. Before us appears the great 
theme of a crisis that confronts the madman with his own 
meaning, reason with unreason, man’s lucid ruse with the 
blindness of the lunatic—a crisis which marks the point at which 
illusion, turned back upon itself, will open to the dazzlement of 
truth.

This opening is imminent in the crisis; in fact it is this 
opening, with its immediate proximity, that constitutes the 
essential element of the crisis. But the opening does not result 
from the crisis itself In order for the crisis to be medical and not 
simply dramatic, in order for it to be not an annihilation of the 
man, but simply a suppression of the disease; in short, in order 
for the dramatic representation of the delirium to have an effect 
of comic purification, a ruse must be introduced at a given 
moment. A ruse, or at least an element which surreptitiously 
alters the autonomous operation of the delirium, and which, 
ceaselessly confirming it, does not bind it to its own truth 
without at the same time linking it to the necessity for its own 
suppression. The simplest example of this method is the ruse 
employed with delirious patients who imagine they perceive 
within their bodies an object or an extraordinary animal: “When 
an invalid believes that he has a living animal shut up within his 
body, one must pretend to have withdrawn it; if it is in the 
stomach, one may, by means of a powerful purge, produce this 
effect, throwing such an animal into the basin without the 
patient’s noticing.”19 The theatrical device represents the object 
of the delirium but cannot do so without externalizing it, and if 
it gives the invalid a perceptual confirmation of his illusion, it 
does so only while ridding him of it by force. The artificial 
reconstitution of delirium constitutes the real distance in which 
the sufferer recovers his liberty. 

But sometimes, there is even no need of this “distancing.” It is 
within the quasi-perception of the delirium that there is 
established, by means of a ruse, a perceptual element, silent at 
first, but whose gradual affirmation will come to contest the 
entire system. It is in himself and in the perception which 
confirms his delirium that the sufferer perceives the liberating 
reality. Trallion reports how a physician dissipated the delirium 
of a melancholic who imagined he had no head, but only a kind
