that give birth to unreason. 

And perhaps nature, as the concrete form of the immediate, 
has an even more fundamental power in the suppression of 
madness. For it has the power of freeing man from his freedom. 
In nature—that nature, at least, which is measured by the double 
exclusion of the violence of desire and the unreality of 
hallucination—man is doubtless liberated from social constraints

(those which force him “to calculate and draw up the balance 
sheet of his imaginary pleasures which bear that name but are 
none”) and from the uncontrollable movement of the passions. 
But by that very fact, he is gently and as it were internally bound 
by a system of natural obligations. The pressures of the healthiest 
needs, the rhythm of the days and the seasons, the calm necessity 
to feed and shelter oneself, constrain the disorder of madmen to 
a regular observance. The excessively remote inventions of the 
imagination are dismissed, along with the excessively urgent 
disguises of desire. In the gentleness of a pleasure that does not 
constrain, man is linked to the wisdom of nature, and this 
fidelity in the form of freedom dissipates the unreason which 
juxtaposes in its paradox the extreme determinism of passion and 
the extreme fantasy of the image. Thus one begins to dream, in 
these mingled landscapes of ethics and medicine, of a liberation 
from madness: a liberation that must not be understood in its 
origin as the discovery, by philanthropy, of the humanity of 
madmen, but as a desire to open madness to the gentle 
constraints of nature. 

The old village of Gheel which, from the end of the Middle 
Ages, still bore witness to the now forgotten relation between the 
confinement of madmen and the exclusion of lepers, also 
received in the last years of the eighteenth century a sudden 
reinterpretation. What had once marked, here, the entire violent, 
pathetic separation of the world of madmen from the world of 
men, now conveyed the idyllic values of a rediscovered unity of 
unreason and nature. This village had once signified that 
madmen were confined, and that therefore the man of reason 
was protected from them; now it manifested that the madman 
was liberated, and that, in this liberty which put him on a level 
with the laws of nature, he was reconciled with the man of 
reason. At Gheel, according to Jouy s description of it, “four- 
fifths of the inhabitants are mad, but mad in the full sense of the 
word, and they enjoy without restraint the same freedom as the
