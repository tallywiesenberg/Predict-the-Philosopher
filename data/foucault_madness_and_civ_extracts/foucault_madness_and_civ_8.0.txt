to that great uncertainty external to everything. He is a prisoner 
in the midst of what is the freest, the openest of routes: bound 
fast at the infinite crossroads. He is the Passenger par excellence'. 
that is, the prisoner of the passage. And the land he will come to 
is unknown—as is, once he disembarks, the land from which he 
comes. He has his truth and his homeland only in that fruitless 
expanse between two countries that cannot belong to him. Is it 
this ritual and these values which are at the origin of the long 
imaginary relationship that can be traced through the whole of 
Western culture? Or is it, conversely, this relationship that, from 
time immemorial, has called into being and established the rite 
of embarkation? One thing at least is certain: water and madness 
have long been linked in the dreams of European man. 

Already, disguised as a madman, Tristan had ordered boatmen 
to land him on the coast of Cornwall. And when he arrived at 
the castle of King Mark, no one recognized him, no one knew 
whence he had come. But he made too many strange remarks, 
both familiar and distant; he knew too well the secrets of the 
commonplace not to have been from another, yet nearby, world. 
He did not come from the solid land, with its solid cities; but 
indeed from the ceaseless unrest of the sea, from those unknown 
highways which conceal so much strange knowledge, from that 
fantastic plain, the underside of the world. Iseut, first of all, 
realized that this madman was a son of the sea, and that insolent 
sailors had cast him here, a sign of misfortune: “Accursed be the 
sailors that brought this madman! Why did they not throw him 

into the sea!” - And more than once in the course of time, the 
same theme reappears: among the mystics of the fifteenth 
century, it has become the motif of the soul as a skiff, abandoned 
on the infinite sea of desires, in the sterile field of cares and 
ignorance, among the mirages of knowledge, amid the unreason 
of the world—a craft at the mercy of the sea s great madness, 
unless it throws out a solid anchor, faith, or raises its spiritual

sails so that the breath of God may bring it to port. At the end of 
the sixteenth century, De Lancre sees in the sea the origin of the 
demoniacal leanings of an entire people: the hazardous labor of
