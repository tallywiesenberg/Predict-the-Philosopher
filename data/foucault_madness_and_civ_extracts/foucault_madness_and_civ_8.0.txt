It has doubtless been essential to Western culture to link, as it 
has done, its perception of madness to the iconographic forms of 
the relation of man to beast.From the start, Western culture has 
not considered it evident that animals participate in the 
plenitude of nature, in its wisdom and its order: this idea was a 
late one and long remained on the surface of culture; perhaps it 
has not yet penetrated very deeply into the subterranean regions 
of the imagination.In fact, on close examination, it becomes 
evident that the animal belongs rather to an anti-nature, to a 
negativity that threatens order and by its frenzy endangers the 
positive wisdom of nature.The work of Lautreamont bears 
witness to this.Why should the fact that Western man has lived 
for two thousand years on his definition as a rational animal 
necessarily mean that he has recognized the possibility of an 
order common to reason and to animality?
