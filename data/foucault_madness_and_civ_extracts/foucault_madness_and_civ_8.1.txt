In the classical age, if it is true that the scientific and 
medical analysis of madness, as we shall see below, sought to 
establish it within this natural mechanism, the real practices that 
concern the insane bear sufficient witness to the fact that 
madness was still contained in the anti-natural violence of 
animality.In any case, it was this animality of madness which 
confinement glorified, at the same time that it sought to avoid 
the scandal inherent in the immorality of the unreasonable.Which 
reveals the distance established in the classical age between 
madness and the other forms of unreason, even if it is true that 
from a certain point of view they had been identified or 
assimilated.If a whole range of unreason was reduced to silence, 
but madness left free to speak the language of its scandal, what 
lesson could it teach which unreason as a whole was not capable 
of transmitting?What meaning had the frenzies and all the fury 
of the insane, which could not be found in the—probably more 
sensible—remarks of the other internees?
