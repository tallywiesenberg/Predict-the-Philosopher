It was no longer a 
matter of requiring human reason to abandon its pride and its 
certainties in order to lose itself in the great unreason of sacrifice.When classical Christianity speaks of the madness of the Cross, 
it is merely to humiliate false reason and add luster to the eternal 
light of truth; the madness of God-in-man’s-image is simply a 
wisdom not recognized by the men of unreason who live in this 
world: “Jesus crucified ... was the scandal of the world and 
appeared as nothing but ignorance and madness to the eyes of 
his time.” But the fact that the world has become Christian, and 
that the order of God is revealed through the meanderings of 
history and the madness of men, now suffices to show that 
“Christ has become the highest point of our wisdom.”9 The 
scandal of Christian faith and Christian abasement, whose 
strength and value as revelation Pascal still preserved, would soon 
have no more meaning for Christian thought except perhaps to 
reveal in these scandalized consciences so many blind souls: “Do 
not permit your Cross, which has subdued the universe for you, 
to be still the madness and scandal of proud minds.” Christian 
unreason was relegated by Christians themselves into the 
margins of a reason that had become identical with the wisdom 
of God incarnate.After Port-Royal, men would have to wait two 
centuries—until Dostoievsky and Nietzsche—for Christ to 
regain the glory of his madness, for scandal to recover its power 
as revelation, for unreason to cease being merely the public 
shame of reason.But at the very moment Christian reason rid itself of the 
madness that had so long been a part of itself, the madman, in 
his abolished reason, in the fury of his animality, received a 
singular power as a demonstration: it was as if scandal, driven out 
of that superhuman region where it related to God and where 
the Incarnation was manifested, reappeared, in the plenitude of

its force and pregnant with a new lesson, in that region where 
man has a relation to nature and to his animality.The lesson’s 
point of application has shifted to the lower regions of madness.
