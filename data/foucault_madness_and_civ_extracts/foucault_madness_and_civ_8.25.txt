The Cross is no longer to be considered in its scandal; but it 
must not be forgotten that throughout his human life Christ 
honored madness, sanctified it as he sanctified infirmity cured, 
sin forgiven, poverty assured of eternal riches.Saint Vincent de 
Paul reminds those assigned to tend the mad within the houses 
of confinement that their “rule in this is Our Lord who chose to 
be surrounded by lunatics, demoniacs, madmen, the tempted and 
the possessed.” These men ruled by the powers of the inhuman 
constitute, around those who represent eternal Wisdom, around 
the Man who incarnates it, a perpetual occasion for glorification: 
because they glorify, by surrounding it, the wisdom that has been 
denied them, and at the same time give it a pretext to humiliate 
itself, to acknowledge that it is granted only by grace.Further: 
Christ did not merely choose to be surrounded by lunatics; he 
himself chose to pass in their eyes for a madman, thus 
experiencing, in his incarnation, all the sufferings of human 
misfortune.Madness thus became the ultimate form, the final 
degree of God in man’s image, before the fulfillment and 
deliverance of the Cross: “O my Savior, you were pleased to be a 
scandal to the Jews, and a madness to the Gentiles; you were 
pleased to seem out of your senses, as it is reported in the Holy 
Gospel that it was thought of Our Lord that he had gone mad.Dicebant quoniam in furorem versus est.
