His Apostles sometimes 
looked upon him as a man in anger, and he seemed such to 
them, so that they should bear witness that he had borne with all 
our infirmities and all our states of affliction, and to teach them 
and us as well to have compassion upon those who fall into these 
infirmities.” 10 Coming into this world, Christ agreed to take 
upon himself all the signs of the human condition and the very 
stigmata of fallen nature; from poverty to death, he followed the

long road of the Passion, which was also the road of the passions, 
of wisdom forgotten, and of madness.And because it was one of 
the forms of the Passion—the ultimate form, in a sense, before 
death—madness would now become, for those who suffered it, 
an object of respect and compassion.To respect madness is not to interpret it as the involuntary and 
inevitable accident of disease, but to recognize this lower limit of 
human truth, a limit not accidental but essential.As death is the 
limit of human life in the realm of time, madness is its limit in 
the realm of animality, and just as death had been sanctified by 
the death of Christ, madness, in its most bestial nature, had also 
been sanctified.On March 29, 1654, Saint Vincent de Paul 
announced to Jean Barreau, himself a congreganist, that his 
brother had just been confined at Saint-Lazare as a lunatic: “We 
must honor Our Lord in the state wherein He was when they 
sought to bind Him, saying quoniam in frenesim versus est , in 
order to sanctify that state in those whom His Divine Providence 
has placed there.”!
