1 Madness is the lowest point of humanity to 
which God submitted in His incarnation, thereby showing that 
there was nothing inhuman in man that could not be redeemed 
and saved; the ultimate point of the Fall was glorified by the 
divine presence: and it is this lesson which, for the seventeenth 
century, all madness still taught.We see why the scandal of madness could be exalted, while 
that of the other forms of unreason was concealed with so much 
care.The scandal of unreason produced only the contagious 
example of transgression and immorality; the scandal of madness 
showed men how close to animality their Fall could bring them; 
and at the same time how far divine mercy could extend when it 
consented to save man.For Renaissance Christianity, the entire 
instructive value of unreason and of its scandals lay in the 
madness of the Incarnation of God in man.For classicism, the 
Incarnation is no longer madness; but what is madness is this

incarnation of man in the beast, which is, as the ultimate point of 
his Fall, the most manifest sign of his guilt; and, as the ultimate 
object of divine mercy, the symbol of universal forgiveness and 
innocence regained.
