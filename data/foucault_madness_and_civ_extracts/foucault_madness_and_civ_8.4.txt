Henceforth, all the lessons of madness and 
the power of its instruction must be sought in this obscure 
region, at the lower confines of humanity, where man is hinged 
to nature, where he is both ultimate downfall and absolute 
innocence.Does not the Church’s solicitude for the insane 
during the classical period, as it is symbolized in Saint Vincent 
de Paul and his Congregation, or in the Brothers of Charity, all 
those religious orders hovering over madness and showing it to 
the world—does this not indicate that the Church found in 
madness a difficult but an essential lesson: the guilty innocence 
of the animal in man?This is the lesson to be read and 
understood in its spectacles, in which it exalted in the madman 
the fury of the human beast.Paradoxically, this Christian 
consciousness of animality prepared the moment when madness 
would be treated as a fact of nature; it would then be quickly 
forgotten what this “nature” meant for classical thought: not the 
always accessible domain of an objective analysis, but that region 
in which there appears, for man, the always possible scandal of a 
madness that is both his ultimate truth and the form of his 
abolition.All these phenomena, these strange practices woven around 
madness, these usages which glorify and at the same time 
discipline it, reduce it to animality while making it teach the 
lesson of the Redemption, put madness in a strange position 
with regard to unreason as a whole.
