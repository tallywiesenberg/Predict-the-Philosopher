It was in relation to 
unreason and to it alone that madness could be understood.Unreason was its support; or let us say that unreason defined the 
locus of madness’s possibility.For classical man, madness was 
not the natural condition, the human and psychological root of 
unreason; it was only unreason’s empirical form; and the 
madman, tracing the course of human degradation to the 
frenzied nadir of animality, disclosed that underlying realm of 
unreason which threatens man and envelops—at a tremendous 
distance—all the forms of his natural existence.It was not a 
question of tending toward a determinism, but of being 
swallowed up by a darkness.More effectively than any other kind 
of rationalism, better in any case than our positivism, classical 
rationalism could watch out for and guard against the 
subterranean danger of unreason, that threatening space of an 
absolute freedom.
