PASSIONAND 

DELIRIUM 


THE savage danger of madness is related to the danger of the 
passions and to their fatal concatenation.Sauvages had sketched the fundamental role of passion, citing 
it as a more constant, more persistent, and somehow more 
deserved cause of madness: “The distraction of our mind is the 
result of our blind surrender to our desires, our incapacity to 
control or to moderate our passions.Whence these amorous 
frenzies, these antipathies, these depraved tastes, this melancholy 
which is caused by grief, these transports wrought in us by 
denial, these excesses in eating, in drinking, these indispositions, 
these corporeal vices which cause madness, the worst of all 
maladies.”!But as yet, what was involved was only passion’s 
moral precedence, its responsibility, in a vague way; the real 
target of this denunciation was the radical relation of the 
phenomena of madness to the very possibility of passion.Before Descartes, and long after his influence as philosopher 
and physiologist had diminished, passion continued to be the 
meeting ground of body and soul; the point where the latter’s 
activity makes contact with the former’s passivity, each being a 
limit imposed upon the other and the locus of their 
communication.
