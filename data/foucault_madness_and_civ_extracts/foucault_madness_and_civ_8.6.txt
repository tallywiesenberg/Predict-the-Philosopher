The medicine of humors sees this unity primarily as a 
reciprocal interaction: “The passions necessarily cause certain 
movements in the humors; anger agitates the bile, sadness excites 
melancholy (black bile), and the movements of the humors are 
on occasion so violent that they disrupt the entire economy of 
the body, even causing death; further, the passions augment the 
quantity of the humors; anger multiplies the bile as sadness 
increases melancholy.The humors which are customarily

agitated by certain passions dispose those in whom they abound 
to the same passions, and to thinking of the objects which 
ordinarily excite them; bile disposes to anger and to thinking of 
those we hate.Melancholy (black bile) disposes to sadness and to 
thinking of untoward things; well-tempered blood disposes to 
joy.1 

The medicine of spirits substitutes for this vague idea of 
“disposition” the rigor of a physical, mechanical transmission of 
movements.If the passions are possible only in a being which 
has a body, and a body not entirely subject to the light of its 
mind and to the immediate transparence of its will, this is true 
insofar as, in ourselves and without ourselves, and generally in 
spite of ourselves, the mind’s movements obey a mechanical 
structure which is that of the movement of spirits.
