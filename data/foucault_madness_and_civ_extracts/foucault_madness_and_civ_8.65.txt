“Before the 
sight of the object of passion, the animal spirits were spread 
throughout the entire body in order to preserve all the parts in 
general; but at the presence of the new object, this entire 
economy is disrupted.The majority of spirits are impelled into 
the muscles of the arms, the legs, the face, and all the exterior 
parts of the body in order to afford it a disposition proper to the 
prevailing passion and to give it the countenance and movement 
necessary for the acquisition of the good or the escape from the 
evil which presents itself.”3 Passion thus disperses the spirits, 
which are disposed to passion: that is, under the effect of passion 
and in the presence of its object, the spirits circulate, disperse, 
and concentrate according to a spatial design which licenses the 
trace of the object in the brain and its image in the soul, thus 
forming in the body a kind of geometric figure of passion which 
is merely its expressive transposition; but which also constitutes 
passion’s essential causal basis, for when all the spirits are 
grouped around this object of passion, or at least around its 
image, the mind in its turn can tao longer ignore it and will 
consequently be subject to passion.97 


One more step, and the entire system becomes a unity in 
which body and soul communicate immediately in the symbolic 
values of common qualities.This is what happens in the 
medicine of solids and fluids, which dominates eighteenth- 
century practice.Tension and release, hardness and softness, 
rigidity and relaxation, congestion and dryness—these qualitative 
states characterize the soul as much as the body, and ultimately 
refer to a kind of indistinct and composite passional situation, 
one which imposes itself on the concatenation of ideas, on the 
course of feelings, on the state of fibers, on the circulation of 
fluids.
