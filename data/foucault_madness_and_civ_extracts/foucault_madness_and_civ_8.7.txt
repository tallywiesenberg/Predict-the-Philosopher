The theme of causality here appears as too discursive, the 
elements it groups too disjunct for its schemas to be applicable.Are the “active passions, such as anger, joy, lust,” causes or 
consequences “of the excessive strength, the excessive tension, 
and the excessive elasticity of the nervous fibers, and of the 
excessive activity of the nervous fluid”?Conversely, cannot the 
“inert passions, such as fear, depression, ennui, lack of appetite, 
the coldness that accompanies homesickness, bizarre appetites, 
stupidity, lack of memory” be as readily followed as they are 
preceded by “weakness of the brain marrow and of the nervous 
fibers distributed in the organs, by impoverishment and inertia of 

the fluids”?^ Indeed, we must no longer try to situate passion in 
a causal succession, or halfway between the corporeal and the 
spiritual; passion indicates, at a new, deeper level, that the soul 
and the body are in a perpetual metaphorical relation in which 
qualities have no need to be communicated because they are 
already common to both; and in which phenomena of expression 
are not causes, quite simply because soul and body are always 
each other s immediate expression.Passion is no longer exactly at 
the geometrical center of the body-and-soul complex; it is, a 
little short of that, at the point where their opposition is not yet 
given, in that region where both their unity and their distinction 
are established.98 


But at this level, passion is no longer simply one of the causes 
—however powerful—of madness; rather it forms the basis for 
its very possibility.
