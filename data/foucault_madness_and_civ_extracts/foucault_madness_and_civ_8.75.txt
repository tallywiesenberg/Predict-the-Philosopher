If it is true that there exists a realm, in the 
relations of soul and body, where cause and effect, determinism 
and expression still intersect in a web so dense that they actually 
form only one and the same movement which cannot be 
dissociated except after the fact; if it is true that prior to the 
violence of the body and the vivacity of the soul, prior to the 
softening of the fibers and the relaxation of the mind, there are 
qualitative, as yet unshared kinds of a priori which subsequently 
impose the same values on the organic and on the spiritual, then 
we see that there can be diseases such as madness which are from 
the start diseases of the body and of the soul, maladies in which 
the affection of the brain is of the same quality, of the same 
origin, of the same nature, finally, as the affection of the soul.The possibility of madness is therefore implicit in the very 
phenomenon of passion.It is true that long before the eighteenth century, and for a 
long series of centuries from which we have doubtless not 
emerged, passion and madness were kept in close relation to one 
another.But let us allow the classical period its originality.The 
moralists of the Greco-Latin tradition had found it just that 
madness be passionâ€™s chastisement; and to be more certain that 
this was the case, they chose to define passion as a temporary and 
attenuated madness.
