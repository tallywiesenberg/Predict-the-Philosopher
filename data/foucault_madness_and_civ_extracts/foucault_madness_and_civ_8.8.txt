But classical thought could define a relation 
between passion and madness which was not on the order of a 
pious hope, a pedagogic threat, or a moral synthesis; it even 
broke with the tradition by inverting the terms of the 
concatenation; it based the chimeras of madness on the nature of 
passion; it saw that the determinism of the passions was nothing 
but a chance for madness to penetrate the world of reason; and 
that if the unquestioned union of body and soul manifested 
man s finitude in passion, it laid this same man open, at the same 
time, to the infinite movement that destroyed him.99 



Madness, then, was not merely one of the possibilities 
afforded by the union of soul and body; it was not just one of the 
consequences of passion.Instituted by the unity of soul and 
body, madness turned against that unity and once again put it in 
question.Madness, made possible by passion, threatened by a 
movement proper to itself what had made passion itself possible.Madness was one of those unities in which laws were 
compromised, perverted, distortedâ€”thereby manifesting such 
unity as evident and established, but also as fragile and already 
doomed to destruction.
