There comes a moment in the course of passion when laws are 
suspended as though of their own accord, when movement either 
abruptly stops, without collision or absorption of any kind of 
active force, or is propagated, the action ceasing only at the 
climax of the paroxysm.Whytt admits that an intense emotion 
can provoke madness exactly as impact can provoke movement, 
for the sole reason that emotion is both impact in the soul and 
agitation of the nervous fiber: “It is thus that sad narratives or 
those capable of moving the heart, a horrible and unexpected 
sight, great grief, rage, terror, and the other passions which make 
a great impression frequently occasion the most sudden and 
violent nervous symptoms.” But—it is here that madness, strictly 
speaking, begins—it happens that this movement immediately 
cancels itself out by its own excess and abruptly provokes an 
immobility which may reach the point of death itself.As if in the 
mechanics of madness, repose were not necessarily a quiescent 
thing but could also be a movement in violent opposition to 
itself, a movement which under the effect of its own violence 
abruptly achieves contradiction and the impossibility of 
continuance.“It is not unheard of that the passions, being very 
violent, generate a kind of tetanus or catalepsy such that the 
person then resembles a statue more than a living being.Further, 
fear, affliction, joy, and shame carried to their excess have more
