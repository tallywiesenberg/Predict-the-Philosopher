Conversely, it happens that movement, passing from soul to 
body and from body to soul, propagates itself indefinitely in a 
locus of anxiety certainly closer to that space where Malebranche 
placed souls than to that in which Descartes situated bodies.Imperceptible movements, often provoked by a slight external 
impact, accumulate, are amplified, and end by exploding in 
violent convulsions.Giovanni Maria Lancisi had already 
explained that the noble Romans were often subject to the vapors 
—hysterical attacks, hypochondriacal fits—because in their court 
life “their minds, continually agitated between fear and hope, 
never knew a moment’s repose.” According to many physicians, 
city life, the life of the court, of the salons, led to madness by this 
multiplicity of excitations constantly accumulated, prolonged, 
and echoed without ever being attenuated.But there is in this 
image, in its more intense forms, and in the events constituting 
its organic version, a certain force which, increasing, can lead to 
delirium, as if movement, instead of losing its strength in 
communicating itself, could involve other forces in its wake, and 
from them derive an additional vigor.This was how Sauvages 
explained the origin of madness: a certain impression of fear is 
linked to the congestion or the pressure of a certain medullary 
fiber; this fear is limited to an object, as this congestion is strictly 
localized.
