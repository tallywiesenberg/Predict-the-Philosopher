In proportion as this fear persists, the soul grants it 
more attention, increasingly isolating and detaching it from all 
else.But such isolation reinforces the fear, and the soul, having 
accorded it too special a condition, gradually tends to attach to it 
a whole series of more or less remote ideas: “It joins to this 
simple idea all those which are likely to nourish and augment it.For example, a man who supposes in his sleep that he is being 
accused of a crime, immediately associates this idea with that of 
its satellites—judges, executioners, the gibbet.” And from being 
thus burdened with all these new elements, involving them in its

course, the idea assumes a kind of additional power which 
ultimately renders it irresistible even to the most concerted 
efforts of the will.Madness, which finds its first possibility in the phenomenon 
of passion, and in the deployment of that double causality which, 
starting from passion itself, radiates both toward the body and 
toward the soul, is at the same time suspension of passion, 
breach of causality, dissolution of the elements of this unity.Madness participates both in the necessity of passion and in the 
anarchy of what, released by this very passion, transcends it and 
ultimately contests all it implies.
