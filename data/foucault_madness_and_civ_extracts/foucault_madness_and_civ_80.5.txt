belonged to unreason, to the transcendence of its discourse, was 
relegated to the psychological. And it is precisely here that 
psychology was born—not as the truth of madness, but as a sign

This is why we must do justice to Freud. Between Freud’s 
Five Case Histories and Janet’s scrupulous investigations of 
Psychological Healing , there is more than the density of a 
discovery, there is the sovereign violence of a return. Janet

madness at the level of its language , reconstituted one of the 
essential elements of an experience reduced to silence by 
positivism; he did not make a major addition to the list of 
psychological treatments for madness; he restored, in medical 
thought, the possibility of a dialogue with unreason. Let us not
