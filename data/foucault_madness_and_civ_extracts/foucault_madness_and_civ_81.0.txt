and unreason.” 

In doubt’s confrontation with its major dangers, Descartes 
realized that he could not be mad—though he was to 
acknowledge for a long time to come that all the powers of 
unreason kept vigil around his thought; but as a philosopher, 
resolutely undertaking to doubt, he could not be “one of these 
insane ones.” Rameau’s Nephew, though, knew quite well—and 
among his fleeting certainties, this was the most obstinate—that 
he was mad. “Before beginning, he heaved a profound sigh and 
raised his hands to his forehead; then he regained his calm 
demeanor and said to me: you know I am ignorant, mad, 
impertinent, and lazy.”l 

The eighteenth century could not exactly understand the 
meaning expressed in Le Neveu de Rameau. Yet something had 
happened, just when the text was written, which promised a 
decisive change. A curious thing: the unreason that had been 
relegated to the distance of confinement reappeared, fraught 
with new dangers and as if endowed with a new power of 
interrogation. Yet what the eighteenth century first noticed 
about it was not the secret interrogation, but only the social 
effects: the torn clothing, the arrogance in rags, the tolerated 
insolence whose disturbing powers were silenced by an amused 
indulgence. The eighteenth century might not have recognized 
itself in Rameau’s Nephew, but it was entirely present in the 1 
who served him as interlocutor and as a type of “exhibitor,” 
amused yet reticent, and with a secret anxiety: for this was the

first time since the Great Confinement that the madman had 
become a social individual; it was the first time that anyone had 
entered into conversation with him, and that, once again, he was 
questioned. Unreason reappeared as a classification, which is not 
much; but it nonetheless reappeared, and slowly recovered its 
place in the familiarity of the social landscape. It was there some 
ten years before the Revolution, when Mercier found it without 
more astonishment than: “Go into another cafe; a man whispers 
to you in a calm and confident tone: ‘You cannot imagine, 
Monsieur, the Governmenfs ingratitude toward me, and its 
blindness to its own interests! For thirty years I have neglected 
my own affairs; I have shut myself up in my study, meditating, 
dreaming, calculating; I have devised a project to pay all the 
State’s debts; another to enrich the King and assure him an 
income of 400 million; another to destroy England forever, 
whose very name affronts me.... When, utterly devoted to these 
vast operations that demand all the application of genius, I was
