evil by itself, instituting another reign of terror. 

Suddenly, in a few years in the middle of the eighteenth 
century, a fear arose—a fear formulated in medical terms but 
animated, basically, by a moral myth. People were in dread of a 
mysterious disease that spread, it was said, from the houses of 
confinement and would soon threaten the cities. They spoke of

prison fevers; they evoked the wagons of criminals, men in 
chains who passed through the cities, leaving disease in their 
wake; scurvy was thought to cause contagions; it was said that 
the air, tainted by disease, would corrupt the residential quarters. 
And the great image of medieval horror reappeared, giving birth, 
in the metaphors of dread, to a second panic. The house of 
confinement was no longer only the lazar house at the city’s 
edge; it was leprosy itself confronting the town: “A terrible ulcer 
upon the body politic, an ulcer that is wide, deep, and draining, 
one that cannot be imagined except by looking full upon it. Even 
the air of the place, which can be smelled four hundred yards 
away—everything suggests that one is approaching a place of 
violence, an asylum of degradation and infortune.”3 Many of 
these centers of confinement were built in the very places where 
the lepers had once been kept; it was as if, across the centuries, 
the new tenants had received the contagion. They revived the 
blazon and the meaning that had been borne in those places: 
“Too great a leper for the capital! The name of Bicetre is a word 
no one can pronounce without an inexpressible feeling of 
repugnance, of horror and contempt.... It has become the 
receptacle for all the most monstrous and vile things to be found 
in society.”4 

The evil which men had attempted to exclude by confinement 
reappeared, to the horror of the public, in a fantastic guise. There 
appeared, ramifying in every direction, the themes of an evil, 
both physical and moral, that enveloped in this very ambiguity 
the mingled powers of corrosion and horror. There prevailed, 
then, a sort of undifferentiated image of “rottenness” that had to 
do with the corruption of morals as well as with the 
decomposition of the flesh, and upon which were based both the 
repugnance and the pity felt for the confined. First the evil began 
to ferment in the closed spaces of confinement. It had all the 
virtues attributed to acid in eighteenth-century chemistry: its fine
