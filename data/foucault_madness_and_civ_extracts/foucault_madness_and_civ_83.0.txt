population had to be reassured and Bicetre cleared of its guilt: 
“The rumors that have begun to spread concerning a contagious 
illness at Bicetre that is capable of infecting the capital are 
without foundation.” Evidently the report did not check the 
rumors completely, since some time later the physician of the 
Hopital General issued another in which he made the same 
statement; he was forced to acknowledge the poor sanitary 
conditions of Bicetre, but “matters have not, for all that, reached 
the cruel extremity of converting the refuge of these unfortunates 
into another source of inevitable evils much more lamentable 
than those which require a remedy as prompt as it is efficacious.” 

The circle was closed: all those forms of unreason which had 
replaced leprosy in the geography of evil, and which had been 
banished into the remotest social distance, now became a visible 
leprosy and offered their running sores to the promiscuity of 
men. Unreason was once more present; but marked now by an 
imaginary stigma of disease, which added its powers of terror. 

Thus it is in the realm of the fantastic and not within the rigor 
of medical thought that unreason joins illness and draws closer to 
it. Long before the problem of discovering to what degree the 
unreasonable is pathological was formulated, there had formed, 
in the space of confinement and by an alchemy peculiar to it, a 
melange combining the dread of unreason and the old specters of 
disease. From a great distance, the old confusions about leprosy 
functioned once again; and it is the vigor of these fantastic 
themes which was the first agent of synthesis between the world

of unreason and the medical universe. They first communicated 
through the hallucinations of fear, combining the infernal 
mixtures of “corruption” and “taint.” It is important, perhaps 
decisive for the place madness was to occupy in modern culture, 
that homo medicus was not called into the world of confinement 
as an arbiter , to divide what was crime from what was madness, 
what was evil from what was illness, but rather as a guardian, to 
protect others from the vague danger that exuded through the 
walls of confinement. It is easy to suppose that a free and 
generous sympathy awakened interest in the fate of the confined, 
and that a more diligent and informed medical attention could 
recognize disease where previously the authorities had 
indiscriminately punished transgressions. As it happened, the 
atmosphere was not one of such benevolent neutrality. If a 
doctor was summoned, if he was asked to observe, it was because 
people were afraid—afraid of the strange chemistry that seethed
