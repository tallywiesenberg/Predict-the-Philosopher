immorality: “these guarded asylums ... are retreats as useful as 
they are necessary.... The sight of these shadowy places and the 
guilty creatures they contain is well calculated to preserve from 
the same acts of just reprobation the deviations of a too 
licentious youth; it is thus prudent of mothers and fathers to 
familiarize their children at an early age with these horrible and

detestable places, where shame and turpitude fetter crime, where 
man, corrupted in his essence, often loses forever the rights he 
had acquired in society.” 

Such are the dreams by which morality, in complicity with 
medicine, tried to defend itself against the dangers contained but 
insufficiently restricted by confinement. These same dangers, at 
the same time, fascinated men's imaginations and their desires. 
Morality dreams of exorcising them, but there is something in 
man which makes him dream of experiencing them, or at least of 
approaching them and releasing their hallucinations. The horror 
that now surrounded the fortresses of confinement also exercised 
an irresistible attraction. Such nights were peopled with 
inaccessible pleasures; such corrupt and ravaged faces became 
masks of voluptuousness; against these dark landscapes appeared 
forms—pains and delights—which echoed Hieronymus Bosch 
and his delirious gardens. The secrets that escaped from the 
chateau in the One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom have been 
murmured ever since: “There, the most infamous excesses are 
committed upon the very person of the prisoner; we hear of 
certain vices practiced frequently, notoriously, and even publicly 
in the common room of the prison, vices which the propriety of 
modern times does not permit us to name. We are told that 
numerous prisoners, simillimi feminis mores stuprati et 
constupratores\ that they return from this obscure, forbidden place 
covered over with their own and others’ debaucheries, lost to all 
shame and ready to commit all sorts of crimes.”7 And La 
Rochefoucauld-Liancourt in his turn evoked those figures of Old 
Women and Young Women in the correction wards of La 
Salpetriere, who from generation to generation communicate the 
same secrets and the same pleasures: “The correction ward is the 
place of greatest punishment for the House, containing when we 
visited it forty-seven girls, most of them very young, more 
thoughtless than guilty.... And always this confusion of ages,
