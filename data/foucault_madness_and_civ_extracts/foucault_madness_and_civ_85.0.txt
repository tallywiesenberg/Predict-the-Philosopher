humiliation. The great cosmic conflict whose peripities had been 
revealed by the Insane in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
shifted until it became, at the end of the classical period, a 
dialectic lacking the heart’s mediation. Sadism is not a name 
finally given to a practice as old as Eros; it is a massive cultural 
fact which appeared precisely at the end of the eighteenth 
century, and which constitutes one of the greatest conversions of 
Western imagination: unreason transformed into delirium of the 
heart, madness of desire, the insane dialogue of love and death in 
the limitless presumption of appetite. Sadism appears at the very 
moment that unreason, confined for over a century and reduced 
to silence, reappears, no longer as an image of the world, no 
longer as a figura , but as language and desire. And it is no 
accident that sadism, as an individual phenomenon bearing the 
name of a man, was born of confinement and, within 
confinement, that Sade’s entire oeuvre is dominated by the 
images of the Fortress, the Cell, the Cellar, the Convent, the 
inaccessible Island which thus form, as it were, the natural 
habitat of unreason. It is no accident, either, that all the fantastic 
literature of madness and horror, which is contemporary with 
Sade’s oeuvre , takes place, preferentially, in the strongholds of 
confinement. And this whole sudden conversion of Western 
memory at the end of the eighteenth century, with its possibility 
of rediscovering—deformed and endowed with a new meaning— 
figures familiar at the end of the Middle Ages: was this 
conversion not authorized by the survival and the reawakening of 
the fantastic in the very places where unreason had been reduced

to silence? 


In the classical period, the awareness of madness and the 
awareness of unreason had not separated from one another. The 
experience of unreason that had guided all the practices of 
confinement so enveloped the awareness of madness that it very 
nearly permitted it to disappear, sweeping it along a road of 
regression where it was close to losing its most specific elements. 

But in the anxiety of the second half of the eighteenth century, 
the fear of madness grew at the same time as the dread of 
unreason: and thereby the two forms of obsession, leaning upon 
each other, continued to reinforce each other. And at the very 
moment we note the liberation of the iconographic powers that 
accompany unreason, we hear on all sides complaints about the 
ravages of madness. Already we are familiar with the concern
