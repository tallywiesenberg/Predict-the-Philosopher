unreason and the time of madness receive two opposing vectors: 
one being unconditioned return and absolute submersion; the 
other, on the contrary, developing according to the chronicle of a 
history. 9 

1. Madness and Liberty. For a long time, certain forms of 
melancholia were considered specifically English; this was a fact 
in medicine and a constant in literature. Montesquieu contrasted 
Roman suicide, which was a form of moral and political

behavior, the desired effect of a concerted education, with 
English suicide, which had to be considered as an illness since 
“the English kill themselves without any apparent reason for 
doing so; they kill themselves in the very lap of happiness.” It is 
here that the milieu plays its role, for if happiness in the 
eighteenth century is part of the order of nature and reason, 
unhappiness, or at least whatever deters from happiness without 
reason, must be part of another order. This order was sought first 
in the excesses of the climate, in nature’s deviation from its 
equilibrium and its happy mean (temperate climates are caused 
by nature; intemperate climates by the milieu). But this was not 
sufficient to explain la maladie anglaise ; already Cheyne had 
declared that wealth, refined food, the abundance all the 
inhabitants enjoyed, the life of pleasure and ease the richest 
society led, were at the origin of such nervous disorders. 
Increasingly, a political and economic explanation was sought, in 
which wealth, progress, institutions appear as the determining 
element of madness. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, 
Spurzheim made a synthesis of all these analyses in one of the 
last texts devoted to them. 10 Madness, “more frequent in 
England than anywhere else,” is merely the penalty of the liberty 
that reigns there, and of the wealth universally enjoyed. Freedom 
of conscience entails more dangers than authority and despotism. 
“Religious sentiments ... exist without restriction; every 
individual is entitled to preach to anyone who will listen to him,” 
and by listening to such different opinions, “minds are disturbed 
in the search for truth.” Dangers of indecision, of an irresolute 
attention, of a vacillating soul! The danger, too, of disputes, of 
passions, of obstinacy: “Everything meets with opposition, and 
opposition excites the feelings; in religion, in politics, in science, 
as in everything, each man is permitted to form an opinion; but 
he must expect to meet with opposition.” Nor does so much 
liberty permit a man to master time; every man is left to his own
