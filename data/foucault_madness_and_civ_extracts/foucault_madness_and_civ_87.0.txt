suspicious of the effects of too strict a devotion, too strong a 
belief. Too much moral rigor, too much anxiety about salvation 
and the life to come were often thought to bring on melancholia. 
The Encyclopedie does not fail to cite such cases: “The 
intemperate impressions made by certain extravagant preachers, 
the excessive fears they inspire of the pains with which our 
religion threatens those who break its laws, produce astonishing 
revolutions in weak minds. At the hospital of Montelimar, 
several women were reported suffering from mania and 
melancholia as a result of a mission held in that city; these 
creatures were ceaselessly struck by the horrible images that had 
thoughtlessly been presented to them; they spoke of nothing but 
despair, revenge, punishment, etc., and one of them absolutely 
refused to undergo any cure, convinced that she was in Hell and 
that nothing could extinguish the fire she believed was devouring 
her.” Pinel follows the line of these enlightened physicians— 
forbidding books of devotion to be given to “melancholics by 
piety,” even recommending solitary confinement for “religious 
persons who believe themselves to be inspired and who seek to 
make proselytes.” But this again is more of a critique than a 
positive analysis: the religious object or theme is suspected of 
arousing delirium and hallucination by the delirious and 
hallucinatory nature attributed to it. Pinel reports the case of a 
recently cured madman who had “read in a religious book ... that 
each man has his guardian angel; on the following night, he 
thought he was surrounded by a choir of angels and imagined he 
heard celestial music and received revelations.” Religion is 
considered here only as an element in the transmission of error. 
But even before Pinel, there had been analyses of a more rigorous

historical nature, in which religion appeared as a milieu of 
satisfaction or repression of the passions. In 1781 a German 
author described as happy those distant eras when priests were 
endowed with absolute powers: then idleness did not exist, every 
moment was marked by “ceremonies, religious practices, 
pilgrimages, visits to the poor and the sick, calendar festivals.”! 1 
Time was thus assigned to an organized happiness, which left no 
leisure for empty passions, for disgust with life, for boredom. If a 
man felt guilty, he was subjected to real, often material 
punishment which occupied his mind and gave him an assurance 
that the transgression was redressed. And when the confessor 
encountered those “hypochondriacal penitents who came too 
often to confession,” he assigned them as penance either a severe 
hardship that “diluted their too thick blood,” or long pilgrimages: 
“The change of air, the length of the road, absence from home,
