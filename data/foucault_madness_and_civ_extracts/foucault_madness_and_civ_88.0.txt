easily perceived by our senses, which offer the soul agreeable 
relations because of the harmony of their consonance ... perform 
throughout the entire bodily machine a light activity which is 
beneficial to all the functions.” On the contrary, a knowledge too 
poor in these sensuous relations, too free with regard to the 
immediate, provokes a tension of the brain alone which 
disequilibrates the whole body; sciences “of things whose 
relationships are difficult to grasp because they are not readily

available to our senses, or because their too complicated relations 
oblige us to expend great application in their study, present the 
soul with an exercise that greatly fatigues the inner sense by a too 
continuous tension upon that organ.” Knowledge thus forms 
around feeling a milieu of abstract relationships where man risks 
losing the physical happiness in which his relation to the world is 
usually established. Knowledge multiplies, no doubt, but its cost 
increases too. Is it certain that there are more wise men today? 
One thing, at least, is certain: “there are more people who have 
the infirmities of wisdom.” The milieu of knowledge grows faster 
than knowledge itself. 

But it is not only knowledge that detaches man from feeling; it 
is sensibility itself: a sensibility that is no longer controlled by the 
movements of nature, but by all the habits, all the demands of 
social life. Modern man—but woman more than man—turns day 
into night and night into day: “The moment at which our 
women rise in Paris is far removed from that which nature has 
indicated; the best hours of the day have slipped away; the purest 
air has disappeared; no one has benefited from it. The vapors, 
the harmful exhalations, attracted by the sun’s heat, are already 
rising in the atmosphere; this is the hour that beauty chooses to 
rise.’ ”12 This disorder of the senses continues in the theater, 
where illusions are cultivated, where vain passions and the most 
fatal movements of the soul are aroused by artifice; women 
especially enjoy these spectacles “that inflame and arouse them”; 
their souls “are so strongly shaken that this produces a 
commotion in their nerves, fleeting, in truth, but whose 
consequences are usually serious; the momentary loss of their 
senses, the tears they shed at the performances of our modern 
tragedies are the least accidents that can result from them.”13 
Novels form a still more artificial milieu, and are more dangerous 
to a disordered sensibility; the verisimilitude modern authors 
attempt to produce, and all the art they employ to imitate truth,
