their souls “are so strongly shaken that this produces a 
commotion in their nerves, fleeting, in truth, but whose 
consequences are usually serious; the momentary loss of their 
senses, the tears they shed at the performances of our modern 
tragedies are the least accidents that can result from them.”13
