only give more prestige to the violent and dangerous sentiments 
they seek to awaken in their female readers: “In the earliest 
epochs of French gallantry and manners, the less perfected minds 
of women were content with facts and events as marvelous as 
they were unbelievable; now they demand believable facts yet 
sentiments so marvelous that their own minds are disturbed and 
confounded by them; they then seek, in all that surrounds them, 
to realize the marvels by which they are enchanted; but 
everything seems to them without sentiment and without life, 
because they are trying to find what does not exist in nature.” 14 
The novel constitutes the milieu of perversion, par excellence, of 
all sensibility; it detaches the soul from all that is immediate and 
natural in feeling and leads it into an imaginary world of 
sentiments violent in proportion to their unreality, and less 
controlled by the gentle laws of nature; “The existence of so 
many authors has produced a host of readers, and continued 
reading generates every nervous complaint; perhaps of all the 
causes that have harmed women’s health, the principal one has 
been the infinite multiplication of novels in the last hundred

century constituted, around its awareness of madness and of its 
threatening spread, a whole new order of concepts. In the 
landscape of unreason where the sixteenth century had located it, 
madness concealed a meaning and an origin that were obscurely 
moral; its secrecy related it to sin, and the animality imminently 
perceived in it did not make it, paradoxically, more innocent. In 
the second half of the eighteenth century, madness was no longer 
recognized in what brings man closer to an immemorial fall or an 
indefinitely present animality; it was, on the contrary, situated in 
those distances man takes in regard to himself, to his world, to 
all that is offered by the immediacy of nature; madness became

possible in that milieu where mans relations with his feelings, 
with time, with others, are altered; madness was possible because 
of everything which, in mans life and development, is a break 
with the immediate. Madness was no longer of the order of 
nature or of the Fall, but of a new order, in which men began to 
have a presentiment of history, and where there formed, in an 
obscure originating relationship, the “alienation” of the 
physicians and the “alienation” of the philosophers—two
