configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth, but 
between which the nineteenth century, after Hegel, soon lost all 
trace of resemblance.

THE NEW DIVISION 


EVERY psychiatrist, every historian yielded, at the beginning of 
the nineteenth century, to the same impulse of indignation; 
everywhere we find the same outrage, the same virtuous censure: 
“No one blushed to put the insane in prison/’ And Esquirol, 
listing the fortress of Ha in Bordeaux, the houses of correction in 
Toulouse and Rennes, the “Bicetres” still existing in Poitiers, in 
Caen, in Amiens, the “Chateau” of Angers, continues: 
“Moreover, there are few prisons where the raving mad are not to

criminals. What a monstrous association! The calm madmen are 
treated worse than malefactors.” 

The entire century echoes him; in England, it was the Tukes, 
who had turned historians and apologists for their ancestral 
occupation; in Germany, after Wagnitz, it was Reil who groaned 
over those wretches “thrown, like State criminals, into dungeons 
where the eye of humanity never penetrates.” The age of 
positivism, for over half a century, constantly claimed to have 
been the first to free the mad from a lamentable confusion with 
the felonious, to separate the innocence of unreason from the 
guilt of crime. 

Yet it is simple enough to show the vanity of this claim. For 
years the same protests had been raised; before Reil, there had 
been Franck: “Those who have visited the insane asylums of 
Germany recall with dread what they have seen. One is horrified 
upon entering these asylums of misery and affliction; one hears 
only cries of despair, yet here dwells the man distinguished by his 
talents and his virtues.” Before Esquirol, before Pinel, there had 
been La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, there had been Tenon; and 
before them, an incessant murmur throughout the eighteenth
