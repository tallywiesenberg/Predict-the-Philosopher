reminds each man of his truth; in a comedy where each man 
deceives the other and dupes himself, the madman is comedy to 
the second degree: the deception of deception; he utters, in his 
simpleton s language which makes no show of reason, the words 
of reason that release, in the comic, the comedy: he speaks love 
to lovers, the truth of life to the young, the middling reality of 
things to the proud, to the insolent, and to liars. Even the old 
feasts of fools, so popular in Flanders and northern Europe, were 
theatrical events, and organized into social and moral criticism, 
whatever they may have contained of spontaneous religious 

In learned literature, too, Madness or Folly was at work, at the 
very heart of reason and truth. It is Folly which embarks all men 
without distinction on its insane ship and binds them to the 
vocation of a common odyssey (Van Oestvoren’s Blauwe Schute , 
Brant’s Narrenschifj)\ it is Folly whose baleful reign Thomas 
Murner conjures up in his Narrenbeschworung ; it is Folly which 
gets the best of Love in Corroz’s satire Contre fol amour , or 
argues with Love as to which of the two comes first, which of the 
two makes the other possible, and triumphs in Louise Labe’s 
dialogue, Debat de folie et d'amour. Folly also has its academic 
pastimes; it is the object of argument, it contends against itself; it

is denounced, and defends itself by claiming that it is closer to 
happiness and truth than reason, that it is closer to reason than 
reason itself; Jakob Wimpfeling edits the Monopolium 
philo soph orum, and Judocus Gallus the Monopolium et societas , 
vulgo des lichtschijfs. Finally, at the center of all these serious 
games, the great humanist texts: the Moria rediviva of Flayder 
and Erasmus’s Praise of Folly. And confronting all these 
discussions, with their tireless dialectic, confronting these 
discourses constantly reworded and reworked, a long dynasty of 
images, from Hieronymus Bosch with The Cure of Madness and 
The Ship of Fools , down to Brueghel and his Dulle Griet\ 
woodcuts and engravings transcribe what the theater, what 
literature and art have already taken up: the intermingled themes 
of the Feast and of the Dance of Fools. Indeed, from the 
fifteenth century on, the face of madness has haunted the 
imagination of Western man. 

A sequence of dates speaks for itself: the Dance of Death in the 
Cimetiere des Innocents doubtless dates from the first years of 
the fifteenth century, the one in the Chaise-Dieu was probably 
composed around 1460; and it was in 1485 that Guyot Marchant
