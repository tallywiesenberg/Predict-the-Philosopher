Madness ends by being a 
movement of the nerves and muscles so violent that nothing in 
the course of images, ideas, or wills seems to correspond to it: 
this is the case of mania when it is suddenly intensified into 
convulsions, or when it degenerates into continuous frenzy.Conversely, madness can, in the body’s repose or inertia, 
generate and then maintain an agitation of the soul, without 
pause or pacification, as is the case in melancholia, where 
external objects do not produce the same impression on the 
sufferer s mind as on that of a healthy man; “his impressions are 
weak and he rarely pays attention to them; his mind is almost 
totally absorbed by the vivacity of certain ideas.”6 

Indeed this dissociation between the external movements of 
the body and the course of ideas does not mean that the unity of 
body and soul is necessarily dissolved, nor that each recovers its 
autonomy in madness.Doubtless the unity is compromised in its 
rigor and in its totality; but it is fissured, it turns out, along lines 
which do not abolish it, but divide it into arbitrary sectors.For 
when melancholia fixes upon an aberrant idea, it is not only the 
soul which is involved; it is the soul with the brain, the soul with 
the nerves, their origin and their fibers: a whole segment of the 
unity of soul and body is thus detached from the aggregate and 
especially from the organs by which reality is perceived.The

same thing occurs in convulsions and agitation: the soul is not 
excluded from the body, but is swept along so rapidly by it that it 
cannot retain all its conceptions; it is separated from its 
memories, its intentions, its firmest ideas, and thus isolated from 
itself and from all that remains stable in the body, it surrenders 
itself to the most mobile fibers; nothing in its behavior is 
henceforth adapted to reality, to truth, or to prudence; though 
the fibers in their vibration may imitate what is happening in the 
perceptions, the sufferer cannot tell the difference: “The rapid 
and chaotic pulsations of the arteries, or whatever other 
derangement occurs, imprints this same movement on the fibers 
(as in perception); they will represent as present objects which 
are not so, as true those which are chimerical.”?
