In madness, the totality of soul and body is parceled out: not 
according to the elements which constitute that totality 
metaphysically; but according to figures, images which envelop 
segments of the body and ideas of the soul in a kind of absurd 
unity.Fragments which isolate man from himself, but above all 
from reality; fragments which, by detaching themselves, have 
formed the unreal unity of a hallucination, and by very virtue of 
this autonomy impose it upon truth.“Madness is no more than 

the derangement of the imagination.”^ In other words, 
beginning with passion, madness is still only an intense 
movement in the rational unity of soul and body; this is the level 
of unreason ; but this intense movement quickly escapes the 
reason of the mechanism and becomes, in its violences, its 
stupors, its senseless propagations, an irrational movement; and 
it is then that, escaping truth and its constraints, the Unreal 
appears.And thereby we find the suggestion of the third cycle we must 
now trace: that of chimeras, of hallucinations, and of error—the 
cycle of non-being.103 


Let us listen to what is said in these fantastic fragments.
