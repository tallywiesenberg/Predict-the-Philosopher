The act of the reasonable man who, rightly or wrongly, judges an 
image to be true or false, is beyond this image, transcends and 
measures it by what is not itself; the act of the madman never 
oversteps the image presented, but surrenders to its immediacy, 
and affirms it only insofar is it is enveloped by it: “Many persons, 
not to say all, succumb to madness only from being too 
concerned about an object.” Inside the image, confiscated by

it, and incapable of escaping from it, madness is nonetheless 
more than imagination, forming an act of undetermined content.What is this act?An act of faith, an act of affirmation and of 
negation—a discourse which sustains and at the same time 
erodes the image, undermines it, distends it in the course of a 
reasoning, and organizes it around a segment of language.The 
man who imagines he is made of glass is not mad, for any sleeper 
can have this image in a dream; but he is mad if, believing he is 
made of glass, he thereby concludes that he is fragile, that he is 
in danger of breaking, that he must touch no object which might 
be too resistant, that he must in fact remain motionless, and so 
on.Such reasonings are those of a madman; but again we must 
note that in themselves they are neither absurd nor illogical.
