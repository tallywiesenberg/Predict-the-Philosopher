Madness, then, is not altogether in the image, which of 
itself is neither true nor false, neither reasonable nor mad; nor is 
it, further, in the reasoning which is mere form, revealing 
nothing but the indubitable figures of logic.And yet madness is 
in one and in the other: in a special version or figure of their 
relationship.Let us consider an example borrowed from Diemerbroek.A 
man was suffering from a profound melancholia.As with all 
melancholics, his mind was attached to a fixed idea, and this idea 
was for him the occasion of a constantly renewed sadness.
