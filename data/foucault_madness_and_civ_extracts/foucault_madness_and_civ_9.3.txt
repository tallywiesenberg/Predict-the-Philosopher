He 
accused himself of having killed his son, and in the excess of his 
remorse, declared that God, for his punishment, had assigned a 
demon to tempt him, like the demon which had tempted the 
Lord.This demon he saw, spoke to, heard, and answered.He 
did not understand why those around him refused to 
acknowledge such a presence.Such then is madness: this 
remorse, this belief, this hallucination, these speeches; in short, 
this complex of convictions and images which constitutes a 
delirium.Now Diemerbroek tries to find out what are the 
“causes” of this madness, how it can have originated.
