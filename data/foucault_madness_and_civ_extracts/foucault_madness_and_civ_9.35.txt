And this is 
what he learns: this man had taken his son bathing and the boy 
had drowned.Hence the father considered himself responsible 
for his sons death.We can therefore reconstitute in the 
following manner the development of this madness: judging 
himself guilty, the man decides that homicide is execrable in the 
sight of God on High; whence it occurs to his imagination that 
he is eternally damned; and since he knows that the chief 
torment of damnation consists in being delivered into Satan’s 
hands, he tells himself “that a horrible demon is assigned to 
him.” This demon he does not as yet see, but since “he does not 
cease thinking of it,” and “regards this notion as necessarily true,” 
he imposes on his brain a certain image of this demon; this 
image is presented to his soul by the action of the brain and of 
the spirits with such insistence that he believes he continually

sees the demon itself.”12 

Hence madness, as analyzed by Diemerbroek, has two levels; 
one is manifest to all eyes: an unwarranted melancholia in a man 
who wrongly accuses himself of having killed his son; a depraved 
imagination which pictures demons; a dismantled reason which 
converses with a phantom.But at a deeper level, we find a 
rigorous organization dependent on the faultless armature of a 
discourse.This discourse, in its logic, commands the firmest 
belief in itself, it advances by judgments and reasonings which 
connect together; it is a kind of reason in action.
