In short, under 
the chaotic and manifest delirium reigns the order of a secret 
delirium.In this second delirium, which is, in a sense, pure 
reason, reason delivered of all the external tinsel of dementia, is 
located the paradoxical truth of madness.And this in a double 
sense, since we find here both what makes madness true 
(irrefutable logic, perfectly organized discourse, faultless 
connection in the transparency of a virtual language) and what 
makes it truly madness (its own nature, the special style of all its 
manifestations, and the internal structure of delirium).But still more profoundly, this delirious language is the 
ultimate truth of madness insofar as it is madness’s organizing 
form, the determining principle of all its manifestations, whether 
of the body or of the soul.For if Diemerbroek’s melancholic 
converses with his demon, it is because the demon’s image has 
been profoundly impressed by the movement of spirits on the 
still-ductile substance of the brain.
