Hence it is not surprising to find the 
eighteenth-century nosographers often classifying vertigo as a 
madness, and more rarely hysterical convulsions; this is because it 
is often impossible to find in hysterical convulsions the unity of a 
language, while vertigo affords the delirious affirmation that the 
world is really “turning around.” Such delirium is a necessary and 
sufficient reason for a disease to be called madness.4.Language is the first and last structure of madness , its 
constituent form; on language are based all the cycles in which 
madness articulates its nature.That the essence of madness can 
be ultimately defined in the simple structure of a discourse does 
not reduce it to a purely psychological nature, but gives it a hold 
over the totality of soul and body; such discourse is both the 
silent language by which the mind speaks to itself in the truth 
proper to it, and the visible articulation in the movements of the 
body.Parallelisms, complements, all the forms of immediate 
communication which we have seen manifested, in madness are 
suspended between soul and body in this single language and in 
its powers.
