The movement of passion which persists until it 
breaks and turns against itself, the sudden appearance of the 
image, and the agitations of the body which were its visible 
concomitants—all this, even as we were trying to reconstruct it, 
was already secretly animated by this language.If the 
determinism of passion is transcended and released in the

hallucination of the image, if the image, in return, has swept 
away the whole world of beliefs and desires, it is because the 
delirious language was already present—a discourse which 
liberated passion from all its limits, and adhered with all the 
constraining weight of its affirmation to the image which was 
liberating itself 

It is in this delirium, which is of both body and soul, of both 
language and image, of both grammar and physiology, that all 
the cycles of madness conclude and begin.It is this delirium 
whose rigorous meaning organized them from the start.It is 
madness itself, and also, beyond each of its phenomena, its silent 
transcendence, which constitute the truth of madness.A last question remains: In the name of what can this 
fundamental language be regarded as a delirium?
