Granting that it 
is the truth of madness , what makes it true madness and the 
originating form of insanity?Why should it be in this discourse, 
whose forms we have seen to be so faithful to the rules of reason, 
that we find all those signs which will most manifestly declare 
the very absence of reason?A central question, but one to which the classical age has not 
formulated a direct answer.We must approach it obliquely, 
interrogating the experiences which are to be found in the 
immediate neighborhood of this essential language of madness: 
that is, the dream and the delusion.The quasi-oneiric character of madness is one of the constant 
themes in the classical period.
