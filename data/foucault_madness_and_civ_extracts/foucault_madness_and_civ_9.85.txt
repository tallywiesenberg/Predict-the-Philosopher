Dreams and madness then appeared to be of the same 
substance.Their mechanism was the same; thus Zacchias could 
identify in sleepwalking the movements which cause dreams, but 
which in a waking state can also provoke madness.In the first moments when one falls asleep, the vapors which 
rise in the body and ascend to the head are many, turbulent, and 
dense.They are so dark that they waken no image in the brain; 
they merely agitate, in their chaotic dance, the nerves and the 
muscles.The same is true in the frenzied, in maniacs: they suffer 
few hallucinations, no false beliefs, but an intense agitation 
which they cannot manage to control.
