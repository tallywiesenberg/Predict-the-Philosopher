Let us continue the 
evolution of sleep: after the first period of turbulence, the vapors 
which rise to the brain are clarified, their movement organized; 
this is the moment when fantastic dreams are born; one sees 
miracles, a thousand impossible things.To this stage corresponds 
that of dementia, in which one is convinced of many things 
“which are not in real life.” Then at last the agitation of the 
vapors is calmed altogether; the sleeper begins to see things still

more clearly; in the transparency of the henceforth limpid vapors, 
recollections of the day before reappear in accordance with 
reality; such images are at most transposed, on one point or 
another—as occurs in melancholics, who recognize all things as 
they are, “in particular those who are not merely distracted.” 
Between the gradual developments of sleep—with what they 
contribute at each stage to the quality of the imagination—and 
the forms of madness, the analogy is constant, because the 
mechanisms are the same: the same movement of vapors and 
spirits, the same liberation of images, the same correspondence 
between the physical qualities of phenomena and the 
psychological or moral values of sentiments.“To emerge from 
the insane no differently than from the sleeping.”!6 

The important thing, in Zacchias’s analysis, is that madness is 
not associated with dreams in their positive phenomena, but 
rather to the totality formed by sleep and dreams together: that 
is, to a complex which includes—besides the image— 
hallucination, memory, or prediction, the great void of sleep, the 
night of the senses, and all that negativity which wrests man 
from the waking state and its apparent truths.Whereas tradition 
compared the delirium of the madman to the vivacity of the 
dream images, the classical period identified delirium only with 
the complex of the image and the night of the mind, against 
which background it assumed its liberty.And this complex, 
transposed entire into the clarity of the waking state, constituted 
madness.
