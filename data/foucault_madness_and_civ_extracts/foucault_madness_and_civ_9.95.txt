This is how we must understand the definitions of 
madness which insistently recur throughout the classical period.The dream, as a complex figure of image and sleep, is almost 
always present in that definition.Either in a negative fashion— 
the notion of the waking state then being the only one that 
distinguishes madmen from sleepers; or in a positive fashion, 
delirium being defined as a modality of the dream, with the 
waking state as the specific difference: “Delirium is the dream of

waking persons.”!7 The ancients’ notion of the dream as a 
transitory form of madness is inverted; it is no longer the dream 
which borrows its disturbing powers from alienation—showing 
thereby how fragile or limited reason is; it is madness which 
takes its original nature from the dream and reveals in this 
kinship that it is a liberation of the image in the dark night of 
reality.The dream deceives; it leads to confusions; it is illusory.But it 
is not erroneous.
