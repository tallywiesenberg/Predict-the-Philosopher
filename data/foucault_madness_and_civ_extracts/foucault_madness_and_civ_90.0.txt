to send them back to the cells, or to keep them in chains. And 
already, we can anticipate that from one century to the next, the 
same protests did not have, at bottom, the same value. Early in 
the nineteenth century, there was indignation that the mad were 
not treated any better than those condemned by common law or 
than State prisoners; throughout the eighteenth century, 
emphasis was placed on the fact that the prisoners deserved a 
better fate than one that lumped them with the insane. For 
Esquirol, the scandal is due to the fact that the mad are only 
mad; for the Prior of Senlis, to the fact that the convicts are, after 
all, only convicts. 

A difference which is perhaps not of such significance, and 
which ought to have been easily perceived. And yet, it is 
necessary to emphasize it in order to understand how the 
consciousness of madness was transformed in the course of the 
eighteenth century. It did not evolve in the context of a 
humanitarian movement that gradually related it more closely to 
the madman s human reality, to his most affecting and most 
intimate aspect; nor did it evolve under the pressure of a 
scientific need that made it more attentive, more faithful to what 
madness might have to say for itself. If it slowly changed, it was 
within that simultaneously real and artificial space of 
confinement. Certain imperceptible shifts in its structures, or at 
times certain violent crises, gradually formed the awareness of 
madness contemporaneous with the Revolution. No medical 
advance, no humanitarian approach was responsible for the fact 
that the mad were gradually isolated, that the monotony of 
insanity was divided into rudimentary types. It was the depths of 
confinement itself that generated the phenomenon; it is from 
confinement that we must seek an account of this new awareness 
of madness. 

A political more than a philanthropic awareness. For if the

eighteenth century perceived that there were among the confined 
—among the libertines, the debauched, the prodigal sons— 
certain men whose confusion and disorder were of another 
nature, and whose anxiety was irreducible, this perception was 
the result of the confined themselves. They were the first to 
protest, and with the most violence. Ministers, police officers, 
magistrates were assailed with the same endless and tirelessly 
repeated complaints: one man writes to Maurepas, indignant at 
being “forced to mingle with madmen, some of whom are so 
violent that at every moment I risk suffering dangerous abuse
