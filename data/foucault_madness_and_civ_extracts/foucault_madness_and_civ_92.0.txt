question. In this confinement drained of a part of its content, 
these two figures—madness, crime—subsist alone; by 
themselves, they symbolize what may be necessary about it; they 
alone are what henceforth deserves to be confined. Having taken 
its distance, having finally become an assignable form in the 
confused world of unreason, did not liberate madness; between 
madness and confinement, a profound relation had been 
instituted, a link which was almost one of essence. 

But at the same moment, confinement suffered another, still 
deeper crisis that called into question not only its repressive role 
but its very existence; a crisis which arose not from within, and 
which was not attached to political protests, but which slowly 
appeared on the entire social and economic horizon. 

Poverty was gradually being freed from the old moral 
confusions. Men had seen unemployment assume, during crises, 
an aspect that could no longer be identified with that of sloth; 
had seen indigence and idleness forced to spread into the 
countryside, where men had supposed they could recognize 
precisely the most immediate and the purest forms of moral life; 
all this revealed that poverty was perhaps not only of the order of 
transgression: “Mendicity is the fruit of poverty, which itself is 
the result of accidents occurring either in the cultivation of the 
land or in the production of manufactures, or in the rise of 
commodity prices, in an excess of population, etc....”4 Poverty 
had become an economic phenomenon. 

But not contingent—nor destined to be suppressed forever. 
There was a certain quantity of indigence which man would not 
succeed in eliminating—a kind of fatality of poverty which must 
accompany all the forms of society to the end of time, even 
where all the idle were employed: “There need be, in a well- 
governed state, only those poor born in indigence, or those who 

fall into it by accident.” This basic poverty was in a sense 
inalienable: birth or accident, it formed a part of life that could

not be avoided. For a long time, it was inconceivable to have a 
state in which there were no paupers, so deeply did need appear 
to be inscribed in man s fate and in the structure of society: 
property, labor, and poverty are terms which remain linked in the 
thought of philosophers until the nineteenth century.
