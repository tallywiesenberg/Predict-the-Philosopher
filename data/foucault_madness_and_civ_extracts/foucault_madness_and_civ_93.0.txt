not a passive element subject to the fluctuations of wealth, but a 
force which directly contributed to the economic situation, to the 
production of wealth, since it is man’s labor which creates—or at 
least transmits, shifts, and multiplies—wealth. The “Poor Man” 
was a vague notion in which were combined that wealth which is 
Man and the state of Need which is acknowledged as essential to 
humanity. Indeed, between Poverty and Population, there is a 
rigorously inverse relation. 

Physiocrats and economists are in agreement on this. 
Population is in itself one of the elements of wealth; it forms, 
indeed, its certain and inexhaustible source. For Francis 
Quesnay and his disciples, man is the essential mediation 
between the land and wealth: “A man is worth as much as the land , 
according to an old proverb. If a man is valueless, so is the land. 
With men, one doubles the land one possesses; one clears it, one 
acquires it. God alone could from the earth make a man, whereas 
all over the world it has been possible to have land by means of 
men, or at least the product of the land, which comes down to 
the same thing. It follows that the first good is the possession of 
men, and the second, of the land.”7

For the economists, the population is a good quite as essential, 
if not more so, since in their view wealth is created not only in 
agricultural labor, but in every industrial transformation, and 
even in commercial circulation. Wealth is linked to a labor 
actually effected by man: “The State having real wealth only in 
the annual products of its lands and in the industry of its 
inhabitants, its wealth will be at a maximum when the product of 
each acre of land and of the industry of each individual is raised 
to its maximum.”8 Paradoxically, a population will be precious in 
proportion to its numbers, since it will afford industry a cheap 
labor force, which, by lowering the cost price, will permit a 
development of production and of commerce. In this infinitely 
open labor market, the “fundamental price”—what corresponds 
for Turgot to the worker’s subsistence—and the price 
determined by supply and demand ultimately coincide. A nation 
will therefore be favored in commercial competition to the 
degree that it has at its disposal the greatest potential wealth of a 
numerous population. 

Confinement was a gross error, and an economic mistake: 
poverty was to be suppressed by removing and maintaining by 
charity a poor population. Actually, it was poverty that was being 
artificially masked; and a part of the population was being really 
suppressed, wealth being always constant. Was the intention to
