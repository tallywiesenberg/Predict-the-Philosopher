Population is in itself one of the elements of wealth; it forms, 
indeed, its certain and inexhaustible source. For Francis 
Quesnay and his disciples, man is the essential mediation 
between the land and wealth: â€œA man is worth as much as the land , 
according to an old proverb. If a man is valueless, so is the land.
