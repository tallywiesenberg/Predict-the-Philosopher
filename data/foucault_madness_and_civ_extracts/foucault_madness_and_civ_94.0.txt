moment could come when “the ever multiplying foundations 
would ultimately absorb all funds and all private property.” Upon 
close scrutiny, the classical forms of aid were a cause of 
impoverishment, the gradual immobilization and in a sense the 
slow death of all productive wealth: “If all the men who ever 
lived had had a tomb, it would have been quite necessary, in 
order to find land to cultivate, to overturn these sterile 
monuments, and to stir the ashes of the dead in order to feed the 

living. ”10 

What disappeared, in the course of the eighteenth century, 
was not the inhuman rigor with which madmen were treated, but 
the evident necessity of confinement, the total unity in which 
they were situated without difficulty, and those countless threads 
that wove them into the continuous texture of unreason. 
Madness was set free long before Pinel, not from the material 
constraints which kept it in the dungeon, but from a much more 
binding, perhaps more decisive servitude which kept it under the 
domination of unreasons obscure power. Even before the 
Revolution, madness was free: free for a perception which 
individualized it, free for the recognition of its unique features 
and for all the operations that would finally give it its status as an 
object. 

Left alone, and detached from its former relations, within the 
crumbling walls of confinement, madness was a problem— 
raising questions it had hitherto never formulated. 

Above all, it embarrassed the legislator who, unable to keep 
from sanctioning the end of confinement, no longer knew at 
what point in the social sphere to situate it-prison, hospital, or 
family aid. The measures taken immediately before or after the

In his circular on the lettres de cachet , Breteuil asked the 
administrators to indicate the nature of the detention orders in 
the various houses of confinement, and what reasons justified

were to be set free “who, having done nothing that could expose
