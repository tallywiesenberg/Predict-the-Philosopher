famous: the decision to remove the chains from the prisoners in 
the dungeons; Couthon visiting the hospital to find out whether 
any suspects were being hidden; Pinel courageously going to 
meet him, while everyone trembled at the sight of the “invalid 
carried in men’s arms.” The confrontation of the wise, firm 
philanthropist and the paralytic monster. “Pinel immediately led 
him to the section for the deranged, where the sight of the cells 
made a painful impression on him. He asked to interrogate all

the patients. From most, he received only insults and obscene 
apostrophes. It was useless to prolong the interview. Turning to 
Pinel: ‘Now, citizen, are you mad yourself to seek to unchain 
such beasts?’ Pinel replied calmly: ‘Citizen, I am convinced that 
these madmen are so intractable only because they have been 
deprived of air and liberty.’ 

“ ‘Well, do as you like with them, but I fear you may become 
the victim of your own presumption.’ Whereupon, Couthon was 
taken to his carriage. His departure was a relief; everyone 
breathed again; the great philanthropist immediately set to 
work. ”2 

These are images, at least insofar as each of the stories derives 
the essence of its power from imaginary forms: the patriarchal 
calm of Tuke’s home, where the heart’s passions and the mind’s 
disorders slowly subside; the lucid firmness of Pinel, who masters 
in a word and a gesture the two animal frenzies that roar against 
him as they hunt him down; and the wisdom that could 
distinguish, between the raving madman and the bloodthirsty 
member of the Convention, which was the true danger: images 
that will carry far—to our own day—their weight of legend. 

The legends of Pinel and Tuke transmit mythical values, 
which nineteenth-century psychiatry would accept as obvious in 
nature. But beneath the myths themselves, there was an 
operation, or rather a series of operations, which silently 
organized the world of the asylum, the methods of cure, and at 
the same time the concrete experience of madness. 

Tuke’s gesture, first of all. Because it is contemporary with 
Pinel’s, because he is known to have been borne along by a whole 
current of “philanthropy,” this gesture is regarded as an act of 
“liberation.” The truth was quite different: “... there has also 
been particular occasion to observe the great loss, which 
individuals of our society have sustained, by being put under the 
care of those who are not only strangers to our principles, but by
