whom they are frequently mixed with other patients, who may 
indulge themselves in ill language, and other exceptionable 
practices. This often seems to leave an unprofitable effect upon 
the patients’ minds after they are restored to the use of their 
reason, alienating them from those religious attachments which 
they had before experienced; and sometimes, even corrupting 
them with vicious habits to which they had been strangers. ”5 
The Retreat would serve as an instrument of segregation: a moral 
and religious segregation which sought to reconstruct around 
madness a milieu as much as possible like that of the 
Community of Quakers. And this for two reasons: first, the sight 
of evil is for every sensitive soul the cause of suffering, the origin 
of all those strong and untoward passions such as horror, hate, 
and digust which engender or perpetuate madness: “It was 
thought, very justly, that the indiscriminate mixture, which must 
occur in large public establishments, of persons of opposite 
religious sentiments and practices; of the profligate and the 
virtuous; the profane and the serious; was calculated to check the 
progress of returning reason, and to fix, still deeper, the 
melancholy and misanthropic train of ideas ...”4 But the 
principal reason lies elsewhere: it is that religion can play the 
double role of nature and of rule, since it has assumed the depth 
of nature in ancestral habit, in education, in everyday exercise, 
and since it is at the same time a constant principle of coercion. 
It is both spontaneity and constraint, and to this degree it 
controls the only forces that can, in reason’s eclipse, 
counterbalance the measureless violence of madness; its precepts, 
“where these have been strongly imbued in early life ... become 
little less than principles of our nature; and their restraining 
power is frequently felt, even under the delirious excitement of 
insanity. To encourage the influence of religious principles over 
the mind of the insane is considered of great consequence, as a 
means of cure. ”5 In the dialectic of insanity where reason hides

without abolishing itself, religion constitutes the concrete form 
of what cannot go mad; it bears what is invincible in reason, it 
bears what subsists beneath madness as quasi-nature and around 
it as the constant solicitation of a milieu “where, during lucid 
intervals, or the state of convalescence, the patient might enjoy 
the society of those who were of similar habits and opinions.” 
Religion safeguards the old secret of reason in the presence of
