madness, thus making closer, more immediate, the constraint 
that was already rampant in classical confinement. There, the 
religious and moral milieu was imposed from without, in such a 
way that madness was controlled, not cured. At the Retreat, 
religion was part of the movement which indicated in spite of 
everything the presence of reason in madness, and which led 
from insanity to health. Religious segregation has a very precise 
meaning: it does not attempt to preserve the sufferers from the 
profane presence of non-Quakers, but to place the insane 
individual within a moral element where he will be in debate 
with himself and his surroundings: to constitute for him a milieu 
where, far from being protected, he will be kept in a perpetual 
anxiety, ceaselessly threatened by Law and Transgression. 

“The principle of fear, which is rarely decreased by insanity, is 
considered as of great importance in the management of the 

patients.” 3 Fear appears as an essential presence in the asylum. 
Already an ancient figure, no doubt, if we think of the terrors of 
confinement. But these terrors surrounded madness from the 
outside, marking the boundary of reason and unreason, and 
enjoying a double power: over the violence of fury in order to 
contain it, and over reason itself to hold it at a distance; such fear 
was entirely on the surface. The fear instituted at the Retreat is 
of great depth; it passes between reason and madness like a 
mediation, like an evocation of a common nature they still share, 
and by which it could link them together. The terror that once 
reigned was the most visible sign of the alienation of madness in

the classical period; fear was now endowed with a power of 
disalienation, which permitted it to restore a primitive complicity 
between the madman and the man of reason. It re-established a 
solidarity between them. Now madness would never—could 
never—cause fear again; it would be afraid , without recourse or 
return, thus entirely in the hands of the pedagogy of good sense, 
of truth, and of morality. 

Samuel Tuke tells how he received at the Retreat a maniac, 
young and prodigiously strong, whose seizures caused panic in 
those around him and even among his guards. When he entered 
the Retreat he was loaded with chains; he wore handcuffs; his 
clothes were attached by ropes. He had no sooner arrived than all 
his shackles were removed, and he was permitted to dine with 
the keepers; his agitation immediately ceased; “his attention 
appeared to be arrested by his new situation.” He was taken to 
his room; the keeper explained that the entire house was
